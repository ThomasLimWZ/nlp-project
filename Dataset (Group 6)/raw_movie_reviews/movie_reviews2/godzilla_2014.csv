I agreed back then but now after the sequels I realize that Gareth Edwards was trying to focus on the story and not just a CGI fest. I really enjoyed Bryan Cranston's character and wish I could have more of that too. While I left wanting more, sometimes that is better than having too much.","51 out of 57 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Godzilla 2014: Should You Watch It?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3016584/?ref_=tt_urv","matthew-rehlinger","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15450737/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2014","Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Godzilla here looks much more like the beloved behemoth than it did in the '98 movie, the music hearkens to the classic Japanese overtures of the old Gojira film era, and the camera work has the comically silly nature of Sam Rami's Spiderman series.Scenario 2: If you are really excited to see a deep, human film with camera angles and writing that really tell a story that is thematically transcendent such as ""District 9"" and the Korean film ""The Host,"" this is not your film. The script is filled with overtly simplistic rhetoric and one dimensional characters (intentionally,) the scenes somehow manage to have very little tension (even for me, the pilot episodes for most sitcoms seem more tense than Gozilla,) and as stated above, the camera-work is intentionally hammy. It should also be noted that to add a human element, the director overuses children to the point that it ends up feeling very obvious, as though he did it to be intentionally campy.Scenario 3: If you are one of those people who really just want a fun popcorn flick such as Pacific Rim, with some solidly choreographed action like in the over-the-top bulletfest Battle:LA, I would say proceed with caution. The fight scenes are less intense and more majestic, like any classic monster movie, and as such the human aspect of the combat is relatively insignificant, less so than any other monster movie I've ever seen. There are no little monsters for anyone to shoot at, if that's your thing.Scenario 4: If you are interested in this film because you love the talented work of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and/or Aaron Taylor- Johnson (three of my favorite actors) and are excited to see what they bring to the table, you should probably sit this one out. Bryan Cranston's role in this film garners far less screen time than advertised, Ken Watanabe spends literally every second walking through the scenes with the pained expression of someone who just walked in on their parents, and all three of the actors give off the vibe that they are very much aware of how cheesy their lines are. Everyone else's performance was similarly forgettable.Honestly, I'm a stickler for deep, human storytelling, but I've also had a softspot for the classic, silly fun of many Godzilla movies, including my favorite, Godzilla vs. Destroyah. All told, depending on which camp you fall under, this will be an entirely different movie for you. As Godzilla movies go, I'd give it a B. As darker, more serious monster movies go, I'd give it a D+.","620 out of 966 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Satisfying Summer Blockbuster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3220353/?ref_=tt_urv","Theo Robertson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1532177/?ref_=tt_urv","14 April 2015","I saw the trailers for this a year ago while I attended a screening for Aronofsky's NOAH . I didn't fancy it much . GODZILLA conjures up memories of the big budget blandfest from a decade and a half ago . Just put some CGI on screen and voilà you've a Summer blockbuster . This version did get a very good average rating when it opened , something in the region 8.1 but progressively got lower and it now has a rating of 6.6 indicating something average . To be fair I went in with an open mind and did find myself enjoying things more than I probably expected The original GODZILLA from 1954 was of a course a Japanese film that used the monster as a metaphor for the bomb . It did quickly abandon this subtext and just became a long running franchise where the titular monster got involved in all sorts of battles with other giant monsters . In its favour Gareth Edwards version of GODZILLA does keep the ethos of this . Radiation is very much to the fore of the story and while Godzilla might not be the hero he's certainly not the villain and this is reserved for ""Massive Unidentified Terreistial Organism"" a sort of hybrid between a giant praying mantis and a dragon . You know at one point they're going to be meeting in a climatic battle Of course two hours of giant CGI creatures getting in to a punch up isn't going to resonate with an audience so Edwards includes a very human backdrop as the story takes place through the eyes of serviceman Ford Brody . You got to love that name , it's sounds like a character John Wayne was born to play , a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do , get off your horse and drink your milk etc . It wasn't until I found out after seeing the film that I found out Brody is played by English actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson who I was totally convinced was one hundred per cent Uncle Sam . That said this isn't an actors type of film and I'm speculating that the casting of Cranston and Binoche might have led to the backlash by many people . If you want to see Binoche try not to be blink because you will literally miss her . It's also difficult not to notice that there's a strong streak of manipulation as to how the characters play out . It's also yet another film where a little kid is used in a scene to keep the audiences emotions on tenterhooksRegardless of this people watch a film like GODZILLA for action set pieces and you can't really fault Edwards for what he's done here . He doesn't have a idiosyncratic quirk to his directorial style and the film does have that kind of Summer blockbuster look but he also previously directed MONSTERS and that movie featured a couple of aliens mating and here the MUTOs have a similar though much more shorter sequence . If you need a film calling for alien reproduction I can see Gareth Edwards being a natural auteur","38 out of 57 found this helpful.

After all the hype it had had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was missing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't. Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story line. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed greatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special effects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for sure.

"7","/10","Form over function Once again.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3024216/?ref_=tt_urv","Dory_Darko","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14277539/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2014","OK, let me start off by saying that the new Godzilla is definitely an entertaining movie and well worth the price of an admission ticket. That is – so long as you go into it with popcorn-level expectations. Now, it has to be said that the bar, since the most recent attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998 (which was hilarious at best) wasn't set particularly high, to say it nicely. So in all honesty, with today's budget and special effects, it never had a big chance of being that bad. But I have to admit, judging from the trailer – I thought it would be better.It starts off pretty good. There is proper story build-up and character lay-out. Where we are – what's happening... It's all there. In fact, the story revolving around the main characters is pretty dramatic from the get-go. Death in the family, trauma leading to obsession over finding the truth surrounding the circumstances. Bryan Cranston is impressive as the family father and science guy. He just knows something is up concerning some big beastie and he won't let up until he figures it out. That is – if he gets the chance. Something happens around one third into the movie that is a pivotal turning point in the story. I knew this immediately when it happened and in the end I realised that I had been correct.From this point on, it's out with the story and in with the action. An almost mind-numbing, pummelling assault of non-stop action. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's a lot less interesting than it could have been.Here's the deal: instead of just one Big Monster, they bring in three. One Godzilla, and two huge insect-like creatures that are only designated as MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object). Seriously, they couldn't come up with a proper name? And instead of Godzilla being the big threat to mankind, the MUTO are. In fact, Godzilla turns out to be the good guy because he's the only one that can defeat these insect creeps. This story line is factor one in the reason that this movie isn't what it could have been. Factor two is the plot point that these creatures all feed on nuclear energy instead of ""manburgers"". Consequentially, the only real threat they pose is the massive destruction they cause in big cities (and obviously, the human lives that become casualties by default). It's because of this that there is never any real sense of threat or danger. They don't hunt us, they don't care about us. All they want is nuclear energy and a place to breed. What's worse is, these MUTO take screen time and attention away from the monster who's supposed to be the main antagonist and namesake of the movie! It might as well have been called ""Big Creepy Insects"" instead of ""Godzilla""... In the end, what we're left with is billions of dollars worth of collateral damage and a big-ass monster who's really kind of a nice guy. Weird.Still, it's certainly not bad. Aaron Taylor- Johnson does his best at looking very serious and all grown up since his Kick-Ass days, although I am certain that this is definitely one of his less compelling roles. The problem is that from the 1/3 turning point that I mentioned, his character becomes very formulaic and cliché. Our hero even shares an intimate moment of eye contact with Godzilla in the end... Aww.Ken Watanabe spends every moment of his screen time looking shocked and awed... and pretty much nothing else. Juliette Binoche is shamefully underused. I would have loved to have seen more of her. The biggest asset is definitely Bryan Cranston. He's the only one who managed to make his character 3-dimensional and a real human being. He, too, would have definitely deserved a bigger role. In fact, the film probably would have been much better for it.Visually, everything is very awesome and impressive. The special effects (visual and sound) are top-notch. Every time Godzilla opened his mouth to let out a massive roar, I thought my eardrums were going to pop. It's bone-chilling and very cool. The design of the MUTO is a real treat, they look like giant praying mantises, totally intimidating. The films' SFX really make it worthwhile. All in all, the story is quite weak and riddled with clichés, though I must say one thing: thank God for the complete lack of obligatory footprints. I was seriously dreading the moment these giant ""claw prints in the mud"" would appear on screen, but thankfully it never happened. The overall feel and setting of this film is quite dark and threatening, and adding such a cliché would have been really dumb and unnecessary. I had really hoped that this was going to be the definitive Godzilla movie. Alas, it is not. But I still enjoyed it for what it was and I definitely recommend seeing it for the special effects alone. In any case, 'Gojira' looks awesome.I rate it 7.5/10.","30 out of 46 found this helpful.

I had hope, and, for the most part, my only criterion was that it be better than Pacific Rim, Hollywood's attempt at the kaiju genre last year. I liked that one, but was disappointed (with Guillermo del Toro, I expected something with a little more meat). Godzilla does not clear that hurdle. It has the same major problem that all these kinds of films do: the human element is lacking. Severely here. And what a fantastic cast to waste! Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe! Every single one of them utterly wasted. Hopefully they all got a big check. We have all these people, but instead we're saddled with charisma black hole Aaron Taylor-Johnson (of Kick-Ass fame), who isn't even adequate. Thankfully, the big monster fights deliver, for the most part. There could maybe be more monster action, but when it's there, it's a lot of fun. I also thank the filmmakers for restraining themselves and keeping the film at only two hours (it runs a tad over that if you stay through the credits).","38 out of 66 found this helpful.

Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that ancient creatures exist that lives in radiation. As the radiation faded from the earth's surface, these creatures retreated to the lower depths. In 1999, miners uncover a vast cavern with a giant skeleton in the Philippines. They also find one of the spores broken open. In Japan at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife in a freak incident. Fifteen years later, Joe is still investigating the incident with the city around the plant quarantined. He is arrested once again for trying to breach the quarantine. His son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has to leave behind his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) in San Francisco to go pick him up from jail in Japan. Joe convinces Ford who is now a US Navy ordnance disposal officer to join him to go to the plant. They discover that there is no radiation leak. Instead the spore from the Philippines named MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) has settled in the plant sucking up all the radiation.This is always going to be a great monster movie. The CGI is terrific and Godzilla has a great time smashing things up. That part seems like a no-brainer. I still give director Gareth Edwards credit for doing a great job. He doesn't disappoint. The problem is once again the human story. The beginning is just too long before it gets to a monster. The Joe Brody story doesn't have the bite. In another movie, his story would be a fun mystery. The problem is that the audience knows it's a monster even if it's not Godzilla. So there is no tension from the mystery since it's not really a mystery. The other problem is that Ford just happens to be at the right place in all of those situations. It's a situation that a lesser movie would rely on. I hoped for better. The final problem I have is that the movie cuts away from the monster action time and time again. It's funny the first time but it gets annoying quickly. Despite all the problems, there is still a fun monster movie and lots of stuff get smashed.","18 out of 29 found this helpful.

"","","Although effects and sound are technically impressive, it is quite unsatisfying and superficial","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3098798/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","5 October 2014","I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.The film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others – all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on – a device that has impact for sure, but doesn't seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.On this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience – so it does it, lots. Considering I didn't care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed – it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness – something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.Unfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value.","104 out of 166 found this helpful.

I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old ""Godzilla vs....."" movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10","159 out of 252 found this helpful.

Therefore, the most surprising thing about Godzilla is not how empty the story is, but rather how little there is of the monster in the movie after which it is named.The plot in ""Godzilla"" is disposable. It only exists as an excuse to unleash the film's titular character. However, is it too much to ask for an original plot with characters we could care about? Here, the back story is cliché-ridden and the characters simply serve the function of moving the story forwards. As such, one would expect that Godzilla is at least given ample screen time. Surprisingly, this is not the case, and the majority of the film's focus seems to be on the military attempting to find out how to kill Godzilla and the MUTOs, which look like giant, angry cockroaches. Ultimately, it is left up to the score and the Michael Bay-esque dub-step reminiscent sound design to create tension.Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are so one-dimensional that nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspired script. More worrying, however, is how unnecessary Sally Hawkins' character is and how the script manages to make Ken Watanabe look like a second-rate actor, as his character rarely changes expression from the looks of intense thought or surprise. Overall, ""Godzilla"" did not work for me at all. Not only is it a film without heart, but it a film meant to thrill that ends up just being tedious. I could have left halfway through the movie.

"","","An Enjoyable Action Romp That Restores The Franchise's Original Glory","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3018707/?ref_=tt_urv","CalRhys","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24740649/?ref_=tt_urv","18 May 2014","In 1998, Roland Emmerich attempted to reignite the eponymous film franchise by creating the critically-panned flop 'Godzilla', 16 years on and we are now faced with one of the best adaptations of the iconic monster's adventures. Gareth Edwards created 'Monsters' in 2010 on a mere budget of £500,000, barely 4 years on and Warner Brothers offered him the chance to create a $160 million adaptation of 'Godzilla'. All the aspects from 'Monsters' are employed in this action/sci-fi adventure, but on a much grander scale. This is a treat for all Godzilla fans and a very respectable adaptation that stays true to the 1950s Japanese classic rather than wandering away like Emmerich's one did. Packed with stunning cinematography, vast special effects and a sweeping spectacle of giant monster battles, 'Godzilla' has been a fantastic start to 2014. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performances are outstanding and there is a certain chemistry that makes their relationship that bit more believable. Whilst at time there are some cheesy and over-the-top scenes, 'Godzilla' is nonetheless an enjoyable action romp that restores the franchise's original glory.","179 out of 341 found this helpful.

The storyline follows a nuclear plant in Japan 🇯🇵 that is mysteriously destroyed. A husband and son lost their mother/wife in the incident and try to uncover what happened and why. In doing so they get front row seats to the awakening of several monsters, some that want to destroy the world and some that want to save it...This movie is directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters) and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass), Elizabeth Olsen (WandaVision), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), David Strathairn (The Firm) and Richard T. Jones (Event Horizon).This is one of those Godzilla movies I didn't hate, but could have been so much better. The monsters are fairly well done and the monster battles are great. But the first monster battle doesn't happen until there's 20 minutes left in the movie...and this movie is two hours and three minutes long. The cast was great but I'm not sure I loved them in this movie. The story was just okay; and while I liked the monsters, I felt like they could have gone with a more tradition Rodan as the first villain. Overall, this is worth a watch, but a missed opportunity to be so much better and everything we needed from a Godzilla picture. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Granted it's not as good as the original 1954 version, Mothra vs Godzilla, the Heisei era flicks, or GMK but it's still good. The effects were amazing with everything conveying a strong sense of scale as all the monsters move slowly like larger than life forces. Also they made Godzilla a nigh- indestructible force of nature with his signature durability and atomic breath. Surprisingly the kaiju have lots of personality expressing moments of joy, love, despair, weariness, and wrath. In fact, I'm willing to look past the dull look of the MUTOs because they act like real animals and show so much emotion.Yet as much as I enjoy the movie, there is the main downside everyone brings up: Godzilla doesn't show up enough. Granted there are lots of creature features that focus more on the humans like Jurassic Park, Aliens, Predator, and Jaws. However, those movies at least had characters that while neither the deepest or most complex, were at least likable and recognizable. Here the main human characters are generic and lifeless. Aaron Taylor Johnson's performance as Ford is boring and lacks the stoic intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood. They could've made Ford have an angry grudge against Godzilla and the MUTOs that would clash with Sherizawa's respect for Godzilla. Ditto Elizabeth Olsen's Elle,she never seemed to show emotionally heartache or depressed concern for her patients or her family. Their bland characters would've had been so annoying had they not overshadowed Bryan Cranston's Joe and Ken Watanabe's Sherizawa.If the creators are going to make another Godzilla flick, then they should either increase Godzilla's screen time or at the very least bring in better actors and create more memorable characters. That said,it's still a fun movie on its own merits and I'm looking forward to the sequel","18 out of 35 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, I was then 6 years old and it was one of the very few Hollywood movies that released at my place. After 10 years, when I had a second watch of 1998 Godzilla, I understood why it was panned so deeply. Still, that movie made me research through the Godzilla mythology and I was pretty much impressed. That's why I visited the movies for this 2014 take on the Alpha Primate. I must say, as a movie fan I'm not quite satisfied with it, but as a classic Godzilla fan, it was more than merry. The technical side is the most note-worthy on this take, since the creature design was so much rooted with the 1950 classic. The scenes which depicts the menace of Godzilla was nearly breath-taking, and the roar was something special. The design of MUTOs were also appreciable, and the CGI works and 3-D effects are also passable. At least, the 3-D didn't made me scratch my head.Considering the story side, it was a weak script, though pretty strong for a disaster movie. It wasn't a throughout smack-smash, or a 2-hour collision of the giants, but had a good human point-of-view over the subject, which takes me to the weak point of the movie.The acting section wasn't that bright. It had a good platform for the actors even though the concentration was on the monster. Bryan Cranston proved it with his charismatic performance. He didn't had a major part on the screen, but was a core element on the script and with the high-voltage sentiments and rage he portrayed the lone crusader for truth brilliantly. Sad thing was, nobody, including Aron-Taylor Johnson and Ken Watanabe, was that much competing. It made me to long for the creature sequences more. But considering the script and the director's intentions, the final product is an adequate one to pass both fans and casual users.As a final note, Godzilla is a classic incarnation of Gojira movies with appropriate human emotions. If you are a classic Gojira fan, never miss it. If you are a movie-goer who likes movies with a strong mythology, go give it a try.........","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was so intrigued by the first half hour as we were brought into the events in a secret facility in Japan. One of the directors watches his wife die after a nuclear breech. Now we cut into the future. The director is still out there. He has become a crusader against the secrecy of this type of research. His son, who lost his other in the earlier incident, has become military and is really annoyed with his father's campaign. Now we throw all that aside. Dad has evidence, but has been arrested for treasonous acts. They see him as more of a nuisance than anything, but they have their own fish to fry. He manages to get back to the house where they lived (which is in rubble) and recover some old floppy disks. During this time, some sort of huge flat headed flying creature with spider legs has come to life. It is causing incredible destruction. Godzilla, who apparently is no secret, is moving around in the ocean. He is on a collision course with these other things. While the special effects are good, there is something really lacking in the story line, in the fights themselves, in the whole attitude toward these monster, and just a sort of malaise. I came to the theater excited because at midnight in 1957, I stayed up past my bedtime to her Raymond Burr in the Americanized version of ""Godzilla"" talk about the destruction of Tokyo. I have since watched so many of these movies, including the forgettable Matthew Broderick one, and I had hoped for some kind of earth shattering, apocalyptic presentation. For me, it was just an ordinary monster movie with little new to offer.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread out to accommodate the monsters.The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado here.Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend solid support.Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear enough for relaying the plot through dialog.Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster monster movie that deserves a big screen watch.","100 out of 163 found this helpful.

It did what it was suppose to do BUT, I do have some issues with it starting with Bryan Cranston's lack of screen time. The trailers would have made you believe Bryan Cranston plays a very big role in the movie but, he doesn't. He had the least screen time out of all the other actors.Also, for a movie called ""Godzilla"", you really don't see Godzilla a whole lot. I take it back, Bryan Cranston had more screen time than Godzilla. Nonetheless, Godzilla (2014) was AMAZINGLY better than the 1998 adaptation. And I have to give credit, where credit is due, Gareth Edwards managed to bring back an iconic feature from the old Godzilla films, something the '98 disaster failed horribly to do. Overall, good entertaining movie. I didn't really feel worried for the characters in the film, for they didn't really leave an impact on the movie.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

Let's just say there's an accident at a nuclear reactor, which no one pays too much attention to until MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) wakes up and heads to the West Coast of America but also on the way is Godzilla.It's clear that Godzilla movies are always going to be made and some are going to be better than others. I think the nicest thing I can say about this version is that it's slightly better than the remakes from 1984 and 1998 version. However, there are still a lot of problems with this version including the fact that it has to be one of the most boring action films in recent years. I really can't count how many times I kept looking at my clock to see how much longer this thing was going to go on. There's a family drama thrown in to try and balance everything out but this too is incredibly boring and goes nowhere.I guess the worst thing about this film is also the best thing. The special effects are quite frankly excellent and once you doze off to the actual story, it's easy to just admire the work. For the most part the CGI effects really look good and especially the monsters as they come across very realistic and all of it blends in well with the real stuff. The various explosions also look very realistic but with this budget you'd expect that. Now, even though the special effects are great and the highlight of the picture, they're also a major problem. I really, really hated the look of the villain MUTO because it's supposed to be a prehistoric monster but instead it comes off more like a robot. For the life of me I couldn't help but think we were watching some sort of robots do battle and this here was just extremely disappointing. Even Godzilla comes across more like a robot than a prehistoric dinosaur. A real shame that as great as these monsters looked they couldn't have been more realistic.There's a lot of family drama thrown in but all of it is just as boring as the action. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the lead and isn't given much to do, acting wise, and after a while it just becomes laughable that he happens to be at various parts of the globe just as ""important"" things happen. Even the usually wonderful Elizabeth Olsen can't bring any life into the picture. Juliette Binoche has a good cameo but even Ken Watanabe is wasted in his part. The bad story is a real shame on two levels. One, it takes up way too much of the running time and it's simply boring. Two, had they not gone for this boring melodrama then perhaps we would have gotten more of the monsters.But, then again, that might not have been a good thing since the monsters are filmed through dark skies, fog and various bits of smoke. It's hard to ever get a great look at them. GODZILLA certainly has a group of fans out there but for me it was a complete dud.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

His adaption is intense, well written, and most of all beautiful. Godzilla has never looked better. In fact, no movie creature has ever looked this good, (I saw it in IMAX, which I highly recommend). Godzilla and the other creatures are truly terrifying. The movie is less from the overall perspective of the monsters, but instead a perspective of the people. This idea initially got me worried, being the huge fan I am, but I could not have been more satisfied. Edwards did a great job of integrating classic aspects of the old movies to life all these years later. The action scenes were stunning and heart pounding. And to add to it all, the characters had real motives which brought a whole new realness to the Godzilla story. They integrated him into real history which was very clever, and made the whole situation quite believable. If you're a die-hard fan or just a movie lover, this will not disappoint.

That said...My first thought on leaving the theater last night was: Good, not great. Visually, the movie does what it does exceptionally well. There are a lot of very coolly handled transitions which use drastic perspective changes to change scenes and simultaneously handle the larger scope of Godzilla and the smaller scope of the individual characters. I'm still a firm believer, though, that 3d...even IMAX 3d, is the death of cinematography. 3d forces the viewer's perspective to an intended focal point in either the foreground or background, and as a result, everything else loses definition. I can't imagine directors or principal photography groups actually liking this technology and I'm continually surprised at how well received it is.Sound was well done from an effects perspective. There was absolutely nothing in the way of a score which was disappointing. The only thing that stood out to me thematically from a musical perspective was a drum heavy theme which they overused each time Japan was shown. I'm not certain that there wasn't other music present, but if there was, it was completely forgettable. In terms of plot, it was a Godzilla movie, so I don't think anyone is going into this expecting an Oscar-worthy screenplay, BUT the trailers set an expectation for me that the movie couldn't match. The acting was nothing special and a little over-the-top in some places. Cranston lent some credibility, but the novelty of his appearance wears off pretty quickly. Unfortunately, this film wasted Ken Wantanabe; I'm a fan of his limited work which I've seen, but he had nothing to work with in this script, and to call his performance wooden is a disservice to trees. AT Johnson is much the same, regrettably. I didn't feel that there was much to connect him to the audience, and instead, he becomes more of a vehicle through which to view the movie's world around him.Now, considering it is a Godzilla movie, the important part. Is the monster battle epic, and does it hold up? The answer is, like everything with this movie, a little of both yes and no. Personally, I really liked how they handled it. I felt the build-up and pacing made for a weighty climax with decent enough stakes to keep the audience invested. The director toys with you a bit though and teases a lot of the action from the perspective of the characters on the ground. The timing of these cuts serve as morsel after morsel of payoff, but after the third or fourth of these cuts, I started to wonder if the grand scale would ever come. Fortunately, in the end, it did come with 3 or 4 separate scenes giving the epically scaled battle the foreground and a couple welcome surprises that were contrary to some of the pre-release info which was making the rounds. Is it worth seeing? If you're a fan of the genre, yes. It has some of the campiness and charm of the series while still playing straight within its own construct. To me, this is miles ahead of the travesty that was Godzilla '98, but it lacked some of the cinematic flair and novelty that Cloverfield brought to the genre back in 08. It was way more digestible than Pacific Rim as well which should bode well for better overall audience reception. I'd go with a strong 7.5 out of 10 with a +/- of about .5 expected after a second viewing.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

Would they get it right? Would it be good? The result is a film that has the ingredients to be great although falls short in execution. The film's greatest success is in Godzilla's character, choosing to characterize him as a natural and eternal force of nature. While I'll always prefer Godzilla as a menace, for a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that meant to able to general audiences it works.Of course the human characters have been a point of debate for years. The ideas behind them are interesting although the actual execution is severely flawed. The first act does a great job in building up character and developing suspense only for the momentum to be lost with the removal of a certain character. It really handicaps the middle act although the climax is admittedly exciting and well done. Had the film not teased the action so much this probably would have been more forgivable although I do appreciate the restraint Edwards showed. The overall film is well made and has a grand sense of scale that makes one feel like you are truly caught in the midst's of the grand natural struggle. The film definitely has it's moments and I do appreciate this film for what it did as both a proper adaptation and as a good gateway entry for new fans.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

But I walked out of the theatre thinking I watched something other than a film about Godzilla. Don't get me wrong, Godzilla himself looked great, one of the best examples of CGI this year to be honest (except for the weird reptilian smile he had going on), but I wish there was more of him. If I could I would rename the movie to 'Giant Slimy Moths' because they seemingly got more screen time than Godzilla itself. Other than that timing issue (and Godzilla looking a little on the chubby side) the visuals where seamless and a joy to watch. Immediately after the casting was released everyone was pumped for 'Breaking Bad' star Brian Cranston to play the role of a nuclear engineer living in Japan, and the hype was defiantly lived up to. Cranston truly can act and that really is shown in the beginning of this film, which is where he shines most. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character of some kind of super soldier really showed his talent towards the end but I'm sorry to say, didn't really excite me too much anywhere else (I still can't see him as anything else other than comic book nerd turned super-nerd). And lastly Elizabeth Olsen probably impressed me the most with her convincing portrayal of an emotionally lost, but strong and independent woman.Even if you don't enjoy action, go for the music because the soundtrack resurrected goosebumps all around my body and, not to be clique, sent shivers down my spine.As far as reboots go this film is up there in the stars, or maybe just above sea level, you'll have to watch it yourself to determine that. But it's an enjoyable movie with a fun sci-fi twist (kind of). 7.9 stars out of 10This review was originally from my blog: www.Adam-Trzcinski.blogger.com","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

' Two monsters in this film, both the natural forces of nature, are finally in combat. The direction of this premise is filmed mainly in a dreadful darkness, and the effect is one of metaphysical horror. One possible spoiler I must partly reveal is the fate of the woman acted beautifully by the actor Juliette Binoche. Quentin Tarantino apparently cried watching it; I was appalled at it. How life has little meaning, if anything, when confronted by the darkest side of nature itself. I do not want to give more away but to say that it is one of the most horrific films I have seen, and somewhere in the primal terror of it is Ligeti's ' Requiem ' an apt piece of the limit of music to be used. I commend the director for making these musical forces, and anyone who wants just sensationalist rubbish to avoid this film.

Director Gareth Edward's 2014 Godzilla film is the second time that an American studio has taken the reigns in an attempt to bring Japan's most famous kaiju to the big screen. Its predecessor in 1998 met mixed to negative reviews, but this update pays homage to the original 1954 Japanese film while at the same time modernizing the tale for a new audience.The film follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a lieutenant in the United States Navy who specializes in disposing of explosive ordinances. Ford's parents, Joe (Bryan Cranston) and Sandra (Juliette Binoche) work in a Japanese nuclear plant when a terrible accident occurred in 1999. Fifteen years later, Joe is a conspiracy theorist on the search for truth when he is arrested for trespassing on the remains of his old house, now a quarantine zone. Joe believes that it was not a natural disaster that took his wife, but some kind of creature that the government is trying to cover up. Now, believing that history is repeating itself, he embarks on a search for his old data, dragging his son along with him.While the plot of Godzilla is told from the perspective of Lt. Brody, everyone knows who the real star of the film is and the director took great care in portraying the monster in a positive light. The real threat to humanity in the film are two giant, insect-like monsters, called M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) who are attempting to meet and reproduce. The beast known as Godzilla is described by resident monster expert, Dr. Serazawa (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samuri) as a prehistoric animal who is ""nature's power to restore balance."" The director spends a great deal of time in the first act of the movie teasing the audience with the scaly hero, and it was a smart decision to build the tension and anticipation before revealing the beloved monster in a roaring crescendo of excitement.The human story in Godzilla is necessary and while not the most gripping, it remains entertaining enough that it doesn't seem to hurt the action. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) is the film's protagonist and the audience watches the story unfold from his perspective. Viewers will be able to get behind the Navy Lieutenant desperately trying to get back to his family and protect them, and also playing his part to save the world. Taylor-Johnson's performance, however, was rather thin and could have benefited from more emoting as opposed to the serious, blank stare he wears for the majority of the film. Conversely, Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) really steals the show as Taylor-Johnson's eccentric father digging for the truth. He shows so much emotion in his time in the film, that it's a shame that his screen time is cut rather short. Ken Watanabe is great in his role and conveys a sense of respect for the titular monster. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife Elle, spends almost the entire film worrying about the safety of her husband and son, but not much else.Edwards' decision to portray the monsters as animals fighting for their own survival helped keep an otherwise fantastical film somewhat grounded in reality. In addition to the breathtaking visuals, the score by Alexandre Desplat is beautiful, perfectly pulling emotion from the audience. Technically speaking, Godzilla as a film is a marvel to look at, hear, and experience.-Oliver Pascual www.mediumraretv.org","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

In a more pragmatic depiction, scientific experiments gone awry lead to menacing monsters being unleashed. These beasts are pitted against Godzilla, leaving the fate of humans in the balance.The latest Japanese gem to be reworked following success stories like The Ring and The Grudge, Godzilla represents a chance to resurrect the leviathan. The opportunity lies in the capable hands of Gareth Edwards. First and foremost, in his primary foray into blockbuster territory, Edwards excels in doing justice to the titular character.Godzilla is a force of nature, the biggest ever seen on screen, dwarfing many skyscrapers and laying waste to his surroundings. The belligerent behemoth's appearance and movement are a sight to behold. Furthermore, his iconic roar and colossal scales, exhibited by employing extensive CGI, complete his sinister look.The director clearly prefers building anticipation rather than front loaded action. His attempt at creating anticipation and a sense of awe is akin to classics such as Jaws and Jurassic Park, where the creature lurks ominously but still makes its presence felt. However, the director does entice the viewer with fleeting glimpses and references throughout.Also at his disposal is a coterie of enormous talent, such as veterans Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe and also emerging actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. The human characters are used as the focal point of the action. The makers place great value in establishing a sentimental element in the midst of all the decimation. Bryan Cranston is particularly effective as the doom monger and delivers the most compelling human interaction sequences.Undoubtedly, the highlight of the movie is that Godzilla is on a collision course with other monsters. The resulting encounters are worthy of the price of admission alone. Also, the spectacle renders itself well in IMAX screens.The story also pays homage to Godzilla's roots and legacy as a metaphor for nuclear proliferation. The writer's success lies in creating an aura of plausibility. As opposed to a ludicrous narrative, there is legitimate realism in the story.The production value of the film also shines through: the cinematography, sound design and score are all executed well to provide a haunting effect. However, flaws do persist in the movie. For instance, the acting is found wanting in particular instances in the absence of the action.Nonetheless, such failings are few and far between. All in all, Godzilla is a fitting tribute to the King of Monsters.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

The theater had an 80% male population and 20% female population. So much for the demographics. I guess guys like monsters. Now onto the movie.Having lived through the big screen release of Jurassic Park and T-Rex, who scared the living daylights out of me, I was really looking forward to another OMG moment of closing my eyes out of terror. Unfortunately, I think I only had one ""holy crap"" pop out of my mouth during the entire movie. Perhaps I'm too old to frighten with make-believe monsters. The movie itself wasn't what I expected. The trailers are pretty spot on setting up the basis for the story. Whatever is down there, it's going to throw us into the stone age again, or so we are led to believe. As it progresses, other monsters emerge who received more screen time than Godzilla. After a while, I felt a bit cheated because I didn't come to see two other creatures get it on and lay eggs. I mean, they're not even that good looking. Sort of leggy, if you ask me, leaping buildings in a single bound. Of course, there's not much left after they leap from rooftop to rooftop.There were a few odd bits in the storyline, one being the captain of the naval ship who seemed to be calling all the shots and making the big decisions to save the United States. Only once did he get on that important red phone to confer with the President on nuking those nasty building stomping, lay egging monsters. Of course, he didn't listen to the guys who knew what they were talking about, telling him the chosen course of action was a bad one. No surprise there.As far as gore and blood, you won't see much. I don't think the movie carries the scare factor enough to leave nightmares behind. Of course, the special effects are a far cry from the 1954 version that I grew up with on television. Godzilla looks like the original big body, small headed monster we've always known. Only, you don't cringe when he shows up. In fact, the audience was cheering the big lizard onto victory. Instead of the terror, he is hailed as the ""savior"" of San Francisco. Hum, I think the religious right may balk over that thought.In any event, it's mildly entertaining. Godzilla sort of sounds like T-Rex, but without the bite. I did not see it in 3D - those progressive lenses I have just ruin the experience for me. The big screen without the 3D was just as much in your face with monsters, falling buildings, and roaring creatures.All in all, it's an okay remake with the cool new technology we have for film making. No complaints with the actors, they all did a fine job of saving the world and showing that they were at least scared to death over the nuclear eating monsters. San Francisco is a pile of rubble, and Las Vegas will never be the same. Such a shame all those casinos were flattened. Oh, well.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

I had my problems with ""King of the Monsters"" which followed and think that the continual teasing of seeing both Godzilla himself, and the fighting, is a much more interesting way to go.A Japanese Nuclear plant disaster, which claimed the life of his mother, is investigated by Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his father (Bryan Cranston), who believes the accident is a cover up. They discover that the site of the accident, is now home to a gigantic cocoon, feeding of the nuclear fallout, and about to birth a gigantic insect like creature. Monarch, established in the 1950's has been secretly studying the history of giant creatures, since discovering a giant lizard creature named Godzilla. Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that Godzilla will try to kill the creature, to maintain his dominance on the planet, but struggles to convince the army of his idea.One thing that this series has never struggled for, regardless of who is directing, is beautiful visuals. This set the trend with some wonderful cinematography. It's a wise move to keep the creatures themselves out of the limelight, particularly when they're fighting as, particularly in the sequel, it does look like two skyscrapers banging into each other. It's a ballsy move from a confident filmmaker.Performances are pretty good. Taylor-Johnson plays the oddly hapless Brody, who stumbles from one disastrous encounter to the next but provides an interesting way of bringing us into the narrative. The films other great controversy, at the time, was the relatively early departure of Bryan Cranston from the story, having been part of the advertising. He's good but it would have seemed even more convoluted to have him keep stumbling into the creatures' way, when it's (just about) justifiable for Brody to do so.I'll have to rewatch the rest of the films in the series (and I am planning to) but from what I recall this is the highpoint of the franchise.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Have seen it in 3D I only can say that I liked the 3D even if it wasn't that stunning like in The Hobbit franchise but it do works sometimes rather good. On part of the story itself it was okay but hey, shouldn't it be going all about Godzilla? Mostly you don't watch these monster flicks for the acting but you rather watch it for the monsters itself and there lays the problem. The main actor Godzilla itself isn't that much to catch in this flick, that's a bit sad because I was left with a hunger after one hour with the only question, when will he come? Once Godzilla is there the action really starts and the CGI and effects used are indeed okay but by then it's a bit too late. Don't misunderstand me, it's not a bad flick but face it, we are overwhelmed with monster flicks the last years (Pacific Rim (2013) for example) who are full of action between the monsters itself and that's what Godzilla is in fact all about, Godzilla do saves the world after all.It starts rather good with excellent performance by Brian Cranston we all know of Breaking Bad and I was hooked on the screen. But once we move further 15 years it just starts to become a mediocre flick. I wasn't alone watching it and all I can here was where's Godzilla? Still worth picking up if you do like flicks about giant monsters and naturally Godzilla lovers will have it in their collection but at the end of the day, it wont stick in your mind.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Godzilla is back and better than ever with a cool looking design and of course atomic breath! This is my favorite movie of 2014 and we're glad to see the return of the king of the monsters on the big screen. The MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) are a threat and that's not a bad thing cause they look great. They sure know how to give Godzilla a challenge in the final fight. Some people don't like the movie mainly cause of the screen time of Godzilla. But does that stop me from liking the film? No, of course it won't. If you're a huge Godzilla fan like i am, definitely go see it. You will not be disappointed when you see it.","24 out of 37 found this helpful.

Luckily this new American Godzilla production keeps the spirit of the original which is something that is a welcomed taste cleanser after the 1998 U.S film that left so many fans with disdain. This new film has a solid cast with Bryan Cranston carrying most of the emotional weight of the film. The design of Godzilla is great and keeps true to the Toho one but has been updated to make Godzilla structurally sound as a giant creature that could support itself. The monster fight scenes brought out the kid in me and did a good job of showing off the monster's scale in size, although these scenes are often cut short or viewed through a small television in the background. Though the majority of the characters are not too interesting and people may have a problem with the film's pacing I'd still say that this is an enjoyable film and appreciate the director and writers efforts to understand what the essence of Godzilla is about.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I watched Monsters and I thought it was kind of clever by establishing the creatures as background characters, that made them more mysterious in nature, but I don't think it works the same in a movie like this, because Godzilla has been an established character for nearly 60 years. Gareth Edwards had gone on to mention in several interviews that much of the direction of the movie had been influenced by Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975), building up Godzilla before his actual appearance and only showing glimpses of the creature before the final showdown. I felt the way it was handled only ended up hindering the overall experience. A lot of the screen time focused more on the human's like Monsters, but unlike Monsters, the characters were just not as interesting to follow. I felt as if the movie intentionally had starved us into being more appreciative of when Godzilla had appeared, to give us the impression that it was more exciting than it should be. Jaws had done the same, but there was an intensity behind it, not knowing where it was or when it would strike next. It's not a must-see, but it's something to watch if you have nothing better to do, just don't go expecting something deep like the trailers and a few people on this board seem to suggest. It is what it is.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

You sum up all of this and you can understand I was very pumped for this movie, yet the result in relation to my expectations was just ""meh"". Don't get me wrong I liked it very much, but I can't deny it being a kind of disappointment. Talking about positives there are many things that could be pointed to: no one in their right mind would dare say this movie looks bad. Everything here is visually stunning, even the small-scale scenes are wonderful to witness and Godzilla and his fellow monsters felt very real, detailed and most certainly looked beautiful. Seamus McGarvey is a really special cinematographer. The cgi department here did a truly breathtaking job, even if there were a couple of shots that made me go ""huh that one was cg"", it is rare for a movie to have the quality special effects you find here. The film also feels very organized and grounded, so from a visual point of view there is lots of continuity. Credit to all of the actors too for making their roles perfectly believable, Bryan Cranston is definitely the highlight here the fact that he isn't in it enough actually detracted a lot of emotion. All in all there's just no way for someone to not have fun or be thrilled here: the money is spectacularly spent in amazing action scenes, add Godzilla and other monsters there and you'll only be excited by it. Quick shout-out to Alexander Desplat and his genius, with this he demonstrates himself as a very versatile composer and pays off with a riveting score. Where this movie fails is in drama and story continuity: on the first point there are small sparkles of interesting character moments, but on the wide scope there isn't enough for getting me attached to the people involved and this is probably due to some wasted time in the first act introducing the characters in very clichéd way (the time feels wasted also because the movie is 10-15 minutes too long) and to the continuous repetition of coincidences and situations that at some point I just gave up on. Talking about repetitions a minor problem I had with the movie, but kind of got on my nerves the more I saw it, was that the action scenes feel always the same in their introduction, they are all opened in the same style and other that being it a kind of clichéd style it was used for two hours and it really bothered me: the action scenes themselves are awesome, but it's the way in which they are introduced that I had a problem with. To the major fault of the movie: the story just did not flow spontaneously enough. There were way too many time where I asked myself: ""but what about that?"" ""oh yea? and where's that been the whole time"" and I went ""Really?"" so dam frequently. An example is when Godzilla (minor spoiler) breathes ""fire"", it was so out of nothing I simply didn't believe in it. Sure it is a iconic characteristic about the monster, but use it wisely or don't use it at all: it felt like a wink to the viewer that ended up being only annoying. Plus, I never fully understood the dynamics of the monsters, it always felt like the logic in it was about to fall a part. The character of Godzilla itself didn't really make much sense. He didn't bother with humans even if they tried to kill him, twice, but then he just leaves them. Very confusing. I don't declare myself a Godzilla fan at all, so I don't know if there's anything behind there, but it could have been easily addressed. Generally the problems I have with the movie are nit-pick, but when it becomes repetitive to a point of stress you loose me, nevertheless the direction was strong and the film was great fun.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

He's barely in the movie. There is another ""actor,"" who plays the lead when the guy you thought was the lead suddenly stops being in the movie. There are some monsters in the movie but they aren't the ones you expect, especially when you paid to see a movie called, GODZILLA. Even when the main attraction finally shows up, he's mostly confined to reflections in windows and on
TV monitors. If you enjoyed the movie, THE VILLAGE, after seeing the trailer for it, you will love this version of GODZILLA. If you really just pretty much hate Godzilla movies, then this is the movie you've been waiting for, because you won't have to worry about seeing him
much. The director cuts away to
something far less interesting anytime you think you're about to see him. If you could give the same crew and budget to director, Ed Wood, of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE fame, I bet even he probably could have made something more entertaining than this endurance test, that costs the price of a movie ticket. I still don't see how they messed this movie up so bad, but the problem started when they promised the audience things they didn't deliver...such as a giant radioactive lizard monster.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

Yes, it was better than Pacific Rim. Godzilla was definitely a must see movie this year. If you think its going to be like Godzilla (1998) then you our wrong, that movie was bad. This movie is just so awesome! Like in my other reviews I'm going to divide it up because I feel likedividing it up.Comparison from 1998 and the Original - Gozilla 1954 was one of the most famous classic movies of all time. And its a good movie especially for people who watched it in the 50s. Godzilla 1998 was bad and it basically ripped of every Jurassic Park Scene. Plus they made Godzilla look like a skinny, small dinosaur. This Godzilla is no doubt the best of them all. And if your like,""But the Classic ones are always the best,"" well then your wrong. Because you have to admit you didn't fall asleep as much as you did in Gozilla's 1954. So I have to say this is the best Godzilla film I have ever seen.Characters - First character I am going to talk about is of course Godzilla. How they made Godzilla was exactly what I wanted him to look like. He looks pretty accurate to the classic Godzilla which is good not like 1998 where he looked like a horrible CGI dinosaur. They pot rayed Godzilla so well in this movie, its almost like you can really see him stopping around your city. So i am very satisfied with how they made Godzilla. Mothra was actually in this movie. Mothra is actually a old classic character to and it was really cool how they put her in it. Yes its a she because the creature was pregnant at the time of the movie. That character was portrayed very well too, kind of reminded me of Pacific Rim aliens for some reason. Bryan Cranston did a very good job making the audience have feelings for him, he seemed to be very into his character. The problem was that he wasn't in the movie a whole lot instead Aaron Taylor- Johnson was in it most of the movie. He didn't seem to catch the audiences attention as much as Bryan did but he did a pretty good job at being in the movie because he had to. Also Ken Watanabe, who was the scientist, wasn't that much of a main character, but he did a good job playing the scientist because he seemed to be so into Godzilla and knowing about him.Story - The story was a bit long in the beginning but overtime it makes you grow excitement and eagerness to see Godzilla beat the living lives out of city buildings and gigantic monsters and this eagerness makes you love Godzilla a lot once he finally appears on screen. Then overtime the story gets pretty good and the scenes get you pumped up and excited and its a fairly, pretty good plot. The story about the monsters are also really good too but you don't get a whole lot about the creatures origins. Scenes/Action Sequences - Again, best gigantic Robot/Monster fighting in a gigantic city scenes I have ever seen. I thought it was better scenes in Pacific Rim just because the robots were quite slow and it wasn't as exciting as watching the flying Mothras beat the you now what out of Godzilla. Godzilla is just such an iconic character you just can hate fight scenes with him in it. I can't spoil about the fight scenes but I wish I could because they are so amazing, but trust me, when you see this movie, you're are going to walk pout of the theater saying,""That was Freaking Awesome."" Mainly the action scenes were what made this movie so good. No its not like Pacific Rim were its a awesome dumb robot fighting movie, this is an emotional awesome monster fighting movie right here. The monsters actually pot rayed some emotions which was absolutely great! Yes, the monsters devoted some heart into the film which really helped make this more than a giant monster/robot fighting Pacific Rim movie. Even with the humans there was a lot of heart devoted into the film with them.Pros And Cons -Pros -Amazing Action Sequences Great Plot and Story Developing Suspense Great Characters Superb CGI Animation Cons -Bryan Cranston is in the movie to little Long BeginningOverall - Overall Godzilla was one of the greatest satisfactions in a movie remake I have ever seen, because movie remakes are never really that good. I am satisfied, and if your looking for a good action packed summer film Godzilla is your #1 option. (A)","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

Slightly. More so than I did Amazing Spider-Man 2, but then again that was a bad movie to start off with.1. I find Aaron Taylor-Johnsons character to be ridiculously redundant and unneeded. Most likely the only reason why they put him in there was because Hollywood needed an attractive Caucasian character to be the lead. His character is utterly ridiculous, with no goal or motivation. He didn't disarm the bomb, so him being an EOD was not relevant. He failed to warn his superiors that the female Mothra or Muuto is already going through gestation. The movie made it a big deal about how they were seeking each other to mate, once they joined up, their mating only involved the male giving the female a nuclear payload? She could've obtained that on her own. 2. How on earth did they go from Japan, to a carrier, then take a helicopter back to Hawaii? Even military helicopters have a max distance of around 750 miles without refueling, the distance between Japan and Hawaii is 4100 miles. Even if the carrier was half way between Japan and Hawaii, they still wouldn't be able to make the distance on a helicopter. 3. Why on earth would the Muutos and Godzilla go to San Francisco? There are no Nuclear power plants, so for a creature who feeds on radiation, they're going pretty far away from a food source. 4. Ken Watanabe has ""studied"" Godzilla and the Muuto for decades yet know nothing about them. So his character was not relevant as well. The movie isn't worth the $10-15 that theatre charges, in my opinion it's only worth a $5 discount ticket. The acting was really bad, the only enjoyable moments was the 5 minute fight at the end when Godzilla just wrecked mothra like a boss.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A film that had so much potential, but flatlined.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3085935/?ref_=tt_urv","bjhomeboy08","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21565031/?ref_=tt_urv","13 September 2014","I followed this film for several months before it's release and my expectations were sky high. What I was hoping for was a fresh new take on the original Godzilla film; a grittier, darker, and far more complex film. What I got instead was a cookie cutter military action film that horrendously segued into a pseudo super hero film. Unfortunately the ending of the film completely ruined it for me. The film blatantly asks the viewer to choose whether or not Godzilla is the hero, when in fact Godzilla is not a hero nor a villain. What Godzilla represents is sheer chaos and destruction; Godzilla is ""a force of nature"" and that's how things should be left off. Unlike the atomic bomb, Godzilla cannot be controlled by man, and the beast operates on it's own terms. Thus this is where the main problem of the film lies. The film teeters between this idea that Godzilla, somehow, is our savior, but for the first 90 minutes of the film the viewers are lead to believe that Godzilla must be stopped at all costs. But this problem mainly stems from the poorly contrived military plot. Which brings me to my second biggest flaw, which are the human characters. The only redeeming characters to the film are Joe Brody, portrayed by Bryan Cranston, and Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, portrayed by Ken Watanabe. Unfortunately their time on screen are severely lacking and any possible resemblance of character development goes out the window once we are introduced to the dry military portrayal of Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Instead of going the military/action route the film would have benefited from taking a more detective/mystery/thriller path, which the trailers so falsely advertised. But back to the subject at hand. The characters, besides the previously mentioned two, are dull and lack any redeeming qualities that the viewer can latch on to, which causes us to simply not care about what is happening to them. The film tries so desperately to establish a tone, but that's all the film does. There are no layers or complexities to the situations that are presented, which go hand in hand with the simplistic and boring characters.My third gripe about this film is that it struggles to identify itself. Is it a disaster movie? A hero film? A monster movie? A thriller? A horror? A science fiction? Well in case you couldn't figure it out, it tries to blend all of these different genres and more. But you often see that in military action films that strive to be more than what it is. If the filmmakers simply went 100% the monster/action genre route then the film would succeeded in delivering it's message and concept. Instead this film appears to have been bogged down by multiple script revisions and having too many hands at the wheel. And in regards to the elephant in the room, the film is advertised as Godzilla when it really should have been advertised as ""The People vs Godzilla."" Godzilla is only featured in about 20 mins of this 122 min film. While the human characters, excluding Cranston performances, are featured for a good 60 mins. Try to keep yourself awake during long dialogues between bone-headed military superiors and soldiers not listening to the scientists, a boring and shoe horned love interest and blah blah blah...Overall the film was over-hyped with expertly crafted trailers and advertisements to lead viewers, like me, to believe that this iteration of Godzilla was going to take this franchise to the next level. Like the name itself, Godzilla is a ""God"" like creature that does not play by mankind's rules, vice-versa, mankind must learn that Godzilla is something that we cannot control and we must adapt to live in his realm of destruction and chaos, essentially hell on earth. Godzilla is not a figure that should be labeled as hero or villain, unless that's the initial purpose. Taking cues from films such as Alien and Jurassic Park would have greatly benefited this film in the long run and would have established not just a franchise but a bonafide contender for many Summers to come.","93 out of 180 found this helpful.

And... it disappoints. There was so little Godzilla in this movie, the antagonists MUTO was the main focus of the movie along with Ford Brody. All the characters are so one dimensional, Ken Watanabe is a typical scientist, Aaron Taylor Johnson is the Heroic character and seriously I cannot get emotionally invested into this characters because I do not feel for them at all even with the relative amount of screen time. Bryan Cranston,the one so heavily marketed in this movie, dies in the first 30 minutes or so, yet I still feel a connection towards his character because there is something more than ""Oh I'm a Nuclear Scientist! Stop Godzilla!"" motivation behind him. The fights between MUTO and Godzilla in the film, are always anti climatic, just as we are expecting a full on fight sequence but nope,screw you audience lets watch more of Ford Brody's Family or the Army taking the nuclear war head instead of that seriously almost made me fell asleep. That said though, the final fight between the Female MUTO and Godzilla was EPIC, my inner 8 year old screamed in delight. This IS WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR. Just because of the Roar and the fight makes the movie from a 4/10 for me to a 6/10. My final conclusion? Go see it if you are interested for a full 1 hour 45 minutes focused on a soldier. If not, save the money, wait for the the DVD release","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Better than Ferris Bueller's version","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3113627/?ref_=tt_urv","joshua-fraser6","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31890845/?ref_=tt_urv","29 October 2014","Godzilla is a remake of the 1998 Godzilla film starring Matthew Broderick, which is a remake of the 1956 Godzilla: King of the monsters which itself is a reworking of the 1954 classic Godzilla directed by Ishiro Honda. Out of the above mentioned films the new Godzilla is definitely better than the 1998 version which was a disappointment upon its release. The new Godzilla goes back to the roots of the iconic monster, taking inspiration from the 1954 film in both its depiction of Godzilla where instead of keeping the story on Godzilla himself it instead brings the focus of the film to the people and how they are affected by the emergence of a giant radioactive lizard, the other throwback being the social commentary about the use of nuclear bomb, which I felt was cleverly updated to feel relevant today.In the film Brian Cranston plays a scientist who believes that something bad is going to happen as a result of nuclear testing done in Japan, but his theories are dismissed by the scientific world and he is called a 'crackpot' by others. It is only after monsters start appearing that his son (a bomb defuser for the navy seals) played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and others start to believe him, but by this point it is too late and the world has a couple of radio-active monsters to worry about. The film has a much more grounded take on Godzilla than the past films which is why the story is told through the perspective of the humans and how they plan to overcome the current disaster, which leads to interesting choices in terms of the direction of the film. Speaking of the direction I believe that Gareth Edwards direction is the highlight of the film and saves it from turning into something like Pacific Rim, the scenes in the film are very well constructed and I was particularly impressed by the introduction of Godzilla in a draw dropping shot.My main issue with the film would be the way Gareth Edwards teased Godzilla in two scenes where the audience believes they were going to see some monster fighting but the scenes just cut away to something less exciting, which I understand goes with the decision to make the film human based, but it does leave the climax underwhelming as it cannot live up to the hype that is previously established. I do believe that this is probably Godzilla's best American outing but it doesn't live up to the original Ishiro Honda version. This is definitely worth watching as long as you don't go in expecting to see only Godzilla destroying cities.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Someone who set out not only to envision a new future for Godzilla but to protect the previous Godzilla's long 60 year history, a man capable of delivering a Godzilla for our time. After seeing Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' it is my opinion that he has succeeded in mastering the vision for the monster that Tomoyuki Tanaka had in mind 60 years ago. Even though the original Godzilla will always be just that - the original, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is for me the first TRUE and complete representation of the vision of Godzilla. Executed in the most masterful of ways in direction by Gareth Edwards and in overall story by Max Borenstein. In delivering the picture that he has Gareth Edwards has completely put to shame directors such as Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich, Zack Snyder and the other go-to blockbuster directors. Injecting a surprising amount of suspense into this 'Godzilla' Gareth's Godzilla will have you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath in anticipation of what is next to come - something a Godzilla movie has not done since 1984. Unlike many of the reviews that I have read, I found the pacing of this movie to be absolutely fine, in fact I would have personally preferred a few more opportunities to catch my breath and gather my wits. Gareth Edwards has clearly given Godzilla the strongest opportunity for continued box office presence that he has ever had in the United States (although the burden of that task in my opinion seems almost insurmountable - and in all honesty - I would prefer to see this 'Godzilla' remain as it is, a superior standalone). A rebirth of epic (but not overwhelming) proportions this Godzilla harks back to the radiated and devastated scenes of Tokyo in Tomoyuki Tanaka and Ishiro Honda's original 1954 'Gojira' capturing with somber respect and sadness the human toll in stark contrast to most summer blockbuster movies in recent memory (especially 'Man of Steel' and 'Star Trek Into Darkness') Gareth Edwards and Max Borenstein can now rightfully join the likes of Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishiro Honda, Akira Ifukube and Eiji Tsuburaya as masters of Godzilla.","244 out of 478 found this helpful.

Do you recall the disappointment that followed? Did you catch the hype and build up to Gareth Edwards' take on the behemoth? Does it follow the pattern? The short version is yes. And no. Godzilla doesn't live up to the hype, it doesn't match expectations and, yes, it is mildly disappointing. But as for it being a let down, nope, not so much. Edwards, in his second outing as director after 2010's low budget blinder, Monsters, gives us a big budget B movie packed with effects that thrills and entertains even if it doesn't excite, terrorize and inspire awe in the manner we'd like. Part of that comes down to Edward himself. Monsters was such a fine, unexpected delight and he set the bar so high for himself that it was unlikely he could surpass it with so much of other people's money and the pressure and interference that presumably brings.The Godzilla aficionados will possibly find much to howl at, but for the casual viewer and happy bystander amidst the havoc wreaking there is much to enjoy here with the nuke-crunching prehistoric monsters. A little more backstory and reason is given for the emergence of Godzilla and his prey, and the human interest story is given a fair run with the relationship between scientist-cum-embittered-conspiracy-theorist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his estranged, cynical, soldier son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).Though Taylor-Johnson has come a long way since Nowhere Boy and makes a reasonable focal point, Godzilla hangs on the name of Cranston, the biggest 'star' on screen here. That comparatively little is made of Joe is something of a surprise and the greatest disappointment. The charisma he threatens to exude is wasted in a lack of screen time and Taylor-Johnson's Ford has neither the impact to be truly memorable nor the circumstances to really shine on this occasion.Godzilla is sprinkled with a few actors who deserve more, but Edwards wastes them, or rather doesn't waste time on them when he can focus on monsters ripping cities to shreds. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife, Elle; Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa; David Strathairn as Admiral William Stenz; Sally Hawkins as Vivienne Graham; none of them are allowed to really sink their teeth into their characters or dominate the screen. Hawkins is particularly wasted (and more than a little wooden, alas), disappearing for a vast chunk of the movie and reappearing almost as an afterthought as though Edwards suddenly remembered she was on the payroll. Not that I'd noticed she had gone AWOL.Yes, Godzilla is the star of this franchise, but then so were the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park series, but that didn't stop Crichton and Spielberg from making the human characters count for something.There is some lovely camera work on display and this is where Edwards' Godzilla really shines. Frequently we are positioned behind people or objects, jostling for a view of the monsters, our vision frustratingly blocked by heads and obstacles, placing us right there in the action and causing us to unconsciously move in our seats to look around the obstruction. But is it enough? Will you enjoy Godzilla? Think of it as Transformers with dinosaurs (and a smidgen of Alien) only better and if that grabs you, take a punt. Better still, take the kids. And stand by for the sequel.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

(Ex. Dominic West in 300, Deirdre Lovejoy in Step Up, Kiefer Sutherland in Phone Booth, Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness, Martin Freeman in The Hobbit) But, to my surprise, once I started watching the movie I realized that he was cast for a good reason, and not just to sell tickets. I thought he did a great job playing a man who is desperate for answers without looking too much like Hiesenburg. (Maybe it's the hair) And that's all I'm going to say about Mr. Cranston. He's not the main focus of the movie so neither is this review. The first two acts of the movie are satisfying. They were more suspense then action, but it worked well. The opening twenty minutes do a great job of establishing conflict and getting us to care about the characters, but they feel under-developed. I don't even remember the main character's name. None of the characters have an arch, but what do you expect from a summer blockbuster about a monster. David Strathairn's character felt displeasingly similar to his role in the Bourne movies. Overall, the acting was believable except for the unnecessary child. Fortunately, the kid wasn't involved that often, so it wasn't a major issue. Godzilla is shown sparingly and that's a good thing. This movie would have gotten really boring if they just presented Godzilla right off the bat instead of leaving an element of mystery to the monster. It was this choice that made the third act good. Not great; but good. The plane jumping scene was awesome but I felt like it was ruined in the trailer. I did like how they used the same music from the trailer. It helped capture the danger and uncertainty of the situation. I thought the monster fights were great, but the same couldn't be said for the parts with just humans in them. Their was one scene that involved gasoline (people who watched the movie know what I'm talking about) that made no sense and left me feeling frustrated. I thought that the cable news parts were annoying and were clearly just used for exposition. The CGI was impressive and there were only three times were it took me out of the story, but all three of them were during quiet moments so I didn't mind too much. My biggest complaint is the way the movie dragged on. I felt like if the last five minutes were cut out, and the end was left to interpretation, then the movie would be that much better. However, Godzilla was still a satisfying film. It was everything I thought it would be plus a little more, and it was able to sustain legitimate tension throughout the second act. I anticipated giving this film a 6/10 but this movie was a little better then I expected. I'm giving Godzilla a 7/10. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an entertaining summer action movie without superheroes.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

There's this gritty, emotional beginning with very good acting and generally nothing to criticise. Then it moves into phase 2 which is great special effects but the acting and dialogue was left at the door. It's almost like Michael Bay usurped the production crew about 1/3 of the way into the film.OK, so you probably heard that Brian Cranston is in this film and he is great as you might expect. His character's son, played by some dude who might remind you of Keanu Reeves only with less talent, simply pales in comparison. The problem for the film is that it is the son who is the main character. He was so bad that, on the drive home from the theatre, I was unable to recall a single one of his lines.Whereas the first part all make sense - and even threatens to be intelligent as we get various concepts and scientific notions tossed our way - whilst at the same time endears Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) to the compassionate viewer, the second part of the film abandons all logic and reason as we track Ford Brody (some dude) and the army as they make bad decision after bad decision along the way in a series of forgettable and clichéd scenes until we finally get Godzilla in all his glory.Godzilla truly, though, is glorious. The special effects are excellent with only the occasional iffy moment. If you are watching the film for Godzilla, then you will not be disappointed.Unfortunately for the rest of us, it does appear that this was scripted just when the writers went on strike? Sorry, I'm just speculating as to why 1/3 of the film is very well written and the latter 2/3s of the story/script is appalling.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I own every film in the highest format available and have watched them all plenty of times.I went into this movie excited, it looked RIGHT. The trailers were giving me a tone I could dig an I was interested to see what they did with it. Interestingly the trailer lured us all wrongfully on purpose which was fantastic! This interpretation of Godzilla goes back to an older way of looking at him, that of sort of an anti-hero. The concept is that instead of being created by the Atomic Bombs of Japan years ago, Godzilla is instead millions of years old and basically Earth's way of keeping the balance tipped away from other giant monsters (assumingly because back then, giant monsters ruined everything). In this sense, it's very reminiscent of the Showa Era of Godzilla. Which is where its weaknesses lie.This film is just as slow, if not slower, than the Showa Era Godzilla films. There's a lot of (uninteresting) human character story, a lot of fight teasing, and just a very small amount of Godzilla until the final climax. Which would be fine except for two things. Firstly, the climax still doesn't give us enough giant monster fighting for my taste. Other Godzilla films, even if they have a heavy focus on the human element through the film, give us a climax of about a straight 10 minutes of nothing else happening except Godzilla kicking butt. This film STILL kept cutting back to the humans while everyone just wanted to see Godzilla vs. Muto.Secondly, while it's VERY comparable to the Showa Era, that is my least favorite era of films.Don't get me wrong though! It's still a GOOD Godzilla movie and all around a good movie. It's fun, funny, entertaining, at times jaw dropping and adrenaline pumping. It's well made and belongs right next to all of the Toho created films. As my title says, it's absolutely a good Godzilla movie. Without a doubt! I just would rank all of the other good Godzilla movies over it.Definitely check it out and see if you may like it more than I do!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Some of the effects are pretty stunning, and the line between CGI and real life is thread thin.But story wise, it's a dead 2/10, simply this is nothing that hasn't been done before at least ten times.

There is too much missing from this, too many half stories told, too many short-cuts on fight scenes, terrible ""monster"" fight choreography when you do actually get to see it and you draw an emotional blank when trying to relate to anyone in this movie, because they aren't real characters.A poor age old story with stereotypical characters, no real twist or anything surprising, predictable outcomes and an impressive CGI performance to help draw a subtle explosive curtain over the lack of depth.","69 out of 133 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Acting is subpar but special effects save the film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128852/?ref_=tt_urv","thomas-w15","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43867541/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2014","Godzilla 7/10- We all know that the 1998 Godzilla with Matthew Broderick was a total train wreck and a pointless remake doing nothing except attempting to copy the original with no success. Now, since I have not seen all of the original Godzilla, I will not make any comparisons. Having said that, the 2014 Godzilla is a good stand-alone film that features near ground breaking special effects plus top-notch acting from supporting actor Bryan Cranston. Aside from the acting from Bryan Cranston, the rest of the acting was sub-par at best. Then again, Bryan Cranston is a great actor and anyone who is compared to him in this film will be put to shame, so I will try not to be too harsh. Still, I expect the other actors to at least try their best and it seemed apparent that in some of the scenes that demanding good acting, they did not. The plot was hard to follow at times, but that may be because the trailer was not bad, but misleading and has you searching for a different path while the movie keeps giving us all of these twists and turns. What I liked about the plot though is that Godzilla was not the only monster, he was not the only possible antagonist. In terms of choosing those types for the other antagonists, I felt like they could have done better since giant mantis looking dinosaurs are not very appealing, but this is all just my opinion. I will not go over much of the acting since most of the movie is special effects, but I would like to give a couple spotlights. Bryan Cranston, as I said before, gave a powerful, literally astounding performance that owned every scene he was in. I was a little worried that he would not be able to set himself aside from Breaking Bad, but no need to worry, he is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now and he shows that in this film. Aaron Taylor- Johnson did nothing special in this film, but it is hard to blame him since he was in the heavy special effects scenes. The only performance I really did not like was from Elizabeth Olsen because she just did not sell the role of her being a loving mother and wife, the same with Aaron Taylor Johnson in terms of father and husband as well. They are both very young though so I think it would have been smarter to either get older actors or to have the couple but not the kid. The rest of the cast did average but again their is only one Bryan Cranston. Now we venture to the best part of the film, the special effects. WOW, that is how I describe the special effects, WOW. I have not said that since Avatar. Just the shear size of Godzilla is something that really leaves in audience in awe. Then adding two other dinosaur/monster characters to the mix really gives the action scenes a lot more depth. I do not want to spoil the part that the entire audience agrees is the highlight of the film, but trust me the final part of the film, the final action is so good that this part alone is enough to see the movie. To put it simply, a lot of tremendous special effects with some fine acting with Bryan Cranston makes the movie very enjoyable to say the least. I definitely recommend Godzilla as your choice going into the theater if you want to see top-quality action film.

Even that was a waste of time as I got nothing from it at all in nearly two hours. They spent USD 160 million to make a poorly executed, grimy coloured, dark and hopelessly inadequate b film and made a profit! And some highly paid film critics actually praised this – all I wonder now is how much they got paid for their misleading recommendations. The only good thing is it kept a lot of talented people in a job, including the highly paid critics too I suppose.It starts fairly well as a Close Encounters rip-off, a man and his son trying to get into nuclear power station the brass hats have put out of bounds claiming ridiculous radiation poisoning for some lying inexplicable reason. They're soon let into the secret as the secret breaks loose. The remaining ninety minutes drag by in grimy darkness, with admittedly great sporadic cgi cartoonery – although there were far more stretches of dark with only farty noises which reminded me of the great Fred The Oyster and other sound effects from the Goon Show. Apart from periods of incoherent messiness the character, monster and plot development was nil; at least in the original Godzilla everybody and everything was cardboard and more real. My own favourite was Godzilla vs King Kong, what was yours? This sentimental-macho techno-hokum may be pleasing to the psyche of modern Japanese viewers but personally bring back The Prince Of Space or The Neptune Men anyday.Did I mention the dark griminess, only broken by the depressing dysentery green of everything? John Wayne made Iwo Jima look like Paradise compared to this non-splendid vision. It's probably the worst film I've half-seen for ages, doesn't do what it says on the tin, and may leave you with eye-strain.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Most of the plot points involving the human characters are familiar, but welcomed. Bryan Cranston steals the show in all the scenes he is in. The rest of the characters are fairly simple, with the exception of Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who you can say is an expert in monsters.The human drama at times does seem to override the action. The movie teases you with action which sometimes can be effective whereas other times you feel sort of robbed. However, the final act is something to be witnessed. There are moments where your jaw may hit the floor.The most important thing to keep in mind when going to see this movie is that if you are looking for another ""Pacific Rim"" with nothing but senseless action, you will be disappointed. This film is based more in realism and goes back to Godzilla's roots. Overall, this movie is heavy on the drama but still packs a punch, even though you may wish you could get just a little more Godzilla. It is worth every penny. The King of the Monsters is back ladies and gentlemen.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

But it is still not really a memorable movie. It is a little bit too much in terms of taking an iconic Japanese movie monster and exposing it to the glamor of Hollywood.The story is fairly consistent to the Godzilla universe; the massive reptilian Godzilla comes out of hiding to do battle against another equally massive otherworldly creature.That was basically it, so don't sit down to watch ""Godzilla"" with the expectations of being intellectually challenged or stimulated, as that is not going to happen. This is pure and simply one of those movies where you just unhook your mind, sit back, and enjoy the pretty colors on the screen (well, not really colors, but the CGI effects).And of course, the American army is fearless in the face of such a clearly overpowered foe, but halters not in their approach to take on the threat to the American way of life. It becomes a little bit too cliché.What this movie survives on is the effects without a doubt. And hats off to the CGI effects team, because they really pulled it off quite nicely. The creatures were very impressive to look at, and very life-like as well (well, as much life-like as massive monsters would be, I assume).I enjoyed the visual destruction of buildings and everything throughout the movie. And they hadn't been stingy on those. There is a lot of mayhem in the movie, but surprisingly little casualties given the enormity of the structural damage dealt in all locations that the Mutos and Godzilla were. So that was a little bit too Hollywood there with its political correctness.One thing that I was missing was the iconic screech of Godzilla. They weren't really anywhere near that in sound or spirit. And let's face it, you can't have a Godzilla movie without his trademark screech.""Godzilla"" is an entertaining movie for what it is, a mindless CGI galore, and it is perfect for one of those days when you just want to do nothing. 6 out of 10 stars from me.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

So much money was spent on that movie and it went on to bomb.17 years later, with much fanfare less the 30 story poster, Godzilla is revisited. This time San Francisco would have a role in the movie, not just a role in publicizing the movie.Godzilla 2014 definitely was more dramatic and more intense. Of course we all paid our money to see Godzilla do what Godzilla does best: breathe fire and destroy cities. We were treated to that and we got to see Godzilla more akin to the original other than the muscular slimmed down '98 version.Godzilla was much like a video game I saw years ago. It may have been a Sims game in which the backdrop was a city and two monsters slugged it out laying waste to the city. In this movie the backdrops are Japan (of course), Hawaii and San Francisco. If anyone is pleased by the destruction of San Francisco then you would be very delighted to see this movie.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The monster fights were truly amazing placed after the patient teasing buildups. But we didn't get to see the amazing entire Godzilla much. It shows up only in the end of the movie. Rest of the time we see his legs or tail or face. and many times his back while swimming in the ocean, which looks like floating mountains. The MUTOs were really brutal. But I wonder why were they walking in the city when they are able to fly. And why the male MUTO travels around just to hand over the female a nuclear missile. In the end Godzilla just goes in to the ocean and swims away, which I think was weird. During the whole movie I was thinking MUTO is this powerful. They aren't able to fight with him. How will they save themselves from Godzilla. But the end was unpredictable.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

For a 2 hour film, you don't really see that much of Godzilla until near the end and the big showdown at the end was a bit difficult to work out. I liked the intense drama throughout the movie but the director got rid of the decent actors really early in the movie so your left with these B actors who look puzzled and confused most of the time. It really needed someone like Will Smith or Channing Tatum who could have brought some wit and action to the main character. The sets looked amazing and realistic, especially when the director pans out so you can see the total destruction of the city, but I was really disappointed with the corny ending. In all, it's a watchable movie which is entertaining and we'll put together, but they really need to get some decent actors if there going to come out with a sequel. Watchable!Round-Up: The main character, whose played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, is mostly known for the Kick- Ass franchise so he was a weird choice for such a massive film. Personally I don't think that he was the right choice because he didn't really bring that much emotion to his character but thats just me being picky. Bryan Cranston played his father well and he brought some intensity to his role, especially when he was watching his wife through the door (trying not to spoiler), but there wasn't any other actors that stood out in the film. With all the attention to detail on the scenery, I wasn't that impressed with the look of Godzilla. He looked very plastic/rubbery which was surprising for this day and age. Anyway, it's definitely an epic movie which will look brilliant on a big screen and sound great with massive speakers, and judging by the movies takings, this is definitely a concept which will always be popular with Godzilla fans.Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $525million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there epic movies about Godzilla taking on some nasty creatures. 6/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Gojira, in spite of being a man in a rubber suit monster movie, is a smart and feisty film. Tapping into an oppressive nuclear age via moody atmospherics, whilst simultaneously imbuing plenty of creature feature carnage, it got the balance right. The makers of Godzilla 2014 have tried to do the same, they look back fondly to the original wave, pay it respect, but sadly they don't quite pull it off.Plot essentially finds the world under attack by some Kaiju (MUTO) monsters after humans keep dabbling in all things nuclear. The end is nigh, that is unless mankind can find an ally in Godzilla, an almighty prehistoric type lizard who itself is a product of some prior nuclear shenanigans.The human plot strands feature the usual secretive government suits mixing with science guys, all looking worried or running around in a fretful state. There's a father and son axis – with the son a bad ass army guy who has a loving wife and child back home. Characters are many, and they take up a good portion of the film, unfortunately very few of them are interestingly written, which is a shame given the pic is packed with acting talent.It's a two hour plus movie, with the build up being very prolonged, with Zilla not showing up till the hour mark. This renders the main monster as a bit player in its own movie, a mistake often made by others in many a sequel to Honda's original. There's also the irritating fact that what all good Zilla movies need is a shed load of monster mayhem, plenty of smack-downs, but sadly they are in short supply here and are often rendered as background staples. Until the finale that isIt takes a long time to get there, but thankfully saving the pic from below average hell, it's not a let down. It thrills and opens up the eyes and ears considerably, and fans of all things Zilla will get goosebumps upon the arrival of the charge and breathing of nuclear fire sequence. But with that comes the annoyance that the good technical craft within the piece has previously been used sparingly, the decision to put bland characters at the forefront instead of cinema's most famous monster proving to be a huge error.Maybe, just maybe, it's time to let sleeping atomic lizard's lie? Or of course there's always Kong to join the fray for franchise steering purpose... 6.5/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Still, director Gareth Edwards and screenwriters Max Borenstein (screenplay) and Dave Callaham (story) have done their best to retain the spirit of those films back when ""Godzilla"" was King of the Monsters rampaging and stomping through an already downtrodden Tokyo. How and why ""Godzilla"" (back in the day when ol' radioactive breath was brought to life through suitmation, スーツメーション) would eventually become a celebrated champion capable of committing giganticide of any and all post-atomic mutations threatening Japan is a process which most creatures (the Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, et.al.), emerging from mere legend must undergo before passing into popular folklore. So, I suppose for this reason more than any other, the fact that talk of a sequel currently in the works is a good thing, because, ""it's good to be the king""!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

While it wouldn't have made my top 10 for the year, this was definitely one of the best monster/disaster movies I've seen in recent memory. The story follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson), a Navy bomb disposal expert, who travels to Japan to get his father out of some trouble. His father used to work for a Japanese company, but after a cataclysmic event 15 years ago the area has been quarantined off, yet he still thinks that there's something going on besides the official story that it was a natural disaster. The ""thing"" actually turns out to be a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that they've been keeping contained. However when it escapes all hell breaks loose, and chaos and massive destruction ensue. Of course, you might be wondering where Godzilla fits into all of this. Despite the title of the movie, Godzilla only appears on screen for about 10-15 minutes. Still, the those precious minutes are worth it as he takes on the MUTO. One thing I appreciated about the film was that it didn't overexpose the monsters, instead letting the human drama take center stage. You get to spend time with the characters you'd most identify with, and the effects of a disaster were dealt with in a very realistic, down-to-earth way, even amongst all of the chaos and destruction. In fact, there was quite a large human cast such that I'd almost wish they'd delved a little deeper so that more time could be spent building things up. The worst offender is probably the prologue which set everything up. It was very effective in establishing a baseline, but not so much in terms of character building. Of course, all complaints aside, all of the performances were excellent. I just wish there had been more Bryan Cranston. In terms of visual effects and spectacle, this film stands head and shoulders above everything that came out in 2014. Scenes of destruction and mayhem were handled very well, and the creatures were also very well-animated. I should also mention the outstanding score by Alexandre Desplat, which hit all the right beats and fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Overall, I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't see this on the big screen but it was still an exciting viewing experience. It pays attention to its human characters and while the monsters don't take up too much screen time, when the action comes it delivers big time. Highly recommended.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights, and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments, it surprisingly works quite well.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6741313/?ref_=tt_urv","msbreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79118814/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2021","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)It's not easy to start off a new cinematic universe. The first installment must be an undeniable success on almost all fronts for the franchise to take off. From interesting world-building to delivering a good first film, it's a brutally challenging task for any director and writer to take on. Godzilla has been around forever, but Warner Bros. And Legendary Entertainment bravely brought on an inexperienced filmmaker, Gareth Edwards (Monsters), and a debutant screenwriter, Max Borenstein, to handle yet another version of the Godzilla story. Expectations-wise, I know that audiences look at this type of movie from an action-heavy perspective. A massive majority of the viewers just want to see monsters fighting, which is understandable. I enjoy a big battle as much as any other moviegoer, but I do desire a remotely decent story. When it comes to this particular genre, I don't ask for an Oscar-worthy screenplay that leaves me floored by the end of the film. I don't need incredibly complex, multi-layered characters with exquisite motivations. I don't even mind heavy exposition as long as it's not overdone and sluggish. With that said, I also don't want the most annoying, cliche archetypes nor nonsensical plot points. I genuinely hate myself when I get too nitpicky with ""movie logic"" issues, but when the characters make the most ridiculously absurd decisions that no sane human being would make, then the film is really asking for a negative commentary. Borenstein - who goes on to co-write two of the following three installments in the MonsterVerse - gets close to a perfectly balanced narrative, which in this genre is related to the amount of screentime allocated to humans and monsters. This movie can't just be Godzilla fighting a random monster since the visually appealing, constant battles would lose impact with time (besides the lack of a story), but it also can't waste all of its duration with the human characters - after all, the film is titled Godzilla, not The Brody Family. Audiences all over the world enter their respective theaters to be blown away by the action, visuals, score, and be thoroughly entertained by titans punching each other to death. Several characters carry surprisingly compelling arcs, especially Ford and Joe Brody. The father-son relationship between Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kickass) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) feels authentic, with both having a common unsolved problem from their past that links to the King of the Monsters. The emotional attachment to this family elevates the dangerous sequences that the movie holds throughout its runtime. Cranston offers an undeniable commitment to his role, while Taylor-Johnson demonstrates some of the talent that would later be discovered by Marvel. Ken Watanabe (Inception, Batman Begins) is a fantastic addition to the cast as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, a scientist who fortunately doesn't follow the formulaic development usually thrown at this type of character. Elizabeth Olsen (Oldboy, Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine, Happy-Go-Lucky) also get a bit of screentime, but they're basically just ""people close to the important characters"". Gareth Edwards admittedly loves the Godzilla lore, but any viewer can tell the great care that both Edwards and Borenstein have with their characters. More screentime is handed to humanity than to the monsters, which will undoubtedly disappoint many fans. While I do feel invested in the protagonists, too much time is spent with the military, where countless exposition scenes drag the overall narrative. The suspenseful build-up to the climactic third act is efficient, but the action is frustratingly hidden from the viewers. Most of the titanic battles are seen through the windows of a car, train, building, or even TVs. The main problem with the film isn't spending time with humans when the monsters aren't fighting but choosing to remain with these characters even when Godzilla and co. Enter the scene. Titans are fighting right behind the camera, and they keep the audience either entirely in the dark or just partially show a section of the battle. Most of the shots are ground-level, usually showing the POV of a certain character. While that brings a higher sense of danger and desperation to the screen, it also generates a frustrating feeling in the audience who's not seeing Godzilla fighting in its full splendor. I understand that part of this decision might be related to some less polished VFX, and in all honesty, despite the rare wide shots of the monsters, the action is definitely entertaining and quite riveting. Alexandre Desplat's score is vibrant, and the actual monsters look gorgeous in the purposefully dark environment (helps to hide visual imperfections), especially Godzilla. Godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights, and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments, it surprisingly works quite well. As the first installment in the MonsterVerse, Gareth Edwards and Max Borenstein deliver an incredibly compelling story on the human side, fully developing the main characters and handing them interesting arcs. Most of the runtime is spent with these protagonists, which will undoubtedly disappoint some fans who crave the titanic battles, but the suspenseful build-up works in favor of the climactic third act. However, choosing to remain with the humans when the monsters are already fighting in the background is a questionable decision that leaves an extremely frustrating feeling in the audience. Cast, visuals, and score seem to hit the right notes, but the actual combat is rarely seen in its full glory - most of it is shown through a ground-level character's perspective - partially due to the necessity of hiding some VFX imperfections. Still, it's an utterly enjoyable monster flick that sets up a pretty entertaining cinematic universe. Rating: B+","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

A few people cried; most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture; Vishnu takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" J. Robert Oppenheimer Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Rises, Super 8, Iron Man 2, Watchmen. For the last five years there has always been one film that I was anticipating more than others. Some films on that list I have enjoyed more than others but none have given me the ""wow"" factor that I had been seeking when leaving the cinema. Walking out of Batman in 1989 as a 6-year-old and showing the first flickers of an obsession with those characters that continues to this day. Leaving, the Cinema, having seen Jurassic Park and genuinely wondering why anyone else would ever bother making a film again because it would never top that. This year my attention on the year's releases was focused squarely on Godzilla. I have never been a massive fan of the original Man in Suit Godzilla films. I have enjoyed some of them and been surprised by the heart they convey, owing in part that the movies were originally made as a criticism of American nuclear weapons testing. However, my enjoyment of these films was hamstrung by the poor, often laughable, effects. I have always been a fan of giant monster movies but much like the horror genre, it is hard to find a genuinely good one. Pacific Rim was amazing for those few moments, during the scene in Japan, but otherwise left me flat. And the less said about the 1998 version of Godzilla the better.So with my excitement at fever pitch, but with the trepidation of someone who has been hurt before, I sat down to watch the latest incarnation of Gojira. Within the first five minutes I would have a smile on my face that would not leave me until long after the credits had rolled. Put simply, it is a masterpiece of event cinema. When Gareth Edwards was announced as the director, I felt it was an interesting choice. I had mostly enjoyed his debut feature Monsters but was curious if his talk heavy, light on action independent film was due to budget or if that was his preferred style. The last Indie darling to be handed an iconic monster movie was Ang Lee and the result was the daddy issue snore fest that was Hulk. Edwards does not make the same mistake. Here he creates some of the most jaw dropping scenes that have ever graced a cinema screen. Monster Vs Monster smack-downs (no Godzuki, sadly), and entire cities being leveled. He holds nothing back. Godzilla's full reveal is a lesson in suspense. There are half glimpses of various parts of the creature to tantalize and tease before we are treated to a full shot of the king of the monsters. This is not to say the director has chosen style over substance and this is clearly evident in his choice of cast. Forgoing the A-list name above the title actors and instead assembling a cast who treat the material with the seriousness of a Shakespearean play. Bryan Cranston has emerged from Breaking Bad as one of the best and most in demand actors in the game right now. Here, he adds a heft and heart to his role as a man racked with guilt over his part in a family tragedy. The scene with Cranston helplessly looking on as he is forced to make an impossible decision with regards to his family shows him at his brilliant best. Watching him devour the screen every bit as much as his 350ft co-star is amazing. To think, if it weren't for Walter White, one of the great acting talents of our time would have been forever known as Malcolm in the Middle's dad. He is supported by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick Ass) as his son, with the vehicular sounding name of Ford Brody. Elizabeth Olsen plays Ford's wife Elle and adding to the Jaws homage, their son is called Sam, which is Quint's first name. The two will be seen together again next year as the super siblings Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age Of Ultron. To say too much about the plot would ruin perhaps the best event movie since Jurassic Park. The movie does not skimp on story and never descends into a clichéd man Vs. military/America-is-awesome that so many of these films tend to do. At its heart there is a real message about man's interference with nature, with a chilling reminder that at any time Mother Nature can remind us that we are the ones under her control and not the other way around. The monster himself is a beautiful design, paying homage to past incarnations but definitely one they have made their own. He feels real and every roar and step is felt. There are moments when his eyes alone convey more depth and emotion than a million Kirsten Stewarts. One moment in particular, showing almost a glimmer of understanding between man and beast, is beautifully understated. Capturing in one moment what the recent Amazing Spider-Man 2 failed to do in the cringe worthy scene with the child. Overall, the film is an undoubted triumph and one that needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. IMAX 3D has always seemed somewhat gimmicky to me, Gravity being an example of one that worked in that medium but does not carry its resonance over to the small screen. However, I don't see Godzilla having this problem. This will be a film I will be re-watching for years to come. Step aside Cloverfield, back to the ocean with the Kaiju of Pacific Rim and as for King Kong, as the song says ""Whats a King to a God?"". The true king ofthe monsters has reclaimed his throne.

That movie had an appropriate blend of Godzilla, and the actors, with everyone sharing ample movie time. This new version takes a different angle and tries to show us something that we would not think of when we first sit down to watch a monster movie.The movie's not a bad one. It just takes time to set its thrill and action running. Little heads up: You need to be very patient with this one. The actors have done a good job esp. Bryan. There is not much of role of Ken Watanbe in this movie.The CGI effects are too good. The devastation and the fights are very much entertaining, not to mention the x-factor of the Godzilla, its roar. My god I am a huge fan of that roar, its simply the best.Go watch this movie with not much of expectations like good story telling, suspense, actors that were fulfilled by the earlier Godzilla. Some people with a flair of plenty of action and a tendency to get bored by lots of dialogs during the movie might get bored at times. But it's definitely worth a watch.

Acting was pretty good and the plot was acceptable. Effects were great and there is plenty of action and drama. But not nearly enough monster action. It does at least avoid the silliness that ruined many of the past movies. No ""boulder volley ball"" or ""monster kung fu"" in this one.And since they were doing a CGI Godzilla, why make him obese? Seriously, he was fatter than the rubber suit version. I prefer the classic Godzilla over the ""Iguana"" from 1998, but they had a chance to make him look better and they absolutely did not. And their presentation when he finally uses his nuke breath was out and out lame.My son and I arranged for an extra day off work to see it. We were pumped and excited after watching the trailers. We left the cinema a bit disappointed. The movie does not come close to the hype leading up to its release. Frankly, ""Godzilla 2000"" was a better movie, in my opinion.If you watch it, just expect ""another Godzilla movie."" That's all it is. If you expect it to be special, you'll be disappointed.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

In this respect, Godzilla 2014 delivers outright. But there's no reason we shouldn't get a decent story as well. As soon as we see the eponymous creature, the humanistic side of the film descends into chaos. The characters are one-dimensional, the script is terrible and I can barely remember any dialogue. In addition, I couldn't help but note how intrusive Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack was. Gone is the tense, choral subtlety of the film's trailer and we are instead treated to Hollywood-standard booming orchestral pieces that actually make the monsters less terrifying.But on a positive note, Godzilla himself was absolutely gorgeous, and Edwards bravely waits almost a full hour to unleash him in one of the best unveilings of any cinematic character of all time. It's mad to think how an entirely digital creation can become the emotional centre of a story. And someone definitely deserves some kind of award for the film's sound design. It's just a shame that Edwards loaded the film with walking clichés, while forgetting to give show-stealer Bryan Cranston anything to do. Very disappointing.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Can a modern blockbuster combine both mainstream & arty principles?This Godzilla, actually the first Godzilla flick I've seen, has artistic ambition, however this ambition is fumbled by several tired disaster-movie clichés, especially the two-dimensional characterisation with shallow family-emoting. The main guy is miscast, probably the least memorable protagonist since the terrible Pacific Rim. Other clichés:The entire movie also lacked humour or eccentricity. Dry as a bone....so far, so meh.What makes Godzilla worth watching is the occasional foray into artistic film-making. Some camera angles are striking, the use of sound was very immersive and that one time Ligeti was used was a special highlight. If the whole film had that vibe, we'd be talking about this like we talk about 2001 or Alien.Alas, the artistic vision didn't quite win out over the mainstream formula. This clash didn't do the film any favours as there was less tension or awe than there should've been for an event-movie like this. The movie having a split-personality makes it feel unsure of itself. It didn't go all-in one way or the other.Still, there's just about enough here to warrant a watch for those looking for interesting disaster/monster movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

At least the special effects didn't completely overshadow the whole movie here and there was a pretty good story attached. On the downside all the characters are kinda flat and underdeveloped especially from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is the main hero dude.Bryan Cranston might be the exception, but he (consciously?) overacts his role as Joe the grieving father/scientist/Godzilla conspiracy theorist. There is a decent back story set up for him though. Elizabeth Olsen is in the wife/mother role and this could have been done by anyone. Ken Watanabe also very flat, a grumpy sort of non character. They all take it seriously though, and this is an entertaining movie.The visuals are beautifully done and I enjoyed the story with Godzilla emerging from hibernation to battle winged creatures called Motos, threatening humanity. I also liked the new spin put on Godzilla where he is the good monster, helping to save civilization and bus loads of children from the evil, nuclear loving, ever mating Motos. Wasn't too sure about the spin put on history regarding Hiroshima etc -changing history- but decided to just let that go.Lots of mayhem and destruction, as cities are leveled (which is always fun to watch), some excellent battle scenes with colossal destruction from the creatures, lots of globe trotting through Japan (Vancouver), Hawaii, Las Vegas, and San Francisco.

BUT, this movie is not about Bryan Cranston being a scientist against a radioactive monster. This story isn't about Godzilla attacking Tokyo. This movie has nothing to do with the previews. This movie is a pseudo love story that constantly takes you away from the action to watch a less interesting love story between unremarkable characters that the movie creators didn't deem important enough to be in the majority of trailers. This movie wasn't about a monster or the actors I expected. The graphics are top notch, the cinematography is on point but even the awesome monster scenes (which are fine) cant redeem this bait and switch tale.

Over the years Godzilla the beast of all beasts has gone through some monstrous treatment by movie makers who believe they can tell his story and give it some justice. Godzilla is a character developed by the Japanese he has so far stared in 28 movies and a couple of TV series. Personally Godzilla has always been a favourite; I have always had a love of giant monsters, beasts, and creations. I've absolutely hated a lot of the films that have been made so far of Godzilla so I was really hoping that this version will finally see justice done and deliver something to remember, this explains why it took me so long to give it a viewing, I just couldn't handle another fake, horrible, iguana looking creature 1954, there are nuclear bombs being detonated in the middle of the ocean, loud screams of a giant beast can be heard and we get a slight glimpse of some back scales, seems as though the bombs they are dropping are being dropped to destroy something; something very large. 1999 and we are somewhere over the Philippines, a helicopter hovers over a very large mine a Japanese researcher named Ichiro Serizawa finds out that the men there have discovered a monstrous cavern after a cave collapse, inside the cavern the scientist and his assistant discover a very large skeleton unlike anything they have ever seen. Hanging from the cavern are two what appears to be cocoons, one is hatched and appears to be what has made the cave as it dragged its monstrous size across the land and into the ocean. Joe Brady is in Japan trying frantically to organise a meeting to close down the power plant on the island due to very large seismic activity. While in the nuclear plant another tremor happens and before anyone can do anything about it there is a major breach, disaster strikes in more ways than one as the plant comes crashing down killing thousands. 2014 Joe Brady's son Lt Ford Brody has made it back home to wife and son in San Francisco but now needs to go back to Japan to bail his father out of prison. Joe Brady has been searching for answers ever since the meltdown and will do what needs to be done to find them. He makes it back to the island where the plant was originally only to discover the truth to what the local government has been hiding. Godzilla is a monster film unlike any other, it's a trip back to yesteryear, it is a montage to all things BIG but best of all it's a movie that gets it so right. To say there were things done amazingly well would be an insult. The CGI of the Monsters in this movie is second to none, it is outstanding, and a lot of the times BIG means a horrible mess, there are very few films where the big creatures look as menacing and as beautiful as they should. Unfortunately though there is so much that lets the film down as well, horrible acting, very weak storyline, and very BIG plot holes. Personally I feel the good outweighs the bad but I'm sure thousands will disagree. I can forgive the director and the films continuity where it was missing for the amazing creatures he and his team have created. The acting is extremely underwhelming, you don't care about any one of them, at its core it is a story of finding the lost partner once again. Ford making his way back to San Francisco to be with his wife and child before the creatures destroy the city around them. Lt Ford Brody is played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (The Illusionist, Kick Ass) his wife Elle Brody played by Elizabeth Olsen (Oldboy, Kill your Darlings) Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) plays Joe Brody apparently (reading other reviews) he was great in his role, personally I didn't see anything to make him the star. Also Ken Watanabe (Inception, Batman Begins) as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa and Sally Hawkins (Layer Cake, Blue Jasmine) both deserve a mention for their roles as unforgettable as they were. Godzilla should be seen to be enjoyed, it's not at all a masterpiece of cinematic viewing, but it is a monster of a monster movie and that's all it really needs to be. Personally I was so happy with what I seen on the screen ( really want to say more but don't want to give it away) It blew me away and took me back to my childhood. The director Gareth Edwards I feel did an amazing job with the CGI and special effects just next time I think more care needs to be taken with his stars. There are two sequels being made so lets just wait to see what's next.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

That last endeavor proved to be a critical disaster. Come on! Matthew Broderick's silly, bumbling scientist, and a very un-Godzilla-like mutant lizard! The only thing familiar was the famous roar. Of course, seeing Manhattan's skyscrapers destroyed, in the then new CGI, was pretty impressive. But, other than that, it wasn't Godzilla! In director Gareth Edwards' 2014 version, downtown destruction is spare; heart-pounding action is tempered; and the King of Monsters plays only a supporting role in the film that bears his name. Perhaps ol' King G has hit a point in his sixty-year-long career where all he has to do is show up, shoot some scenes in which he knocks down a few buildings, and fights a couple of monsters (with some rather unsatisfying collateral building damage). Despite putting on a few extra midsection pounds (even movie star monsters get midlife pudge), he still possesses the iconic name that makes audiences cheer when he (or she?) appears on screen. Like a sci-fi version of Brando—who later in his career occasionally came out of obscurity to fill a supporting role, collect his paycheck, become more eccentric, elusive, and obese— Godzilla has a name that is carved in cinema history, and Hollywood has proved in one week that they can bank on that name with ticket sales in excess of $150 million. Although he may need to shed a few pounds, he (or she) has certainly proved that Godzilla is back.Since 1954, when Japan introduced the world to Godzilla, he has played the antagonist, the protagonist, destroyed megacities, fought armies, monsters, aliens; and, with the aid of pocket-size, singing, Japanese twins, he's defeated two giant moths; he's made us examine our neglect of the environment, as he fought a pollution-ingesting smog monster (Godzilla vs. Hedorah, 1971), and he's made us question our use of atomic weapons (Godzilla, 1954). Edwards's subtle homage to the film history of Godzilla is a pleasure for the knowing Godzilla fan. He gives audiences the traditional half-crazy scientist; the scientist's reluctant child, who holds some of their father's knowledge about the monster (see Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, 1974); two modern-day radiation-consuming, winged insects (versions of Mothra, 1964); and a Japanese scientist (Ken Watanabe) in dramatic close-up, with grave seriousness, as he tells the military the giant lizard-monster's name is Godzilla. (insert audience cheers). Despite the young and attractive Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, a large portion of the cast is surprisingly older: Bryan Cranston (wearing a Barry Manilow- like wig), David Strathairn (forgettable military-commander Everyman); Ken Watanabe (whose every close-up says, ""I'm more concerned about my chronic constipation than these radiation-ingesting monsters""), Sally Hawkins (was she in it?), Juliette Binoche (also wearing Cranstone's Barry Manilow wig—or a short-haired wig that seems to say, ""Women scientists can't have long, flowing, girlie hair; they have to have short, practical hair""; but I think they allocated the film's hair- and makeup budget to CGI, or a trainer to build Aaron Taylor-Johnson's massive, Godzilla-like neck). Although these very accomplished actors' talents are grossly ignored and comic-bookized, they seem to serve the purpose of connecting the large audience of baby boomers, who grew up with the Godzilla movies during Monster Week on their local TV stations, to this 2014 version. Like Godzilla vs. Hedorah, which used Godzilla's antagonist—a smog monster—as a metaphor for man's abuse of the environment (an early example of today's trend in environmental sci-fi flicks), environmental worry has supplanted the original Godzilla metaphor for nuclear anxieties. This time it's mistreated nature's wrath that we have to fear in the form of MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). Environmental anxieties are ever-present today with some real monsters causing mass destruction, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, Japan's earthquake, and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and countless Midwest tornadoes, just to name a very few. It's satisfying to symbolically destroy that which is destroying us. We may not be able to take revenge on Hurricane Sandy or predict the next mega-quake, but we can take cathartic satisfaction in watching Godzilla pummel radiation-ravenous, pterodactyl-Mothra-bat-glowworm-like things (a result of man's abuse of nature). Gareth Edwards (Monsters) establishes his cinematic vision with some stunning shots that beg to be seen only on the big screen. One moment of note occurs high above the monster-ravished downtown San Francisco as a team of soldiers skydive into the city holding flairs that stream long ribbons of red smoke. It's a welcomed pause of cinematic beauty. While the special effects are impressive, Edwards doesn't overwhelm the picture with a constant roller-coaster ride of action sequences. There are some careful dynamics to his pacing. However, while we're waiting for the monsters to appear, we're subjected to countless dull scenes, filled with characters who are about as thrilling as watching people wait in line at the DMV. I just wish this Godzilla had fewer stars, less waiting, and more Godzilla. But at least the King of Monsters is finally back!—John David West","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It almost seemed like it was going to make the same mistakes of the 1998 film. It was another American version and Godzilla was CGI again. However this film is, thankfully, dramatically better. One of the biggest reasons for this movies success is in large part due to Gareth Edwards excellent direction. Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of the ""boots on the ground"" type of cinematography. Where the film is shot almost like a documentary. Most of the shots are only from angles that normal humans would be able to get.Inside of buildings, up from the street, and on top of skyscrapers. Again, I usually am not a fan of this style but for this film is actually works very well. Since the major threats of the film are three gigantic monsters this technique helps to give you a sense of realism. It makes these huge creatures have a sense of presence and scale.Being able to see how large these creatures are from a human angle really shows how monstrous they are. While Edwards hasn't shown that he can be a great director yet he has shown with the few films he's made that he understands how to give CG a sense of presence.Filming them mainly at night or in large cities. My favorite part of the film though is it's sound design. Whether it's the thunderous crashes of the creatures footsteps or the intimidating roars they emit, each sound is unique and well designed. Being able to associate noises with the specific monster further helped them feel like they were actually there.It was clear that the majority of the film makers time and effort was spent here because the story is pretty eh. It was difficult to get into things when our main character could remarkably go any where the monsters were. Sure he was in the military so a few times it made sense how he could be there.The problem is the entirety of the story revolves around these creatures. It follows them around to each area they go to. They wreck some stuff and then go somewhere else and repeat. Usually this boring, under developed plot would aggravate me a lot more than it did here. The main reason it didn't was because it never begs you to care about what was going on. It knows what it is and has fun with it. It gives a reason for it being in the place that it was and then showed you some awesome carnage. Because that's what you paid for right? To see these cool beasts throw down.Many will argue that the creatures didn't have enough screen time but I thought they were used just right. Showing them to much would have hurt the immersion of the film and to little would have made this very boring. But they were used just enough to make them intimating every time you see them. ​ Obviously this isn't a perfect film. It's thin and sometimes a bit uneven but it's strengths far out weigh its weaknesses. It's fun, big, and bold. It creates a great atmosphere and doesn't beg for you get into the story. This makes it very easy to get sucked into the film and have a blast watching it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is the HALO jump sequence, promoted heavily in the teaser trailer, accompanied by György Ligeti's hair-curling orchestral piece ""Requiem"", made famous in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" when Dave Bowman entered that portal. The sight of minuscule soldiers falling down into apocalyptic clouds as they see destruction all around them with gigantic, moving shadows is a work of terrifying, spectacular beauty; one of the best recent film sequences I've seen and heard. To experience it in IMAX 3D adds to the nightmare fuel.Some other startling bits involve numerous disaster sequences that so closely echoes various natural disasters of the past decade. Viewers may be reminded of terrible events like the tsunamis and earthquakes of 2004 and 2011 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Scenes like these will definitely strike a chord in those who fear mother nature's wrath, but of course they play second fiddle to the real star of the show, who like Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"", doesn't show up until the latter half of the film, but one can definitely sense its brooding, commanding presence.Yes, 60 Years since it laid waste to Tokyo, the King of the Monsters triumphantly returns to the big screen after a 10-year sabbatical in this mammoth-sized entertainment that shifts the Big G into summer blockbuster territory, obliterating Roland Emmerich's turkey into smithereens.Like last summer's ""Pacific Rim"", ""Godzilla"" features gigantic-scale action set-pieces and crowd-pleasing moments, though in large part due to Edwards' skillful and intelligent direction, it entirely eclipses the latter film. Edwards (in only his second directorial feature following the 2010 microbudget ""Monster"") probably felt the same thing a lot of people did in ""Pacific Rim"" - too much action sequences that were dragged out for the purpose of pleasing its core audience. He is wise to limit Godzilla's appearance until the second half of the film, and even so limit his presence until the explosively entertaining climax, taking a page or two from Hitchcock and Spielberg's ""Jaws"" about restraint. The film was made with a ""spectator"" point of view - the audience sees Godzilla as if they were really seeing him, be it the TV screen or while avoiding the unrelenting chaos around them. Edwards didn't just learn from Spielberg as much as he pays a glowing tribute ala J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"". See if you can spot the references to ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters"" in this review. There's even references to ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", among other movies. Not that it isn't a real film. Whilst ""Pacific Rim"" is a film tailor-made for fans of the kaiju/mecha genre, in the same mold that most Marvel superhero films and 'Expendables' films cater to their target audiences, ""Godzilla"" is made like an old-fashioned blockbuster, down from its gripping, foreboding opening to its doom-shrouded action-packed climax that provides a well-earned catharsis to the ominous buildup from the previous 90-minutes. The action sequences are a combination of the classic kaiju franchise with the ominous Biblical paintings of Gustave Doré, especially in the final 30 minutes. Seamus McGarvey's tactful cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's brooding, wildly unleashing orchestral score complement some truly awesome visual effects perfectly to make for the most visually stunning outing of the King yet.Not that there isn't a plot. Max Borenstein's screenplay details something too spoiler that even the mere mention of the basic plot will give away too much, so I won't But the trailers do a damn good job about hiding the true plot of the film, which I must say is formulaic on the human characters' side, but pretty well-written and frenetic for the most part.Oh right, there are other cast members in the film too, all A-listers, ranging from a brief Bryan Cranston giving a combination of Roy Neary and Walter White, Ken Watanabe looking as wise and mournful as the great Takashi Shimura in the original, and a military David Strathairn giving heavy-duty exposition as usual. Add Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and Elizabeth Olsen as obligatory female characters and we have ourselves a heck of a cast that is severely underused. But we didn't come to see a Godzilla movie for a cast surely deserving of an Oscar Bait film. Pretty much the only human who takes center stage is tough, stoic military vet Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of ""Kick-Ass"" fame), who defiantly holds his own against all odds and comes off as a character who demands attention as to what his next plan of action is as chaos rumbles all around him.Bottom line is, I liked what I saw, and Edwards has done a truly bang-up job resurrecting the King of the Monsters from cult fascination. If possible, watch it in IMAX 3D to savor the visual effects and sheer scale, and to hear that famous, mighty roar in terrifying rumbles. It's been a long time coming, but the King is back, and the monster movie is replenished with a vengeance. Would Toho/Legendary mind if I request a future outing?","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

People were complaining in droves about the wooden acting and the fact that the movie's namesake barely appeared in the film at all. Some of these complaints are perfectly legit, but othersin my opinionnot so much. Before GODZILLA was released, I did a bit of homework. Having never actually seen a Godzilla film before but interested in this new film, I watched the original 1954 film (as well as the 1956 American version) and four different Toho films from the later collection. Maybe it's because I put way more thought into it than I should've, but I didn't hate GODZILLA and each subsequent viewing made it more and more entertaining. The movie opens in the late 90's, when a mining crew stumbled across a couple giant eggs of unknown origin in an underground chamber. Years later, a creature emerges from the within and busts out of the research facility that had contained it. It carves a path of destruction through Japan and then across the Pacific to the western coast of the United States where it intends to mate with another MUTO (massive unidentified terrestrial organism) that has hatched from a similar egg that had been dumped into storage in Nevada. Mankind has only one hope to stop these creatures: Godzilla. The king of monsters awakens and beelines for California where it will do battle with the MUTOsbut can man trust he won't turn his destructive power on them next?I'm going to start by defending this movie. For all the people who complain that Godzilla doesn't get much screen time or that his first couple battles against the MUTOs occur off screen, you went into this movie with the wrong expectations. Considering director Gareth Edwards was most likely brought on based on the strengths of his movie MONSTERS which, as I understand (I haven't seen it), tells the story of a giant monster attack form the perspective of the humans on the ground and doesn't actually feature much of the beast. Then, if you go back and watch the original GOJIRA, Godzilla doesn't feature much until the final march into Tokyo. Until the end, Godzilla is seen in bits and piecesa glimpse of his head towering over a hill, his foot coming down into a home, etc. So I personally understand Edwards' decision to give Godzilla minimal screen time (and even that's unfairwe see plenty of him) and saving the on-screen battle for the very end. He's building tension. If he'd given us what we want right away, what interest would we have had in staying through to the end? The creature design on Godzilla is fantastic. He's got the classic design brought to life with seamless CG with a few updates to make him a little more menacing. I'm not as keen on the look of the MUTOs. That would be a complaint of mine. With all the other monsters already populating Toho's collection, why go with an original creation? And why go with a design that feels too familiar to what we've seen in CLOVERFIELD or PACIFIC RIM? While I'm on the topic of the MUTOs, why would they have developed an EMP defense? From an evolutionary standpoint, the ability to produce an electromagnetic pulse would've only been useful in the last hundred years. These creatures have been around for millennia. It's useful from a storytelling perspective (keeps the humans helpless around them) but makes no sense otherwise.So, while I can forgive Edwards for not spoiling us with an abundance of creature battles, I can't forgive him for his casting and direction. GODZILLA puts us in the perspective of Ford Brody, an explosives expert with the American military played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I know Taylor-Johnson has got skill. He was great in KICK- ASS and NOWHERE BOY. But here, he's the most wooden, uninteresting character I have seen in a film in a long, long time. He never quite emotes, speaking all his lines very quietly without much of any sort of inflection. I think the only emotion he displayed the entire time was mild irritation. He was dull and, since he's our ""main character"", every sequence that wasn't Godzilla or MUTOs tearing through society suffered. Elizabeth Olsen, another talented young star, is similarly wasted on the other end of the spectrum. She spends most of the time crying or panicking. If we were going to spend an entire movie following a character through this fantastical crisis, it should've been Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) or Ford's father Joe (Bryan Cranston). Oh, and don't expect much Joe. Despite being prominently displayed in pretty much every trailer or TV spot, Cranston actually has less screen time than Godzilla. Not cool, Warner/Legendary. Not cool. GODZILLA is a nice blend of elements from both the original, more subtle GOJIRA and the city-smashing monster battles of Toho's later films. It's flawed and its human characters are its weakest bit. But you can't argue with the presentation of Japan's most famous monsterthe design and CG are amazing and his final battle with the MUTOs, while short, is awesome. I might be in the minority but I didn't hate this movie and I find I enjoy it a little more each time I watch it. Manage your expectations and you should find something to enjoy about the 2014 resurrection of the legend: GODZILLA.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The new American remake of Godzilla tries to honor these two sides: it is much more dramatic and serious than ""Circle of Fire"", for example, but it still offers the rewards cathartics that fans of tokusatsu (""special effects film"") expect. After the character's first original appearances, we noticed that the character stopped being treated as an uncontrollable and unbeatable threat, to assume, under standards that we can better understand, a post of ""anti-hero""; a kind of natural protector, from the monstrous balance of nature to changes in the pattern of terrestrial fauna. Considering the conceptual root for the creation of the Atomic Lizard in the final stretch of World War II, it is impossible to dissociate the many meanings of this genesis for any other post-1954 kaiju production.Based on the Japanese film of the eponymous character and a reboot of the Godzilla / Gojira franchise. This is the second film about Godzilla made by an American studio, the first being the film from 1998. The film recounts the origin of Godzilla today as a ""terrible force of nature"", this new version opens the so-called MonsterVerse, a monster movie franchise that also includes its sequels ""Godzilla II: King of the Monsters"" and Godzilla Vs. Kong, which is due to premiere in 2021 and serves as both ""King of the Monsters"" and the 2017 movie ""Kong"": Skull Island "", also part of the franchise.Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) raised his son alone after the death of his wife (Juliette Binoche) in an accident at the nuclear plant where they both worked in Japan. He never accepted the catastrophe and fifteen years later he continues to mull over what happened, trying to find something. explanation. Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), now an adult, is a US Army soldier and desperately needs to fight desperately to save the world population - and especially his family - from the gigantic, unshakable and incredibly frightening monster Godzilla.From his first feature, Monsters, director Gareth Edwards brings his knowledge in visual effects to imagine a world where the passage of giant creatures, while causing disasters, does not seem spectacular: they are monsters different from those of alien behavior or cornered like that of Cloverfield; here they treat the land as their habitat, and the environment is shaped by them. It remains for humans to conform. In this reinterpretation of 2014, written by Max Borenstein (based on a story by Dave Callaham) we have the basic homework already included in the opening credits, a smart choice of direction to fix in the viewer's head the natural relationship that this animal has with the planet and how much the Atomic Age created, awakened or increased the destructive potential that nature keeps hidden somewhere. Legendary Pictures' ambitious production, together with Warner Bros., makes this second version an exciting journey of survival and attempted natural balance. There is hopelessness inherent in this condition, and it is from there that the film elaborates its sense of gravity and drama. It is as if humanity has always been doomed to be lost.
Superhero, monsters and catastrophes films are self-explanatory. And Godzilla fits perfectly into the last two categories. Except for details that differentiate the plot, even slightly, Godzilla films must have the giant lizard invading cities and causing destruction. And this is no exception. However, the story is conducted in such a way as not to offend the viewer's intelligence. Are there clichés? Logical. In fact, how to escape them in a film of the genre? Are there half-hearted scientific justifications that could not resist a more demanding sieve? No doubt. But, let's face it, in a monster movie, who in their right mind is concerned with the legitimacy of explanations? Whoever goes to the cinema to see Gojira basically wants only two things: a monster that is big enough to be very, very afraid, even if we are safe in the chair; and a lot of destruction caused by the monster. And if there is a fight between monsters even better.With a new vision of the franchise in this ""Godzilla"" in hand, filmmaker Gareth Edwards tried to pay homage to the various visions given to the character over the years, not only in the persona of the creature shown on the scene, but also in the narrative itself. It is a pity that this tribute ends up taking itself too seriously, although it is this same seriousness that ends up sustaining the efficient first act of the projection. Interestingly, the script manages to keep our attention by the simple criterion of growing threat. The soundtrack draws attention to the epic, the danger, the horror and the editing and mixing of sound create the necessary environment to leave us terrified, waiting for more disasters. Not only does Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack somewhat resemble that of John Williams at times, but the sound design also stands out by avoiding punctuating all scenes with the soundtrack, making great use of silence (a dramatic feature that is unfortunately underused, especially in blockbusters). Creating the necessary tension to amplify Godzilla's triumphant appearance.
Throughout the projection, we see that Edwards and Borenstein try to combine the buzzwords of catastrophe films with those of Japanese kaijuu features, playing clearly to the audience with the elements of the latter. The problem is that there is not a perfect mix between these ingredients, which ends up swelling the production a little, especially with the excess of characters' characteristic of the two genres that appear during the projection, which are either little developed or suddenly abandoned, being this especially true in female roles, with Elizabeth Olsen and Sally Hawkins criminally wasted on screen. When Bryan Cranston, the common man who becomes obsessed with tragedy, is left out, his place as a provider of scientific dialogues is taken over by Ken Watanabe, who is the chief scientist at Monarch. In this, the human scenes end up centered on Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is not exactly a well of charisma when compared to Cranston, Watanabe or Godzilla, the real gimmick of the project.While the action sequences starring Johnson fall into clichés, those that focus on monsters always call attention to creativity, which ends up frustrating the public even more with the filmmakers' insistence on turning their attention to Ford, who should have taken on a supporting role in the narrative after the introduction of Godzilla, but ends up participating in some scenes that could easily be omitted without creating prejudice with the audience's identification with the human. There is no mistake in the monster's appearance taking an hour to happen. The slip is in not delivering to him, from this point on, the role of protagonist of the tape, especially considering the direction that the story takes. The cuts of some of the clashes between the creatures during the second act end up irritating instead of generating expectations for the climax of the tape. The film's redemption is in its third act, when finally, the current generation begins to understand why Godzilla has not lost his majesty. Even with the monster's heavy movement referring to the movements of the old films of Ishirô Honda, when he was lived by an actor in a rubber suit, he shows himself threatening and wild, executing his classic blows while attacking his equally monstrous and gigantic enemies, with one of them, winged, alluding to Mothra, one of Godzilla's classic opponents.And let's face it, the text's treatment of MUTOs is very good. The kaiju have a rule regarding this type of extra appearance, so there is nothing new or bad treatment of the animals in the film, nothing that we have not seen in the first three interactions of Godzilla with other creatures, namely, in the fights against Anguirus in Godzilla Attacks Again (1955); against the iconic gorilla in King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and against the cutest and deadliest moth on Earth in Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964). Thus, when the plot points to a clash between the monsters and not a fight essentially against humanity, the work, which was already quite divided, breaks down completely. The human side loses any impact on the viewer and our attention turns only to what really matters, to what is very well treated here: Godzilla hunting and, in the end, facing the MUTOs.It was really to be expected a dark and pessimistic tone, dark photography and real touches, without comic relief as a monster movie should be. In this respect, Godzilla fulfilled its goal: a technically perfect production, whether in effects or in camera settings, without that Cloverfield hustle and bustle. He also scores points for his dramatic and violent style, for the competent cast and, mainly, for the social criticism related to the current world, different from the fears of the 50s: ""The arrogance of Man is in thinking that he has control of Nature... and not contrary. "", In the words of Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, a character present in the original film. The result of all this effort could only be satisfactory. Perhaps Godzilla could achieve higher marks if the icon appeared more often, without so much drama and with more horror scenes, but, in any case, the monster lived up to expectations and was well represented for 21st century viewers.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Godzilla required him to deliver a few scenes that were more serious and emotional and he simply couldn't do it. Making his lack of acting chops even more apparent was the incredible acting of Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. The other fail in the film was that they tried to artificially manufacture drama in order to add intrigue. All those things did was take away from the film. Honestly, I feel that this movie would've been so much better if it was about 30 minutes shorter.

However, this was a pleasant surprise and I understood that much of it was misunderstood and under appreciated simply because people went into this movie expecting Kaiju battles from start to bottom, but that simply does not work in a movie that is meant to be a reimagination of an iconic character, you need to establish the universe.First of all let's get the obvious praise out of the way , as someone who has gone and seen all the legendary produced Godzilla films, this one has by far the best acting. Bryan Cranston for the first half of the show absolutely carries everything, his iconic interrogation scene is in my opinion the best piece of acting we have seen in the legendary Monsterverse, obviously not including any of the Japanese films.Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a decent job, but he can be a bit unreactive at time, which I think is this movies biggest weak point, with better direction he might have been able to appear more sincere. Other then that the plot is solid, none of it seems that ridicules if you accept that monsters do exist in this universe and how nations would react to it.The cinematography however is a masterclass by Seamus McGarvey, who in my opinion gives up some of the best shots in the entire Monsterverse. The iconic drop scene is easily one of the most stunning scenes you will ever see. Godzilla is also presented in a very mysterious and almost god like way, seen through light flares, smoke, water and other elements for most of the movies. A LOT of people see this as a negative, NOT enough Godzilla they scream, but what other legendary movie manages to actually make the moments count for monsters to this degree? Compare this to King of the monsters, which while has a lot more screentime for the monsters, is nowhere near as good in presentation and completely fails to make you feel the impact and weight of these massive fictional creatures.In conclusion, Godzilla 2014 is incredibly underappreciated and you should not be persuaded by negative reviews, it is WORTH A WATCH.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't hate this movie, it is watchable, but don't watch pacific rim and think you are going to get more of the same, the flip side is if you hated pacific rim you may like this.on another note this movie is leaps and bounds above the previous godzilla film and there are signs the filmmakers are fans of godzilla (atomic breath is awesome)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I loved it and even though the actors could have been a little better it was still a one of a kind of movie. Oh and Godzilla you look great I love the new face structure which is different from the older movies. I think they should start bringing more older monsters into the series because everyone wants more Godzilla and if you don't go watch that B rated movie the Purge and have good dreams. Also, Godzilla fans, I liked the rock em sock em robots in Pacific Rim even though only one actually could fight all the monsters. Yea, so we held the lines for years with our robot and lost in one fight with a CAT 4 monster. Anyway, the monsters were perfect villains for future Godzilla movies, just saying if any producers, screenwriters and directors pretty much the entire staff is listening right now. Well, it was great I will be buying the movie and trying to find a Godzilla costume to add to my collection of Godzilla memorabilia. Godzilla over Superman any day of the week, ha-ha, later.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Recalling back to the pre-internet, before DVD - even before VHS, days..you had to meticulously comb your local ""TV guide"" for a chance to see once of these late night or early morning weekends.Now over all I found it pretty entertaining, but had a lot of holes in it where it probably could have been much better.First the movie sort felt like it took it self too seriously. Maybe the idea here was to capture the essence of 1956 (USA) version. Where you are sort of a bystander to the story, seeing it from a third-person point of view.To it's credit it captured other parts of the spirit of the movies like where the in the progression of the originals Godzilla is the hero. Also the acting and choice of actors was well, except I don't feel Ken Watanabe was the best role for a ""Dr. Serizawa"". In the original Serizawa hard this dark, sort of maniacal edge to him. After all he was some sort of scientific genius, and thus would be geeky/nerdy, with that weird edge you would expect.Where I think the movie ultimately fails to it's potential was too much of this third-person view. In all of the Godzilla movies I've seen (most if not all of them) more of the focus was on the fights and interactions of monsters. It was one of the thrilling parts. Even being limited by the SFX technology of the time (rubber suits, detailed miniatures, etc.) one of the more interesting aspects. In this movie very downplayed.Also part of the Godzilla experience was about character. You could see Godzilla had this personality, human like emotions, etc. He showed intelligence other then say just animalistic. Severally lacking in this movie.Finally another classic part of the formula this movie misses out on is Godzilla's interaction and affinity for children. In some of the movies you would see a young (in the 8 to 12 year old range) boy talk with and be be bonded buddies. It connected this kind of special understanding, sincerity, and innocence of the child's point of view. A connecting of fantasy and reality and adding more of a personal/human touch.As I write this I feel more and more that the creator's vision of this movie was fairly out of tune with what is/was really great about Godzilla. As if they should have studied more and could have consulted fans of the originals for advice, etc..In the end is was entertaining and worth watching!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance – boy, what an impact he had. Now, that was 40 years ago – but would it be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer?As it turns out, it's not quite possible; at least not as far as this latest version of 'Godzilla' is concerned - but that's probably not for lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards' part. The young director ('Monsters') has stated many times that 'Jaws' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in 'Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's masterpiece (they're both called Brody). Edwards made it very clear that he wanted to take an ""old school"" approach – and as far as the beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets).The ""muto"" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature – is otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and although there is one great creature scene after another, and although those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards the inevitable showdown, it's hard to stay invested in the human side of the story. After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it's hard to feel thrilled. Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since you only just met the guy, you don't feel too much attached.Ultimately – despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale – 'Godzilla' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in 'Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago. Trying to show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way seventies cinema did – you also need the kind of character-driven scenes where someone says: ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!""","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

One of the only reasons I gave it a 6 was because the film looked great and the animations of Godzilla were great and I loved Bryan Cranston being in it since I love Breaking Bad. It think I was being generous giving it a 6. Other than Bryan Cranston the acting was a bit cheesy and made me laugh at some points. The movie never really pulled me in. I found myself reaching for the remote to change to a different movie after the first quarter of the movie. It was kind of boring and nothing really exciting happened. Even if something happened at the very end that was exiting it wasn't good enough to keep me watching it that long.

The bass and LFE is so OVER THE PLACE that you can't recognize an explosion from a character walking from a monster screaming... it's all LOUD LOUD LOUD, it's so LOUD that you either cover your ears or throw up. Hint to audio mixer guy: if you put a loud bass to everything you saturate the spectrum, you will loose the shock value and just irritate the viewer.2- Script: I really don't know why in this world a director will put such good actors to such lame roles, they don't have anything meaningful to say, they just go on about a ""plan to destroy the monsters"" and they go on an on forever.. without ANY character development.3- Directing: Important parts relegated as non-important, totally unimportant parts taking the front seat in filming. Hint to director: Godzilla fights ARE the main attraction for watching this movie, if you give us 10 seconds of fight and you then put Godzilla onto the background and blurry it out to show 20 minutes of an imbecile trying to device a plan on how to stop Godzilla you should be bound be hated by the viewers. We wanted to SEE GODZILLA not half the movie wasted on stupid military tactics that amounts to ZERO in the movie.4-Common Sense: Anything that common sense dictates is not present in this movie, the amount of situations in which the characters are trying to resolve it in the worst possible way, and I mean a way which you will scream at the screen ""are you THAT STUPID?"" are excessive. Nothing fits, it's like the director gone straight from the education center to his first movie, he don't have the slightest clue on how to properly do a movie.5- Shock Value: When the best scare in the whole movie is a group of pigeons impacting a BUS window (I am NOT joking) you know something gone terrible wrong in the process..Conclusion: When you're watching the movie with your little kids and your 6 years old girl says out loud ""What is this crap??! I wanna see Godzilla!"" you know you're watching a piece crap. (Specially when they loved the previous one).The previous Godzilla was bad, but if you measure this to the older one you need to completely redesign a set of values in which this movie will be bad and the previous one awesome and this is plain disgusting because this Godzilla looks amazing, but somehow, the director didn't saw appropriate to gives us more of this one and less of the military.This is the WORST monster movie you will ever see in your life. Big Ass Spiders! is a lot more fun than this and that was a B-Movie filmed as a B-Movie and the actors were laughing through the movie!.","22 out of 41 found this helpful.

I agree with the first complaint, badly scripted and acted, bad even by comparison to Marvel's similar stuff. I take a different tack on the other complaint, not much lizzard time. There's more behind the decision. The idea was to give us the usual Godzilla movie of destruction where a giant creature stomps around but through the eyes of people who run to and from it, as shifting glimpses of unfathomable beings tearing at the skies.One clear example of this choreography begins with the discovery of the Russian sub on the island. We get no more than a vague first glimpse of Godzilla's hulk swimming underneath a ship, rushing to battle, followed by another vague reveal of only bits of a larger creature to the reddish light of cascading flares, a majestic unveiling seen by an audience of onlookers.Then a child's pov from inside the stopped train as lights come back on, popping up one by one in the cordon of tracks, guiding our eye to the monster, another unveiling here. The train drawn towards the monster as if by the urge to see. All this prefigures the first encounter between Godzilla and monster; a first battle which we only catch glimpses of as news footage on TV as another child is dozing off on a couch, again teasing us with postponement.You'll see again and again this choreographed pattern of withthold and unveil; humorously in the destruction of Vegas, more ordinary actionlike in the night bridge scene.A superb moment that encapsulates the approach has a special ops team parachute down on the city from a plane, they have to do a plot thing about a bomb, no matter. A beautiful shot at the edge of the atmosphere as planedoors open, then as they fall, a first-person parachutist's view of the two monsters fighting among skyscrapers unfurls across the screen, a majestic glimpse of the larger event stolen on the way down.How can anyone say there's no creativity here? It's what we came to see all along, monsters, only given to us in this more dynamic way, as ribbons of perception fluttering in the turbulence of spectacle.I don't think a great filmmaker was stifled here by the blandness of what he signed to, but he may be a technician to watch. Watch this. It's pure Gothic horror reinvented by the eye.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

And what a great 5* film Jaws was! Godzilla on the other hand It's not as if the film is absolutely terrible. As an example of the genre of dumb-arsed, popcorn-munching summer blockbusters, it has its diverting moments. Certainly if you get turned on my giant dinosaurs fighting each other and smashing up San Francisco, this is definitely the film for you. But it's not going to set the awards season alight, in just about any category as far as I can see.It starts promisingly enough, with a Jurassic Park-style helicopter ride over lush Philippine jungle to a Raiders of the Lost Ark-style dig where some Alien-style eggs have been discovered. So far, so plagerised. The ever reliable Ken Watanabe (probably hired solely for the way he pronounces ""Godzilla"") plays the investigating scientist with his rather unlikely side-kick Sally Hawkins ('Blue Jasmine').The action then moves to one of the best segments of the film in Japan where nuclear plant boss Brody (Snr), played by Malcolm in the Middle / Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, has to contend with the tragic consequences of what has been disturbed.We then skip 15 years forwards to where explosives expert Ford Brody (Jnr) (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of Kick-Ass fame) has to leave his young family in San Francisco to fly to Japan to bail out his dad from jail. (Yes, I couldn't work that one out either doesn't Japan do Paypal?). The basic premise here is that Godzilla is the good guy in the picture (even though the Americans seem to want to try and shoot him at every opportunity) helping to ""restore balance"" to the prehistoric world by defeating the horny preying-mantis-like monsters (aka MUTOs) before they can have rumpy-pumpy and make thousands of other preying-mantis like monsters, so returning ""man to the stone age"". Much mayhem and destruction naturally follows, showing once again (""Man of Steel"", ""Avengers Assemble"", etc, etc) that the US economic recovery is based solely on jobs for builders, decorators and glaziers.In the acting stakes, Taylor-Johnson is very good (channelling a brooding Jake Gyllenhaal look) but Cranston seems rather over the top. It is also a very sexist films, with the female leads being given scandalously little to do: Elizabeth Olsen (looking wonderfully un-skinny and gorgeous in a non-Hollywood sort of way) is confined to running and screaming and the wonderful Sally Hawkins has even less to do, confined to being Watanabe's bag-carrier for the majority of the film.Where I could get very critical is in the nonsensical story. Leaving aside the scientific problems I have with ""radioactive levels reducing"" due to ""catalysation"" (whatever that means), the story plays fast and loose with the concept of the MUTOs feeding on radioactive materials. In one scene, a MUTO leaves the main US stockpile of radioactive waste voluntarily, but is supposed to be 'lured out to sea' by a single nuclear warhead. Like, WHAT? And why the US army would try to transport said 'bait' through the enemy territory by train rather than fly it out is bizarre. The story is also strong on Watanabe's claim that letting Godzilla duke it out with the MUTOs is the way forwards, and yet there are at least two occasions when Godzilla and one or more of the MUTOs are together, and yet nothing seems to come of that confrontation. The story just moves on to another pursuit of monster vs monster. Like, WHAT? Very unsatisfactory.In other departments, the special effects are passable if not outstanding, but there are some memorably cinematic scenes: notably the free-fall parachuting into San Francisco set to Ligeti's music (as used in 2001: A Space Odyssey), which is impressive. And the rest of the music by the omnipresent Alexandre Duplat is also noteworthy (no pun intended). Relative newcomer Gareth Edwards directs, and clearly made an impact as Disney have just given him a Star Wars spin-off film to direct.A decent early salvo for the summer blockbuster season, but (unlike Godzilla and the MUTOs), unlikely to set the world alight.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bobmann447.wordpress.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!)","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Their previous GODZILLA film, made in 1998, was absolutely execrable. The director of this new version was Gareth Edwards, who previously made the low budget MONSTERS, which I wasn't too keen on. And as a massive fan of the various Japanese film series, how could the Americans possibly hope to do the subject justice? The answer is that they don't, at least not really. Only in the last half an hour of the film does this become a GODZILLA film properly; until that point, it feels more like MONSTERS 2. Edwards obviously has a passion for huge-sized beasties, but as a film-maker he leaves me cold. Much of the running time here consists of following around an absolutely dull, one-dimensional American family who have little to do with the actual big events of the film.Thus we get Bryan Cranston grieving his wife, Elizabeth Olsen randomly working in a hospital, and an annoying kid lurking around. The worst of the lot is the erstwhile lead, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (KICK ASS) who gives the singularly most wooden performance I've seen in a while. What a poor choice of actor for the lead role, and what a pointless role to begin with anyway. Ken Watanabe is considerably better, but under used in a show of tokenism.As for Godzilla, he has a couple of beetle-like enemies to contend with here, and the creations are larger than ever. Inevitably CGI is used to animate the monsters and the result is visually impressive; enough money has gone into it to make this a dark and brooding visual experience. As I said before, though, it's only in the action of the last half hour that this starts feeling truly like a Japanese GODZILLA film, which is what I was hoping for the whole time. You could excise the whole, somewhat pointless, first hour and a half and still get the same result.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

The second half of the film is great. It is beat for beat enjoyable vices of fan service and character development so contrived you could throw a grappling hook up and over it. The film was undeniably inspired by the post-modern Cloverfield spectacle only they did their own thing with it. Ironically Cloverfield was inspired by Godzilla. I love every kind of Kaiju film including the ones derivative. This film focuses so heavily on the human characters that our Kaiju on the menu serve more as runway-models on a catwalk than they do as a brooding dynamic. The scenes are fleeting but mostly enjoyable however the CGI has not aged too well but I noticed that the first time around too after watching many years later. This film struggles to flaunt it's own identity, and when it does it is small glimpses in the muddled chaos. It tries to tip it's hat to so many motifs that it never breathes. I love this series but it can only improve. Good start to a modern Kaiju effort. Looking forward to GodzillaVSKong.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Then I found out that Edwards was directing the film. I had already seen 'Monsters' with my fiancé and both of us decided that for a movie neither of us heard of before and for a Netflix movie. It was pretty fantastic. So I allowed myself some room for hope. (1998 made me believe I would never see my Godzilla dreams realized). Bit by bit, I kept hearing snippets come out that Edwards was bringing it back, old school style. My levels for hope kept rising. Then the Halo jump trailer came out and I was sold. For me, I know who Godzilla is, I know what he does. I wanted more. Then the Asia trailer came out, and I was hooked. Everything had a retro feel but darker more original. So I did what any self respecting fan did. I shut myself away from any news about this movie. Then one trip to cost-co gave me an offer I could not refuse. Gojira, the original Gojira sold with the bastardized American version, Godzilla raids again and Godzilla vs Mothra for 12 bucks. I couldn't resist. So for the first time ever, I watched the original Japanese Gojira in all of its amazing glory. The helplessness, the fear, the slow realization of hopelessness. The sacrifice. Everything. It was just perfect. Now onto the movie.The movie sets up really quickly. It brings it so that Gojira is the actual starting off point. Godzilla dies in Gojira but here is the bigger badder one. Everybody is doing what they can to kill Godzilla. In the first 10 min, they explain what I already knew. Godzilla exists and we just cannot kill him. My first thought was fantastic, we are not wasting any time going over him coming out of the water again. We all know, that is what he does. This about what he does next. Next introducing the characters, we meet Bryan who in character cannot be there for his son. He is too busy doing his civic duty at a Nuclear Power Plant, He is so busy that he never realizes that it was his birthday. The son is left feeling disappointed goes to school and unknowingly witnesses the death of this Mother. Turns out a MUTO who has a fondness for Nuclear Energy destroyed the plant. 15 years later, the kid who has been put off to the side by his dad, due to the dads conspiracy theories and lost his mother (essentially left alone) has to get his father out of jail for trying to break into the quarantined area of the broke down power plant. The son is a soldier, which explains his actions throughout the rest of the film. Dad convinces son to go on a trip to the quarantined zone where they successfully break in, and witness the birth of a MUTO. All chaos ensues and Dad ultimately dies, before his death, Dad tells son to go be with his son. Something the dad had never been able to do. And thus, I sit there with a man tear in my right eye. Realizing that this is what the story is. A man trying to get home to his son. I can relate to that. I would do that for my son. The helplessness conveyed in Gojira, is showcased here. Give a soldier a directive and he will do his best to achieve it. Meanwhile Godzilla is down for whatever the MUTO's bring. Godzilla is an Alpha animal that will stop at nothing from being the top dog and for the first time in 50 years, he is presented ""prey"". So he stalks and attacks the MUTO's any chance he can get. I personally loved the wait. I personally loved the focus on the MUTO's. When they screamed, I felt it deep inside my body. The suspense left me white knuckled, and wanting more. When finally allowed to witness Godzilla in all of his awesome glory, I ate in every scene. When it came to the final battle The son, doing his best to make sure he will be able to see his son again. Godzilla doing his best to make sure he is Alpha and the MUTO's doing their best to ensure their survival. It was amazing. When Godzilla got angry (and he did) you felt it. The minute long roar that felt like an eternity left you exhausted. When Godzillas fins started lighting up like as if the depths of hades fury were about to be unleashed (if only for a second), I let out a whispered ""heck yes"". When Godzilla tail whipped a MUTO, while bringing down a MUTO, I winched. When the Female MUTO screamed at the sight of her babies being burned alive, you felt her pain. When Godzilla ended her, you felt his anger and you felt even for a second, that even though this is a complete fantasy made up ridiculous story that if you were Godzilla, you would have kept it going, just like he did, breathing radiation breath down her throat way longer than necessary. I experienced another man tear at the end of the movie. When the son is finally reunited with his own son. That moment was very real to me. The main character went through hell. But he was able to fulfill his mission. He saved his family and 'came home'. #2 greatest Godzilla movie only behind Gojira. Even 60 years later, you should not expect a greater one. This one never tried to out class the original, it merely did its very best to live up to that standard. And it succeeded in almost every way possible.","30 out of 53 found this helpful.

The king of monsters, in a grandiose film, full of nostalgic sentiment, returns with deserving in an epic proportion. There were high expectations for the remake of the new Godzilla, the monster that 50 years ago gained incredible recognition within the cinematographic world. The mission that many considered impossible to bring back the true essence of Godzilla, fell into the hands of the almost inexperienced Gareth Edwards, who brings fans a film that recalls the original merging with techniques that the current cinema offers. The film, which this time features a human drama within the script, creates the prospect of viewing on all sides the consequences caused by Godzilla and the battle of monsters across the city. When a suspicious accident happened at the nuclear plant where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) worked, leading to the death of his wife, doubts were created as to what could cause such destruction. 15 years after the events, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Joe's son and now an adult, is the lieutenant of the American army and needs to take care of his father, who has answers about what happened, but who is not taken seriously. Gareth Edwards is a consistent fan service to Hollywood cinema today, the director creates in moments of tension, anxiety about the viewer and the right moment to release that relief of satisfaction. The script that gradually releases details about the monster and gathers aspects to keep the best in the end, leaves everyone's expectations high and does not disappoint when it delivers the promised action, on the contrary, while puffing out the chest and in the roar of Godzilla, the thrill of contemplating that is terrifyingly incredible. Perhaps it is not wrong to say that on some occasions the film appeals to the apathetic doomsday feeling as seen in many apocalyptic-themed productions, however, what Edwards relates to what humans are able to do when everything is up for grabs. water below - technologies that no longer work, nuclear bombs capable of decimating the entire city and natural disasters ready to start - reflects what it is like to be prepared for adverse situations. The director uses his techniques similar to the interesting one, Monsters, to bring together human drama and all the visual dazzle in high proportions, using techniques for positioning the cameras and the aid of the soundtrack directly affecting the viewing of the film, which at a certain moment determines Godzilla with Ford Brody, like the heroes you're rooting for. Godzilla happily delivers a visually exuberant and terrifying film in the battle of the monsters. A true film that teaches many how to cause destruction in an entire city, without the need for mind-boggling action at all times.Film seen on February 20, 2021.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

One of the BIG complaints that A LOT of people have with these films is the lack of compelling characters, motivation, and growth. I will say that in this film the introduction to these characters were surprisingly solid. But when the film continues after that, it never reaches any real emotional and real character moments.Aaron Taylor Johnson while he does the best he could plays his character kind of flat, and sadly so one else is there to help carry the movie with him. Elizabeth Olsen while her parts as playing a mother were good, I wish she was in this movie more. Bryan Cranston while he plays his part as a father well, he wasn't the true lead, and he should've been.When the movie lacks in character moments, it usually has really exciting monster action. I'm gonna be honest though, I'd expect something better. The problem was that a good portion of the monster action takes place off screen, or the action takes place in the dark, which really doesn't do any favors for this movie. I don't understand the creative choice for keeping the fights in pitch black most of the time.The best thing I can say that when you do get to see Godzilla in his full glory in the day, I'm impressed with his creature design. You get a sense of the Power behind every step he makes, and his roar in my opinion is so iconic.In the long run, I don't hate this movie. I think it is watchable, but if I have to be completely honest, I was expecting more. The best description that I would have for this movie is being a blank slate for how to do a Monster movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Believe it or not, it's true. The King of Monsters is ultra famous, an icon of epic proportions loved and revered by many. Yes, the big guy is back big time in Gareth Edwards' updated reincarnation of the super beast, aptly titled Godzilla.There have been many versions of this reptilian wonder, over thirty sequels since the first successful film in 1954. As a child, I watched that original Godzilla movie on my black & white Zenith TV in awe. I remember going to the movie theater with my buddies and seeing him fight the likes of King Kong, Mothra, and Ghidorah back in the early sixties. I enjoyed the rampaging of Tokyo as the creature lumbered his way across the miniature city models, shrieking and wailing as he gracelessly stomped the citizens and architecture of Japan. No, I didn't get the anti-nuclear message then, nor did I even care as a teenager. It was a group event, a monster movie, badly acted and even worse, badly dubbed, where you could root for the monster and take in all the destruction on the big screen. It was totally cool and mindless fun. This new and improved 2014 version is that too and more. (I also saw the most recent American remake by Roland Emmerich in 1998 which was ravaged by the critics and I didn't love that film, but I didn't hate it that much either.)Godzilla (2014) is a different creature entirely, more refined than crass, a monster with a mission. Even the creature's look and movements are streamlined and adroit. The film also brings in top name stars to add some prestige to the project, trying valiantly to remove the schlock and deliver the shock: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, Elizabeth Olsen, and David Strathairn are here, albeit in minor roles. (There are also many monsters-in- combat scenes, but actually, the most frightening creature in the whole film is Cranston's hideous wig which tends to upstage everyone including the main star of the film. No, not Mr. Cranston, I mean Mr. G. himself! And yes, no doubt, I will be having many restless nights from the recurring nightmares caused by that toupee.) Nevertheless, these actors' presence is felt as the director and the writers weave a more personal story into the mayhem, still paying homage to the creature and its radioactive origins. Besides Godzilla, this reboot focuses on two human characters who fight the monster and their own personal demons: Aaron Taylor- Johnson is Ford Brody, a soldier with an itchy trigger finger and Ken Watanabe is Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, an earnest scientist who views Godzilla in a savior rather than destroyer. The sub-plot is slim and formulaic, but both actors do a solid job of conveying the film's preachy message about man's foolhardy attempt in controlling nuclear power. Much time, perhaps too much time, is spend on the human back-stories and the interrelationship of the film's non-reptilian characters prior to Godzilla's entrance. (The creature doesn't even surface until an hour into the film.)Still, as always, it's the action sequences that matter most. These creatures get around as the film globe-trots from China and Hawaii and California and Nevada, specifically Las Vegas (well, they are high-rollers), to where else but that iconic landmark of monster movies, the Golden Gate Bridge, for a climactic smack-down. This Godzilla uses state-of-the-art visuals to keep interest high. (The tsunami sequence is thrilling.) The CGI work is very impressive. However, the 3-D effects scattered throughout the movie don't really amount to much and the MUTO monsters (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), lack real menace or originality and are inspired too closely from Aliens, Starship Troopers, and Transformers. Production values are strong, especially Seamus McGarvey's imaginative cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's dramatic musical score which helps to contribute to the film's success. As the director, Edwards' unique vision incorporates shadows, aerial perspectives, and clever point of views via masks and goggles to bring some needed tension. He efficiently shoots the film with a minimum of story and a maximum of tightly staged battles, keeping the action at the forefront and making Godzilla (2014) an unexpected guilty pleasure. This film will do serious damage at the box office with, I'm sure, another sequel in the near future. Godzilla lives on! GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: The opening credits are particularly well done, with a montage of 1950's archival footage of nuclear bombings and redacted text highlighting the cast and filmmakers. It helps to set the right tone for a more serious monster film right from the start.","46 out of 87 found this helpful.

This movie of course isn't a masterpiece, but has the merit of extablishing a good tone for the sequels, and FINALLY presenting us Godzilla for what he really is. Godzilla is not evil, nor good, hes simply a force of nature. In the 98's movie, I felt really bad, Godzilla was depicted as a poor creature who get's killed by the humans, indeed I had the feeling that humans in that movie were the real evil, suppressing an animal who only tried to survive. I felt really sorry, it was like destroing a legend. This time however, is finally showed the real Godzilla, not good, not evil, simply above human perception of existence. Of course, in this movie there are some bad things too, some inconsistencies and contraddictions, some things seems conveniently too simple, like the main character living with his family in the very same place where in the end the action take place and where the monsters arrives from across the globe... But, whatever.. In the end I think this movie has more good things than bad, a great photograpy, a good script and a evocative soundtrack..","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That's a stark contrast to the 1998 movie where Godzilla's first appearance was MUCH earlier in the film.The last 30minutes of the movie though is where all the action is at... It features a cool battle between the monsters and eventhough Godzilla takes a lot of unnecessary damage, the battle is still fun and believable.The entire movie is honestly worth a watch. I however would NOT recommend that you watch the 2019 atrocious movie titled ""Godzilla King of Monsters"" as that movie is quite horrible. Anyway, this movie get a 7/10 for an overall movie, and 8/10 if you compare it to other monster-movies.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

To completely forget that awful remake, it goes back to the classic design of the monster, takes a more atmospheric tone, and stripping off the worst parts (mostly the bad humor) of the abomination. The achievement here is rather astounding. It's not the typical type of action movie that most of the time shoves the large scale destruction to the audience. It instead prioritizes the tension which becomes a totally breathtaking experience. Though, there are parts of the story that deserve a little more exploration to make it an ultimately compelling blockbuster, but then it's already compelling when it features the terror and the largeness of this awesome monster.It didn't took that long for it to impress the audience. The first act is already a perfect movie. It focuses on a character with a real grief towards the situation. Even more interesting, there is a sociopolitical theme hidden behind the mission which makes an intriguing piece of commentary. But when it hits to the next act, it somehow abandons it and finally rises to the more bombastic points of the story. What comes afterwards follows a character who has a less interesting plight. The lead character, Ford, may have a pretty basic arc, but it wasn't nearly as compelling as his father's. Maybe if he had a solid one, it might have distracted the disasters going on and that is probably true. This movie is all about the monster, and the human element already lies on their scale and fear. The beginning is just a missed opportunity of something more. Otherwise, it's still an engrossing experience.The film would have been a straightforward explosive extravaganza, but the direction decided to be much challenging. There is an obvious inspiration to ""Jaws"" and even to another giant monster movie ""Cloverfield"" (when it comes to politics). The film does have action, but displaying them aren't the only key to excite the viewers. In fact, the destruction often goes straight to the aftermath. People might feel that they're missing too much mayhem, but actually they're not. The mysteries actually make the threat much larger. Because it's not about how the cities get wrecked, it's more about acknowledging how absolutely formidable these creatures are. The camera also keeps giving tremendous shots of which compares between the scale of a normal human being to the monster.The character development can still be complained at some point. Thankfully, the acting is splendid. Aaron Taylor-Johnson ends up being the weakest among. I'm not sure if it's his fault, the character is not well developed, but he could have improved and filled the gaps of the supposedly heroic Ford Brody. In contrast, Bryan Cranston is simply terrific in every single scene he is in that one would wish he could have been the main character of the entire film. The rest of the cast surpassed the script and somewhat elevated their characters.The message is quite clear, Hollywood has learned their lesson. The rest of the drama may not justify the powerful first act, but the film finally succeeds at portraying the Godzilla everyone deserves. It's just full of love, not only to the original, but also to the genre. Other than the behemoth sized set pieces, the film takes plenty of remarkable inspirations from several creature horror movies, from Spielberg's to Reeves'. Even with all the intriguing politics and gravity, the King of the Monsters still stands as the landmark of the whole film. Godzilla is just amazing for reliving the original spirit of this genre.","42 out of 81 found this helpful.

But I was really, really disappointed in the 1998 remake. It was not true to the original Godzilla legend. The 1998 Godzilla was a coward who ran from the military. This one does it all. This Godzilla Dominates, as Godzilla was meant to do. When Godzilla finally awakens and fills the screen, he lets out an awesome theater wall shaking roar that makes it clear it is ""game on."" I gave this a 10, not because it was a perfect movie. The human interest stuff was not very effective. I gave it a 10 because Godzilla and his monster foes were truly awesome on a grand scale.I saw it in IMAX 3D, but I am not sure either is necessary (IMAX or 3D). But I think if you wait to see it on DVD or streaming at home, you will definitely miss a lot of the overwhelming spectacle, unless you have a huge screen and professional level theater sound system at home and turn up the volume. But this movie would still be great in 2D at a commercial theater with a decent sound system and large screen.One comment: disappointed they couldn't use Blue Oyster Cult's ""Godzilla"" in the movie somewhere. Probably something to do with too much money for the music rights or something, but I do not know. Maybe they just chose not to use it.Overall: Great Movie. See it in the theater, even 2D would be awesome.","42 out of 81 found this helpful.

My only quibble with this was that it all takes place in cover of darkness, to clearly hide any faults in what look like stunning visuals effects, so it either worked or they could've had it in daylight and have us bask in the full glory of the deadly battle.Not as fun as I'd hoped, but I would still recommend this, although I think it's slightly weaker that it's prequel (2017's Kong: Skull Island).","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Over the past 20 years this has been a tired & tested formula genre, and has gone through so many reboots, parodies, copies and rip-offs. The director & writers have taken the genre and stripped it bare to its core from the past, and what we have is a more grown up and interesting take on Godzilla.The special effects are good, but its the tension and build up which is excellent, as we await the inevitable clash between Godzilla and some other bizarre creatures. Compared to the masses of other monster movies, this was far more interesting. I saw a recent Japanese Godzilla remake lately, and it was just boring. This one keeps you interested through much of it.The biggest problem is that simply despite the improvements in various aspects to its peers, there's really not much more you can do with this genre. King Kong, Jurassic World etc have done much enough the same and there's little to get excited. Nothing too original, just another slant on the same old story.The ending was nothing to write home about, and the usual gung-ho US army hero was too jingoistic for me to care about.Anyhow, it was fine for an evening's viewing and better than many of its recent peers, but the genre is done like Westerns etc. It will keep getting rebooted as people seem to like remakes but all we'll see is updated special effects, and no new story. Nice try and fine effort, but that's best I can say about this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Joe never accepts the official explanation for the accident. Fifteen years later, his son, the US Navy Officer Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), learns that Joe has trespassed in Janjira quarantine area and is arrested in Japan. He travels to Japan to release his father and they go to the Janjira facility area to retrieve Joe's data and pictures. Soon they discover the truth about the accident, caused by a ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" (""MUTO"") that eats radiation trapped underground. The MUTO escapes from the secret facility to Honolulu killing Joe. Godzilla is also awakened, causes a tsunami in Hawaii and fights against the MUTO destroying Honolulu. Meanwhile a female MUTO escapes from the Nevada nuclear waste facility and destroys Las Vegas, heading to breed with the first MUTO in San Francisco. Now the last hope on Earth is Godzilla fighting and destroying the MUTO's. ""Godzilla"" (2014) is a deceptive version of the legendary Japanese monster. An action movie that makes the viewer take naps certainly has problems in the screenplay. There is a silly, boring and corny subplot with the inexpressive Aaron Taylor-Johnson that is a waste of time. The cameo of Juliette Binoche lures their fans with her name in the credits. The cinematography is too dark and hard to be followed in some fights. And in the end, the dinosaur-like monster becomes the savior of the mankind in a senseless conclusion. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Godzilla""","16 out of 29 found this helpful.

As a matter of fact I may have to go all out on my home audio now, because the sounds truly put you in this movie. The roars, the explosions, the everything. It felt real.I will have to say while I enjoyed the acting (I can see how Bryan Cranston made such waves lately) and the place the director made you look internally while viewing (I found myself analyzing my relationship with my family, my job, my country), my favorite parts were definitely when Godzilla showed up in full view. Wow! It was so well done, and somehow stayed true to the many iterations of Godzilla and the many generations of Godzilla fans. It truly is a hair raising, visceral experience to see Godzilla in such a believable way. I just loved that.And to the director, I saw your 2010 Monsters and was very impressed. When I heard you were doing Godzilla, I had very high hopes. I thank you and everybody who put you in the driver's seat to make this thing happen.

Emmerich is well known for making big budget disaster movies like Independence Day (1996) and in (2004) he directed The Day After Tomorrow. The (1998) Godzilla movie wasn't very well received by critics and audiences who labelled the movie as boring and forgettable with laughably bad dialogue, unlikeable characters and a disappointing Godzilla creature because of this Godzilla didn't get another chance at a Hollywood style remake until 16 years later in (2014).Godzilla (2014) opened with mixed reviews from critics and audiences a lot of the complaints were about how there were hardly any scenes with Godzilla in them as the first hour of the movie tries to build up the reveal of Godzilla by giving audiences a glimpse of his spine in the water or his armour plated legs walking past buildings. The other complaint most people had was about the main character Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who's character is the focus point of the movie as he slowly travels from Japan back to his family in San Francisco with the military. Aaron Taylors performance as Ford is okay I guess but he's in a movie which for the first hour stars Bryan Cranston so next to Cranston his performance and his character just aren't as memorable or likable as Cranstons. Aaron Taylors character is basically like a magnet for Godzilla and the Muto creatures throughout the movie wherever he goes Godzilla and the Mutos just happen to be going that way aswell at one point they have a Muto look directly at him as if a 300 foot monster would pay any interest to a tiny ant sized human being after literally stepping on thousands of them throughout the entire movie it's a ridiculous and pointless scene.The movie isn't bad by any means but it's just so boring for the first hour and fifteen minutes hardly anything happens more time is spent following Aaron Taylors boring character around showing us scenes of him trying to get back to his family than it does showing us Godzilla and the new Muto creatures which should be the focus point of the movie. The last thirty minutes of the movie finally give us some good scenes of Godzilla and the Mutos fighting but it takes so long to get to it that by the time the fighting starts your already half asleep for boredom.The movie does look great especially on Blu Ray and the scenes with Godzilla and the Mutos fighting was really well done CGI so at least they got that part right but sadly you see more naval ships and fighter jets than you do Godzilla.I recommend watching this movie if you are a fan of Godzilla movies just don't expect the greatest of Godzilla movies going into to this movie if you want to see Colossal sized monsters fight I recommend watching the Japanese Godzilla movies or the 2019 Godzilla King of the Monsters movie they are far superior movies.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The second part of the movie is the one that includes the most action and catastrophic-apoc. scenes, and I'd like to underline the use of a track composed by Gyorgy Ligeti, used also in 2001: a space odissey to give the right atmosphere to a scene that I'd define iconic to this movie.Complains about this movie come from the real pro of the movie, the existence of a not- too plain plot, and the short amount of screen time Godzilla has, choice done by Edwards maybe because this is somehow just an ""introduction"" movie, all reasons that make this a ""not-just-action"" movie, and reasons I actually liked it. Also the subplot of the characters involved gives a more real-like feature to the whole movie.Nonetheless, as I said I wouldn't truly rate this 10/10, but more a 8/10, because it still doesn't have a so-complex plot, but I wouldn't blame writers or the director for that, they already tried to do the most possible, but more likely the carachter itself's plainess... let's admit, Godzilla couldn't have a very complicated plot anyhow.Still I liked this movie and suggest everyone to see it.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The king of the monsters is back, but we could have used more Godzilla in Godzilla.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3019960/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2014","The days of miniatures and guys in rubber creature suits are long since past. Back in the previous century, this was a long-standing way of making an entertaining monster movie. It didn't really need much of a character development story to make for a great film. The people who saw this, were here for the monsters and city destruction. That was enough to make the Japanese monster Godzilla such a cultural icon for over fifty years. If you do your homework, you'd be surprised to find out that there are more then thirty Godzilla films, ranging from having him as a terrifying force to saving the world from other monsters to even making him a children's idol to look up to.The Godzilla series was something else I loved as a kid, though it wasn't easy for an American like myself. The movies are very hard to find (these were the days before we had the convenient Netflix) and rarely show in theaters (I saw Godzilla 2000 in theaters), making hard to persuade my friends that wanted modern special effects and better story telling. Today's movies can't work on special effects alone, often needing that griping story that for something like giant monsters, is hard to pull off. The American Godzilla gives the famous monster a second round at combining action and a western setting.The story begins in 1999 inwhere else but Japan where scientists Ishiro Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (played by Sally Hawkins) discover a giant skeleton and a hatched egg where one of the creatures as escaped into the sea. At the same time, a power plant supervisor Joe Brody (played by Bryan Cranston) nearly escapes a meltdown when seismic activity destroys the place. The disaster, written off as an earthquake, results in an evacuation and quarantine of the Japanese area. Cut to fifteen years later where Joe's son Ford (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an officer in the Navy living in San Francisco with his wife Elle (played by Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam. He finds out that Joe has been arrested for trespassing in the quarantined area, forcing Ford to go back to Japan. Joe and Ford return to the quarantine zone to collect disks that reveal a cover up. They are arrested and taken to a facility where an egg hatches, unearthing a winged creature called a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) destroys that place and flies off to the United States. The scientists and the Navy reveal another creature, Godzilla, as the only thing that can fight off the MUTOS as Ford tries everything in his power to get back to his family.To combine a tragic story around a monster like Godzilla in today's time is hard to pull off. Does it work? It does in many areas. Last years Pacific Rim perfected the combination of having good human characters in a giant monster movie. Godzilla took a lesson by applying the same idea of good actors playing good characters. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's story of getting home was good, reminding me of War of the Worlds. Brian Cranston steels every scene as a broken man attempting to expose a conspiracy, even if we've seen this before. Even the story of the military trying to kill the monsters is good. What's missing is Godzilla himself. He doesn't show up until an hour in, but when he does, it brought me back to my childhood. The creature is given a modern, CGI look that is defiantly worthy of the title ""GODzilla"". I just wish there could have been more of him. He's in about twenty-five minutes of the entire movie, giving th story to the people. This is like getting a taste of a gourmet chefs food without getting the full dish. I guess it's better to have a little of something that great rather then to have too much of it.I'll give this seven rubber suit Godzilla's out of ten. Had their been just a little more monster action, this would have been one of the best of 2014, but I had fun. I was satisfied with the new American Godzilla. Lets just hope that if they make sequels, we get to see Mothra, Mechagodzilla or King Ghidorah fight the king of the monsters. Oh, and more Godzilla would be nice.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Or ever heard of a thing called 'tension-building'? Surely not.This film was everything I hoped it would be and then some! The characters were all great, there isn't a single bad performance - everyone treats this with respect and add an appropriately serious tone to the film. Ford Brody is my favorite as his strict code of Honor and morals was put to the test by malevolent creatures, which created some brilliant dilemmas and great duo scenes with his father (played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston). Themes were perfectly adapted from the original Gojira, which makes this 10x more dark and gritty!","20 out of 35 found this helpful.

So it's a logical consequence that we find a lot of references to current major catastrophes in this movie like the great tsunami catastrophe in 2004, the core melt accident in Fukushima, and there are even scenes that reminded me very strongly of ground zero and the aftermath of 09/11 with all the fire men looking for buried survivors in a ruined, dust-covered surrounding. This affinity to real disasters that we have all seen on TV enhances authenticity and thrill factor of the movie.What's also extraordinary about this release is the way the fighting scenes are presented. It's not only the usual confrontation of several monsters whereupon a whole city is getting destroyed, there is more to this, the director plays with our expectations, he postpones fights, uses special camera angle's and finds quite pictorial ways to present the scenes which thus have a certain poetic quality to them, something unique that was not seen in any of the previous Godzilla movies due to the lack of cinematic means.In a time where massive city destructions are seen in movie theaters on a regular basis (I mean, the ""Transformers"" series alone showed them in each of the three parts, not to think of ""Pacific Rim"", ""Avengers"" etc.) it is refreshing to see that you still can get something special out of the same genre-typical elements. so everyone who expected just two hours of mindless battles might be surprised by how much thought lies behind this beautifully depicted clash of monsters. It's true, that it takes a while until we hear Godzillas famous roar, however the time it takes is not spent in vain as it serves the creation of suspense and gives space for character development in the context of which the one and only, living legend Bryan Cranston plays a major role as an obsessive scientist who is involved in a very touching family drama. His son, a soldier, later attracts the focus on his struggle to fight back the threat (very evil MUTOS) with military means as there soon comes the point where scientists get pushed back to an counseling role like it is the case with Ken Watanabe who plays an Japanese scientist, a brooding voice of reason and an intermediary between the cultures; its good that the producers chose a Japanese actor to play such an important figure.The director Gareth Edwards did not reinvent the entire genre, there are still the typical ingredients to be found, but a very smart script that offers some good twists, a strong cast and a very beautiful cinematography make this movie one of the most ambitious and impressive contributions to the monster movie franchise, maybe not as good as ""Jurassic Park"" but definitely worth seeing. If the Godzilla of 1998 was a silly joke than this one is an awakening, the first milestone of a new era of Godzilla movies that will be measured against this one. The king of monsters has claimed his throne!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'll admit that I had prevised this to be another gimmicky, Michael Bay-esque train wreck upon viewing the trailers, yet, it seemed to maintain a reasonably engaging story along with convincing pseudo-science to explain the presence of the monsters in the first place.I would, however, opine that the character development was very lack-luster and the settings throughout the events of the film were void of any novelty whatsoever (I'm not quibbling about the fact that it takes place in Tokyo, I'm referring to the actual infrastructure and microcosmic settings throughout the film).So, in short, while it's nothing Kubrick and Spielberg would be groveling over, I would say that it's worth a view.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I felt most of the movie was aimed towards the other two monsters, rather than Godzilla himself. I believe the other two got more screen time. Overall, I am happy I got to see this Godzilla. The 1998 Godzilla had a better overall story line, and Godzilla was more involved in the 1998 film than this one. But I cannot say I am upset with the films production, and it's nice to see New York City make it through a city destruction film for a change. Godzilla was larger than life on the screen, and I was pleased with how amazing he looked, and especially the fire breathing attack he used. This film has me screaming ""Godzilla!!!""

"6","/10","Half Effective Disaster Film, Half Monsters-fighting Nerds' Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3019624/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmMuscle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18123905/?ref_=tt_urv","20 May 2014","Monster movies have been around since the dawn of Hollywood, but it's only now that they're gradually transforming into superhero movies as well because—as you all know—we're facing a drought of those. In this case, Godzilla starts off as a terrific tense disaster film that actually forced my mouth open at one point. The film cleverly keeps the first hour mysterious, refraining from showing too much of the monster or its background. Nerdy Godzilla fanboys might be complaining, but it's a very wise decision that definitely maximizes the impact of its first appearance. In fact, the movie started resembling 2005's King Kong and the Jurassic Park series with its initial reluctance to delve straight into the monster's destruction. Instead, we're introduced to the narrative's main characters and how they all tie into the big picture. Now, some might be underwhelmed by the ""dullness"" of these characters as some critics noted, but a 2-hour film that's predominantly focusing on a daunting creature can only do so much. It can stretch out to be 3 hours and both develop its characters and primary monster like King Kong (2005) did, but you all would still be whining. In my opinion, most of the actors do a good job with the material they're provided to work with—Bryan Cranston, as usual, showing his A-game and starting to separate himself from his famous role as Heisenberg. The film's concentration on its characters in the first half also allows for effective scenes that lead to the deaths of fairly significant individuals. As a result, the audiences are thus able to feel the danger of the whole situation with the establishment of greater suspense for the later acts on whether or not a certain character might die in a particular sequence. The tone, in large part, retains grittiness and a dark, hopeless aura sets in, which thankfully means moviegoers won't have to deal with forced humor throughout as we all know the mandate for summer blockbusters usually demands. With that being said, yes, this movie is an exceptional Godzilla film that intelligently builds the behemoth up for his first (chilling) appearance and from that moment on, all havoc is unleashed. Destruction befalls on every major city and millions of citizens perish underneath the rubble—everything that also makes for a fine disaster film at its foundation. Like I earlier mentioned, there are some highly tense, blood-curdling segments indeed, and in addition, a group of innocent kids are occasionally seen in the middle of it, thereby further fueling viewers' apprehension. On the other hand, no, Godzilla isn't perfect because it still suffers from its fair share of flaws as a film. First of all, Aaron Taylor Johnson, definitely the lead of the film, somehow persistently maintains his composure and remains reserved like a standard tough guy even when colossal monsters near to such a close distance that they can very well devour him in the split of a second. Seriously, I'd be screaming my lungs out, but of course, only the females in the movie are shrieking. For some reason, the kids in most films stereotypically gasp at some ""cool"" real-life action rather than crying for mommy and daddy. What?! I don't think that's how real adolescents behave. A lot of the kids in this film simply stare at all the horrific chaos with a demeanor of amazement, wowing at the sight of explosions in close proximity. It's a very superficial display of reality, as is usual with Hollywood blockbusters, in the midst of a story that's otherwise attempting to portray terror through reasonable realism. And then, I really have to ask: is Godzilla just King Kong 2.0? Herein, we're supposed to feel sympathy for the Brobdingnagian force because he's yet another superhero who breathes florescent fire and extricates humans from other scary monsters. Along the vein of popular superheroes like Batman and Spider-Man, he immediately comes to the rescue whenever there's any hint of a notable character in jeopardy. With or without the gargantuan monster's aid, some characters are still conveniently spared from immense danger even though everyone else around them is essentially doomed. See, what occurs in the movie that first posed as a despairing disaster film of monumental proportions is a noticeable tonal shift in its last act. It's decently realistic and gloomy at first only to suddenly reshape into a Pacific Rim 2.0, offering us a few grandiose Kaiju battles. Given the fact that I haven't seen the original Godzilla pictures, I entered the theater hoping that this would turn out to be a ""humans versus Godzilla"" movie, but that would ultimately mean unstoppable obliteration. The filmmakers basically took the easy route out and ensured the security of a happy ending. After all has been said and done, I believe a recommendation for this film would be fair as its first hour and a half is nicely constructed and depicted for it's as good of a Godzilla film as we could ever possibly get. Keep in mind, though, that its two hours, overall, do seem unusually lengthy for some odd reason.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

In this film everything that makes Godzilla is being turned upside down and transformed into a propaganda movie for the American way of life. How can a Japanese icon created as a metaphor for the nuclear threat become the symbol of the USA supremacy? Spin away!First the monsters are ancient predators from when the Earth was radioactive, so it is not the fault of humans for their existence and any such responsibility is voided. In fact, the Bikini atoll nuclear tests were purposeful in attempting to destroy one of these monsters. Also, the creatures don't spread radioactivity, in fact they feed off it. Just put a monster egg near Fukushima and the radioactivity will magically vanish. Godzilla is actually there to preserve balance, like some kind of ancient giant Avatar: when two monsters wake up from their slumber and decide to procreate in San Francisco, Godzilla comes to the rescue and fights them both, then goes back home.Second, the entire decision process rests solely in the hands of the American military, even when they were in Japan. They simply come and take control. The news are all American and the trek of two giant monsters moving from Japan to San Francisco is just an afterthought that happens in a few minutes. The hero is a US soldier, conveniently son of a scientist obsessed with these monsters and, almost naturally, married to a medical nurse and having a small child whose only purpose is to look cute and ask for his mommy.So other than the monster fights, which are kind of boring with some exceptions, and the rather silly quest of this one guy to get to San Francisco to his family instead of telling them to get out, you get epic music, military music, motivational music, military propaganda, derision of science, arrested Americans demanding things, even some Christian prayers and lots and lots of gung-ho soldiers firing ineffective weapons at skyscraper size monsters.Oh, and in the end, after entire cities are devastated, which involves hundreds of thousands dead, a lot of respiratory related diseases in the making, Godzilla is applauded for the service it performed to restore balance.Bottom line: a complete failure from multiple standpoints: storyline, script, actor charisma, acting quality, soundtrack, logic, even action scenes. I mean can you believe that the most noticeable character for me was Elizabeth Olsen, just because she was looking nice and that was her entire role anyway? The only reason I don't rate this film lower is because of the trailers. Now those were great!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A magnificent, ambitious and often astonishing epic let down by minor clichés.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3023241/?ref_=tt_urv","kyle-domination","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34268976/?ref_=tt_urv","27 May 2014","Since the awful disappointment of the 90's remake of Godzilla, the arrival of a new and more refined version stimulated a great deal of anticipation in me! The new trailer was expertly made, I was very, very excited. After months of speculation from my family, I finally got the chance to see it. What a clichéd, delightful surprise. In all honesty, Godzilla lived up to its expectations. Making a B-movie into a more realistic film is a hard job but director Gareth Edwards delivers a satisfying disaster movie that only some audiences, including myself, will fully appreciate. It's superior, reputable and full-out epic but it's greatness also turns into it's weakness. Clichés. Almost every film in the modern world accept clichés into it's script and this is one of them. Godzilla rightfully tries to avoid the garbage clichés but fails to contain them through it's love story between Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford and Elizabeth Olson's Elle. Their performances are respectable, they are fine but Bryan Cranston, who is famous for brilliantly portraying Walter White in television series Breaking Bad, steals the show as Joe Brody, the father figure who is shown obsessed with how mysterious signs of Godzilla's presence have appeared. Joe tries to study the signs along with the Japanese guy in Inception, and the story unfolds. In the story, astonishing surprises unfold and sadly I cannot continue to explain the story with spoiling it! To put it in words, it is unexpected and actually quite clever. Through it's surprises, Godzilla's power is unleashed and the film turns into an action- fest, without showing all the destruction it actually can. It avoids it, but the ending has plenty of it. Having said, I admired its ending because really the film is a guilty pleasure, like Pacific Rim. It was made for people's entertainment and it is easily recognisable in Edwards' direction. The devastating lizard / dinosaur / crocodile / dragon has plenty of astonishing action. Godzilla kicking butt is definitely a guilty pleasure to watch. I would, however, liked to have seen it in IMAX 3D. It think the experience would be even more admirable. This is because the visuals in Godzilla are incredible, Godzilla is a breathtaking beast! At times, you actually root for Godzilla to wreak havoc, you'll understand when you watch the film. The suspense is also really well executed.Pros and Cons:+ Fantastic Godzilla action + Unexpected, cleverly executed story elements + Bryan Cranston's bombshell performance + Great visuals + Brilliant suspense - An acquired taste for some audiences - Expected clichés - Human characterisation doesn't fully pay offIn all, Godzilla is both questionable and astonishing. For the full experience, go and see it in IMAX.Verdict = 8 out of 10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The original Godzilla focused on the humans, and Godzilla was the result of nuclear activity and taught a very valued lesson about the environment. Godzilla has only had limited amount of screen time through out the movies by TOHO, the creators. The Godzilla from 1998 was a disgrace and wasn't even Godzilla, because TOHO made a movie after that, that kicked 1998's butt. TOHO watched 2014 Godzilla and said it was a fantastic movie, but that wasn't why I went to see it. The movie was great, it had beautiful camera work, and it was suspenseful. The movie kept you on the edge of the seat, and the initial roar from the God himself makes the theater rumble. I'm sure everyone's inner child was satisfied. If you haven't seen the movie, you should. TOHO loves the movie, why shouldn't you? All and all, this movie is a great addition to the Godzilla franchise and I cannot wait for the sequel.","14 out of 23 found this helpful.

I was somewhat disappointed for three reasons: 1. Although the quality of visual effects was very high the monsters didn't look real, they were all black and some looked metallic. The movie would be more watchable if the monsters had more colours and texture.2. It is a good cast with good actors, but I blame the director for not pushing them to display emotions. Except Cranston all other main characters had the same plain facial expression even when they saw a monster for the first time. No change in facial expression to show astonishment and fear. Aaron and Elizabeth always had the same expression no matter what was happening to or around them, they looked like they were trying to read a restaurant menu.3. Overall it didn't feel like one-flow movie and lacked suspense. It felt like a patchwork.Im giving it 7/7 because of good quality special effects and that I watched in d-box, which made the experience more entertaining and less boring.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Unlike the 98 film which portrays Godzilla more of a villain, this one portrays Godzilla as more of a hero and a defender of mankind just like in the cartoons. One of the perks in the film was the great casting choices particularly Bryan Cranston as Joe but felt as though the character was not given enough screen time to develop. I think Aaron Johnson was great as Joe's son ford. Elizabeth Olsen was also good as fords wife Elle Brody. I do feel as though one of the problems regarding the film was the look of the mute creatures which felt rather cheesy and Godzilla's on screen which didn't happen until an hour into the film. However the film did have plenty of action and destruction in addition to the debate of whether mankind is really in control of nature . I would say that the film is a definite for Godzilla hardcore fans. Just hope that the sequel is better.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Then perhaps they may feel the film is overlong, it doesn't show the giant lizard as much as it should or other trivialities. The setup is simple- We meet a research couple in Japan trying to figure out why the surrounding areas around a nuclear plant has strange activity going on. There is an accident and the wife is killed leaving the husband to go eccentric. We transport to the future where the couple's son- our hero has his young family. Soon a giant lizard appears on the fray and starts creating chaos in the American cities as we follow the young son's travails. The film is competently directed and features some nice scenes. The characters are also relatable. CGI is not over the top even though later on there are quite a few giant bugs and monsters onscreen. Edwards's first film Monster has a similar blueprint to Godzilla in that he prefers to show the characters with the monsters in the backdrop servicing more as an underlying theme.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I guess I'll do a survey of the comments and look for a commonality.One thing for sure: There *is* a sort of ""Plan 9"" feel to the plot lead-up. It was beginning to look like we'd be left high/dry with respect to a binding mythos that lends credence to the concept. And then we finally get to the scene at Monarch where things sorta start to get explained; but it sounded a bit hollow, to me; like the alien fellow's speech in Plan 9 about why alien intelligence urgently needed to intervene in Earth matters. Yeah, it made a sort of sense, but... not really. They try to palm Cranston's character off as one of those crackpots-who-knew-all-along, but in the end it doesn't gel. You get the distinct feeling that Cranston's character was supposed to be tragic; but sadly, due to thematic mismanagement, he comes off as a bit pathetic.Now, I've never been a monster aficionado: As a kid, I tended to get scared easily, and wouldn't watch monster flicks, even while my buddies loved 'em. So I'm trying to play catch-up here. But I sense that the key to making a flick like this work is to skip the pretenses to high-toned theatrics and go for the gut: Create a visceral sense of power and primal, atavistic, animal angst. I really don't understand, in the least, all the commenter remonstrations to the effect that there's not enough monster action. There's plenty, plenty, plenty of very tastefully choreographed monster action in this flick; and it's powerful, primal, angry... all that!So, in the end, I give this guy a 7: It's not timeless art, but the producers, et.al. sought to paint a very big picture, and a big picture is delivered. For that, alone, it deserves more than the weird reprisal ratings it's been receiving.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Godzilla looks great and is a perfect mesh of old and new. Last Years Pacific Rim came close, but Godzilla is the perfect way to spend your time at the movies. Is the story perfect? no, but it hits the right notes and Edwards taking his play book from Spielberg and Jaws teases us just right until the big showdown at the end. Actor Bryan Cranston helps the material shine even more with his appearance at the beginning. I wished he had more screen time, but Ken Watanabe is also there to help out.

Producers are scraping the bottom of the barrel for franchises to reboot. Now here comes the latest remake of 'Godzilla', a pointless two-hour borefest during which the main character is barely even seen.I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan, and the initial positive reviews for this movie made me cautiously optimistic. Well, big mistake. There is nothing extraordinary about this Summer Blockbuster, and everything typical about it. Frankly, the whole film feels like a cheat, a ripoff designed to lure moviegoers with the most minimal plot possible. Lazy filmmaking to be sure. The mediocre 1998 version, and even last year's 'Pacific Rim' had more charm than 'Godzilla', which forces us to suffer through an hour of pointless human drama before we even see Godzilla.We have no emotional connection to these characters. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the entire movie is the actor cast in the lead. He's wooden, uncharismatic, and vanilla. The film itself looks very dark, with thick black smoke and red lights occasionally peeping through. It's actually hard to see what's going on. The soundtrack alternates between silence and blaring, to clue us in that there's a monster on screen.Yes, there's one very well made scene (which every other commenter has mentioned) when the paratroopers jump into the action with vivid red smoky flares. In fact they put this scene on the movie poster. Well, one nice scene doesn't compensate for the rest of 'Godzilla', which is a failure on every level.","24 out of 48 found this helpful.

Personally I didn't find myself caring for any of them. No one really had a prime role in the film apart from the son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) everyone appeared to be a kind of side show with far too much chatter going on and no real feeling. I didn't really get the feeling of fear, shock or any genuine reaction from anyone when the Monster first appears and starts causing chaos. It was all very underwhelming. However, when it came to the battles, explosions and CGI work it was quite something. Godzilla really had a darker tone to its design and it was nice to see him shown to have actual intelligence and not just be a mindless Monster bent on destroying everything and eating all the fish.

It is kind of bummer when the movie does boast a very decent cast. Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame does have his few moments initially, but later he is reduced to conspiracy mumbling scientist. His rather wooden son, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson, is a military boy who returns home only to find the world under a far greater threat. Elizabeth Olsen plays the loving and caring wife, but don't go looking for emotional epiphany there either. Ken Watanabe is mostly found in one or two positions, either he is spewing deeper philosophical ramifications of Godzilla's presence or he is just stunned with the proceedings. But then the actors are not to be blamed, because the story does not provide much of an area for the actors to make the characters their own and the clunky story telling leaves much to be desired from the humans. Gareth Edwards tries to give a logical coherence to the movie that takes itself seriously, but as monster movies always tend to be, Godzilla is filled with plot holes and logic debridement. The story deliberately uses the human characters to be the vehicles to tell the story of the heroic adventure of Godzilla through their eyes, and also as a scale to measure the enormity of the monsters. Gareth Edwards has worked meticulously to build up an atmosphere with great construct of light and shadow that varies with each of the set pieces. The set pieces are huge and Edwards have tried to bring phenomenal outrageous craziness to these locations so that when the monsters hit, one could shudder at the reality of it if it did ever happen. But that does not work much towards infusing us with terror, since the human emotional context is entirely missing. But it does manage to fill us with awe. When the monsters break out onto the screen or leave mayhem in their path, we find ourselves watching a lyrical celluloid of mayhem, destruction and monstrosity with the realisation of the colossal nature of the beasts and our minute existence. In the last epic battle as the giants fight in the shadow of smokes and darkness in the middle of a city, the fight takes on the form of gigantic proportions on which the fate of the humanity is precariously balanced. Godzilla is not much of a movie with enough emotional resonance, but it is a monster movie through and through. You may lament for mere twenty minutes of Godzilla's presence, but then you would be entirely missing the point of movie if you couldn't find monsters on the screen in their absence. It is one of the few beauties of Godzilla. For many the build up of Godzilla may be intolerable and the brief final battle too short, but if one can look at the amount of technical and visual wizardry and Edwards' vision has gone to create a monster movie that is about atmosphere, build up and visual spectacle, and to what wonderful poetry those are translated on the screen, you would be able to appreciate it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A solid comeback for my childhood hero","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3020215/?ref_=tt_urv","kluseba","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22956348/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2014","I have grown up with the classic Japanese Godzilla movies that I first discovered when I was around eight or nine years old. I liked so many things about these movies: the looks of the monsters, the epic battle scenes, the different technical gimmicks, the detailed and handmade special effects, the emotional soundtracks, the diversified side stories and many references to Japanese culture. When I saw the first American ""Godzilla"" adaption as a child, I was rather disappointed and thought of it as a missed attempt at putting a ""Jurassic Park"" monster in a metropolis. As a child, I was then asking my parents to find the first original Godzilla movie that I had heard and read about and when my father finally came home with a videotape of it, I preferred this dark, diversified, philosophical movie that explored at least four genres at the same time (being a detailed action movie, a philosophical drama, a bleak horror movie and an innovating science-fiction film) to any movie I had ever seen before. Until today, the original movie from 1954 is one of my all-time favourite films and a classic any cineaste must see.Until today, I have watched almost all Godzilla movies and while I adore most of them (my favourites being ""Godzilla"" (1954), ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"" (1964), ""Invasion of Astro-Monster"" (1965), ""Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla"" (1974), ""The Return Of Godzilla"" (1984), ""Godzilla versus King Ghidorah"" (1991) and ""Godzilla versus Destoroyah"" (1995) among others), I thought it was a good idea to end the series with the fiftieth anniversary and a last epic movie called ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" back in 2004 because the franchise started to run out of ideas. Ten years later, the world's most famous Kaiju is back. As a longtime fan I was excited that my childhood hero was back on screen but on the other side I felt that everything had been said about Godzilla and that the first American movie was of a low average quality at best.While the new movie is nothing revolutionary and not a far call from many classic Japanese movies without reaching the perfection of the unbeatable original, the new film is much better than the first American Godzilla movie. I liked the slow start of the movie including a scientific story that is slightly inspired by the original but also by current events as the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. The strongest acting parts of the movie can be seen in the first thirty minutes or so and immediately get you into the story. The idea of two new monsters that would compete with Godzilla took me a little bit by surprise and really goes back to the Japanese classics which is a positive fact for a longtime fan. The final battle scenes in San Francisco are entertaining and visually stunning. Most importantly, the looks of Godzilla are great and feature all trademarks fans like about him from his atomic breath to his unique roars. The king of monsters looks a little bit bigger and heavier than the original but I think it looks extremely beautiful. Maybe Godzilla almost looks too sympathetic which is reminding me of the movies of the sixties and seventies rather than the original film or the last Japanese films. In comparison to the last few movies of the franchise, Godzilla is actually playing a the role of a hero and not a villain again which was another positive surprise to me.Obviously, there are also a few minor negative elements in here. Apart of the great and touching first thirty minutes or so, the acting in this movie is a little bit wooden and stereotypical. I'm sorry to say this but child actor Carson Bolde is one of the worst of its kind. His character almost doesn't speak, has only one facial expression and looks like he had a severe Down syndrome. While watching the first thirty minutes, I thought it was going to be an extraordinary movie but a few lengths and the lack of high quality acting made the final result a very good film but not an absolute highlight. Another really negative element is that Godzilla almost only plays a secondary role in this movie apart of the last thirty minutes. The king of monsters doesn't have much screening time but once it is there, it really shines. The movie rather focuses on the two other monsters. I don't want to spoil anything but the two new monsters look somewhat artificial and have no unique charisma. The story around these two monsters had some potential but they are mostly unimpressive in the end and among the most boring opponents Godzilla ever had. On a side note, let's add that the soundtrack of this movie is unimpressive and never comes close to the emotional and epic Japanese soundtracks.In the end, the first thirty minutes of the movie are creative and intense while the final battle scenes in the last thirty minutes are entertaining and epic at some points. In between, the weak acting, the lack of screen time for Godzilla and the unimpressive new monsters slow the pace of the movie a little bit down. Fans of the franchise might analyze this film as a good and solid comeback but no extraordinary one. Enjoy and watch it without further hesitation if you are still undecided. After all, the new looks of Godzilla and its unique charisma (yes, a monster can have charisma and it's probably the best ""actor"" in this movie) left me wanting more by the end of the movie. This is a well done tribute to the classics with convincing settings from the Phillipines over Japan to Hawaii and San Francisco. The special effects are as stunning as you can expect. I would call this movie a solid success after all. I'm in love with my childhood hero again and really hope Godzilla will be back.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Everything about this movie is horrible. I have watched loads and loads of movies from all over the world and this has to be one of the worst. The acting is just terrible and the story is even worse. The plot twists are horrendous. It just didn't make sense that Godzilla swam all the way from japan to San Francisco to fight the MUTOs and then he just swam back after smiling for the cameras. And this movie is rated higher than the movie which came out in 1998. That movie was better off by miles. Some people might have liked it after watching all the CGI in theaters.

It had excellent action and great CGI, but to me it felt kind of empty and that it was missing some things. While I don't think there was too little Godzilla, the emphasis is never solely on him; the MUTOs sorta steal the show this way.Unfortunately I was a victim of my expectations and hype the first time I saw this as it detracted from the experience. I saw it again last night, and let me tell you, man was I blown away! Even more so than the first time I saw it! How they use Godzilla in this movie is definitely different, but it is truly phenomenal and something special. I can see this movie only improving with time, and being added to the likes of Jaws, Jurassic Park and Alien as sorta classic monster movies.Additionally, this movie is just fresh. It stands out from all your other token blockbuster flicks like Spiderman and Xmen because of the way the story builds and feels. Again I think this is going to allow this movie to stand time much better than some other more recent blockbusters.Is it perfect? No, but its a hell of a good ride and the best Monster movie you could probably ever see! See the movie with either no expectations or watch it twice and you will realize that this is truly a great work of art.","31 out of 59 found this helpful.

Or maybe they themselves are severely lacking in brainpower and do not understand the level of trash in what they spew out. In Godzilla scriptwriter Dave (David) Callaham should have a special dishonorable mention for ruining a promising movie.The movie started of with the obligatory nuclear power plant scenes. When it started I first thought, oh no not the blame nuclear power scare again. However, as it turned out, this was not so. Unfortunately, this was pretty much the only good part in the entire script. The rest of the script is just a collection of illogical, unintelligent garbage.It starts quite quickly when Ford's father suddenly pulls of his mask, takes a sniff, and declares that there is no radioactivity in the air. Only a scientifically ignorant idiot writes something like that. Then we have the scene were the soldiers rush into The Nevada nuclear waste facility and checks the inspection hatch on every door until they find one where there is a light only to discover that the monster have broken free and left a gargantuan hole. A huge monster have broken through the walls of a nuclear waste facility leaving a whole big enough to drive a battleship through and no one would have noticed until some marines goes around and inspects the doors on the inside? Again, you have to be pretty unintelligent to write a scene like that.The entire plot is basically the same unintelligent mess. They follow the creatures around until they reach civilization. First then do they actually try and do something. That is just so nonsensical. In the case that a huge city-destroying creature would approach any large population center it would be blasted way before it reached it. Also, when they do attack they fire some light weaponry and maybe a tank gun or two against it. If millions of people were at risk I think it is not a very far fetched belief that the military would throw everything they had at the threat. And do not get me started on the hair-brained scheme of luring out the monsters to the sea with a nuke. What a load of bullocks! Okay, so with all this ranting, why did I give the movie as much as 6 out of 10 stars? Well, I am a fan of huge monster movies and the parts where the monsters rampage around destroying things or slugging it out against each others are great. Unfortunately this is pretty much the good that can be said about this movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I mean it's not a rich plot like The Godfather, but I didn't go to a monster movie to see Godzilla make the MUTO's an offer they can't refuse. In the interest of full disclosure the movie was riding along as a solid 8/10 until a 27 year old personal wish was fulfilled by the star of the show Godzilla himself.""Gunnery Sergeant Hartman: Private Pyle I'm gonna give you three seconds; exactly three-f*g-seconds to wipe that stupid looking grin off your face or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull-f*k you! ONE! TWO! THREE!""Thank you Godzilla for finally showing me what that scene would have looked like had Gunnery Sergeant Hartman gone through with his threat. I tacked on 2 stars for a certain enjoyable scene in the movie that parallels my wish.So I'll admit, a lot of these stars are 'thank god they didn't ruin it' stars. It wasn't dumbed down for kids. They didn't throw a Jar Jar Binks like character in. I didn't have to time wash-room dashes like i did in LOTR/The Hobbit, the movie actually ended after a reasonable length of time.Go see it, have fun. You'll enjoy it I'm sure.

The opening scene is really the only one that is pretty emotional and you actually care about the characters. One thing I was impressed with was that there were so many scenes where they could have made the movie cheesy but they did, (for example, the main character riding on Godzillas back, throwing some reigns on him, and going forth and destroying the monster.)

I liked it but felt it could have been so much better. The first hour drags on but I guess that's because it's taboo to do a movie under two hours these days if you want to be taken seriously as a filmmaker. The biggest gripe I have is one I'm sure is shared by many other viewers. Namely that Godzilla doesn't become a big part of the movie until late and so we basically have over an hour of a two-hour Godzilla movie devoted to humans and a new monster (with a terribly boring design). Once he does show up, the action and special effects are good but never so impressive as to make you forget the long wait. Of the humans, Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe are both good, as you might expect. Cranston is not the star, as the trailers would lead you to believe. The star is Aaron Taylor-Johnson and he does a fine job though nothing particularly noteworthy. Elizabeth Olsen, whom I adore, is largely wasted in a supported part where her only purpose is to survive the movie to be reunited with her husband. So is it worth seeing? Yes but temper your expectations. It's not as good as the original Godzilla (either version) or as much fun as the sequels. In many ways it has more in common with director Gareth Edwards' previous film, Monsters, than it does with Godzilla. If you liked Monsters (and I did) you'll probably like this. Maybe not as much, though.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

What secrets are the government hiding away in the quarantined zone? When a freak of nature breaks lose from the cocoon it was encased in, another comes in to restore balance to the nature of things, while we try to get in his way....he is Godzilla.There's a lot going on in Godzilla, so I'll give it credit for trying to bring something to the table that the original Americanized version did not. The size and scope of this entry is bigger and better. Gareth Edwards, the guy behind the independent special effects heavy flick Monsters, has been given a monster size of a budget to direct this decades old creature and possible restart a franchise. His delivery of Godzilla is a mess, but it beautiful mess.The film is gorgeous to look at. Seeing the destruction of the world while these massive beasts tango is a marvellous achievement. Edwards teases the audience a lot here. Just when we are about to see the showdown, he cuts away and we only get glimpses of it on the television. A neat way to build up our anticipation for the destruction that is sure to ensue in the climax. He does this one too many times though and the teases become irritating. Show us what we want: Destruction, Mayhem, GODZILLA. The special effects are astounding, that's a given. Edwards fully develops these creatures in a life like environment and the destruction they cause feels real. The size and scope of these creatures are leaps and bounds over what Emmerich gave us in the late 90's. The fighting between the monsters is a little rough, Del Toro has more of a craft to it with Pacific Rim. Here it feels more like a brawl, rightfully so. Godzilla does the cardinal sin of false advertising. I can't really fault the film for this, but I do feel that it was a mistake creatively to kill off certain characters early in the film. There is no emotional catalyst for our lead hero here. It feels forced to try and make those connections it desperately wants the viewer to see and brings the film to sometimes boring sections. The human characters fill out their clichéd roles fine enough. Cranston is dynamite as the guy who is right about ominous things, but nobody believes him. Johnson is our lead, a good guy with father issues, trying to make it back home to his family and be the dad he never had. David Strathairn does his Jason Bourn military shtick and finally we have two actors who do absolutely nothing in the film. First is Ken Watanabe with very few lines, but serious looks here and there. He's our ""let's explain everything"" guy. The other is Elizabeth Olsen, who has done excellent work, as the wife of our lead. Her job is....I'm still confused here because she isn't even the damsel in distress. She is screen filler. Then last, but not least we have Godzilla, who is barely in the film. Cardboard characters are to be expected in a monster flick....but aren't monsters expected to be in monster flicks? The guy's name is on the poster and Godzilla has the least amount of screen time here. The other creatures are cool looking as well and I really got into the ""history"" of when they first showed up and stuff, I just wish they explored that a tad bit more. The film is insanely serious. No real moments of brevity. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, in the hopes that they take this in some kind of direction and not chug out Godzilla VS whatever creature the fans want now....I have my hopes.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The biggest question stemming from message boards and critic reviews alike, is whether the colossal lizard is seen, or even glimpsed, enough. Anyone who saw 2013's incredibly dull monster/machine pile-up Pacific Rim will surely be aware that more is not necessarily better, and CGI is soulless without a heart. So my answer to that question would be a yes, as although Edwards teases us perhaps one time too many, when the beast finally roars, it's spine-tingling.The screenplay by Max Borenstein, based on a story by Dave Callaham, opts not to have the King of the Monsters the result of nuclear testing, but one of many ancient creatures laying low, feeding on the energy from the Earth's core. In 1999, scientists Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) discover the skeleton of a giant creature in a collapsed mine, and two pods. One pod has broken open and left a trail leading into the sea, and the other remains dormant. In Japan, unusual seismic activity causes a nuclear power plant to leak radioactive steam, killing the wife of plant supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston). Fifteen years later, Joe's son, bomb disposal expert Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), returns to Japan to find his father still obsessing over the unexplained events that led to his wife's death.This sounds like a lot of plot for a movie primarily about giant, rampaging creatures. The director previously made Monsters (2010), a low-budget, very human drama about a world facing an alien invasion, only the focus was on the romantic relationship between it's two leads. Edwards clearly isn't interested in simply blowing s**t up for our amusement, he wants us to care for the people dodging the flying cars and falling skyscrapers. It's an admirable approach, and is careful not to serve up stock chin-stroking villains or supporting characters you are waiting for to croak, but does make the mistake of offering one- dimensional archetypes as our protagonists. We have our square-jawed lead, our brilliant but possibly mad scientist, and even an expository ethnic character to make sure we're keeping up with the plot.There's also the problem of Taylor-Johnson, who although is a perfectly likable actor, does not have leading-man chops. This combined with his thinly-written character makes it incredibly difficult to get caught up in his long journey back to his loving wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and child (Carson Bolde). But while the film may often move at a snail's pace, it is never boring. Though the titular giant takes his time before popping his head up out of the water, there's two other bat-like creatures causing havoc, usually seen from the ground-up or on news reports, heightening the tension by creating a sense of realism. It's a very modern-day Gojira, developing it's own mythology yet appeasing fans of the beast's many incarnations, and no doubt frustrating those wanting to see an epic CGI smack-down.

The tests succeeded only in driving the King of All Monsters back into the ocean.But Godzilla is not the only one. There are the dangerous MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) who feed on radiation, and who are awakened, ready to breed. And they're hungry.The acting makes a great difference. If the cast doesn't care, then the audience won't. (That's not always a bad thing. DeForest Kelley trying not to laugh during ""Night of the Lepus"" is one of that movie's best bits.) But Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, and David Straithairn, among others, wisely take the approach that what's happening isn't a merry romp through the towers of San Francisco. These events are deadly serious business, and the cast treats the material as though it were Shakespeare. We care about these characters.Cranston, in particular, gives the film his all. I can truly say that this is the first monster film in which there is a genuinely human and tragic scene, one which could happen in real life and work in a more serious movie. Joe's anguish, agony and loss all come through in closeup, and that moves the audience. The scene does a great deal to erase the silliness of all this film's predecessors, and, more importantly, gives the audience an emotional investment in Joe and his family. I read one review in which the reviewer called the cast ""overqualified."" That may be, but it is certainly worth it in this case. The story really gets going 15 years later, when Joe's soldier son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, of the ""Kick-Ass"" films) is summoned to Japan, because Dad's been arrested. It seems as though Joe has become a crank conspiracy theorist, who knows the authorities are covering something up, that the reason for the disaster had to be something other than the official reason. Little do they know.Once the MUTOs arrive, just hold onto your seats and enjoy the ride. Edwards' adroit use of special effects, his skillful teasing before we see the full Godzilla, and the action scenes move along so well and so swiftly, that the most important problem of monster movies – certain logic holes, for instance – zoom by before anyone can notice them.At last, Godzilla has become something more than a sumo wrestler in a rubber suit kicking over obvious cardboard models. In the right hands, the King of All Monsters can be entertaining for the right reasons. I can only hope the studio doesn't start chintzing for the next one. It'll be worth spending the money.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's hard to believe how advanced the technology has become. If you are a tech-savvy guy who loved CGI and gigantic creatures in movies such as Pacific Rim, this one is for you. And if you love disaster movies, again this one is not to be missed. This is not your typical Roland Emmerich disaster movie like 1998's Godzilla, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow etc, which don't let you take anything serious. This is a disaster movie where you really feel the survival horror and atmosphere. As someone said it's like ""The Dark Knight"" of disaster movies. Special credit to the director and team responsible of creating Godzilla and the two other monsters. They are so gigantic, so terrifying, I don't have words to put it. For once it reminded me those terrifying gigantic creatures from ""The Mist"", as well as the gigantic monsters from the director's previous film ""Monsters"". And the monsters' fights are so perfectly executed.

Inspired by the success of 'King Kong', the first 'Godzilla' was released in 1954 and was extremely influential, and it was adapted by Americans into 'Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'. Godzilla inspired many other movies, video games and comics. Four Godzilla movies have been produced in America and one in Italy (also known as Cozzilla),while North Korea released 'Pulgasari', which was similar to Godzilla. The monster was created as an allegory of the effects and consequences of the hydrogen bomb, and represented the Japanese fear of the Hiroshima disaster happening again. This 'Godzilla' is a reboot of the one from 1954, and not a remake of the badly received 1998 version.In 1999, a couple of researchers are investigating the finding of a massive skeleton under an excavation site in the Philippines, along with a strange cocoon attached to it, and one that has apparently hatched. In Japan, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is worried that the periodical 'earthquakes' occurring lately may cause damage unless the nuclear power plant he's working in is shut down. As his wife (Juliette Binoche) approaches the reactor to check it for damage, a strong tremor causes a breach in the reactor, Joe's wife's death, and the collapse of the building. Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) lives in the USA but is called to Japan to bail his father out, who's been trespassing in order to find out what really happened the day his wife died. At the 'abandoned' nuclear plant, that has been turned into a military-protected research center, what happened in 1999 starts happening again.Interestingly enough, the two characters that looked like main characters in the trailer – Godzilla and Joe (Bryan Cranston) – are the ones you'll see the least in the movie. I didn't find this characteristic to be that bad, in regards to Godzilla. It manages to build tension and expectation as you wait for the monster to appear, and it also gives you time to appreciate the monsters Godzilla's fighting – the so-called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms). But the fact that Aaron Taylor-Johnson was the 'human lead', instead of Bryan Cranston, was just bad. Because Mr Kick-Ass isn't a good actor, has no charisma, and the public doesn't get anything from the script that can help sympathize with him. He has a wife and small child, and I could really care less, because most of the (too many) actors in the movie are just expendable and forgettable. The dialogues don't help, either.On the bright side, like I said, the movie is tense. Many scenes occur at night, in silence – when all of a sudden a huge monster appears and destroys everything while shrieking maniacally, which is just beautiful. The CGI is great and the cinematography doesn't disappoint, just like the majestic soundtrack. There aren't as many action scenes as one would expect, and the MUTOs and Godzilla are gradually revealed, up until the final big fight. The fact that some serious effort has been put into creating an interesting story – and actually, the mere fact that there is a story, gives this movie an automatic thumbs up. All in all, this 'Godzilla' is an interesting, tense, fun monster movie to watch, that can be appreciated by newbies and long-term fans of the franchise equally.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Italian car company commercial further added to the hype - Godzilla crashing through a city, wrecking havoc on all who were in his way. GODZILLA (2014) was a let-down. While the basic story line was o.k., the main point of the movie seemed to be mans involvement in the plot, and the two prehistoric - yet alien looking - creatures that Godzilla did battle with. While the CGI work was outstanding, and Godzilla himself never looked better, he was in the movie only a fraction of the time I would have expected for something titled - GODZILLA. Yes, the scenes of his battles were epic in nature and I have to admit I felt like I was 50 years younger as I watched them but, it was too little, too late. Perhaps an edited version with 30 to 45 minutes less of all that was unnecessary and not 'Godzilla' might make this movie more of a classic in future days, but for me, as the movie stands, I was disappointed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Gareth Edwards fails to do justice to the monster's legacy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3049938/?ref_=tt_urv","toqtaqiya2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22793030/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2014","If you've seen the trailer for this Godzilla film you probably thought that it would be a more faithful yet serious take on Japan's most famous monster. In the trailer Godzilla looked like a real threat. It seemed frightening the way it was portrayed. In the film though this isn't the case. We're yet again in that summer movie territory where the trailer was more inspired than the film itself. Does The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) come to mind? I think that the big reason why many people were disappointed with this Godzilla film is its lack of originality. If you pause and look at what's happening you'll see that it's actually very similar to the 1998 Godzilla film directed by Roland Emmerich. Godzilla is portrayed as a monster with some intelligence. It becomes a sympathetic creature. The American military and navy get involved, something that we've seen many times in Hollywood films recently. And, to top it all off, there's more focus on the human characters than on Godzilla. In fact, much time passes before the Big G even makes an appearance. So, just as in the 1998 film, we're forced to watch a typical human drama before anything exciting happens. But at least the 1998 film was entertaining. And it was a film about Godzilla. This 2014 film is lacking both Godzilla and entertainment. It's a summer movie, so I expected to be entertained. Instead I was left wondering what happened when the film ended. It wasn't just me. Other people in the theater were criticizing it right after it ended. Director Gareth Edwards really didn't have enough experience to make a big budget summer movie. The monster fights lack excitement, the acting is wooden, and the clichéd script lacks intelligence. I don't think that Edwards is a bad filmmaker. I think that he's an inexperienced filmmaker. His 2010 low-budget feature Monsters is a technical triumph that showed some promise. Max Borenstein's lazy script and studio interference are the two things that really ruined this film in my opinion. In a monster movie one would at least expect some exciting action but this film fails even at that. In addition, it's obvious that Edwards took the Jaws (1975) approach of obscuring the creature for much of the film's running time. Jaws, however, features interesting human characters and terrific performances. It keeps on movin' when the big shark isn't around. The human characters and performances in Edwards' Godzilla are flat, resulting in a truly dull middle section. Only Bryan Cranston, playing Joe Brody, stands out. Cranston is definitely one of the best Hollywood actors working now. His performance alone made this film bearable at the beginning, but even then the story's shortcomings were already noticeable. I have to admit that I had doubts about this film. I usually read reviews on a certain website before I go to the cinema. This time I made the mistake of reading the early positive reviews on IMDb, so I didn't wait for the review on that favorite website of mine. As it turned out, that website was right yet again and this Godzilla film made for an unpleasant night at the cinema. Some Godzilla fans might like what Edwards did, but casual moviegoers should definitely not buy a ticket. Remember, as was the case with the 1998 film, there's no hiding that this is a Western production. It has none of the quirks and cultural aspects of the Japanese films.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

So why did Godzilla have such a small part in this movie? It took so long for the beasts to fight it out. Meanwhile, way too much time is devoted to Aaron Taylor-Johnson's family life. It wasn't acted or scripted badly, but it contributed little to the movie except for length. The film has an openly anti-nuclear power message, which is fine, but that was stated too many times. The result of a nuclear power accident is that it causes the creation of two monsters, which resemble locusts, and if they mate, it'll endanger the human race. As a result, Godzilla awakens and arises from the ocean to protect the earth. The special effects and computer generated imagery are excellent, the best ever in a Godzilla movie, and when the battle finally comes, it's well staged. Problem is there isn't nearly enough of it. The closing scene is quite good, but I still felt cheated.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It seemed like it had so much potential. Darker, decent set up, but once the movie hit its so called stride and was supposed to be engaging, climactic, etc.it was not. Monsters were LAME, character performances were most likely given as written. Taylor-Johnson does what he is asked to here which is go from one unlikely scenario to the other, in an obscenely fast way and then goes from one impossible situation to another. People get lost with the odds of never being found again high, and then get found rather easily. My love for this movie however, I'm afraid will never be found. Effects were decent even though I didn't love the CGI monsters.The Good: Maybe the first half hour or so before the movies get there, when you think the characters and plot are being set up well and you don't know how bad it's going to get.The Bad: I hated the monsters, the animations, the weak plot, and the many unlikely events.

I am taking about Ronald Emmerich, Dean Devlin and Patrick Tatopolous. This team has worked on hits like Universal Soldier, Stargate and Independence Day. This film had seasoned actors Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno who could carry any film by themselves.The 2014 film is directed by Gareth Edwards who is not seasoned enough to handle such a big project. The writer Dave Callaham writes a dull story and thus the screenplay written by Max Borenstein is ineffective. Bryan Cranston(of Breaking Bad TV series fame) is the only good actor in the film. But he has a short role in the film.The film does not continue from the 1997 film, but is a standalone film.The plot hinges around Project Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham investigate a colossal skeleton in a collapsed mine in the Philippines. They find two egg-shaped pods; one dormant, one broken open. The hatched creature burrows under Janjira Nuclear Power Plant and causes a seismic effect as it feeds on the reactor's radiation. Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), the plant's supervisor, sends his wife Sandra and a team of technicians into the reactor. While the team is inside, the reactor is breached, releasing radioactive steam. Sandra and her team are unable to escape and the plant collapses into ruin.Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford is a US Navy explosive ordinance disposal officer, living in San Francisco with his wife Elle and son Sam. After Joe is detained for trespassing in the Janjira quarantine zone, Ford returns to Japan. Convinced of a cover-up of the cause of the disaster, Joe convinces Ford to help him retrieve vital data at their old home.Watch film to find out what happens next.The core of this film hinges on the C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) special effects and no attention is given to the unbelievably ridiculous plot, which you have to see to believe. If the trio of Emmerich, Devlin and Tatopoulos had begin given this project, then the result would have been much better.Verdict: Just watch once and forget about it. This film will be forgotten in years to come among the many trash films produced by the United States film industry.You may like: Gozilla 1954, Godzilla King Of The Monsters! 1956, Godzilla 1985.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Brief side note, ""Monsters"" was the 1st movie I ever wrote a review on for rotten tomatoes. It was about 2 sentences long:-p This movie is awesome and succeeds where ""Pacific Rim"" fails, but where that movie succeeds, is what holds this back. There is a some truly awesome monster fighting here, but I do wish there was more. I liked all the human actors, but I do wish there was more Godzilla. Having said that, what Godzilla there is, it's amazing. He looks phenomenal, and there's more than a couple times during the movie where you will want to cheer. The effects are amazing, and the overall story is pretty good. Heard there is a sequel on the way, and I cannot wait. The more Godzilla, the better! Great Summer movie to just sit down, chow on some popcorn and get lost in the carnage.watch movie Godzilla 2014 online stream visit http://gg.gg/kaiju2014Overall, Godzilla is not only a very good summer blockbuster, I think its the best movies I've seen this year so far.

"7","/10","An uneven, but entertaining film that suffers from lack of Godzilla.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3020672/?ref_=tt_urv","PopCulturedwithMovieMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2784307/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2014","Godzilla is one of the most well known and recognizable movie characters of all time. His name and image has been ingrained into our pop culture vocabulary for decades. Even people who have never seen a Godzilla film, know the name. That's the definition of an iconic character.With that being said, I fall into the category of people that has never actually seen a Godzilla film. Although I'm passionate about cinema, I've just never been particularly interested in the story. Sure, I've seen parts of the original 1954 Japanese film, but that's about it.Despite being an iconic figure, it wasn't a nuclear bomb that almost killed Godzilla, it was Hollywood. In 1998 Roland Emmerich's Godzilla was released starring Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. The film is now a Hollywood punchline and infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. The 1998 version of Godzilla is also known for possibly killing more careers than its titular star kills civilians.The good news is, nothing ever truly dies in Hollywood - it's just reborn. Boasting some of the best trailers you will ever see, Godzilla once again took a strong grip on pop culture. The trailer spread like wild fire through social media making Godzilla the must-see movie of the early summer. Godzilla is perfect blockbuster escapist fare and a perfect night out for anybody looking to turn their brain off for two hours. There's not a ton of great dialogue or character development. It's a Godzilla film, this is to be expected.The film starts out with a quick montage showing us what happened to Godzilla in 1954. We are soon introduced to Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston, in an effort to capitalize on his post Heisenberg high. Brody is a scientist working at a Japanese nuclear power plant. The film quickly fast forwards 15 years and Cranston's brilliant scientist has now been disgraced and reduced to a jittery wacko. Or so he seems to everybody else. Like with any disaster film, Cranston isn't crazy; in fact, he knows something is about to go horribly wrong but nobody will listen to him.As usual, Cranston is on top of his game. You can see the desperation in every wrinkle of his forehead and can hear it in every word he utters. Unfortunately, the focus soon shifts to Brody's son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Taylor-Johnson really hasn't done much. I enjoyed him in the Kick-Ass films, but he's never struck me as a particularly strong actor. When a gigantic CGI lizard has more facial expressions than your male lead, there's a problem.The more of the film Taylor-Johnson is asked to carry, the faster it starts to go downhill. Another unfortunate part of the film is how they waste Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Taylor-Johnson's wife. Like many female characters in films like this, Olsen's character is reduced to sitting at home wringing her hands waiting for news about her husband. Elizabeth Olsen is a great actress, but she's not going to break away from the shadow of her famous Full House siblings if she keeps choosing roles like this. Got it, dude?Maybe the biggest grievance I have with the film is the fact that Godzilla has his own film hijacked from him by two creatures most people have never heard of. While the two massive insect-like creatures are creating havoc, Godzilla is riding the pine. I paid money to watch Godzilla stomp on buildings, not to watch two over grown insects have sex. I know it sounds like I didn't like the film, but that's not the case. The first half of the film is especially strong. Godzilla also features some of the best music you will hear in a film all year, as well as some truly breathtaking special effects. The film also boasts a satisfying climax. It's so awesome, it made me wish there was more of that throughout the film.With Godzilla's success at the box office, it's safe to assume that he will stay in our current pop culture landscape for a little longer. I just hope Godzilla gets to flex his muscles more in the next film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

In 1998, Hollywood tried to get in on the action under the helm of big, dumb blockbuster specialist Roland Emmerich, and while the result is routinely derided by one and all, it made a comfortable profit.Now, they have tried again, with inexperienced indie director Gareth Edwards. He has enjoyed a remarkable career trajectory since his micro-budget film Monsters won praise from a variety of sources. Before the dust had settled from Godzilla's landing, it was announced that he had been given charge of the first of several new stand-alone Star Wars films which will sit alongside JJ Abrams' main trilogy.The stars come from the indie world too. Aaron Taylor-Johnson broke through with British drama Nowhere Boy (which I thoroughly recommend), and continued the trend by starring as the unlikely hero Kick-Ass. Elizabeth Olsen's early success was trailer park drama Martha Marcy May Marlene. More recently, both have cemented their status as rising stars by appearing as super-powered brother and sister Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age of Ultron.There is something a bit... cynical, though, about the placement of their characters in Godzilla. ATJ is Ford Brody, a former soldier and war veteran, while Olsen is his wife Elle, a nurse. Both are, I gather, professions that are practically shortcuts to instant sympathy in large parts of the American audience. This is edging on being a problem for me, because in Britain at least, military people have no such rosy glow about them, and especially since what are widely regarded as massively misjudged campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyway, to top it all off, they also have photogenic child Sam (Carson Bolde).I don't know why it bothered me. It's certainly no more egregious than any number of other blockbusters. It doesn't feel any more blatant, either in the moment or looking back. It isn't even that big a problem: throughout most of the film, I was more amused than offended. ""Of course they are,"" I found myself thinking. ""It's almost as if they don't trust a skyscraper-sized lizard monster to cement audience sympathy.""Godzilla has always been as much a character in his movies as a plot device, though. He has personality, motivations, even emotions of a sort. Taken over the series as a whole, he has friends and allies too.This makes the character design extremely important, and Edwards and his team did a good job in this aspect. Yes, he is a bit wider around the waist than traditional portrayals, but calling him 'fat' is really a cheap shot, and not that important to the film either. And he looks fantastic. All the special effects work is excellent, in fact. Really top notch. It's not quite up there with Avatar, Gravity or Interstellar, but not far off, and putting such outlandish monsters firmly into an everyday context while still carrying the audience is quite a feat to pull off.The themes are the thing though. The best Godzilla films I have seen are either ridiculously daft, or deeply allegorical, and not that subtle about it either. This Godzilla film's themes are understated, and slightly troubling: it seems to say that nature can handle itself, and protect us as we heedlessly harm the planet. I wanted metaphors a lot more blatant than this, and preferably better thought out.By sacrificing the message, they move closer to the silly, spectacular model of Gojira films, but for my money, don't get close enough. It's a halfway house, and not successful enough at blending those two modes to raise it to the next level.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even Godzilla itself diverts form the T-Rex blunder of the 1998 movie and captures the big-footed original monster of the Japanese series in CGI perfection. However Godzilla is not the sole malevolent creature to appear in this movie, as the famed mega-predator enters into a all-destructive chase for another humongous kaiju (or MUTO as it is defined in this movie) with a devastating EMP blast. In the midst of this epic battle humanity and the army struggle to contain the destruction, while Edwards, like in ""Monsters"", struggles to imprint human drama as a backdrop to events. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), a scientist at a nuclear power plant, loses his wife (a brief cameo by Juliette Binoche) to one early attack by the MUTO, thus becoming obsessed with the monster and the encompassing government cover-up brought in effect to hide the truth. As a character and as an actor Cranston is a short-lived emotional highlight in the story, which unfortunately soon loses traction with what feels like his premature death. This loss leaves us battling for interest in the lax son of Joe, demolitions expert soldier Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is a bland shell of a character, generic to the extreme, effectively keeping us disinterested in the story and leaving us hoping for a fast-forward to more massive destruction of metropolis. MUTO expert Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and the wife-nurse Elle Brody (Elizabeth Olsen) are equally unengaging, dull as a dishwater and forgettable. The overall lack of character imprint into the story coupled with audacious coincidences littering the movie, make the drama inert and feel like an important position on Edwards' checklist of blockbuster movies components.I did however immensely like as Edwards slowly builds tension, initially only showing massive bones of the leviathan creatures or just the aftereffects of their presence, then only sifting through bits and pieces of destruction through news reports, whilst avoiding showing the battles between Godzilla and the MUTOs, leaving space for total San Francisco annihilation for the final act. Nonetheless with the lack of emotional engagement ""Godzilla"" feels like but a mild success, a poor dramatic relative to the much more successful giant-bashing ""Pacific Rim"" feature of 2013, who has a superb mix of absurdity, pathos and general character formation that is vastly superior to Edwards effort.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

With this expectation I will say that I left the theater with mixed emotions.On the upside, the movie is visually stunning, the animations and destruction looks amazing and really shows Godzilla in his pride. Bryan Cranston's performance is breathtaking and makes the movie entertaining in the parts where Godzilla is not present. And that final? F*cking awesome! On the downside, there are not as many fights as I had hoped and Bryan Cranston was not that much in the movie as everyone expected(They really promoted this movie as if he was the lead character). So if you were expecting Heisenberg Vs Godzilla you will not be pleased by this film. The lack of action in a action movie makes the 2 hour runtime feel a bit dragged out(all leading up to the end, which makes it totally worth the wait), especially when Aaron-Taylor Johnsons character isn't that interesting.Overall I will say this movie is worth watching, even if you aren't the biggest Godzilla fan.

I appreciate how snippets of the original Godzilla score/music was incorporated all through out this new film. For those who has seen the first Gojira, the sound aspect injected intermittently in G.Edward's version sort of sends out to the viewers a nostalgic feeling of the old film. The storyline though deviated sharply from the original which worked out well. I guess the film-makers felt the need for adjustments for the present era of moviegoers. Popular news sites have written about a sequel. Many commenters are all for another sequel. But for me personally, quality Godzilla movies such as this last one should only come out no less than 10 years at a time to keep the anticipation but mainly that Godzilla is a special gem. Or like a plant that flowers only every so often that stay hidden for a time but when it blooms, it blooms with spectacle. OK, flower and Godzilla doesn't match- I can't find a better comparison but you know what I mean. I had rather wait another 15 years of a really good Godzilla movie than see a B-quality every 2 or 3 years. Godzilla is a majestic and grand figure. In movie history, there's no monster (or whatever you call it) that commands such awe. It deserved every cent of its $160 million budget.","21 out of 40 found this helpful.

As a die-hard fan of the old, exclusively Toho Godzilla, I felt the need to write an honest review which would voice my opinions of this new (and improved) entry into the Godzilla franchise.Let me start by saying, I was not let down, far from it, however, there were some aspects of the movie which I think fell short. While the visuals were stunning and the fights, (when you got to them) breathtaking, I can't help but feel the plot focused too much on the human aspects of the story and led more to be desired of a Pacific Rim style face off between the monsters. This was a major issue with the slated American attempt at Godzilla in 1998 and I felt the issue beginning to resurface with this movie. I found that I didn't really care much for any of the human characters despite a few sob stories and I constantly wanted to see more of the monsters. I got more emotion out of the two M.U.T.O monsters than any of the human characters. Despite this, the humans hardships were at least somewhat realistic (unlike Pacific Rim) and helped maintain a gritty tone to the movie reminiscent of Gojira (1954).Luckily, when the action did kick in towards the second half, we got to see the real goods. There were some scenes where I questioned the direction, but after some surprising twists and a riveting final showdown with some unexpected empathy towards Godzilla himself, I became totally immersed. If you're a fan of CGI, please go and see this movie! While the acting overall wasn't bad, there was some awkward dialogue and a distinct lack of Bryan Cranston. It becomes rather apparent, considering his role in a majority of the trailers, that he becomes no more than a reason for a lot of Breaking Bad fans to see the movie. There was an audible sigh/gasp from the audience upon realising our favourite actor won't be with us any longer. Focus then switches to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays Cranston's son. From here on we continue on a slightly bumpy ride featuring a few unnecessary additions to the plot in order to try and develop Johnson's character. Despite this, performances were solid, with some minor exceptions (Ken Watanabe's single facial expression and Cranston's questionable grasp of Japanese to name a couple), though I can't complain overall.Godzilla himself was perfection. They got his characteristics spot on, even down to his famous atomic breath. If the movie had included or even hinted at a new version of the Gojira (1954) theme I would have died happy, but it was not to be. It is clear that the movie was made by and for Godzilla fans and stays true to a traditional Godzilla classic. It left me feeling extremely satisfied and whether you're a Godzilla fan or not, I'm sure you will enjoy it too!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

In fact, I found the much-criticized 1998 version much more entertaining. Some of the reviews here were spot on regarding plot and terror level. Too much of the film was made in the dark and there was nothing of special effects that raised my excitement level. I watched Godzilla on DVD, which came with a special features disc and watched some of that to gain some insight. After watching it, I still wondered why the movie was made the way it was, or even better, why bother making it in the first place. As far as monster movies goes, it falls well below the terror level of Jurassic Park and even the 2005 King Kong, which I found to be a beautiful love story. I judge how much I like a movie based on my desire to see it again. Alas, I have no such desire at this point, and don't see it coming in the near future.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

THAT's how good this movie is!! This is not a movie, it's an experienceof a lifetime! And I'm very happy that I saw this movie first day, first show in an IMAX theatre! Any other (normal theatre) wouldn't do justice to the special effects. Though the theatre was housefull, throughout the movie, I didn't hear ONE word from anyone..not even from the kids in the audience. The only sound I heard was myself saying ""Awesome"" quite a lot during the show! I had seen the previous Godzilla movie released some years back. But the trailers for this movie is what prompted me to see it..and boy, I am one very happy person. I had expected the story to be the same as the one in previous Godzilla movie but (thankfully) it was quite different!! Luckily, the trailers didn't show ANY of the ""other elements"" of the movie. So, if you go to see this movie without knowing anything about the story, like me, then you will enjoy it MUCH more. I am not going to tell anything more about the story as I don't want to provide any spoilers. But sadly, IMDb has already provided a major spoiler in it's ""Storyline"" section. So , DON'T read that! One thing I did not like in the movie was that most of the main characters , especially Ford Broody and Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, weren't that appealing. They both seemed bit dull and passive, compared to Joe Brody , the only character that I liked. He was very convincing in his role. Anyway, the humans in this movie should be considered irrelevant. They do become irrelevant as the movie progresses and the focus directly and indirectly shifts to Godzilla. Another complaint that I have is that the movie suddenly seems to get over! I mean, it's not that the movie is incomplete or something. But once ""things get settled"", suddenly the movie gets over! I would have expected that at least they would have shown people talk about Godzilla and his actions. Anyway, not a big deal. The major appeal of the movie is it's special effects. Simply of the best ever. And the story is pretty good. And the direction amazing. Do watch this one. Doesn't get any bigger than this!","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

The part I liked most was that it leans quite a bit on the early movies by giving Godzilla a character and depicting him as something with purpose. This allowed them also to play a bit with the question of who is in charge, man or nature and use it as a subtle theme that is driven to the obvious conclusion. What I didn't like about it was the overall pacing and the special effects. The first half is really good and had a good mixture of story, Godzilla and top-notch acting. But the 2nd half contains too many elements of the usual disaster movies with a dragged out climax that failed to deliver because of rather poor CGI work. It could be that I'm spoiled from other productions but too much of the scenes were put during night time and you had a hard time to see what's going on, also the CGI during daylight lacked depth in texture and integration into the environment. With a bit more story and utilizing the actors more in the second half, it would have distracted me from the shortcomings and made them less obvious - that's why I think it could have been better but it is still an entertaining movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Without wishing to spoil much of what occurs throughout the story, the film takes a pretty stock standard approach of distant family members pulling together in time of a world disaster and fills that out with some extremely basic supports from the grizzled military commander through to the token loyal wife and in the form of Ken Watanabe's scientist one of the most glazed over and gawking acting appearances of the year (seriously just count the times he stands around looking at something as though he has just been hit by a bad case of the stares). With a weak and underused support base Edwards does strike gold with the combo of Johnson and in particular Bryan Cranston who seems to be still on an acting high from his 5 season arc in Breaking Bad and here adds much needed gravitas to the human flavour of the piece, but in the end who really needs these humans when Godzilla is on the loose? With the CGI star of the piece Godzilla a startling and impressive incarnation (even though the big fella seems to have a penchant for the odd lizard cheeseburger) it's safe to say this is where Edwards film comes into its own and becomes a must-see big screen adventure. With the films ample and sparingly used set pieces Edwards has proved that while he can handle the human element he excels at the popcorn munching extravagance even more so. Unwilling to spoil many of the films unique set ups it's safe to say there is enough jaw dropping imagery on display here to safely call Godzilla one of the most visually impressive films your likely to witness this year and while the film's most stunning set piece in the form of a military drop has been seen countless times in the films trailers and adverts there are many other moments of true epic nature to allow us to call this a feast for eyes. In a stage in motion pictures where CGI has reached all new levels of over-saturation it's a real joy to behold a film that seems to use its wizardry to realistic and stunning effects.Godzilla is a finely crafted and immensely entertaining reboot of a franchise that perhaps many thought would now lay long dormant but thanks to Edwards deft touch you get the feeling once again that us mere mortals will be more than OK to see more of what is on display here and while Godzilla is in itself its own worst enemy, a film held back by a subject that can only take it so far there is little doubt that this big budget effort is about all you could ever want from a giant radiated lizard going about his business.3 and a half jungle submarines out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

He is WAY over advertised in the previews. Now with that being said I'll finish up my review. To be honest when it started out I was on the edge of my seat begging for more. As it progressed it only got better and more interesting until around 1/3 of the way through the film. After that 1/3 of the way through it becomes painfully apparent that this movie really isn't going to bring much to the table other than snappy visual effects and scary music. With such good storytelling in the beginning and such great acting and action sequences, I was pleasantly surprised only to be let down by the thinning of the plot, the pointlessness of the human actions and the overall focus on the ""all American soldier"" got old pretty fast. The irony is that if the beginning hadn't been so good, the ending wouldn't have seemed so bad. Conclusion: The action sequences really suck you in, the pure scale of the movie is incredible and the monsters look amazing, but the plot gets worse as time goes on and the American soldier focus gets old REALLY quick. I'm glad I saw it in theatres for the experience, but I'm not sure I'll be suggesting it to anyone, and I certainly won't be buying it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

They have a special charm to them and are definitely treasured classics. This second American version of the monster classic, I believe, somewhat does the monster justice but is better than the 1998 American version with Matthew Broderick.The trailer gives people the impression that this is a very dark film where Godzilla begins a spree of terror in the U.S. and throughout the world. However, it is really about Godzilla and two other malevolent creatures called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) being awaken and unleashed by the events of the nuclear bombing at Bikini Atoll in the 1940s. This leads to a battle between the monsters, with American cities caught in the middle.The film starts off with some intrigue, showing scientists Joe and Sandra Brody (Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche) getting caught in an accident at the Janjira Nuclear Plant near Tokyo, where an explosion and radiation leak lead to causalities, already giving the audience the impression that monsters are involved, since radiation is a trademark element in bringing Godzilla to life. However, the movie drags on a bit after that when we are taken 15 years later after the incident, to a lot of uninteresting human drama involving the character leads. The movie picks up again almost toward the middle of the movie when we see some action involving the MUTOs, military and citizen evacuations - all leading to a pretty spectacular monster battle.Writers Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham wrote a pretty interesting story. Director Gareth Edwards did a decent job directing the film, inserting enough drama, carnage, tension and thrills to make the film more believable and serious than the 1998 version. And, composer Alexandre Desplat wrote a very catchy and haunting music score, giving it a monster flavor and I thought the few first strands of his themes will remind you of Godzilla's classic theme from his original Japanese movie.I wasn't blown away by the acting, which I found to be pretty awful - Cranston was mediocre and a little overzealous; British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody was bland, boring and emotionless with a bad American accent; Elizabeth Olsen as Elle Brody was OK; and Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa looked too confused. However, Serizawa did bring the connection between radiation and the monsters, and seemed to be one of a very few in the movie who has sympathy for them (echoing elements from the original Japanese series). Therefore, I felt Serizawa contributed the most to the plot. Lastly, the visual and special effects were pretty awesome. I'm not a big fan of CGI, however, the effects team did capture the somberness and carnage of fallen cities, and the mayhem and terror of the monsters' presence.Although Godzilla himself is given limited screen time, the monster is the real star of the movie as the drama and talks concentrate on him and his presence is felt throughout the movie. It's a pretty good way to celebrate Godzilla's 60th anniversary and, as the audience in the theater was left applauding after the credits started to role, this is actually a pretty satisfying film that somewhat puts the ""God"" back in ""zilla."" I just wished that there was more monster action and wished the acting was better; I wouldn't mind if the producers had selected an entire new crop of actors over the ones employed.Grade C+","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I knew nothing about the movie, even if I watched all of the trailers. All I could tell you back then, is that it was a new Godzilla movie which might include several other monsters in it. So I didn't really know what I was in for. This film focus a little bit more on human beings and character's back stories, It's not all about monsters and a lot more about humans. Godzilla is in it obviously, but it's not all about him. It's about humans who have to deal with the fact that there are big walking monsters in the world. The point is that we have to feel that those monsters exist and that they are a real threat for humanity. That's why this film is working so well. However I wished they show a little bit more of Godzilla fighting scenes, not those special report news telling us that the monsters are devastating cities etc. Since it's mostly about the characters, they are pretty good. Bryan Cranston for instance is awesome in the movie. He has a couple of really emotional scenes but he's not out there that much though, which is a little bit disappointing as well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is in the movie and he's good enough. Kind of statues as a military force, he just wants to get the job done which make sense in a way. ""Let's get it done!"" I can't help myself but to compare this Godzilla film with Pacific Rim which annoys me as Godzilla is so much more realistic - not that cooler though, but good nonetheless. It's directed extremely well and gives a kind of humans perspective regards to these creatures, it sold them. They're not monsters. Those creatures are animals who are trying to survive on this planet. Finally, the score by Alexandre Desplat is fantastic, I loved how it sounds.Overall, this movie was epic and looked epic. But don't expect Pacific Rim because you will be disappointed. This film is smarter displaying a mankind view of nature.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Darker than Dark Knight. Darker than almost horror movie, bar The Blair Witch Project.So dark that I almost yelled. While I understand maybe the movie makers wanted it to be fearsome and maybe did not want to show some brutality in it, the movie was too dark for audiences. We almost could not tell what was going on. This is a movie, not a radio show.Also, when I was expecting an epic monster fight scene, it suddenly zoomed into a TV news showing a glimpse of that fight.

Just if, the director did not shy in buying some lights or candles. Again, way too dark.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Gareth Edwards did such a good job at remaking the classic I had a hard time getting up when I had to go to the bathroom. :) I knew as soon as I saw the opening credits that this was going to be an absolutely awesome movie. After seeing the inferior 1998 version that for some reason I watched several times, I was anxiously waiting for a good remake. This 123 minute slice of awesome completely made up for my long time of waiting. There were two things I was looking for that this movie did not have, however. The original theme from 1954 and the original roar. I was not dissatisfied with the new roar, though, and it was so cool it gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it. I did still miss the original music, but I do understand copyright laws. People keep ripping on this awesome movie because it didn't offer anything new. I think it offered some new material, like the look of Godzilla and his roar and the monsters he fights. The makers of the movie changed a lot of the small things about the appearance of Godzilla, but kept the main things. For example, they kept his menacing behavior, his sky scraping height, and his incomprehensible strength. I think Edwards did an awesome job making this movie. He made sure not to completely copy off of Japan's Gojira, but made sure to keep it similar enough so the die-hard Godzilla fans were not unhappy. One of the reasons the 1998 Godzilla was not very successful was because Roland Emmerich completely changed the appearance of the so-called Godzilla to where it just looked like a giant T-Rex. Sort of. But Edwards kept the main shape of Godzilla so that was good. I guess I should actually review the general aspects of the movie. The actors were mostly A+ stars talking B+ dialogue, but it didn't bother me that much at all, because I'm not a huge stickler. Although there were some really good quotes throughout, and that kind of made up for it. The special effects were mind blowing. I'm surprised the budget was still only $160,000,000 with how good the special effects were. With three monsters, I would have expected it to be over $200,000,000 easily. The story was moderately original, and offered some new ideas and some already used ideas. However, if you just want to see a movie on a Saturday night, this will not bother you at all, and you should enjoy the movie as it is. Edwards' directing style is great, and makes you feel like you might be in a nearby helicopter or plane watching all of the action unfold, which is a lot better than just a completely still camera sitting on a bridge. He (Edwards) also did a good job putting in some minor characters to emphasize the importance of people during some of the fight scenes, like a bus driver. Overall, this is a solid installment in the Godzilla franchise, and will be much more successful, remembered, and liked than the 1998 Godzilla ever was. Thanks for reading. See ya!","18 out of 34 found this helpful.

Surprisingly , he himself didn't had much screen time to woo the audience. Even when he appears they cut to humans and other things leaving the viewers disappointing. This has been done many times in the film and it had an advantage of creating the tense but a regular fan boy might get disappointed of this style. The final battle was good and the film concluded in a good fashion though. Gareth Edwards tried to balance the human aspect and the monster-action but he was partly successful. He had put more efforts on the humans but they didn't have much to perform but only there to felt shocked and panicked. He teased the viewers and created the tension till the Big G's arrival which paid well for the initial half. He should have focused more on a compelling narration but he insisted more on creating the environment. Bryan Cranston performed well as Joe Brody and he carries the first part of the movie on his shoulders. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was good as Naval technician Ford and he performed well. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's Wife didn't had much screen time. A good actor like Ken Watanabe was there only to stare at the consequences happening let alone performing. It's hard to have compelling characters when the film is based on a Monster but a even in a film like this has to have good characters for the viewers to connect. The film was good at parts with more tension than action catching some viewers in this aspect but at the same time it leaves others who expect popcorn entertainment. It was good but not as good as we wanted it to be.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

If you go, just hang out in the lobby, eat some popcorn, chat with your friends and then head in to the theater for the last 20 minutes. You'll have a much better time. Truly one of the worst theater experiences I've had in recent history.Much of the CGI is darkened to hide its flaws. The green screen lines are easily visible (sometimes in scenes that are otherwise cinematically beautiful). The human characters are Completely one dimensional, uttering terrible dialogue the likes of which haven't been heard since Attack Of The Clones - and that includes Bryan Cranston who must have known that the lines coming out of his mouth were utter, nonsensical garbage.The new monsters are using the same trite design mode established in Cloverfield (to much better effect), while Godzilla (who lumbers around like an arthritic 108 year old man) is held back until the final act and criminally underused.Matthew Broderick must be dancing for joy knowing he won't be the Godzilla community's goat anymore.","27 out of 57 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Mess With Nature And Nature Will Always Mess Back","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3018030/?ref_=tt_urv","Jakestro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28401393/?ref_=tt_urv","18 May 2014","Back in 1954, the original Godzilla taught us many things.Mess with nature and nature will always mess back. Give a monster a motive and the audience is yours. Get the atmosphere right and no one will notice the cracks in your budget. Or at least care.Created as a vehicle to sustain director Roland Emmerich's blockbusting momentum after Independence Day, the last Hollywood version of Godzilla taught us something else entirely: Special effects can't single-handedly carry a giant monster film and it can't simply rely on big named actors either. Which is why nobody's seen Mr. Emmerich since 1998.As the creator of 2010's acclaimed sci-fi-on-a-shoestring ""'Monsters""' and now the director of this hopeful franchise-reboot, Gareth Edwards has clearly learned from these lessons – for the most part.But while the blood of ""Monsters"" runs through it, it's pretty obvious where – or rather who – this 2014 Godzilla's greatest inspiration comes from.From the ""War of the Worlds"" plotting and inevitable nods to ""Jurassic Park"" to sundry small but ""Close Encounters"" (note the shape of those sonographs), it's got Spielberg's baseball cap all over it. The 2014 reboot of Godzilla is a hugely serious business starting in 1999 with a genuinely wrenching tragedy at a Japanese nuclear facility that leaves scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) torn from his wife (Juliette Binoche) and son Ford.Fifteen years later, army lieutenant Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is on leave with his own son and wife (Elizabeth Olsen) when he is summoned back to Japan to get his now-paranoid dad out of jail.Convinced that the events of 1999 were part of a massive cover-up, Joe has made a nuisance of himself ever since. But with the truth almost in his grasp, Joe drags Ford back to the abandoned city they once lived to retrieve the last pieces of the puzzle.They find all the evidence they need. Much more. As do the researchers at the heart of the conspiracy (Ken Watanabe and the spare part-like Sally Hawkins).And as if one hundred-story, radiation-absorbing, evolution-defying menace wasn't enough for the world to deal with, there are more.On top of that, like every other recent global threat film that doesn't take place in New York, they're all heading for San Francisco. Where Ford's family happens to live.Yes, Edwards even throws in the old 'packed schoolbus on a bridge' routine as everything between Hawaii and Vegas is caught in a devastating pincer movement that renders the US Armed Forces as impotent as a basket of neutered puppies.Like previously mentioned, a blockbuster shouldn't live and die by it's special effects, but in many ways that's often as much as Godzilla has going for it, alongside a number of exquisitely composed and atmospheric shots.The visuals are astonishing, whether it's the creatures tearing down entire cities or a tsunami devastating Honolulu.The first big sighting is just about worth the wait and the one thing Edwards certainly manages to get right are the reveals. As Godzilla or the M.U.T.O.'s appear from out of smoke or out of the sky to maul each other or a skyscraper, he's able to deliver a handful of truly jaw- dropping sequences. Godzilla is huge and really quite unsettling as a presence, and in one or two moments the film touches on being a proper intense film, posing genuine danger from these massive beasts.And how they love it, supplementing their smash-and-trash campaign with bursts of electromagnetic mayhem that leaves cities powerless and – in one eerily impactful scene – causes planes to drop out of the sky.And yet it's often to be found skimping on the action, cutting out early from the scraps and only showing us the aftermath rather than the main event. As a result the first two-thirds consist of an awful lot of teasing, which, in less capable hands, could have been a blockbusting mistake. Although it could be argued that an all-out assault would be exhausting in a Transformers or Pacific Rim sort of way.A little lightness of touch might have worked wonders too. It's an entirely humorless affair, which makes you question the point of having something as silly as two hours of monsters hitting each other when it doesn't try to make you smile once. Enjoy the thrill of the few times when Godzilla lets rip with all his might, but mayhem isn't really enough if you're not having fun with it.Godzilla, after all, is the reason you're here. But like most bill- topping acts, and with millions of years of pent-up, FX-fuelled frustration to release, he's worth the wait.If you enjoyed this review, please don't hesitate to check out my other ones at www.themoviecorner.net, thanks for reading!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now fast forward again to 2014 and the Americans once again take on the legendary Big ""G"", can they finally get it right?.......well sort of. I'm not going to give you a play-by -play of the whole movie,too many other reviewers have already done that,..I'm going to tell you what you really need to know. Let's start with the good : Godzilla LOOKS pretty damn good (though the complaints of looking somewhat ""hefty"" have merit), and equally important they seem to have gotten the NATURE of the beast mostly correct, Godzilla is the anti-hero of the monster world, he is not evil,he is heroic, yet also indifferent to humankind. WHEN (and that's the key issue)you see Godzilla it is truly exhilarating and you really want to just stare in awe of this creature as long as possible. The monster fights are pretty good WHEN they are actually showing them, and let's face it ,that is what most of us really want in a Godzilla movie. This is definitely a ""movie theatre"" movie and should be seen on the biggest, loudest screen possible. Bryan Cranston is great for as long as you get to see him. That's about it for the good, it may not sound like much but it makes up for a lot of the bad and still justifies a ticket purchase.Now to the bad: Way ,way ,waaaay too much buildup and not nearly enough payoff. Bryan Cranston's character and acting talents are completely squandered. At first you are sympathetic to the human element, but after almost 90 minutes and over 20 ""cutaways"" to the human scenes you start becoming downright bored and even resentful, to the point that you wish the MUTOS and Godzilla would wipe them all out already so we can focus on the monsters. Stupid Military dialogue. Only one species of MUTO. ......and now to biggest gripe of all........ Godzilla, the movies' namesake, the big ""G"", Gojira, King of all Monsters gets a whopping 10 minutes of screen time of an entire 2 hour movie,..and if you think I am exaggerating don't take my word, I want you to bring an actual stopwatch with you, start it when ""G"" is on screen and stop it at each cutaway when he is offscreen ,then check the total time when the movie ends. He gets about 1 minute midway through the movie at his introduction and about 9 minutes at the end (not counting the interspersed cutaways).Bottom Line: as the saying goes ,you only get one chance to make a first impression, and director Gareth Edwards has somewhat squandered his by taking what could have been a ""Great"" movie and making it into a mere ""good"" one by being waaay too reserved with showing the monsters. It's still worthy of a viewing on the bigscreen, it's miles above the 98 version, it's fertile ground to make a much better sequel, but I really wish they could have gotten it right the first time around by giving us exactly what we came for......GODZILLA !!!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The problem I found with that, seems to have drifted in to this, and that is where lies the failure.Focused more on the human side and drama of his stories, Edwards fails to recognise that Godzilla is the hero, the titular character, and above all, the star of any Godzilla movie.This in turn leaves us with a beautifully made film about the US army (yay) who take on alien creatures intent on destroying the planet (or the US at least).Oh yeah, and there is a cameo by Godzilla.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Since his first appearance in a Japanese movie in 1954, there have been no less than 28 offerings from Toho Studios, while there have now been four American productions: two (1956 and 1985) re-packagings of a Japanese film, the ill-fated 1998 version (which was supposed to have been the first of a trilogy), and now this Legendary/Warner Brothers outing.Let it be said immediately that British director Gareth Edwards has produced a superior film to the mess than we had in 1998 - a well-paced and entertaining thriller. He is helped by advances in technology (the end credits name a vast army of special effects artists) and the co-operation of the US military (the same end credits acknowledge the use of an arsenal of ships and weaponry), but also we have a vaguely understandable plot this time, as San Franscisco rather than New York City is pummelled into the ground. Godzilla looks the part (congratulations to the casting director), but the two MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) look as if they were rejects from the 1997 movie ""Starship Troopers"".As two of those in charge of the monster hunt, Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn fit their roles well; and, as a romantic couple in peril, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are pretty enough; but Sally Hawkins is miscast for a blockbuster movie (and I mean that as a compliment) and there is a criminal under use of the wonderful French actress Juliette Binoche (as with Jean Reno in the 1998 film, it seems that the producers just wanted to pull in a Gallic audience). For once in a movie, the ending comes at exactly the right point (with no silly coda) and makes it clear that a sequel is likely.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I did not even get to watch the much-maligned 1998 Hollywood Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick. But definitely the pulse-pounding and very intriguing trailer made really want to catch this present-day homage to the classic film monster.From vintage-style scenes showing nuclear experiments in the 1950s, the story jumps to 1999 in the Philippines, where a big earthquake unearths evidence of a giant fossilized monster. Following this, another massive but unnatural tremor occurs in Japan causing the destruction of a nuclear facility where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife and destroying the once good life he lived.The story jumps 15 years to the future when Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) returns home after years his military service. An emergency call brings him back to Tokyo to help his dad who seemed to have never moved on since the tragedy of 1999. Unusual seismic activity similar to 1999 are happening again, but this time it unleashes three destructive monsters, two huge flying mantis-like creatures, and one gigantic dinosaur-like beast, whom they called Godzilla. They wreak havoc not only in Japan, but across the globe, reaching a climactic battle-royale in San Francisco.Bryan Cranston is really a very sensitive actor. I know him because of his award-winning performances on the TV show ""Breaking Bad"", though I have not really watched that show beyond the first episode. He is the true human heart of this film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson has really evolved from the nerdy pseudo-hero Kick- Ass to how he looks in this film. I did not recognize him. Oddly, he feels generic here, little star presence, giving a serviceable but ultimately forgettable lead performance. Ken Watanabe is really the go-to Japanese lead actor. In this film he plays the Japanese scientist who was studying these monsters. Mr. Watanabe was very good in conveying distress with his intense face. However, I felt he sounded very garbled when he talked. I think I lost a lot of details because of his unclear pronunciation of words.Technically, the sound was so massive. It reverberated through the whole theater causing us to shake. The computer-generated visual effects were similarly top-notch, especially the monsters and the destruction they were causing. We watched this in 3D which for me while nice to see, did not really add much to the enjoyment of the film. The film had a rather dark and muddy color palette, I believe the 3D made it even more murky-looking.I felt the build up to the last hour when Godzilla was finally being revealed was very slow. It was only Bryan Cranston's presence that kept these scenes from being boring. The story-telling felt turgid, and repetitive. However, whenever the titular character Godzilla was on screen, up to his very last scene, it was truly awesome indeed. The final battle in San Francisco was epic and emotional, the best parts of the film as a whole, particularly that moment when he first unleashes his nuclear laser-like breath. Director Gareth Edwards, in his desire to remain faithful to the story's Japanese roots, took a very slow burn approach indeed. But hang on, and the film culminates in one glorious explosion of action and heart toward the end.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

They tried to make it look so dramatic how she died, even though it was just a few minutes into the movie... that's just unnecessary and silly.As for the action scenes... Too few & too brief. The only memorable scene was the atomic breath scene. Without that scene, I would have probably given this movie a 2/10 or maybe even a 1.This movie has a 7.1 IMDb rating because of the atomic breath scene and the hype from all the fans. If the Godzilla franchise didn't exist prior to this movie, then the ratings would have been much lower.This is just one of many movies that's mediocre but has 1 memorable scene.","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

The actions sequences are not fast paced, but are very captivating, and I think that is what saved it for me. I was dreading that I would walk away feeling like I had watched another Pacific Rim, and Transformer film. The CGI is impeccable! This is coming from a guy who finds that cgi leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. Godzilla itself resembles the beast that we can remember from yesteryear, thankfully!As far as acting and character development goes, well there just isn't any. Cranston delivers a fine performance, though his appearance in the film is all to brief, and that frustrated me. The majority of the characters were painfully dull, and some... why are the even there??.. I don't know.For a no brainer, visual extravaganza go and see it, there were fist pumps galore during the battles, and some clever little details to get you excited. Though don't go in feeling like you will be getting an insight into anything you don't already know about the beast.. it is ambiguous at best. I can smell a franchise coming, starring the worlds greatest anti hero.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have seen more convincing hairpieces at a pensioner's pool party in Boca Raton. The only thing that was missing was a Hawaiian shirt, short shorts and a pick up line that begins with ""Hey baby...."".The movie has a stellar cast, with two Oscar winners and three Oscar nominees but you would never know it. Juliette Binoche was clearly taking the money and running, gone in 60 seconds (literally) and Ken Watanabe is as lifelike as the Oscar he won. Watanabe stomps leaden footed through most of his scenes garbling his lines but when it comes to stomping, who does it better than Godzilla? Sure the film is called Godzilla but...where IS GODZILLA? It's like some sort of absurdist piece. The titular head of the movie appears only sometimes, and we are first forced to endure a good thirty minutes of scene-setting and bad wigs. Godzilla appears more like the original Japanese version and there is some hat-tipping to the origins of the film franchise, but apart from that...we are still waiting for Godzilla. Not only is Godzilla hard to find in this hard slog of a film, but when Godzilla isn't just stomping over landmarks he is noshing on some sort of angry flying leftover from the film Starship Troopers. He isn't an angry refugee from atomic testing, he is a hungry behemoth who unintentionally saves the world. It's a good thing too...because NOTHING saves this film. Elizabeth Olsen runs the gamut of emotions from A to...well A. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, MUST be better in other films, because he makes Godzilla look life-like and believable. It is for Sally Hawkins that my heart breaks. She is an outstanding actress, and just this year was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for Blue Jasmine. What was she doing here? What was she doing signing on for this film? She was virtually invisible as the handmaiden to Watanabe, and although she is the only one who it can be said of, was actually acting, she was wasted and lost in the carnage and close ups of Cranston and Watanabe. My final sorrowful song is sung to David Strathairn who is also an Oscar nominated actor, and is deservedly considered one of America's finest character actors. However, therein, lies the problem. In order for one to be a character, one must have a character to inhabit. Strathairn blinks his way through this film seemingly oblivious to the mess around him. It must make it easier when your resume includes, ""Lincoln"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" to simply not move and hope no one notices you. Most good stories start with a fundamental list of ingredients: the initial situation, conflict, complication, climax, suspense, denouement, and conclusion. None of these ingredients will be found in Godzilla. They are simply not applicable. In ""Waiting for Godot"" Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes. As scholar David Bradby says in his criticism of Godot, this is an understatement: ""less than nothing happens.""That same criticism can be made of Godzilla, or as I have called it, ""Waiting for Godotzilla.""","31 out of 68 found this helpful.

Secondly, I applaud the director for making the Godzilla from the 1998 film look like a joke. The 2014 version is a movie created for Godzilla fans and that's why it gets the praise. If you enjoyed the movie Cloverfield like I did, and if you heard of Godzilla and expect nothing like a romance movie or a documentary film.

It is all you want from your generic summer blockbuster. Giant destructive monsters, shouting US military/navy soldiers, the annoying crying/screaming wife, a separated husband and wife due to a colossal event, a straight talking admiral/commander, and a nerd scientist who has many sudden realisations. And yet, this movie just happened to be much more. It had a followable plot, it had surprises, it had twists and it had turns, there was no unnecessary humour. It had Heisenberg. It was a hugely enjoyable film, despite it's flaws.Do I really need to comment on the visuals? Everyone who's seen the trailer knows that this is a spectacular film, and it really delivers on it's promise. I saw it in 3D and despite my worries beforehand I did not get motion sickness at all. My main complaint would be the build up to that first shot of Godzilla. It took way too long, I was sitting there listening to all this back story while constantly thinking ""Where's Godzilla? Where's Godzilla?"" I was starting to worry that Godzilla did not make an appearance in this Godzilla film. A minor problem though, once the film got going, it really got goingTo end on a positive, the film is great if you like this sort of inconceivable destructive monster thing. I'd give it 7.5/10 if you could do that here. But I have one last thing to say to the creators of this film, don't make a sequel. Leave it is it is. It's a great film with a good story and if you go messing with it you know what will happen. Just don't, please.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There are some fantastic visuals on show,the special effects are exceptional and the music and sound design are excellent. Director Gareth Edwards creates some tension and atmosphere and successfully gives the much needed scope and scale to battle scared Godzilla when he is finally revealed midway through.The MUTO designs appear to unavoidably borrow elements from Starship Troopers; Star Wars Episode 2; Pacific Rim to name a few and the influx of creature films over the years slightly takes the edge off the spectacle. In addition, Godzilla's emotional functional storyline borrows a pivotal plot point from Gareth Edwards' own film Monsters (2010), which is odd considering Dave Callaham wrote this offering.All the actors are on fine form, Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston are notable. Effects aside the everyday detail is unprecedented, the Las Vegas, tsunami and battleship helm segments to name a few are meticulously created, the film feels very real at times in terms of look and background activity aided by the excellent sets and locations. The designed sequences of movements between the MUTOs and Godzilla in the showdown fights are choreographed and executed finely giving mass and character to the unidentified terrestrial organisms.Overall, a visual treat and apt Godzilla entertainment.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I've only watched the disappointing Roland Emmerich 1998 film and only small bits of the old ones. I watched the trailer for Gareth Edward's ""Godzilla"" and became very interested in this adaptation. From the trailer, it looked visually stunning and intense. I have to say, though, I was a let down by this film.The story is mostly about Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his encounters with Godzilla. They conveniently meet from Japan to Hawaii to California as Godzilla tries to find and destroy two new monsters who were released (the trailer made no mention of these two creatures). There is another storyline with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who gives us background information about the new Godzilla.Godzilla looks great in this film. He is huge and looks very realistic. Every time he comes on the screen it's really good. However, Edwards makes this film like Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" so we don't get to see Godzilla as much. The film decides to follow the humans more and tries to be a character drama. I don't think this worked out though. I felt like the characters were thinly scripted. We've seen these kind of characters before. The performances aren't bad, but I never felt emotionally engaged with any of them. The cast is great with Oscar winner Juliette Binoche and Oscar nominees Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. It even has Bryan Cranston who seems to have won everything except an Oscar, but I just didn't feel connected to them. I didn't really care for them.The story is forced and has a few plot holes. Many people just happen to be in the right place at the right time. It can be kind of repetitive. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography really saves this film. It looks great and really captures the grand scale of Godzilla. He makes great use of blacks and reds throughout the film. Edward's ""Godzilla"" is a blockbuster reboot that looks great, but has a weak story. The film is at its best when Godzilla holds the screen. It'll wow you.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

'Godzilla' is an American monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is a reboot of Toho's Godzilla franchise and is the first film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. Most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion, it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The action in this this movie is really well done, and they don't over do it with explosions or unnecessary violence, which is shocking.
In the film, a soldier (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) attempts to return to his family while caught in the crossfire of an ancient rivalry between Godzilla and two monsters known as MUTOs.
Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are all one-dimensional, and nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspiring dialogue. They can't create good chemistry between them either, because the only have two scenes together and are apart for the rest of the film. I didn't like that the story is still very Americanised in the fact that it is a very white cast even though the bulk of the film is in Japan.
Say what you will about the shake cam, or the fact that you don't see the God of Monsters that much. This film is balls to the wall entertaining as it should be being a Summer Blockbuster. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is kidding themselves.
Overall, this movie has a good story with very entertaining action scenes. The characters are unfortunately not fleshed out enough to care about what happens to them. The only character in the movie you are rooting for is Godzilla himself.

Set in contemporary timeline, it depicts Godzilla as ""a terrifying force of nature"" who is pitted against malevolent creatures who for years have been feeding on nuclear radiations but now threaten the very existence of humanity. But the bigger question is whether it resurrects the legacy of the King of the Monsters and the answer to it is both yes & no.Director Gareth Edwards uses the same formula that he applied in his debut feature, Monsters, only for it to not work in the end. Too much time is devoted to the human drama which really wouldn't have been a problem if by any means it was interesting or properly executed. Also, he's able to build up the tension but then cuts it just when it's getting more exciting, leading to frustration on the part of viewers. And the humour is absent to give an impression of a serious film but the script adds nothing to that aspired seriousness, thus leaving the drama pretty hollow.Still, barring one aspect, the technical filmmaking is worthy of all the praise. Art direction meticulously designs, details & renders the creatures on the screen. Cinematography expertly manages to create an aura of impending doom. VFX is as spectacular as the titular character itself while sound is easily the movie's most impressive aspect. Editing, however, isn't up to the mark but the background score by Alexandre Desplat is just the way it should be in this movie; majestic, imposing & grandeur.Coming to the performances, Godzilla features an unusual cast in Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins & others. And I've no idea what the hell they signed up for because acting certainly isn't what they do here. For the majority of its runtime, all they do is simply stare with their blank faces & dropped jaws and are completely clueless about what's expected from their characters. The only exception is Bryan Cranston who delivers an energetic performance but then his role is short-lived.This movie promised to bring the 'King of the Monsters' right from its origins while also keeping its look & style faithful to its depiction in the original Japanese film. And to that, it delivers. Apart from few modifications, the overall appearance of Godzilla is mostly in tune with its iconic look plus its distinctive roar & signature weapon are also in tact. Still, its role is reduced to an extended cameo as the 1st half doesn't tease us with Godzilla's presence but this giant monster is virtually absent from the scene. And when it finally shows up, it happens simply out of nowhere.On an overall scale, Gareth Edwards' Godzilla had the potential to be 'The Movie of the Summer' but thanks to its mediocre direction, uninspired screenplay, terrible characterization, dull performances, messed-up editing & lack of substance, it doesn't live up to its hype. Still, what works ends up working pretty well in here & considering today's mainstream audience's taste in films, most of them are gonna come out pretty satisfied in the end anyway. To summarize the movie in a sentence, Godzilla did rise but it didn't rise enough.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Sixty years after Godzilla made his initial screen appearance, we get a full blown Hollywood special effects blockbuster version that will eclipse the $100 million mark in its first weekend. This is director Gareth Edwards second feature film (Monsters, 2010) and he juggles the modern day re-imagining with the Japanese roots and a hand full of other tributes throughout.The cast seems impressive: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn. Unfortunately, most of these fine actors have little to do, and instead the dominant human presence (most every scene) is Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) who somehow keeps getting gigs despite lacking even a dollop of screen presence or acting ability. Of course, this movie is supposed to belong to Godzilla, and even he is usurped on screen time by two nuclear-feasting praying mantis creatures that share some attributes with the classic Alien. These screen hogs are called MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) and are quite substantial ... crushing skyscrapers by landing.The 1954 original film was an anti-nuclear statement, though the re-edited U.S. version replaced the political statement with Raymond Burr. Mr. Burr also appeared in the 1984 sequel which included a storyline of feeding off a nuclear plant (borrowed in this year's version). This film's prologue featuring Bryan Cranston working at a 1999 nuclear plant is an unmistakable nod to the recent Fukushima disaster, and sets the stage for the collision of science (Watanabe) and military (Strathairn). Director Edwards clearly enjoys his Jaws-like teasing of Godzilla, who finally shows up after almost an hour. And despite the Jurassic Park roar by our titular monster, this doesn't hold a candle to Spielberg's 1993 classic. We do get the quite familiar shots of bystanders running down the street, glancing back in fear - a must for any monster movie.Having seen this one in 3D, I'll mention again that the enhanced effects offered by this technology do not offset the darkened, dulled look. Add that to the almost total lack of color - it's borderline Black and White - and there are simply too few breathtaking visual moments to consider this a monster classic.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Godzilla 14' entertained me until the end. I have seen every single Godzilla movie and this isn't even close to the worst ones.The story is kinda bad. This movie focuses more on the humans than Godzilla, which I don't have a problem with, since they have done it in past Godzilla movies that were good. The problem with it focusing on the humans though it that the characters are plain and generic. They never fleshed out the humans enough for me to care about them and they made stupid choices turn after turn. Not to mention dialogue have continuity errors. Again they have done this in past Godzilla movies.The acting was meh. Bryan Cranston gave the best performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson was not that great, he just kinda stared and said things that furthered the plot. Elizabeth Olsen was just there as a plot device, she didn't have many lines. Ken Watanabe was just there to stare, talk about Godzilla, and correctly pronounce Gojira. Sally Hawkins was there for like 5 scenes and in every one she was annoying.The camera work was good though. There were some nice shots that showed chaos throughout the city, the soldiers, the monsters, and hat HALO jump. One thing is for sure, it didn't look bad at all.The soundtrack is great too. The music makes you feel like you're in every situation and lends great to the Godzilla theme.Godzilla 14' was OK, but the dark and gritty feel won me over to give it a 7/10. The movie wasn't horrible like people say it is, but it isn't a masterpiece. It is just a cool monster movie that is entertaining. If we would have gotten this in 98' no one would have complained. I really hope they improve upon this to make a great sequel, I can't wait to see Ghidorah in action again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I would have liked to have seen more Godzilla in this movie or if you were going to focus on the humans make them more interesting. Only 2 or 3 of the human characters have any sort of invest-ability while the others either don't have time for us to care or are as flat as paper.

It isnt made for home viewing, if you happened to watch it in cinema and later on home then you understand.
In cinema everything is bigger, louder and gives more chills.
In home if you dont have a home theater system and turn up the volume, you wouldnt still get that exact feeling, its just made for cinema watching.Story is good, specially i like how Ford Brody moves around in the movie, how he isnt lingering in one place, he has a goal, but he does everything that it takes to reach that goal.CGI is on point with the sound effects, hearing how the Godzilla charges up to shoot out the flames, just gives you the chills...

Usually, disaster films heavy in CGI don't do anything for me but this one is oddly affecting. Yeah, humans in it are kind of superfluous to the plot but it's a GODZILLA MOVIE, not Citizen Kane. You go to see kaiju battling it out and cities being destroyed with a few lines of dialog about man and nature. On that level, it's something of a masterpiece.

Aaron Taylor Johnson come on really ? that actor Kick Ass (2010) Savages (2012)wasn't guy who suit for main role in movie everyone said he was boring i can tell come on they were going to choose Joseph Gordon Levitt, Henry Cavill these guys could been better then Aaron Taylor Joesph Gordon and Henry were going to be main they were going to get these actors to be main but comprised the shortlist for the role before Legendary took interest in Taylor-Johnson WTF that is big problem why could of Byran Cranston could been main role in film why could old people be main role why ? Byran Cranston was the greatest Performance ever then Aaron Taylor Johnson no Performance for that guy i say he was just boring no acting his acting is not very series in movie he's acting is more like kick ass Byran Cranston was a fan of Godzilla he has been fan of Godzilla in His Childhood but why could Byran could been Main Role if he was main it could been better like Breaking Bad. it was always hes favorite monster movie That f**king pisses me off how they killed off the best actor within the first 30 minutes! I always liked Bryan Cranston as an actor because of Breaking Bad, Drive but i know this is clichéd but after Breaking Bad he became one of my favorite actors because he can make you sympathize, fear and laugh with a character and he is always believable in every role no matter how shitty a movie is! he is usually the best part. f**k why couldn't he have been the lead! oh here's why because hes a 58 year old man not a 22 year old straight out of the CW actor. well that's bull crap! when did men stop being the leads in movies and boys became it! f**k if i was a movie director which i really want to be and i had Bryan Cranston in my cast i would make him the f**king lead because he has the most talent. F**king hell give the older guys a chance instead of these untalented CW/Abercrombe runway model types! ﻿there is good shots in movie when Aaron Jumps off the plane with the red flares flying around jumping down wow Godzilla there is good CGI but to much, This movie was awesome, this ending was funny too. But people complaining about it so much were expecting the whole movie to be literally nothing but action and a bunch of cgi. Most people don't even know what they want in movies anymore. But this movie stayed true to the old Godzilla movies, and the other monsters being on screen more than Godzilla has happened plenty of times in movies like Godzilla vs Destroy. The build up for Godzilla is what made it so epic, and the atomic breath really made the movie there is less Godzilla just more Characters not really slow burn but there is not many great characters i enjoy this movie but i give it 6/10 it could done better because it is 2 hour movie 5 or 7 minutes Godzilla was in it he less in it he needs to be more in movie Main Role wasn't great or good just lame it would better if Byran Cranston as main role it doesn't matter if he is old or not old give it shot they could got Josh Brolin or Aaron Paul it doesn't matter if character is got to be 22 year old it is the performance of acting Aaron Taylor is more Comedy not in Series movies he didn't suit in role very well Byran Cranston will suit better for main role this movie needs more Godzilla","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In some ways, it let me down. In most, it satisfied me.Let me first speak of the cons. For all this film's darkness, its ""infant immortality"" shows it's not quite as gritty as the classic film. I also was disappointed Godzilla did not return to his villainous roots. Finally, the characters and their stories were not as interesting as they ought to have been.The pros far outweigh the cons though. Gareth Edwards loves his monsters and it shows. He treats the kaiju with respect. Godzilla and the MUTO are well-designed, have great roars, behaviors, and flawless CGI. The movie utilizes buildup and suspense to bring a climax that pays off massively. The film also has a constant dark atmosphere, that never once crosses into cheese. Every angle in this film is masterfully shot, end of story. Bryan Cranston's performance was breathtaking and scenes with him have the most emotion and heart. While the character stories did not pay off, the characters (and the acting) all sufficed. While short of a masterpiece, this is one of the best monster movies you will ever see.","14 out of 26 found this helpful.

I do not usually go in for monster movies as I felt they all had the same basic formula- the world isn't ready for the monster, it comes out of nowhere, terrorizes a city or two,etc. But Gareth Edwards took that formula and changed it and made it his own,for the better,I think. The special effects are amazing and when Godzilla made his grand entrance it took my breath away. It also helped that I saw The King of the Monsters in all his glory, in 3D.(Trust me,it's worth it.)This new reboot certainly has it's flaws,however, with an underwhelming performance from Aaron Taylor Johnson,and a misused performance from the phenomenal Bryan Cranston.I also felt that this version did not show enough of the big green guy, and focused too much on characters whose names you probably won't remember after coming out of the theatre. But Godzilla (2014) is quite an enjoyable summer blockbuster that puts it's own spin on the monster movie formula.7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film is the second attempt at a Hollywood reboot of the Godzilla film franchise, following the disastrous attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998. The film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Cranston, alongside Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn. Mostly identifiable from his successful low budget film 'Monsters', Edwards attempts to take some of the concentrated interior conflicts from the characters in this previous film, and apply them to this film, set to the backdrop of the destruction of America at the hands of the King of the Monsters. Whilst an initial lengthy and thorough exploration into the characters themselves does provide the basis for the following chaos and destruction to have some substance behind it, it results in an opening act which feels sluggish. Additionally, whether it is through his roaring screech or enormous shadow, Godzilla is consistently teased to the audience in an attempt to increase anticipation for his first appearance. The persistent and over-implementation of this technique however simply builds frustration rather than excitement. Nevertheless, Godzilla's initial appearance is undoubtedly powerful. Never has his vast scaly body looked so beautiful, and never has his ear-piercing roar sounded so authentic and frightening. The CGI as a matter of fact is almost faultlessly immersive throughout the entirety of the film, as is the sound design and hypnotic soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat. Greatly to the director's credit, the film from this point does manage to maintain a feeling of panic and horror, and does manage to hit many of the emotional beats that felt lacking during the film's first half. Fascinatingly, this is both the film's greatest asset yet also its biggest hindrance. The film excels so marvelously in its final acts that it leaves its opening feeling dry and even somewhat mechanical. All things considered, the film is clearly a mixed-bag, but a worthwhile watch nonetheless.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now as you may see in any of my other reviews I'm short and sweet so i will conduct my review of Godzilla in the same manner, The first 50 minutes i was glued to the screen, just waiting for that glimpse of Godzilla in his remastered beauty, now believe me its worth the wait. The special effects and CGI are impeccable Godzilla is scary in his own right but sad to say this was where i lost interest as after seeing Godzilla the story line was bland and predictable, i hoped Bryan Cranston would have a much larger role as he has produced some amazing work as of late and i hoped this would follow suit. Basically keeping it short the longer i got into the movie the more my interest declined and it basically became an 'hurry up and end' affair for me as i had already predicted outcome and i wasn't wrong. In a nutshell the visual and audio aspects of the movie are 10/10 but the story lets it down massively leaving me giving the film a 6/10 with the old saying 'great potential but could have done better'.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Impressive effects and a cool monster, but not enough of them","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3018557/?ref_=tt_urv","rcolgan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20595945/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2014","Once again Godzilla roars his way on to our screens, with a big epic path of destruction lying in his wake. Obviously after the failure of the 90's Godzilla, then the director Gareth Edwards had a lot to make up for. Unlike the 90's Godzilla, the film is far more loyal to the original films. For example, it's the military's mistakes that awake an ancient monster who has been dormant for years. As they awaken, mankind's only hope lies in Godzilla to protect them. In one of several nice callbacks in the film, Godzilla and the other monsters are influenced by the use of nuclear warfare, demonstrating the film does have respect for it's roots. But obviously whilst the story remains like the original, the effects have improved vastly over the past 60 years. The monsters definitely look epic and just like the monkeys in Planet of the Apes, Godzilla has been brought to the modern age and gone from a guy in a suit to brilliant special effects. Obviously the effects go towards not only making the epic scale of monsters real, but also their vast destruction with the sight of entire buildings falling as we get to witness our monster pretty much obliterate entire cities. Though, it has to be said the special effects alone are not the only thing that make this film impressive. Whilst the effects are probably the main selling point of the film, the director is not afraid to build up the monster over time, for a large part of the film showing glimpses of the monsters before their ultimate reveal. This is far more effective at emphasising the scale of the beasts in the film and also building up anticipation to get a full view of the monster. He also often shows the camera at the perspective of the citizens looking up at these monsters, placing us in the position of the victim of these attacks.But unfortunately, just like Pacific Rim last year, a majority of the characters in the film feel either redundant or underdeveloped. For example, Brody's family are probably in the film for about 15 minutes and have little character and absolutely no impact on the plot other than being a reason for him to get home. They're an incredibly weak plot device and the film would have been much more successful had they simply been removed from the film to allow for more time towards stronger elements in the film. Similarly, Sally Hawkins character does nothing in the entire 2 hours of the film apart from possibly some exposition that could have easily been done by Ken Watanabe's character. Then there's the lead Brody, who is a very bland hero. This isn't due to the acting, but because we never learn anything about him as a character after the first 20 minutes of the film. It becomes harder to invest in the film because of this due to a lack of empathy towards the character and less tension when he is placed in danger. It's also strange because they were effective at creating a great character in Bryan Cranston who would've been far better as the lead for the film, but instead gets barely any screen time overall. His character actually gets a lot of emotional investment in the first act of the film, becoming obsessed with finding out what had been hidden from him and becoming a crazed conspiracy theorist. But then the focus of the film shifts to his son who was less built up than Cranston was and didn't get any development over the rest of the film. It was also Cranston's great acting as well, being that great mixture of emotional agony and sheer awesomeness, making it a real shame we couldn't see more of him in the film. There's also one other great character that the film has. Godzilla himself. Yes, finally instead of Hollywood treating him as some mindless monster, Godzilla has a personality! He's awesome with the best cheers in the cinema coming from his tail whips and atomic breath making him into one heck of a bad-ass. Along with this also comes his epic roar that remains as timeless now as it ever was. But Godzilla does have one disadvantage. Whilst the character of Godzilla dominates everything when he is on screen and has a very impressive build up, just like Cranston's character he doesn't get enough screen time with a feeling that there were some missed scenes of destruction in the film. This can be said to partly being focused to build up suspense of character, but it's also because the film spends far too much time focused on the other monsters called the MUTO's. This is a shame, seeing as they are not particularly impressive and are fairly generic monsters that you can never really get particularly interested in. What I don't get is why not just use one of the many already existing monsters for the film like Mothra or King Ghidorah who would have made more interesting enemies? Though I guess we can hope to see them in the sequels. Besides, Godzilla is still a good film. It's not as great as it could be, but still has some good elements such as the fights and the character of Godzilla. It's just a shame the film is let down by weaker elements such as spending too much time on characters who serve no purpose. But the film is certain to be a hit at the box office, largely due to the special effects and the name Godzilla which is something of an icon. Also I do feel that in some part the star power of Bryan Cranston will also play a role in it's box office glory due to his strong presence in the trailer and riding off his success from Breaking Bad.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They emphasized not on the colossal action of Godzilla vs other monsters, but on the pure devastation such a creature would leave in its wake. Like the 1954 one, but using the latest technology to fully enhance its vision.Sadly, we got a monster vs monster film. Not a bad one, necessarily. But instead of the scourge of humanity, Godzilla's our uncontrollable hero. I'd preferred a darker Godzilla film, to bring some fresh air to Hollywood blockbusters and the franchise.Some people complain about the pacing of the film. On paper, I think it's done perfectly. There's a lot of buildup, yet things are always happening. The damage by these creatures is devastating, yet controlled enough so you aren't desensitized. Some shots are done very well, truly emphasizing the creatures' titanic size. The CGI blows the costumed men out of the water, and even does a good job on the destruction. The final battle is climactic, and earned cheers in our theater.Unfortunately, the characters are pretty weak. Godzilla films aren't know for their personalities, but by this era, we should have some relateable characters. I literally cannot say a single defining trait about our main character. He's just a typical, handsome action lead who isn't even particularly handsome. More is known about the surface of Mars than his relationship between his wife and kid. They're obviously included as a cheap attempt to pull heartstrings. Bryan Cranston's and Ken Watanabe's characters are better, but ultimately have too little time and too little depth. The weakness of the characters makes the Jaws-esq pacing a bit disappointing.I still had a good time. The ending fight scene was totally worth it, and the action and destruction beforehand impressed me. It should have been better, though. Hopefully the sequel will correct its problems and tread new ground while pleasing fans.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I will say that its only really comparisons are the original movies, the 1998 ""movie"" (sigh), and Pacific Rim. Aaaand it was pretty good! It played it safe and kinda shows, but that was good for the formula they had.-The story was a good update of one of the originals (and I won't tell you guys which one) and I really liked the new looks. I also loved how much they honored the original in the look of the monster, characters, story, and movie overall.-Its 2 hours and has an origin story pace. I did wish Godzilla was in it a little more earlier on, but the Pacific Rim good fights at the end proved worthwhile.-The cast was good. Bryan Cranston was great! Ken Watanabe is also one of my favorite actors now! He was so good in it! Yup. I did not really like the lead that much. I don't know his name and his character is not supposed to be all actor, but he still could have used a little range.-Music was great! Exciting and honored the originals a lot! -Cg was great. Could potentially be an Oscar contender. Also fights rocked.-Cinematography and look was pretty good too! I was impressed a few times.-So overall it was infinitely better than the first American attempt/failure in 1998! It was on par with Godzilla as a remake and I enjoyed it. It was not as ""cool"" as Pacific Rim, but it was deeper and had an actual story. Lol.-I would give Godzilla a high 7.5. Almost an 8. I liked it more than my 7,5s so far (Amazing Spider-Man 2, Muppets Most Wanted, Non-Stop) but not as much as my 8s (Jack Ryan, Lone Survivor, Saving Mr. Banks, God's Not Dead) I want to give it an 8, but I would not buy it.-I would however totally recommend it! Content was very mild and it was an awesome monster movie! So if that's your thing then I would totally recommend it! Also stay tuned for X-Men next week!","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Surprisingly enough, the film places humans in the forefront, mainly focusing on character development rather than the exploits of the notorious monster. Although this approach is successfully executed, with Bryan Cranston being particularly deserving of praise and Aaron-Tyler Johnson also giving a solid performance, it does result in Godzilla becoming a character driven film, which ultimately hurts its essence. However, despite the fact that it presents the audience with an unexpected and uncharacteristic framework, the film does manage to maintain its trademark thrilling style. Godzilla is undoubtedly an enjoyable cinematic experience, and even though it offers far less action than one would anticipate, it is worth watching for the gripping visual and sound effects alone.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film was so full of pretentious cinematic clichés, over indulgent militarism (are you really going to semi-auto weapons to hurt a monster 10 stories tall?), and battle scenes so poorly designed (one would think of an old sci-fi flick 'The Deadly Mantis'), that the start may have been the best part of this ride.

The acting, while not the greatest ever seen, was well portrayed.It was quite the wait through the first thirty minutes of the movie. It was very well worth the wait. The suspense is built up until the bursting point, and it was paid off with a show that could only be described as devastating in a wonderful way. Godzilla is a commanding presence as he should be. This time, they got his character design correct, as well as his character as a whole. While their sequencing can lack here and there, the movie does very well in its payoff. The human tale is very gripping entertainment, but it is augmented by the presence of a true King of the Monsters. Definitely a great start, now on to the next!","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Mainly because I don't usually feel the need to as I normally find something good, something likable, something to grasp onto and enjoy in most movies. I'm the kind of guy who'll see any movie for what it is; give it some cheesy, low-budge horror, or sickly sweet romcom, I'm good with most things - but this...This to me is the worst. This American, blockbuster'esqe, CGI enriched, hoo-rah, 'more visual than story' nonsense is just too much. I'm starting to wonder what it is that drives the Hollywood execs to consider this as an 'OK' film to release. Has it got to the point where it's OK just to plough nonsensical amounts of money into CGI and just forget about any kind of storyline? Is it that they forget that there's more than just the people that enjoy movies that live outside of America? No offense to my American brethren, but is this what you guys consider to be a good movie these days?? I'm not sure what's going on in the world of American movies these days, especially where Hollywood's concerned. When you guys can produce the likes of Inception, The Dark Knight..........and then you let out this mindless drivel....TLDR - Don't, just don't.","26 out of 57 found this helpful.

Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it. In spite of what the professional critics had to say. I'm glad that I chose to ignore them and see it anyway. The ending was especially good, and as was the twist on the original story. I do feel that there was quite a bit that was added a filler material which shows a lack of creativity. It's kinda like they wrote the story around the ending, having written it first. Some things didn't quite add up for me in the story as well.

The parts with Godzilla are understated, fleeting and uninspired. No epic or memorable moments. No exciting battles.The production value of the film was good and the graphics were fairly well done. Parts of the storyline were also well written. So, overall I will give this mercy rating of a 6. This will not be added to my Blu-ray collection until it reaches the sub $3 range.

The monsters fighting scene, included the effects of CGI, were indeed outstanding - as if they were real! Our King's roar does shake the whole theater as it was like the whole building was about to collapse! I actually got scared TWICE - Once from the MUTO hatching scene, and the other was... I cannot even remember! GAH! But, those scenes actually got me good! The reason why I gave the score 8/10 is because the lack of human characteristics as it's rather dull - Bryan Cranston did a wonderful and excellent job, he's an awesome actor and I give credit for delivering a powerful feel about the movie; As for the rest, they need to add a bit more of 'Umph!' into the movie or even more screen time? Godzilla, on the other hand, has more feel and made me think He was a real creature - He is indeed The reborn and King of all Monsters as how he has shown and battled against the MUTOs. In the end, I actually felt quite sympathetic and empathetic to those the characters who were going through all the havoc causes by the forces of nature. Overall, the movie was both epic and awesome! I do hope it'll make a big hit in its home country this coming July. I am going to watch it in the theater again, twice, as this is one of those films you'd watch more than just one time!","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

I'd heard that Toho was involved more with the production, I thought Edwards' Monsters (2010) was an intriguing take on a giant monster movie, and Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame was in it, promising strong performances and drama to support the monster action. Leaning back in my theater chair with a tub of popcorn, a big smile on my face, and surrounded by friends, I was so ready for this to be amazing. Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling a bit underwhelmed, and a friend's constant complaining about every possible nitpick tarnished my experience even further. Forward to 2019, when I finally decided I wanted to revisit it, feeling hyped again for the sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, coming out in May this year. Got the Blu Ray to add to my growing Godzilla collection-I've got most of them, though there are so many! It's loaded with extras that I'll have to get to at some point before May.My appreciation for it has slightly increased, and I think it's enjoyable as a ""dumb action/sci-fi movie,"" which is what most of the Godzilla films are, aside from the 1954 original and a few later gems like Godzilla vs. Mothra (1964) and Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant All-Out Monsters Attack (2001), which actually have good acting, human storylines, and capture some of the social heft of the original. So it's a bit unfair to judge this movie for what it isn't, though it's hard to judge the film on its own terms since it seemed like it was trying to meld suspenseful/fun creature rampage flick with a serious human survival/family action/melodrama story.The strongest aspect is how the monsters are handled. Despite the short amount of screentime Godzilla gets, the restraint does build up anticipation for the reveals. And the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) do get shown off a lot destroying stuff early on. The first half hour does a solid job of setting up the threat, so we understand how dangerous they are when they start wreaking havoc. Their appearance is sinister and unique; describing them as ""insect-like"" is probably the easiest comparison. Godzilla thankfully looks akin to the original Toho designs, a lumbering, spiky giant rather than the sleek giant iguana of the 1999 Tri-Star incarnation. There's great carnage action of city destruction and monster fights with the MUTOs, and the news footage of the monsters' conflict played casually on television sets adds a bit of campy levity to an otherwise too-serious tone. Finally, there's that one scene of Godzilla using his radioactive beam in an ""oh yes!"" moment that every decent Godzilla movie has.As for the mix of monster and human stories, the problem is that these elements are uneven, the human drama pushed to the forefront, focusing on Cranston's character, Joe Brodie (an engineer at a nuclear power plant) and later his son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), an army bomb disposal expert. This isn't inherently bad, as I thought it was what made Monsters unique, leaving me with the impression of a giant monster movie ""elevated"" to dramatic heights. What's unfulfilling is that it lacks emotional weight, suspense, or originality. We spend so much time with Ford yet learn little about or see little emotion from him (it's hard to decide whether this is due to Taylor-Johnson's limitations or the writing or a combination). And a soldier, we are meant to see him as a kind of military hero, and also as a loving family man, searching for his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde). It's all a bit cliché.The role of MONARCH, the secret government agency studying giant creatures, which also plays a role in Kong: Skull Island (2017) and will feature in the next installments in the Legendary ""Monsterverse,"" adds a bit of intrigue, with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) a clear nod to director Ishiro Honda (who helmed the original as well as several sequels) and the tragic Dr. Serizawa from the first film, and Dr. Vivenne Graham (Sally Hawkins, now famous as the protagonist of The Shape of Water). While neither have much to do during the film, they are strong actors who bring a presence and a gravitas to the situation-understanding that all they can really do is study the monsters, because the military is not equipped to defeat them.Definitely worth a watch for even a casual kaiju (giant monster) fan, as long as you have tempered expectations. Despite its flaws, it's entertaining enough as a set up the Monsterverse and to see Hollywood put forward a more respectful take on Godzilla than the 1999 movie. While the Tri-Star Godzilla, I would argue, is actually not a bad giant monster movie, it fails miserably as a Godzilla movie, with few similarities to the Japanese franchise and the military winning the day. Legendary's take resembles the original series in that humans are struggling for survival rather than triumphing over creatures who are clearly beyond human power to control. Kong: Skull Island was more fun than this film in terms of campiness and more monster action, and the trailers for Godzilla: King of the Monsters look amazing, so I am exciting for the future of this franchise.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The heartbreaking opening was an interesting direction for a movie that had seemed to ignore that storyline completely, and a little waste of Cranston if you ask me. However the movie picked up quickly, and boy was it a fun ride! The visuals were just amazing to watch. The 3D isn't necessary but if you have a few bucks, go ahead. The human element as read by previous reviews, did indeed lack. The biggest peeve I had about the movie was that the big man himself (Godzilla) didn't show up until the last about half an hour and the teasings of him only made it excruciating to wait. When Godzilla came, my mind was blown by awesomeness. It made my insides into that of a 5-year old. Anyway in the end I give it a 8/10 and I would recommend you to watch it and if you can, in Imax 3D.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's dark, gritty and menacing, often to a fault. The screen is awash with grays and browns. The important CG moments are impressive and generally perform well, but they're still quite obviously digital set pieces and feel unnatural. I did find a lot more to appreciate in the tone of this one than in its 1998 cousin, which wears a strong admiration of the Toho source material on its sleeve. In terms of focus, this could've passed for one of Japan's own: the screen spends far more time hovering around the human components than the monster himself, who's largely relegated to a cameo role. Those civilians are universal retreads, though, only vaguely interesting at their best moments. For the most part it's a very bland movie, slogging through a repetitive plot that had me checking my watch on the regular. The monster fisticuffs are cool, even if the impact of familiar skylines being toppled has lost some edge in the wake of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim and The Avengers, but even those are often tossed aside as afterthoughts. I lost count of how many times the screen cut away just as the king of monsters got his paws on an equally-oversized freak. Clearly it was a conscious decision to keep our perspective with the huddled masses, but that makes for a tough contradiction; artistic, yes; rewarding, no. The HALO jump seen in an early teaser trailer is probably the only thing I'll remember in a few months. Much less enthusiastic a revival than I was hoping for.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Interestingly, the second monster is very very similar to the monster of Cloverfield. Suspense is the key to a monster movie...Godzilla 2014 over-killed it.

But to really enjoy this film it requires that you sit back, suspend your disbelief totally, immerse yourself in a mindset that people in the 50s had. Have some popcorn and imagine you are there. And the film sports some first person perspectives that really get there. Atomic science was a new and mysterious thing and the film tries to portray that with a foggy atmosphere in the opening stages. And those opening stages are slow to develop building suspense. As the nature of Godzilla and his purposes are revealed the film also becomes brighter in lighting. Imagine the fear of an audience afraid of what might become of the world in the nuclear age, and Godzilla will seem all that much more fearsome for it. It is very much in the style of 50s monster movies too and as such it is much of a time warp as an impressive display of modern CGI technology.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He gets teased for quite a while with only showing the spikes on his back or a foot, while watching I hated it but for all the right reasons, it builds up tension till he is finally revealed and it was glorious. The humans were good, but not outstanding, which is a plus if you ask me. If I compare it to Transformers, where you also have a secondary human cast, it is handled way better because it doesn't feel tacked on as much and for me it didn't steal the show from the monsters. Another point I really liked was the fact that they incorporated the cautionary aspect of the original Godzilla, regarding nuclear weapons/energy but modified it a bit and lifted it from the 50's to present day; I am not going to go into more detail about this as not to spoil the movie. Lastly, two negative points, which might be nitpicking but still it needs to be said. Firstly, the 3D, while the animation was top notch on the monsters and for the most part the CGI worked well and was nicely integrated, why on Earth would you opt for what I call ambient 3D. It's basically the 3D you saw in Avatar, it looks great and gives you great depth perception, but a movie like Godzilla really lends itself to the more ""all-out"" effects á la Drive angry. I wanted to see sh*t flying into my face when Godzilla wrecks a building, I wanted to flinch when he whips his tail in my direction. The other slightly negative point is regarding the monster fight scenes, some of the lacked impact for me. I could forgive that on the old rubber suits you couldn't easily make Godzilla bleed or see his scales scratched and torn, but in 2014 I expect a bit from Godzilla to at least leave behind some kind of mark or scratch. In all fairness, I have to mention that this is not true for all the scenes and it didn't impact me that much, but I noticed it and others did too. Overall, I really enjoyed watching this film and recommend seeing it in theaters if only to hear Godzilla's epic roar on their sounds system. As for a numerical score I give Godzilla a very solid 8 out of 10, it's not a must see but if you like monster movies or even just want to watch a popcorn flick, you won't be disappointed.","16 out of 31 found this helpful.

Lots of explosions and special effects, pretty standard story, blah. Nope. I was actually surprised, and I enjoyed the whole thing.The story was more intricate than I expected, and it kept bringing up surprises, the visuals were pretty on point, and it did give me quite a thrill. Watched this in 3D, which was good, but nothing overly spectacular, it didn't add too much for me. Don't read anything about this, keep an open mind. This isn't a movie about a monster that comes out of nowhere, destroys a city then gets killed. Lots of fun.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

As far as big monster movies go, Cloverfield is way more thrilling and entertaining. Still, this isn't bad, it just seems like a big disappointment (although it also could have been way worse). The acting is good, for the most part. Cranston is aces, as is Elizabeth Olsen. Aaron Taylor Johnson, though, once again remains completely charmless and has no screen presence. Why keep casting him? Because he's hot, right? The character development in this really needed work, as did the screenplay. It's very ho-hum. The directing is adequate though, and the action scenes do hold up well.

With nonsensical plot points, lifeless acting and a tone so earnest it makes Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy look like a Disney series, there's plenty to gripe about. Winning the directing gig solely on the back of his phenomenal debut film Monsters, Gareth Edwards appeared to be a rock solid choice for the job, but his approach is so heavy handed it all but drains the film of it's energy in the first hour. He also has a tendency to sideline logic or narrative cohesiveness – which is expected in a film that asks to be taken so seriously – in the name of crafting a visually splendid shot. Not helping is a ridiculously wooden central turn from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is boring and unconvincing as the Navy EOD technician who inexplicably becomes the key to fighting the monsters. Also disappointing is the short shrift given to the extremely talented Elizabeth Olsen (see Martha Marcy May Marlene) with a one-dimensional role as Taylor-Johnson's wife and the overcooked performance from the otherwise amazing Bryan 'Breaking Bad' Cranston. Yet for all of its downfalls, when the final hour hits and Edwards lets loose with some cracking sequences all is almost forgiven. From a tense scene atop a railway bridge to a thrilling special ops HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) jump and finally to the concluding beasty showdown in metropolitan Oakland, Edwards demonstrates just how memorable this picture could have been had he got it right from the opening credits instead of halfway through. Pacific Rim without the tongue-in-cheek vibe, Godzilla is at first a tough slog but finishes strong to place this squarely in the middle of the road.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's no ""Blade Runner,"" but it's a fun way to escape a rainy Saturday.There is a lot of fun fan service for those who remember the original movies. For one, the creature design isn't ""Jurassic Park"" — it deliberately recalls the man-in-the-rubber-suit effects of the Japanese films. And they made sure to include that impossible to forget (or write) REEEEEEEIIIIAAAAAAARRRGH.I might be imagining things, but I'm pretty sure the baddies here are deliberately reminiscent of ""Cloverfield"" (2008). That was funny.There is a long and overwrought subplot monopolizing the first half of the film, involving a bereaved Bryan Cranston. Whatever this was meant to achieve in terms of character motivations, it kinda wasn't worth it to delay the arrival of giant monsters. I'm pretty sure that people don't go to a Godzilla movie to see Bryan Cranston.Actually  I take that back. That dude is so popular that it's entirely possible that people do go to a Godzilla movie to see Bryan Cranston.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The biggest creature ever in a movie.Well... while Godzilla is incredibly amazing when HE is in action, it lacks something that Cloverfield had. That feeling of being afraid of being ripped in a second, no matter how much you're trying to escape. The suspense is lacking somehow except in the beginning of the movie.The scenes of people being in panic are close compared to Transformers 1, 2012 or World War Z. It's a replay of chaos in the streets that nowadays gets a bit un- touching.The scenario? The ""Clichés"" are there. So if you dislike the American blockbusters, don't take it bad.Despite these negative feelings, Kudos to the FX team who made Godzilla proud of its name. When he is on the screen, you're blown up by the immensity of the GOD- like reptile being a fearless beast.But the creature is not so present on the screen. Poor Godzilla, he will eventually get an award for the best supporting role in a movie that bears his name. 6/10","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Tonight I went purely to see how the modern CGI dealt with the old old story of the big scary dinosaur, and it wasn't bad, once you finally got there. This film was so slow getting going, it was almost an hour into the action before there was any kind of action. I know films need to provide back stories and build you up to the main juicy content but this was painful to behold, and I found myself fidgeting in my seat just to stay awake.......however......once the plot took and the main guts of the film got underway the action wasn't half bad. Godzilla himself was quite a personable character and even the bad guys had a moment of tenderness. It's always fun to see a place you know trashed in a disaster film and boy did they trash San Francisco.

Fans of Godzilla will be very happy. They handled the tone and development of the film fairly well. And of course Godzilla acted and looked as we all expected.However, I think Pacific Rim has raised the bar in terms of what American audiences expect from a Kaiju film (or at least what I want). I want epic monster battles seasoned with interesting stories of people dealing with these apocalyptic scenarios. Pacific Rim gave us both of those. Godzilla came close...but didn't.The monster battles were chopped up into tiny bits and strewn along the plot. The human stories were bland at best. The characters were one dimensional and the monsters we didn't care about had more screen time then the star of the film.Pacific Rim has Hannibal Chow, and the two quirky doctors. Godzilla had a cliché family with a jar head who's only interesting detail was that he worked on bombs. The father played by Brian Cranston was the most interesting character and he's not in most of the film.Knowing that this film was directed by the same guy who gave us 'Monsters' makes sense to me now. He applied the same formula for Monsters to Godzilla. And this resulted in a kind of tension building, hide and go seek with history's greatest monster. Which would have worked if only...if only they gave us MORE GODZILLA! The movie had too little Godzilla and too much boring actors and stupid other monsters. Now maybe I am tainted by Pacific Rim. But I really think this movie should have taken a few more notes from that film.But people love Godzilla and don't want to talk bad about it in case they kill any hopes for a sequel. But announcements were made recently for a sequel..so thats good. However I fear the director and studio will only see the money (which I think most sales will be made because it's Godzilla and not on the inherent merits of the film itself) and not consider its flaws. I fear the sequel will repeat itself.For the sequel...Please give us MORE Godzilla...or at the very least...more interesting human characters....Thank you.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Godzilla is actually shown through glimpses and teases at first, which eventually builds up tremendously to one of the greatest movie climaxes I've ever seen! The characters are surprisingly developed and greatly interwoven with the monster set-pieces. It's really clever how they connected these two plot lines and how they balance off each other. The main character is especially interesting in the fact that he goes through the same things Godzilla goes through. When the big creature stumbles, he also stumbles. When Godzilla is put down, he shares an eerie glance at Ford Brody which represent the bigger themes of this movie.What's great about the themes/subtexts of the film is that it respects and pays homage to the original 1954 Gojira, but it doesn't wink to the audience or cut short on the ideas. Early character arcs are established to show nuances within the tone of the film and the screenplay by Max Borenstein complements this with appropriately fantastic writing and dialog - much resemblance to classics like Jurassic Park and Jaws. In the end, everything comes full circle and Godzilla is shown as an anti-hero - the way he should be.In conclusion, Godzilla is not only the greatest monster movie of all time, but a refreshing and spectacularly smart film that shows restraint and compassion in times of inconsiderate film-makers who make movies for money and not for the love of the movie-goer.(10/10)","23 out of 48 found this helpful.

Now the old Godzilla movies might not have cared too much about the humans themselves it was more about the monster. And in a way the movie pay tribute to that. Actually, anything involving the ""monsters"" is done with the utmost respect to the history of the ""franchise"" (not sure if that's what they'd call it in Japan, but let's stick with that, why don't we).But when it comes to the human story, especially anything absent Bryan Cranston (who does ramp it up a bit, but never truly fails to convey and convince in his role) and maybe our Japanese go-to guy (though he does have some lines that might make you cringe), the rest is absolute nonsense ... and not in a good way. Too many clichés, too many lightweight and not fleshed out characters, that kind of take the wind out of the movie. Fortunately not entirely, because you can rely on the action and CG to ramp it up a notch.For some it's a case of too little too late, when it comes to the actual ""star"" of the movie, but I liked it just the way it was.

And we didn't get enough of Godzilla's fire breathe because when they did show it, it was great. The movie feature some talented actors and actresses but this movie really didn't need THAT much acting. Fun to see the dude from Kick A in another movie.

I hated it. Possibly preconceived notion of an action packed transformers-style movie. This is more of a suspense thriller with action. I think it would have helped if i had the mindset that i've evolved to, being open to all possibilities when i start a movie instead of expecting something and being disappointed. I kept my original review at the end for reference lol.This movie was pretty awesome. I thought about going all the way from 3 to 7 but i hesitated, maybe on third viewing (yes, definitely a 7). It was suspenseful, the music was awesome, and the monster scenes were epic. I still think godzilla himself was a little slow and clunky and there were a few tease moments where i wish they would have just stayed on the fight instead of cutting away, but this was a very enjoyable experience the second time around (and third). (3 viewings, 3/28/2021)original review - 3 out of 10 - just didn't like it. Wasn't my style. Most of the movie was a tease, not being able to see what's happening or having an obstructed view.

Godzilla manages to balance a lot of the key factors such as the many minutes we see both the monsters and people and not stray off on a tangent but there are some subtle faults that maybe could of been addressed.The narrative and this whole idea of Nuclear anxiety(relating back to the original film in 1954)which is an occurring theme that drives the majority of the film is built up at the very start of the film rather well as it does create this great expectation that we do get. The archived footage helps us see this as it blends in with glimpses of this reptile creature which obviously symbolises that something catastrophic will happen.What I personally liked about this film knowing that I didn't watch any of the trailers to spoil my self and how I really don't know much in depth about other Godzilla stories was the sequence near the start where we see scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins) exploring a cave in the Philippines of not just a skeleton, but two egg pods which honestly surprised me in a good way.Even though this idea of having Godzilla and the M.U.T.O (Massive unidentified terrestrial organism) may have been a risky move by Director Gareth Edwards and how it could of been a huge mess of just pure fighting an unbalance in terms of the number of times they appear on screen (which mainly is probably one of the main reasons why some people detest this film), he at least has made this bold but successful move of adding more monsters and quite frankly, Edwards has done a good job of balancing out the colossal fighting sequences with the human perspectives and how they are handling and struggling with these behemoths. Although Godzilla does make his full appearance known around the one hour mark which again has had many people being critical of the pacing and momentum of the film, the first time we see the all powerful figure and hear this god-like roar it certainly delivers shivers down the spine. Personally I find the pacing of the film reasonable; the first hour leading up to the immense scenes feel natural and doesn't really drag at all. While it can argued that the human perspective of the story near towards the end doesn't engage you to sympathise with the characters that we get to know throughout, the opening sequences make up for that with the character of Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston).Out of all the acting performances, no one can really go against how good Bryan Cranston is in terms of what sought of character he has to adapt. The character of Joe Brody (a nuclear physicist at Janjira nuclear plant) who is quickly accustomed living a life filled with grief,tragedy,anger and sadness is a character that does seem to be difficult to manage to which Cranston does very well when we see him diverge himself in a life full of conspiracy and agonising mystery trying to find out what really happened at the plant. Although his performance can be seen as insignificant and could of perhaps been situated around another person, Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays Lieutenant Ford Brody (son of Joe Brody)and is profoundly the main person we follow does a stable job of well.. showing us the human perspective of the struggle against the beasts and that's all there is to his character really. The only positive that I got from his performance was his on-screen chemistry with Elizabeth Olsen's character Elle Brody and how they bounced off each other really well as a married couple. It is a bit of a shame however for Olsen who doesn't really get a stagnant and more of a engaging role to really connect with her character. There are glimpses of her where she is nursing people around the hospital where I feel they could of perhaps focused more on her story as well and what it was like for her when Godzilla and the Male/female M.U.T.O were bashing at each other rather than seeing Ford Brody's perspective for the majority of the time. As for Ken Watanabe.. he is certainly the character with the stereotypical lines. Although his role is supposed to be vital to the narrative, the lines and the way he delivers them will be the only thing remembered about his character.. trust me. One last thing to inform all of you for those who want to watch this film.... DON'T WATCH IT IN 3-D. Iv'e always said that 3-D is a cheap gimmick which is supposed to 'ENTICE' the film-goer and Godzilla in 3-D is a good example of WHY YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH IT IN 3-D!!! it seriously adds nothing and at times the foreground of the images that appear aren't really focused properly which is annoying so PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.Having said this however, Godzilla is in my book a good piece for the monster/disaster genre. Again the bold but successful inclusion of different monsters including obviously Godzilla genuinely surprised me and adds another dimension to this genre of films. The time you see Bran Cranston on screen is really pleasing to see but doesn't really get appreciated due to how the other human perspectives play out throughout the film. It's hard to say whether Godzilla will be one of the best films to be released this year in 2014 due to other major films yet to be released.

It gave me everything I wanted out of a Godzilla movie, if not nearly enough of it. Godzilla was every bit the badass he should be, not some 'little lizard in the big city' ala the horrible 98 picture, but the Earth's bull-in-a-china-shop Sheriff that he's supposed to be. While certainly not a dude in a suit, his design is highly reminiscent of the original, and having grown up loving Godzilla movies, it was fantastic nostalgia to watch him bust out old favourite moves in high-budget 3-D.That all said, there were some things about the movie which grated. First off, while Brian Cranston does a great job, the story which the movie follows becomes rather redundant, and really actually kind of irritating, after about the first half-hour to forty-five minutes.In the build-up it's a solid story, nothing 'Oscar for screenplay' worthy certainly, but the sort of decent drama and character establishment which the closest modern comparison, Pacific Rim, completely failed to muster. It got you emotionally invested in Cranston's character, and by extension the characters around him.The problem is that long after the build-up, those characters remain the irksomely central focus of the movie, quite literally obstructing our view of the action. Several times the movie has these ""Oh..! Oh...! AWWW, Come onn..!"" moments, where some really cool monster-battling is -just- getting started, only to cut away abruptly to one of the characters answering a phone/riding a train, with perhaps brief and tiny flashes of the awesome battle you wish you were watching on a TV in the background.There comes a point in the movie where the story of the supporting characters should really move out of centre-stage for the main character, the titular Godzilla... but it never happens. Instead, the story finds ways of carrying the supporting characters through each situation to the end, even getting one personally involved with the monsters in a really weird, goofy way.All in all though, my review boils down to this: NEEDS MORE MONSTER BRAWLS!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because, statistically speaking, it has a high probability for suck-age: A universe where a monstrous prehistoric reptile destroys a city is pretty far-fetched. Coupled with creating believable circumstances for its existence and a fairly realistic looking but conceptually modern monster is a challenge.In the 2014 version of Godzilla, Godzilla is a monster well known and researched by the government but kept secret from mankind. It exists cloaked in the water, dormant from destruction. That is, until other massive unidentified terrestrial organisms (MUTO) threaten civilization and the only way to save the world is pitting MUTO against Godzilla.Scientist Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston, and his son Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson are caught in the middle of the combat in Japan while Ford's wife Elle, Elizabeth Olsen, and their son try to survive the devastation created by the MUTO in San Francisco.Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche are not nearly as prevalent in the film as the trailer allows you to believe. The trailer is an old bait and switch, which at some level acknowledges and admits that the movie can not hold its own and needs to capitalize on some star-power. Olsen and Johnson do their job but aren't compelling enough to keep you engaged.All in all, the premise is a little thin and you don't really care about the characters. Godzilla wants to feel like a monster match-up to rival all other adversary crossover battles. The problem? The MUTO is new and you don't really get why Godzilla is the only one who can take them down. Ken Watanabe says it has something to do with the light and the dark, the balance, or some kind of dubious explanation.As a movie it isn't great and there are better summer blockbusters to keep you entertained. As a Godzilla film it is a lot of fun. Watanabe says ""Got-zirra"" a few times; there are a lot of action scenes with military battle scenes at several iconic locations and the Godzilla monster looks super cool. And the final battle scene is legit!More reviews at our website!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

(Godzillas first roar is roughly halfway through the film) the films focuses on Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and the only problem I have with him is he doesn't show a lot of emotion throughout the film, I understand he's part of the military but from my knowledge anyone on the planet would have a more emotive reaction to these creatures. What I do like about him is that we become a third person camera to him and he's in with the chaos a lot. As for the other actors, props to them as they're all amazing.Now to the thing we want to hear about, the monsters, I love them to pieces and if I could get all the figures I can get my nerdy hands on, I would, watching these from the moment you see one to the end of the film is an absolute joy and childhood dream, it's what you want from a monster film, what I love most is that they are animals, not beings with history of worship and stuff behind them, they're animals and they're doing what nature intended, trying to survive, it's what I appreciate most about this film, they aren't intentionally trying to destroy cities, they're just animals doing what they would be doing and it feels more realistic and it's how I see this film, a realistic interpretation of a global situation like this.This is one of the best if not the best Godzilla film in my opinion, I haven't seen all of the Godzilla films so it's hard for me to say that but right now I doubt it's going to get beaten, it made me fall in love with him and he's been a true monster that lights up the silver screen.If you are going to watch this, you won't see the monsters as much as you'd hope to but it makes the scenes all the more better and memorable, less is more and it always will be.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Most of the scenes were done extremely well, particularly where the sheer scale of the monsters was concerned. The scene where the U. S. warships are in the bar around the Golden Gate Bridge was particularly striking.I have only one real criticism regarding the cinematographical choices made, namely that the scenes that took place at night were simply too dark. It was quite difficult to see what was happening. Moviegoers are supposed to be thrilled by the action of the monsters, not frustrated by the lack of lighting.I give the film 9 (out of 10) for the monsters. Gojira is rendered spectacularly, and the MUTOs are both awesome and (I felt) realistic. Usually I come away thinking that they are clunky or that the anatomical design is not practical in terms of movement or flight. But here, the design team seems to have consulted actual natural forms.I give the film 10 (out of 10) for the humans/actors. Every last one of them. For a two-hour film that had several major human characters, there was a lot of character development and real human emotion. Brian Cranston was fantastic. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was the perfect blend of a cool head, a concerned family man, and a dutiful soldier. Ken Watanab was great in his role, perhaps a bit too befuddled through parts of the film. I would like for him to have been a bit more forceful in his character's depiction.I give the fim 10 (out of 10 for overall plot. For once, FINALLY, the plot was not just one big (and slightly boring) fight between the monsters followed by another fight between the monsters. There was a story!! And it was very well developed. The way that they built up the reveal of Gojira was great!! And the ultimate encounter between him and the MUTOs was quite masterful (if a bit difficult to watch at times in the darkened scenes).","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Let me explain: The sound editing, CGI work, graphics, and cinematography were pretty good. I enjoyed it. My biggest turn off was its poor screenplay.For one, I thought Godzilla is an evil overly-grown monster that causes destruction and harm to the human race. There's a great Wikipedia page to further inform you in case you're interested. Of course Hollywood had to screw up the storyline. I'm not going to insert any spoilers here, but let's just say that if Godzilla would've started taking pictures with the human race I wouldn't have been shocked. Gareth Edwards made Godzilla seem like the nicest, most harmless creature ever. Needless to mention that Edwards xeroxed an epic Saving Private Ryan moment (When Tom Hanks' character 'eradicated' a tank with his hang gun""), that really bothered me. The elaborate fighting scenes were compelling only because of the great CGI and sound work. Otherwise, the movie was filled with cheesy lines, a story line that was simply false, and a poor screenplay.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Did I miss anything? If so, it was terrible, whatever it was. Everything was terrible.The initial story is ridiculous but is the kind of thing you can forgive in an action/sci-fi movie. After that, the movie goes downhill, and keeps going down and down and down as the movie progresses. The main plot lines are routine, tedious, and boring.The movie is really just an action flick, not intended to have a real plot or any character development. That might OK, but even an action film has to have a semi-coherent plot to be any fun to watch. This movie's plot is, as I said above, idiotic, making the action scenes mostly unexciting and uninteresting. It also might be OK if you could actually see the action, but much of the time you can't. Most of the action takes place at night in scenes so dimly lit that you can't see what is going on.This film has no - repeat, NO - redeeming features.

Godzilla is more than just ""blowing up a rampant, giant monster"", but I will not explain why that is, as that would ruin your excitement firsthand if not already spoiled. There is a small plot twist that makes the movie more clear for people trying to understand what has happened.This movie actually has a main character, who is a Lieutenant... He doesn't have a giant megazord or robot to battle Godzilla, he doesn't heat-ray vision or super-strength. His father has just studied Godzilla and any related events after her first appearance, and that is the only reason why this soldier is important.

This is a popcorn flick above all else. So logic is thin. There are all sorts of little messes.The plot could definitely been improved. A crater of a former nuclear power plant is holding a giant cocoon for 15 years and no one notices. Right there, reality snaps. BUt this *IS* a movie about giant radioactive monsters, right? So are we really expecting real world logic to last long? WHen father yells out for his son being hit, when his son can't be seen and is in a covered and locked truck which he never saw before, you think, wow,talk about bad editing and continuity. There are more. The army stops all vehicles on a bridge, stranding them, then you hear, ""don't fire there are civilians on the bridge,"" well yeah, you trapped them there then rolled a tank onto the bridge because a bridge is a great offensive line to a creature that is longer than the bridge itself.The main characters are somewhat uninteresting. They try and put them all in harm's way, but really it is all very orchestrated and false feeling.So why do I like this.Because Godzilla was the good monster. Granted, Godzilla probably needed a little more screen time. He wasn't just destroying things like a dinosaur running wild. I loved the description of G as an alpha predator, a force of nature.And he was given a cool looking monster to fight against. I really liked the MUTOS. They were like atomic gnats. People loved those old movies because they loved the monsters. Recreating the outdated monsters of the 60s will not work. The monster need to be monsters that people would find cool today. I wish they didn't feel the need to drag the fight to the U.S. to make it ""interesting"" to Americans.This is what the old movies were about. ""Let them fight."" It is exactly what the audience wants. They got those elements right this time. Hopefully the sequel will invest in better plots and characters.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It provides many jaw-dropping moments that hardly to find at any typical movie. Some destructions are captured really detail and all the battle is just spectacular. Credit should be given to visual effects department that has created an outstanding look for Godzilla character. The way it swims, walks and roars are perfectly designed. The only flaw from this reboot is, the movie lacks in humanity side. It shows more damages buildings and roads that is caused by monsters than how many innocent people was sacrificed from the tragedy itself. Also Ford Brody character is too heroic though. Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a serious yet ambitious film-making and a reboot that is needed. It pays all the mistake Roland Emmerich had done years ago with much upgrades at visual and significantly more logical issue in storyline. Aside of some weaknesses, ""Godzilla"" is probably the most stunning and entertaining movie so far this year also great experience to see it at IMAX theater.","14 out of 27 found this helpful.

Outside of that though the similarities are endless, the dialog is wooden, the lines in some places are laughable. The plot could be predicated by any cinema knowledgeable 6 year old. and please don't go to see it for the acting, I promise you will leave disappointed.The long and short of it is, if you loved the old Godzilla(as I do), you will love this one even more, otherwise stay home.

"7","/10","Let them fight! Just without the humans... Please...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3076918/?ref_=tt_urv","Jacobmaycry","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54889703/?ref_=tt_urv","28 August 2014","Let me start with apologizing for I will be comparing this new entry with the 1998 Godzilla. I know! They are two very different movies but I'm 21 so Godzilla has been a big piece of my childhood. Therefore I have my expectations.So now that's that: This years entry is probably the best Godzilla movie I've seen hands down! Although I do have my share of complaints, which I will get to later. 2014 Godzilla gets the most important aspect RIGHT. And that's, well... GODZILLA. This isn't some 1998 re-imagining, which is basically a giant dinosaur just bumping into buildings and eating fish. This is classic Godzilla. The ultimate king (or God) of all monsters. The Godzilla who actually has character. The Godzilla who isn't afraid of any creature whether it be a giant monstrous butterfly or (my personal favorite) a giant flying robotic space turtle! and of course the Godzilla who is truly brutal and terrifying, because he doesn't act like just some giant dumb reptile, I mean you can tell he has a conscious which only makes him more dangerous. They were so spot on with Godzilla. Unfortunately though, the movie is quickly thrown off balance do to a paper thin plot and uninteresting characters. I personally like Aaron Taylor- Johnson, I always felt like he's only a few paces away of joining the list of the highly talented modern day actors. So when I found out he was the primary protagonist for the new Godzilla, I was STOKED. And I thought for sure this would give him the recognition he deserves but unfortunately, even he himself fell flat with this feature. As for all the other supporting characters, you can just forget about them, because your going to end up up doing so naturally. The only actual GOOD STAND OUT characters in this film is Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and Dr. Ishiro (Ken Watanabe). Even then, your not going to see much of them because the camera tends to focus mostly on Ford Brody (our boy Johnson) since this is primarily his story.The story is always four steps behind this character as we watch him travel from china to New York to try and be with his family after being caught in the midst of monster uprising moving globally around the world. If the story doesn't sound interesting it's because it really isn't. The only times it will catch your attention is when it actually includes Godzilla. That was the biggest problem, too often it strayed away from everyone's favorite iconic monster to try and tell this bland story with bland characters. In honesty, there's not even a reason for these characters to be in the movie AT ALL. Simply because they just don't make an impact on the anything that's going on in the monster pandemic. Ford is simply just THERE, always acting as a witness even though the movie try's to portray him as the hero of the day. I just really wished to see a better story coming from the human area. Or at least manage to have more depth to those characters. This is why I couldn't help but to like the 1998 version a tad bit more when it came to this aspect simply because they did a great job balancing out characters, story, drama, and the great monster action. And I was simply led to basically believe this movie would conquer that objective just as well. Than at times, the the structure of movie just feels off, making you ask questions. In the entire US military is Ford seriously the only explosive expert? Why attack the monsters in a particular way if you have already learned 2 times before hand that it doesn't work? All the story structure problems just simply feels like a desperate attempt to keep Ford on fire and in middle of the action. Which is the problem with focusing in on one character in the entire movie!!! As appose to having multiple characters who all bring in a different take in each scenario, like the 1998 film. Like I said earlier, don't even mind the side characters because they are just pushed too far out of sight, it's too easy to forget they are in the movie. Not even the high rolling actors/actresses can make up for the practically invisible roles, and really it's just a waste of great talent. But fortunately! The movie is still not a disaster. The visual effects are jaw dropping, the fights are tense. And there were many complaints thrown around about how Godzilla had little screen time. While that could have helped distract audience more from the weak story and straight from the line characters, it built a lot of suspense making every fight we do see even more worth while and a real treat. Especially at the final score where everything just comes together for a real adrenaline rush, and even the story gets better at that point!So what do we have? The plot is a bit too simple for a movie about such a complex creature(s). Good characters are something to be desired, and I don't even blame it on the acting I just believe it's poor character builds. But visually it's fun and does justice for everyone's favorite little monster.Despite many of its problems. I walked away satisfied a pumped with pure excitement! Only wanting to see a sequel to be announced. There's quite a few things that could have been done better. But the 2014 reboot still gets a lot of things right. For that, I highly recommend this movie to anyone ESPECIALLY a real Godzilla fan! So if you're craving a great monster action movie, watch this ASAP! If your a fan who wants to see Godzilla, just be sure to watch it with someone more calm to hold your popcorn for you. You kids enjoy now!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Godzilla Is A Great Summer Blockbuster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3017869/?ref_=tt_urv","TheFilmGuy1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31464766/?ref_=tt_urv","17 May 2014","I went into this film as a summer blockbuster and I will be reviewing it in that mindset too. I'm a fan of big monster movies that are done well. They give me a feeling that other movies don't. I really get sucked in and I love that kind of atmosphere. I think this film reminded me the most of Cloverfield. The monster designs had that kind of feeling to it, and it had a nice build-up to the monster reveal that is amazing. I won't spoil it, but the reveal of Godzilla gave me chills. The build-up really works. The whole film has a lot of build-up and suspense to it that really is great. Many scenes with the monsters are shot at night, but it is done quite well and you can see the monsters well, allowing the darkness to cover up anything that may look unrealistic in a day time scene. The score is also quite nice, and fits well with the the events that are occurring for the most part. I think an issue comes in with the concept of making it very heavily focused on character drama. I love that idea in theory, but it just doesn't come together in this as well as I would have liked it to. Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't the greatest actor in my opinion, and it doesn't work having him as the lead. He gets the job done but it just could have been much better. Bryan Cranston gives a fairly good performance, but I can't help but feel like he wasn't 100% suited to the role, and maybe he was cast in that role just to bring in more people, since Breaking Bad was huge. Not that he doesn't do a good job, it just felt like something was missing at times. Also the movie felt a tad bit cheesier than it should have been at times. It takes a more realistic approach to the whole Godzilla idea but still includes silly stuff, but I think that's just the whole Hollywood blockbuster thing. I went into this wanting some fun and monster scenes that would give me chills, and it delivered. Godzilla is a really great summer film.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Ford Brody(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a bomb disarming expert, living a domesticated life in San Francisco, with his wife, Elle Brody(Elizabeth Olsen) & son, Sam Brody(Carson Bolde). After a tragedy occurred in his childhood, Ford's dad, Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), just can't let go of the past & still believes that whatever happened was not a natural disaster. Meanwhile, after a horrific accident the MUTO(Massive Unknown Terrestrial Organism) monsters are born. This also makes way for Godzilla, an ancient radioactive monster, who faces off against the MUTOs. Now, it is up to the US army which includes Ford, to stop the three monsters from wreaking havoc and destroying the human race. Godzilla is an extremely entertaining movie from start to finish. The special effects are outstanding & the face off between Godzilla & the MUTOs is worth the ticket price alone. Godzilla and the other creatures look menacing. The 3D is effective. However, in the midst of all this there is no coherent story to speak of. Sure, there is a basic plot. However, with so many talented actors in the mix, they could have made Godzilla an emotionally engaging movie, apart from it being a monster movie. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is great as Ford Brody. Ken Watanabe is impressive as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. Bryan Cranston is outstanding as Joe Brody. Cranston was barely given any screen time. I really wish he had a bigger role. Elizabeth Olsen is brilliant as Elle Brody. Carson Bolde is adorable as Sam Brody. Sally Hawkins is effective as Vivienne Graham. Juliette Binoche is amazing as Sandra Brody. Last but not the least, David Strathairn is spectacular as Admiral William Stenz. Godzilla is not a must watch. However, watch it for some monstrous entertainment!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm going to try to avoid spoilers but some things will be impossible to avoid.This isn't your father's Godzilla. This new Godzilla is the biggest he's ever been but it's also the lightest he's ever been, meaning that the allegories and the pathos are either gone or diluted to the point in which you don't really care. The fear of nuclear war and the blame on human kind for their destruction of the Earth is virtually gone.What is here is a monster you want to see win. A monster you want to root for! In this movie Godzilla is the Guardian of Earth! The movie goes the route of the 1970's Godzilla movies in which he is a hero but it isn't as ridiculous as those films. It is the first Godzilla movie to play him as a realistic (as real as a kaiju film can be) good guy and not some Ultra Man wrestling match (not that there is anything wrong with that).The grim horror and futility of the situation that was so clearly portrayed in the trailers is also gone. Gone are the scenes of crushed trains and dead bodies littering the countryside. The movie takes a considerably more palatable approach and aims for the largest possible audience it can get. From the get go you like Godzilla and your love for him grows as the movie goes on. By the end you're cheering for him. The final monster throwdown is EPIC! The only question really worth asking is: Is it better than the 1998 film of the same title? My answer is a resounding YES!!! Just be prepared for it to not be the movie you think it is. The trailers were misleading and it is nothing like any previous Godzilla film. All the actors do a very good job and the plot is solid.The film takes a big page from the GAMERA TRILOGY. If you have no idea what I'm referring to then read on. The Gamera Trilogy ( a trio of Japanese Kaiju films made in the mid 1990's) is highly regarded as the best giant monster films ever made. They are the best model for as crazy a concept as Kaiju being successful and overall blow your socks off AWESOMENESS!! I LOVE THE GAMERA TRILOGY!!!! This movie is pound for pound a remake of the Gamera Trilogy. You could swap Godzilla for Gamera in this new Godzilla film, change nothing else about it, and the film would function perfectly as GAMERA 4.When you watch this movie you'll come out loving Godzilla... albeit for different reason than those you loved about him before. Overall, not the movie I was expecting but definitely a good kaiju film. Will it do well at the box office? I hope so. Should you all go see it? For the reasons I said above, I think you all will like it.Just know that this is not the Japanese Godzilla. This is the NEW American Godzilla. A hero, not a symbol of the mistakes of mankind and the punishment we all deserve, which is what Godzilla REALLY is.Essentially Gareth Edwards did to Godzilla what J.J. Abrams did to Star Trek: Made it accessible to all audiences.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

The other two MUTOs (purposely keeping to just the acronym) seemed somewhat averagely done, female one more so than the male. Film definitely intends to pass through as a special effects spectacle (and does so to a large extent), though, it doesn't hold a candle to Pacific Rim's visual grandiose. Few scenes do leave you agape with wonder: Godzilla's radioactive blast, both the times (second one delivering fatal blow was better than first) Male MUTA's headfirst, full-stretched plunge into seaIn the name of story there isn't much, in fact, saying anything more would ruin the somewhat little plot there is. Maybe just me...I was actually sleepy-eyed once or twice; film could also have been a little more pacy. And...what a big letdown to see Bryan Cranston follow ""Breaking Bad"" with such a film.Overall, you won't be missing much if you skip it, or...just go ahead and watch for that guilty pleasure!I understand the aim was to make a character-based disaster flick with focus on lead character, and the lead character does justify itself. However, everything else, script, acting, direction went haywire. What do you think? 6.3/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Godzilla is directed by Gareth Edwards and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. Godzilla is a film to experience only in theaters, you will not experience Godzilla the same on your TV, phone or computer. Disclosing the plot of the film would ruin the surprise and i would recommend you just see the film for yourself to find out. The acting is amazing, with Bryan Cranston giving an incredible performance as the tortured father that will leave you riveted in every scene he's in. Ken Watanabe is also great in the film playing as the scientist. Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't as good as i would have liked him to be in the film, but he still did a pretty decent job as the son to Bryan Cranston. The CGI and sound effects are on par with Jurassic Park and are probably the best thing about this film. The sound affects truly give Godzilla the roar he deserves. Every scene involving Godzilla is extremely well done. Gareth Edwards has done an amazing job at making you feel the weight of Godzilla's steps as he walks/ swims through anything in his way (it actually feels like your there). The CGI in the film is absolutely groundbreaking with very scene being extremely powerful as you watch huge skyscrapers and complete destruction of cites fall to the ground with ease. The lighting in the film is really dark and gives the viewer a sense of horror as literally god strikes down upon the world. Godzilla is a must see movie experience that can only be experienced at the movies!. Although the acting could have been a little bit better than expected, it didn't deter from the main focus of the film to much which is obviously Godzilla. The CGI and special effects were also incredible and groundbreaking!. I would highly recommend you see Godzilla as soon as possible. ✭✭✭✭","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

It was only 93 minutes long but it spawned a legend that has lasted 60 years and 28 (Japanese) films. I am, of course, referring to the colossus that is Godzilla.Fast forward to 2014 and the newest incarnation of the world's most famous kaiju. Godzilla is an icon and the director, Gareth Edwards, had a mammoth task to overcome; how to bring the monster into the 21st Century without angering the fans.The film begins with some original opening credits; words are redacted before the viewers' eyes, leaving only the names of the cast. This plays out over footage, supposedly from the 1950s, showing radars, military personnel and, finally, a large nuclear explosion at Bikini Atoll (the first of many references to actual events and /or classic Godzilla movies ).We jump to 1999 and meet Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who is investigating the skeleton of a large, prehistoric creature found in the Philippines. Then we zoom over to Japan where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is concerned about the nuclear plant where he works. Disaster obviously ensues and what follows is a sequence reminiscent of the Fukushima disaster which occurred only a few years ago.And now we are up to date. Joe's son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, is happily living in San Francisco with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son.At this point I would like to say that I was slightly disturbed at watching these two young actors playing lovers as, in my head, they are the Maximoff siblings (I know, I know, it's not real but I can still have my opinion).Father and son are eventually reunited and that's where the action really begins.Cranston is brilliant as a father who feels like he has lost it all; both traumatised and unhinged in equal measure. Watanabe is the yin to Cranston's yang; calm and collected to a point where some of his dialogue is barely above a whisper.The younger actors; Taylor-Johnson and Olsen, are not as strong in their roles. Olsen is not given much to do except cry and run. In fact, one downside of this movie is that there is a distinct lack of strong female characters.Taylor-Johnson has a larger part to play but he doesn't quite fulfil the leading man role. He isn't entirely convincing as an action star but neither plausible as desperate family man. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a good actor but he wasn't given enough to work with. The script is basic with Cranston's impassioned ranting (heard in the trailer) as the only stand out part.But to most, it isn't the human cast that people care about. Does the 2014 version of Godzilla make the grade? In short, yes. He bears a resemblance to the original creature but without the look of a rubber suit. You could believe that there is a dinosaur-like monster out there. As you have probably gathered from the many trailers, Godzilla isn't the only kaiju in the movie but I will leave what they are, and why they are there, as a surprise.And then there is THAT roar. Spine tingling with a bass deep enough to turn your internal organs to mush, perfect.At several points in the film, just as the audience thinks it might be treated to a monster smackdown, the focus is always pulled back to the less interesting human story. However, the final battle is worth waiting for, if not a little short. Gareth Edwards has held enough back for the inevitable sequel (pending box office results).There are small niggles here and there but I was always a fan of the King of Monsters (another classic reference) and there is enough here to remind us of the creature we fell in love with.Bonus points if you spot the reference to another kaiju which appears in the first half of the film.Rating - 7/10 www.silverscreensnob.blogspot.com","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Godzilla (2014) - ambitious and admirable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3023874/?ref_=tt_urv","Ironed_Out","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur41775695/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2014","The first thing I thought whilst watching Godzilla and immediately after leaving was just how ambitious an attempt this was from director Gareth Edwards. He transferred from his very good low-budget film 'Monsters' to the other end of the spectrum, confirming, at the very least, he is a director with great potential.What he produces is a fantastic monster movie and what I admired most about the film is that you can see just how ambitious he was when creating it. What he tries to achieve in only 2 hours of film is a credit to himself and the genre of film he is taking on. I am by no means a manic Godzilla fan. I watched the 1998 film when I was around 10 years old and, like any youngster, I had an obsession with Dinosaurs and the like so enjoyed the film immensely. But I am not one of those who has watched every trailer and had it book-marked as a 'must-see' film upon release. What I hoped to see, was a genuine attempt to make a serious, dark monster movie (again, I'm not a massive fan of the monster movie genre) and Edwards absolutely delivered that to my surprise.To sum up his ambition, he tries his absolute best to dedicate as much time as is possible to the main lead (Ford Brody) as much as he does the monsters in this film. It may not pay-off entirely and maybe, in hindsight, he would've done things differently, but all the right intentions were there and it's certainly no failed attempt. We are introduced to his father, charismatically portrayed by Bryan Cranston, who dedicated as much passion as you'd see in any drama, and the fractured relationship between the two. We see Ford Brody's family, albeit briefly, and we are introduced to Elle, another solid performance from Elizabeth Olsen. All three give it their absolute best, although the selection of Aaron Taylor-Johnson may have been one of the areas to address if you had a second chance. He by no means is bad, but a different actor may have felt more believable. Ken Wantanabe and Sally Hawkins are mainly there to give us some insight into the films name-sake, and produce good performances, and the rest of the cast do solid jobs.Edwards also looks to build as much suspense as he can before revealing Godzilla, something which I really liked. You get the pointers. You get references and the odd image, but he doesn't rush it upon us. My view is that once you've had the Godzilla reveal, and you've seen him on screen for 5 minutes, the novelty wears off. So I really liked the fact he tried to build suspense, whilst giving you one of the secondary monsters in this film to keep you engaged. Again, like the selection of some of the cast, he may have done things slightly differently if given the chance to re-make his re-make, but it's a brilliantly ambitious effort to dedicate as much time as he does to the human characters and to try and build suspense instead of just engaging us with 2 hours of mayhem. That comes very much in the second half of the film.Once we get to the hour point, the main course is served. Godzilla is revealed and it turns into an action film for the majority of the remainder. As for Godzilla himself, and the two MUTOs, they are excellently done. I had feared from watching one trailer that Godzilla himself looked a bit 'B-movie'-ish, but he certainly doesn't. The special effects are very good and the set and characters almost become part of a stage for these three beasts who go to war and inflict as much damage as possible, which is why I felt the first hour worked so well. I'm a big fan of action films when done well. I start to lose interest when the action begins after the first minute and continues, non-stop, for the next 90, unless it's done to a really high standard. The destruction scenes in Godzilla are excellent and they are just the right length. I think 90 minutes to 2 hours of that and I would be writing a very different review.And finally, just a word on the atmosphere and the way it's filmed, which I thought was the best and most unique part of Godzilla. There is one scene involving a halo jump that I thought was as good as any scene in any action film. The background music, the way it was shot (through the goggles of the main character), the darkness and the flickering lighting, sporadically revealing parts of the monster below as the men fell to what looked like hell. It was an incredible scene and the highlight of the movie. There are other scenes which leave their mark, where we get slight reveals of Godzilla but very rarely, in the entire film, do we see him in his entirety, another part which I found worked well.All in all, Edwards and his cast can be incredibly proud of what they attempted and, ultimately, achieved. They decided to go for a serious tone, for a solid cast of actors either on the up or well established, and produce an atmospheric monster movie with an underlying human tale. Did it have faults? Of course. But I think the scale of this movie, the expectation upon the crew and the fact this is a film very early on in a promising directors career path means that the negatives should be ignored and replaced with the strengths of what this movie is. It's as good as you could hope of a summer monster blockbuster, and can take it's place not just in the monster genre, but in the action/drama category too.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

It means there is a lot of action going on almost every minute. I really enjoyed looking at all damages caused by monsters, true eye candy. Before I have started watching it I was hoping for something similar to Cloverfield (2008) - if you have not seen it well it is one of my favourite movies it means GTFO and watch it now! Unfortunately it is far from it it's not as dark,gloomy and scary as Cloverfield. Main focus is on people and their actions while monsters are shown only sometimes and very briefly. The camera work is great when they are showing monsters, it really makes huge impact and you can feel the seriousness of situation. I actually had to check if it's not the same director who made Cloverfield, as I was seeing lots of similarities, which of course is great. The Godzilla looks very good although too much steroids for my taste. Final fight was amazing and I really liked the ending.This movie could have failed on so many levels but it didn't! and I am glad for it! tgchan's rating: 7.5 / 10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

No matter what you imagine to see before entering this movie , it's not what you think at all. It's a new version of Godzilla , new take for the story in everything. Some will like this new version while others will definitely not. All I can say that Godzilla is well drawn , I like this design better than the previous one in 1997. It's HUGE really HUGE and it's voice is so beautiful and scary. The graphics and sound effects are amazing. There are two main problems with the movie that they could have handled better and it might made the audience much happier. First of all it's a Godzilla movie so we are expecting to only see Godzilla and it's destruction not people maybe if they are running for their lives or being killed we would watch them other than that we don't want it. Second one is the dialogue a lot of people in the movie and a lot of talking. All we ever needed is more Godzilla screening time in the movie and more fighting. At the end GODZILLA is really the king of monsters , the one and only monster.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

After a nuclear meltdown in Japan Joe Brody (Cranston) is forced to flee his home. Nothing ever set well with him about with the whole accident. When he is caught trying to sneak back into the city he is caught and his son Ford (Taylor-Johnson) must go get him. When a similar event happens Joe and his son are enlisted to help figure out what is wrong. It turns out that Joe's instincts were right. I will open by saying that I have never really been a big fan of Godzilla. I have only watched one of the original series and the 90's one with Matthew Broderick. Going into this one my only real expectation was that it will be better than that one. I was not wrong. That said the movie I think tried to do too much. The first half of the movie was watching the scientists try to figure out what was going on. When you sit down to watch a monster movie you really want to get right to the action. This is a movie I will review in two aspects. When the monsters were not on the screen the movie was a little slow moving and hard to stay interested in. The entire time you are just thinking blah, blah, blah lets see action. On the other hand when the monsters are on screen and fighting the movie is entertaining and I could have watched a movie of just that. Once again not being a fan of the Godzilla movies I do have to say this was better than I expected I just wish there was more of the monster aspect. Overall, better then expected and worth seeing but be prepared for the movie to drag a little when the action isn't happening. I give this a low B+.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He's just a hound for Godzilla films, and he loved it. I like old monster films, but this is the 21st Century, and everything is different now. But I admit I was impressed. We can't believe in floppy rubber suit monsters anymore; but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy some good old monster bashing when it's done well. And I think it is here.The FX are very good - but this is not just another comic book FX romp. I actually came to feel for the Big Green guy here. And while I didn't quite feel so deeply for the humans, I think they (both the characters and actors portraying them) did what they had to do under the circumstances - they were all quite believable to me. As for the action - I can't believe anyone found the first part dull; it isn't monster-ridden, but it segues into the monster action quite well. And there's more to Godzilla himself here than some critics are reporting. There are lots of memorable moments through-out the film. The moment when the MUTO walks by the while the soldiers are lying on the bridge trying not to be noticed really had me on edge. And I won't spoil the final battle, but it's a keeper.I found the whole very riveting and entertaining. It moves well and is well made. That the heaviest action moments are played out between the monsters but seen through the eyes of human observers worked well for me. I really felt like I was there, I saw as much as I needed to, to be thrilled and entertained. And that's the word for it - entertainment. ""Citizen Kane"" this ain't, but it's a great movie for chills and thrills (and frankly there ain't many of those these days). The old Big Green is back - and he's cleaning house the new style way! - What more could you want from a giant monster movie for Godzilla's sake!","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

I grew up watching Godzilla and have seen every film he has ever been in. So going into this, I had high expectations. The movie did not disappoint terribly but there are many flaws that could have been easily fixed. It is still an enjoyable film that offers many moments and scenes that are worth the ticket and even worth paying $35 for a combo pack once it is released to retailers.I want to focus on the good things first. This film has a star- studded cast and just about everyone delivers at expectations and beyond expectations. The CGI is state of the art and some of the sequences are thrilling. The action is some of the best I have seen in quite some time. This film is being compared to Pacific Rim by many but I must say that Pacific Rim was nowhere near as good as Godzilla. Pacific Rim was what the trailers promised and nothing more. Godzilla had many surprises and even some golden Easter eggs that I will not spoil. The cinematography in this film is beautiful and very jaw dropping at times. Edwards did a magnificent job directing and I can't wait to see what he does next. Bryan Cranston was amazing as always. Aaron Taylor Johnson dazzled in his first major role in a serious film. Elizabeth Olsen was great also. When director Gareth Edwards said that this film was going to be like Jaws in the sense that you wouldn't see Godzilla until an appropriate time, he delivered. Godzilla has more of a classic look and the antagonists in this film also impressed. Edwards really tried to shoot this film from the eyes of an onlooker and this created a very gratifying experience for the viewers. Its plot is very well thought out and offers quite a few twists and turns that the trailers didn't spoil. Overall, the positives for the film are quite indulging for Gojira fans everywhere. I encourage anyone who loves Godzilla to see this film.Now for the negatives, I will not go too in depth to spoil anything but I will give an overview. There are some gaping plot holes and also some incredibly unrealistic moments in this film that obviously sought for dramatic scenery rather than realism. One of the lead actors in the cast was incredibly disappointing and it really hurt my overall view of the film. There are many lapses of human interaction where things happen and you wonder how they did in the first place. There is also something in the beginning that happens that will kind of make you feel mislead. Speaking of misleading, the trailers, in my own opinion, do not do this film a lot of justice. There are a lot of scenes in the trailers that are not in the film, which made me feel disappointed as well. It is not as dark as has been advertised and sometimes the film even feels lighthearted. Finally, my biggest disappointment was the score. It was not brooding and dark like the trailers made it seem to be and also it was a bit overbearing at times.Overall, this film is definitely worth seeing but do not expect an Oscar-winning, top 250 film (though Captain America did make it into the top 250 for some reason). The film is incredibly fun and offers many moments when the audience had to cheer. I encourage all Godzilla fans to check it out and I can't wait to see what the special features on the combo pack will reveal when that moment comes.-Charles Dunphey (Author/Filmmaker/Film Critic/Graphic Novel Writer & Artistcharlesdunphey(dot)blogspot(dot)com","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

This is old school Godzilla, with all the big time mayhem and epic moments of corny that you would expect. It is a modern movie that tries to stay true to the nature of what Godzilla is and means, even though it is an Americanization of the franchise and that shows through at times.This movie, like most Godzilla classics, starts out rather slow, throwing barely probable science at the watcher until the action starts. And to be fair, if I was looking at what they were looking at I'd probably chuck my science manuals out the window too. Overall the monster fight scenes were just okay, but there were a few shining moments of awesome in there. The humans in the movie were given a bit too much screen time, but in the end this movie was pretty darn good.8 of 10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"9","/10","The Most Badass Godzilla You Will Ever See","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3016689/?ref_=tt_urv","fridaynightdestination","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21947998/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2014","Godzilla was awesome. Now, now, it isn't perfect, but overall it was extremely entertaining. Lets dive right in. Also, the movie actually shows the title in beginning! Most movies don't do it till the end or not at all! That annoys me! So here we go.First off, the story was interesting. I enjoyed seeing the military action that took place against Godzilla. David Straharin and Ken Wantabe played an interesting role in it. Now the film definitely follows the role of Aaron Taylor Johnsons character named Ford Brody. He is in it for almost every scene. Ford Brody is an interesting character. You do wanna see him get back to his family. You wanna see him and wife meet again. But by the time it gets to the end you don't really care about him and you can guess why. The whole government conspiracy was interesting, and Bryan Cranston played a very interesting role in that.Acting- The acting was good, mainly from Bryan Cranston. While he won't win any Oscars, Bryan did a very good job with his character. Ken Wantabe did a very good job and so did David Stratharin. The beautiful Elizabeth Olsen did a good job. So overall, good acting.CGI- AMAZING! WOW! I FELT LIKE I COULD REACH OUT (and touch faith) THE MONSTERS!The MUTOS- Yeah, the other monsters, something I have been curious about seeing for a while. I mean, WOW were they badass. I wasn't sure if I was gonna like them, but they are badass and terrifying. Little kids that are gonna be brought to this movie aren't gonna be scared of Godzilla. They are gonna be scared of the MUTOs.Godzilla- Yeah, the reason why we came to see the movie. How was he? AWESOME! They portrayed him so well. While it would have been nice to see him more, every second he is in is badass. And the very second after you see him that is a second of not seeing him, you want to see him again. You just want to see him AGAIN AND AGAIN! The movie does make you be patient, but the final act delivers. This movie has the most badass Godzilla you will ever see.Visual Style- The Visual Style of the movie was very nice. Very good cinematography. 3D-Well done. Not the best 3D I've ever seen, nowhere near of the level of this years The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or 300: Rise of an Empire, but the 3D still delivered, especially in the rainy scenes.Here is quick pros and cons+ Godzilla is badass+ Great soundtrack+ Amazing CGI+ Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson) is actually likable+ Bryan Cranston+ The MUTOS were awesome+ Good 3D+ The Last 30 Mins Is AWESOME+ The Atomic Breath+ The Way Godzilla Is PortrayedOverall, while it can get slow and boring and it needed more of the title monster, Godzilla is overall a very awesome, entertaining, and badass experience that needs to be seen in IMAX 3D. Godzilla is a very good film that would make Ishiro Honda proud. 9.0/10","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

I have a working knowledge of the original films by Toho mostly through other reviewers like James Rolfe. I never grew up with the originals, so my understanding for the phenomena of kaiju was limited. Coming into this movie though I was anxious to see what would come of the work and devotion to the past, and I was for the most part pleased with what I saw. The portrayals of the main family in their efforts to stay in contact were well done. That storyline often carried some emotional weight that I don't often see in a summer blockbuster.I liked the creature design on Godzilla and the M.U.T.O.s. I thought they showed true menace and were quite threatening. I only wish that I could have seen more discussion and portrayal of the titular character. Godzilla showing up halfway through a two-and-a-half-hour movie creates a bit of anxiety. And for a film that's supposed to be kicking off a new series, it really does very little to attempt to talk about the where and why of the giant lizard.When I did get to see Godzilla though, I wasn't disappointed. All the elements that made him an intense fighting force were there made even better by grounded motion capture performance and trademark radioactive breath put to good use.I left the theater feeling good, and that's better than I could have hoped for.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The cast was good, especially Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe and I also liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the lead who certainly has come a long way from Kick-Ass. The special effects looked really good, but the story itself was disappointing which let the whole movie down, and the ending was terrible. I will not put in any spoilers except to say that the ending was rushed and goes against the spirit of Godzilla. It was as if the movie had run out of ideas. Unless Godzilla is rebooted, I won't care for a sequel.At least the 1998 version of Godzilla directed by Ronald Emmerich was slightly more enjoyable, despite the fact it received a mauling by critics.5/10","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

If you're not, buy a large tub of popcorn and extra large soda and go see what is already the best movie of the summer! It's an old fashioned monster movie in the truest sense. There's no story, the dialogue is shallow and only meant to push the plot along, and the acting borders on the melodramatic. But the real genius is how it has the feel of Godzilla from the 50's, achieved in part by the 3D effects that help simulate the backdrop special effects of yesteryear. Even the music is reminiscent of the over-the-top scores from the 50's. (Maybe Alexandre Desplat, the busiest composer in Hollywood, will finally win an Oscar.) It uses modern technology to give the feel of an old black and white summer popcorn flick. Brilliant! Younger and unsavvy movie goers probably won't get it, but it seems perfectly clear to me what they're doing here. This doesn't mean the special effects don't look good; quite the contrary. The monster and destruction scenes are edge of your seat thrilling! A movie like this would never be nominated for best picture, but in a certain way it probably should be for its achievement in throwback film making using modern sensibilities. Genius!","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, there are enough silly aspects to undermine its greatness. The sound of the movie probably best exemplifies the unevenness of the movie. At times the sound truly enhances the feel of the film submerging you into its reality. While at other times it removes you from this submergence with the question ""why is this sound a part of this movie now?"". Many of the visuals of the film are astonishing. While others simply make you wonder what am I looking at and make you want to tilt your head to try and get a better view. Perhaps the worst aspect of the movie is the lack of smart choices made by its characters. Almost every character in the movie with speaking parts of more than a couple lines does something to make me think ""That is pretty stupid"". Despite these shortcomings, Godzilla is worth watching for most movie goers. There is enough originality and interesting choices to make most viewers feel they did not waste their time.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

For the rest of the time you're focused on Ford played by Aaron Taylor Johnson aka Kickass. His character is a army bomb diffuser or disposer I cant recall which one for sure. He has been separated from his wife after going on a risky trip with his estranged father played by Bryan Cranston. Now he is trying to get home but he's stuck in between 3 giant monsters all duking it out. I failed to take much enjoyment from the humans in this movie and the star of the show was present so little I couldn't get much enjoyment from him either. I felt like the movie kept teasing me and teasing me, showing you brief glimpses of Godzilla and showing you a few seconds of a fight here and there. The method would've been fine if the final battle was epic enough to justify all the teasing. Unfortunately the true finale of the movie didn't reward my patience the way I would've hoped. The special effects here are amazing and Godzilla looks so awesome. And you need to watch this in IMAX to truly get submerged into the sheer scope of this movie. There are defiantly hints at a sequel and a possible reference to the next monster to show up but ultimately this movie left me feeling like I had a boring orgasm after 2 hours of foreplay. I came home and wanted to watch Cloverfield which in my opinion is a superior monster movie. In Cloverfield even with the lack of the monster I cared enough about the humans thanks to the filming style to still really enjoy it. Godzilla didn't give me enough monster and it gave me a so so human story. I cant help but feel a little underwhelmed but this is still a great movie and there is a lot of fun to be had.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is successfully achieved as the film proposes a darker, grittier and more authentic feel than its predecessor. Godzilla is sleek ,beautifully crafted and it's obvious that the studio spared no expense in rendering a Hollywood monster that would leave audiences wanting more. Unfortunately this is to the detriment of the film itself as the title character is more often than not overshadowed by both it's Kaiju and human opposition. Edward's attempt at blending both monster porn and a compelling story of human courage ultimately misfires as he fails to strike the mean between both approaches. These two primary concepts are underdeveloped and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's bland clichéd performance highlights the lack of attention given to characters who show less life than there primordial counterparts. However Edwards does step up to the mainstream with confidence and his Spielbergian influences add some degree of quality to an altogether under-whelming experience. The slow tease introduction of the showpiece à-la Spielberg's Jaws is certainly a step in the right direction but the lack of a payoff ultimately negates the positive intentions. This along with the never thoroughly explored 'Man versus Nature' angle only aids in emphasizing how much more this film could and should have been. Although sandwiched between some heavy hitting summer blockbusters, such as X-men, Godzilla is sure to attract significant audience numbers but with the final product delivering less Jurassic Park and more Lost World, it is undecided as to whether or not this is the film that will resurrect a franchise already dead in the water.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even though it was barely godzilla in the movie it still lived up to the hype for me. I was actually expecting this movie to be OK but not great but the acting was good the story the directing. For the director to only have one movie under his belt shows that if you put your mind to it you can create a fantastic movie. Walter White isn't in the movie much but when he's there he makes us want to hear him say ""say my name"". The Olsen sister did a pretty good job and kick ass did a good job as well even though he was mono tone but he was the main character in the film. I don't want to spoil anything but when Godzilla fights it's epic but you wish there could be more kind of like pacific rim had but it teases til you get the final showdown at the end where he goes on full brawl head to head like he's in a WWE match. Another thing that was great in this movie was the score. The music had me getting goose bumps it was monstrous which I'm sure it was intended. The guy from inception was kind of my favorite character because he knew what was going on with nature and man and the metaphor with the movie is that godzilla is a god a watchful protector a dark knight lol just kidding I had to say that but yeah godzilla is meant to help and is the hero of the movie. You won't be disappointed but just know if you want to see more godzilla then this is not the movie for you but you should see it because it makes you think what if it happened","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

You didn't see the actual monster in many scenes, if at all, and it looked like it had a darker and more realistic feel to it than most monster movies. Then, to my disappointment, the movie is just the complete opposite. Once the monkey is out of the cage, it's just an endless monster battle. The plot is ridiculous. Most of the time, decisions made by the people in command are obviously horrendous. Acting was sub par. Only thing this movie does well is special effects, which are quite spectacular. But that can't help save it from misery, as the stupidity in this movie just keeps on piling up throughout.I really don't understand the raving reviews this movie has gotten on this site. Anyway, obviously people have different taste, but this is just a warning, that if you thought that this was going to be a different type of monster movie, with intense, dark, gritty atmosphere, you were wrong, and you will be disappointed, just like me.

The story is changed from the previous editions and is a fresh take on the tale. Please keep in mind that my reference for that is having watched the 1998 edition of Godzilla which had Godzilla attacking Manhattan.The pros include great CGI, a fresh story-line and a whole lot of *new* I did leave the theater a little underwhelmed though. Despite the story being a new take, it tended to get confused with two separate story-lines - the human interest angle and the actual Godzilla portion. Both those portions, to me, seemed a little half baked and I wished for more.I just left thinking that there wasn't enough of Godzilla in the tale, and as I don't want to spoil the plot, I do believe many of you will take away the same feeling after leaving the theater. I believe great special effects isn't always enough, and though the whole tale is a work of fiction, certain plot movements are beyond plausibility even considering that...But is a fairly entertaining tale, meant for the big screen. Lots of popcorn and you may leave satiated, but not necessarily fulfilled.Thats just my two cents though ;)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

From a technical and aesthetic level, the film is unmatched by anything seen in 2014 thus far. Exhibiting such creative styles of directing, Edwards hones in on all of Godzilla's personality traits that have made him such an icon to the cinematic universe. Everything from his choices of screen shots, brilliantly set up by Oscar-nominated Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, and his approval of Alexandre Desplat's haunting score, Edwards successfully brings Godzilla in to the new century with admiration and respect. This is one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters of its kind since Jurassic Park.There's nothing that can benefit any person seeking to see the film if I reveal any plot points. I did an admirable job of steering clear of any plot spoilers that could have ruined the experience. I implore all movie goers to exercise the same discipline for any future franchises or films they are anxiously awaiting. What I will speak about is the at times, uneven script by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham. Borenstein's most notable credit is Swordswallowers and Thin Men (2003) and Callaham has had a hand in The Expendables franchise and Doom. The first third of the film is succinctly riveting, and full of rich and layered characters that lay an incredible foundation for the story. After a key character is disposed of forty minutes in, the story takes clichéd approaches to action heroes that both feel unnatural and unrealistic. Understanding that this is science fiction, I need a strong level of believability for a film to succeed. There are several instances that eye-rolling occurred and annoyance set in.From an acting stand point, there are many great things that are being displayed. Bryan Cranston is a true highlight, full of ferocity and emotion that settles the viewer as much as he creates nervous tension. I'll fully admit to gushing over the reality that now, Academy Award nominated actress Sally Hawkins, is now in a summer blockbuster franchise and slowly becoming a mainstream entity. As the lead, Aaron Taylor-Johnson executes when appropriate and challenges his own abilities as we've come to miss in films like Savages and Kick-Ass. In this franchise, Taylor-Johnson illuminates as a more confident, detailed version of ""Jake Sully"" (Sam Worthington) from Avatar. Another true highlight is Elizabeth Olsen, who continues to be one of my favorite actresses working without THE role yet. Though she's minimized to cheap crying and terrified screams, Olsen stands out.The rest of the all-star cast: David Strathairn, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, and Victor Rasuk are all solid performers in otherwise, underwritten and/or misfired roles.Production Designer Owen Paterson builds an apocalyptic world to an outstanding degree, especially in one that takes place in present day. He's excelled in things like this before with past efforts in The Matrix and V for Vendetta. The Visual Effects team is simply astonishing. Godzilla looks superb. Every detail, nuance, and mannerism is marvelously captured. It's the strongest visual medium that the year has offered. If there's one thing that you can take to the Oscar bank, it's the Visual Effects team. I am also completely enamored by the Sound Mixing and Sound Editing that was audibly enticing to the ears.Godzilla is pure fun and pure entertainment, no matter how you slice it. If you're looking for something to offer up some great laughs, visuals, and thrills, you have it all right here. There's more depth to the film, something that many will find and latch onto however, it's not a complete home run like one would have hoped. It's still vastly superior to the garbage that was the 1998 film. This Godzilla is just fine. By the way, if you can, IMAX 3D is just what the doctor ordered on this film. Do yourself a favor, and fill the prescription.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Godzilla(2014) is terrible from the start. By erecting pointless character's driven to meaningless climaxes. It's as if the Studio and Production Team had a meeting about how to turn a great creature feature like Godzilla, and redeem it from the 1998 garbage Director Roland Emmorich shat out. So they sat around, ordered some pf changs, and couldn't think of crap. ""We need some inspiration, fellas!"" Says director Gareth Edwards, so instead of popping in GODZILLA(1954), he pops in CLOVERFIELD into the DVD player. They watched the entire film attentively. ""Well now that's what our viewers WANT! Lots of deep, guttural brass noises and shaky bass. ""And tails! And glimpses of monster feet and tails, sir!"" Says the Assistand Director. ""I think we need more inspiration, though..."" The director says. So he pops in BATTLEFIELD: LOS ANGELES. Because that's what we need. More MILITARY! And CHARACTERS! More characters not to care about!!!

Oh, and squidward as the navy general and that Japanese guy from Last Samurai who literally just gives us this deep, confused stare off-frame the entire f*cking movie. I'm serious! Watch the movie, and watch EVERY scene Ken Watanabe and you'll laugh. I need to do like a montage or something of all his scenes staring off camera with his mouth open and his eyes all shaky. I could continue but I don't want to. That's my review. my advice is if you haven't seen Godzilla(2014), save yourself some money, go on Youtube, and watch the trailer a couple times...then watch the old films from 1994 and back.","18 out of 41 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Remarkable Reboot from Gareth Edwards","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3017333/?ref_=tt_urv","sohansurag","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21382612/?ref_=tt_urv","17 May 2014","Godzilla, a legend that rhymes with the celebrated monsters of all time, the likes of King Kong and Frankenstein. Of all the summer blockbusters, Gareth Edward's Godzilla would undoubtedly be among the top. The previews were haunting and thrilling enough to build hype. The anticipation it'd built is understandable, considering Roland Emmerich's very mediocre Godzilla. Almost 15 years after, this years iteration had loads of promises to keep and going in for the movie I had my hopes way too high like any other Godzilla fan. And without further ado, I'd like to say I was satiated.I was welcome to a customized IMAX intro which served as a great node to the monster in question and then to a scene where Ken Watanabe's character, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa travels to Philippines to investigate a mysterious incident, the shots constantly reminded me of a movie from the past decade, from the aerial views of a copter to Ichiro's hat. Had John William's score been playing in the background I would have mistaken it for Jurassic Park. Shortly after, we are introduced to Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody working in an Atomic plant in Tokyo and there on it served a heavy dose of the grim things that was about to come. While the characters are well written, it takes a long long time to get to the juicy bits. But believe me, your first glimpse of Godzilla will be well worth the slow burn and the tension thus built and works very much in favor of the over all tone of the movie. The humongous beast himself is a sight to behold when he makes his appearance, hulking over buildings like a true god. The monster's design stays true to its roots, albeit with all intricate details, as opposed to its redesign in Emmerich's Godzilla which seemed like a giant Iguana. I'll leave the details for you to experience it for yourself.Gareth Edwards was a brilliant choice as the director and Godzilla shares a similar style with his previous movie, Monsters. He has done what Christopher Nolan did with Batman. Rooting the characters in a believable world that we could all relate to. He was able to achieve the tension and dread as well as the impending fate of humanity and then leading to an amazing, jaw-dropping monster scuffle finale.A charismatic Bryan Cranston plays Joe Brody, a grief torn husband who won't stop at anything to find the mysterious atomic plant calamity that killed his wife. I was surprised as there was no applause seeing Cranston on screen, after all he was our favorite Walter White. His performance was awe inspiring and demanded nothing less than a standing ovation. Later on we are introduced to Aaron Johnson, Brody's son, and initially felt fine for the role though later on it seemed like he was in no hurry and felt a bit bland for the role. The world, his wife and kid's lives are at stake and this guy is acting all super cool. Elizabeth Olsen played Aaron's wife and while she had a good presence her absence wouldn't have made much difference either. Ken Watanabe displayed a good performance, but nothing to write home about.Let's get onto the bad bits now. There were these sequences where the monsters would be on a full on collision course and guess what? It'd be shown on a teeny TV screen in snippets .What?! I mean saving the best for the finale always seems like a good idea, but only on paper. It might work well for an indie/TV movie like Monsters but for a movie with a gargantuan budget like this, it was a tad bit disappointing. I understand Gareth was focusing on all the drama but being a fanboy I would have loved to see more Godzilla and MUTO going head to head. It takes over a whopping 60 minutes to have a glimpse of Godzilla and till then we had to sit through the human drama. It was so severely trying not to be Pacific Rim by injecting more drama and less monster brawl. This is where Pacific Rim won, it was all about the Robots vs Giant Monsters, yes it was pure style over substance but yes it was also what I had asked and paid for. Alexandre Desplat's score was well synced with the visuals capturing tension and haste in equal proportions, but at times, felt a bit subtle as well.1998′s Godzilla was in no means an intolerable movie, it had loads of monster action topped with another ton of cheese and my own 5th grade self had loved it at the time. But being a grown up I found way too many flaws to love it as much as I had back then. Gareth's Godzilla is much more dark in tone and leaves no room for cheese or humor and instead its a huge step up from its predecessor. Huge credits should go for the visual effects team making the monsters believably enthralling. This is almost a perfect reboot for the franchise which has some much needed heart and drama.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Special effects are bigger and better than ever before. I saw it in Imax (worth it for the big screen and big sound, not so much for the retrofitted 3-D, which is nothing special).If you were expecting meaty roles for top-notch actors Bryan Cranston, Julette Binoche, and Ken Watanabe, too bad. The first 2 are killed off early, and Watanabe mainly just stands around with his mouth open (tho he and sidekick nuclear engineer Victoria Graham do get a couple of minutes to unload the only exposition the screenwriters figured the audience would sit still for). At no point does anyone question why creatures that feed on electromagnetic energy need such huge mouths and so many teeth.Elizabeth Olsen is utterly wasted in a throw-away fretting-mom role, and the nominal hero of the whole shebang, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (much buffed up since regularly getting his ass kicked in the title role in Kick-Ass) stoicizes as a Marine lieutenant thru a series of disasters that he just happens to be in time to witness as he follows nature-balancing Gojira and its 2 new nemeses, a male and female mating pair of MUTOs, across the Pacific where they will jointly devastate San Francisco for a change, after warming up with Honolulu and Las Vegas.Blessedly, the movie-makers let us see the creatures fairly early (instead of teasing us with obscure distance shots and partial glimpses for much of the movie) and at full size. Unlike the Transformer movies and Pacific Rim, you can actually see who's doing what to whom else at reasonable distances, and at speeds resembling real time. Good shot composition and no soft-pedaling of the destruction involved, tho the PG-13 rating is preserved by showing us essentially none of what had to be a gargantuanly massive toll of deaths and injuries.Godzilla gets bigger with every incarnation, and this one is no exception, making it perfectly believable that some forces of nature (like Antarctic glaciers, sunspots, and giant radioactive Japanese lizards) are so powerful that humanity is helpless before them. Really, with CGI technology as advanced as it's gotten, there's no upper limit on creature size, certainly not the frequently and cheerfully ignored square-cube rule. I expect that soon we'll be seeing Galactus gracing the big screen.Of more substantial interest, the opening trailers included one for Christopher Nolan's latest mind-blower, Interstellar, due out Nov. 7. It's not the case that the trailer alone is worth the price of admission, but it's value added.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

In a polar opposite of the lighthearted rendition 16 years ago, Godzilla is now radioactively gloomy, bringing a more nuclear oriented plot. It opens well with good human interaction for first half, but sadly the momentum dies down in lieu of gargantuan fight, which is somewhat acceptable and expected just by looking at the title.The cast looks a bit stumbled with the sparse dialogue and repetitive scenes. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody does look the part of a marine with ancient history with unnatural disaster. He carries himself decently until the last act where he stares into the ruins or eyes of behemoth far too often. Ken Watanabe is utterly underutilized, channeling Mark Wahlberg from The Happening. He seems so confused the entire time, even at ordinary moments, and at rare scenes where he's given script, his role is reduced to giving catchphrases.Bryan Cranston as Ford's father does a fine performance setting the somber tone at first half. His part is by far the most emotional one; it's a good set-up for the reveal and sells the menace of the creature. The movie works by building the anticipation and not prematurely showcasing the giant, although in some scenes the story progress is told by exposition, either by news or reports. It makes the encounters feel rather cut short, it could've used more visual delight before switching gear to next sequence.Graphic has more somber atmosphere, at later parts the movie even embraces horror vibe, completely with eerie humming. The drab color palette adds more terror, there's little quizzical tone to be had here. While it's not as colorful as the recent monster movie Pacific Rim, the theme holds consistently. Effects are put to good use; unworldly battles are done with powerful impact. Camera angles often tease the massive beast, occasionally focusing on its scale or eye to enhance the size. Contrasting color, with each passing setting, delivers the solemn ambiance.There is discrepancy while the story moves forward, human interaction is increasingly reduced towards the end. The movie could've maintained the relationship, but it is certainly lacking at last act. No amount of child actors put in dire situations, and one dog, can bait more sympathy from audience. Script itself is lacking, often leaving the characters glaring emotionless to the screen. A bit coincidence or plot luck is also at played to fit Ford Brody to the scenes, which understandable in disaster movie. Regardless of the flaws, Godzilla serves as a colossus carnage leaving destruction on its wake but not on the original material.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Is it better then the 1998 film with the same name...........YES, hands down it better then that film. Is it a good film sadly for me no. I won't lie there were some bits i did enjoy but not a lot f it. If you enjoy watching The America military prove how dumb they are by trying to blow things up with out thinking, even after someone said it's a bad idea............This movie is for you. If you enjoy watching every America movie Cliché.......... This Film is for you. If you enjoy giant monsters causing mass amounts of damage........... The last 20-30 minutes are for you. I don't mind slow build up but you have to have a strong cast and characters to keep you interested. Apart from Bryan Cranston the cast was well boring. I have never been to a movie where i was sighing and groaning even rolled my eyes waiting for something to happen. When stuff did happen to begin with it was in small dose teasing the monster which was enjoyable. Sadly thought you see most of the movie through Aaron Taylor-Johnson eyes so you miss most of the monster action and focus of the what the Military is doing. The Visual are stunning and Godzilla was beautiful. The other creature on the other hand thew visual impress was very generic looking, even willing to say it was from Pacific Rim. I really wanted to enjoy this film but sadly i felt a little angry after leaving the cinema. There are some good moment in this film and i know some people that will enjoy it. Sadly thought it not for me. I'd rather watch the Original Godzilla. Also there know bonus scene after the credit so don't stay till the end.My Honest score 6.5/10.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

However, the director and scriptwriter of this movie are completely lost from the start of the movie. The dialogs are incompetent, childish, in consequent and sloppy. Situations change with the blink of an eye containing big continuity mistakes. Personal relations between characters are superficial, consecutive scenes seems nothing to do with the previous ones, everything is kind of messy.

This movie's approach is more serious than Pacific Rim's for example but not too much so. Visually the movie is absolutely tremendous. The beautiful cinematography conjures up some jaw dropping scenes and the CGI monsters and the destruction they cause are quite awe-inspiring. The way they dealt with the fighting between the monsters and the soldiers also made sense and really highlighted the enormity of these creatures. I'm glad they set a good part of the monster action at night so the monsters aren't always blasted front and center on the screen so we can use our imaginations to fill in the gaps. When the monsters are truly revealed, it's hard not to get chills at that point. I thought there was just the right amount of Godzilla in the film but for those who expect this to be another Pacific Rim there might be too little of the big guy.I perhaps wanted more heart from Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford Brody who was a bit generic as the movie's protagonist (though I think that's due to the script because Johnson put in a great performance in Kick-Ass). Bryan Cranston delivered the best performance in this film with great emotion as the nuclear engineer and Ford's dad Joe Brody. They also play well off each other. Elizabeth Olsen plays Ford's wife who is also a nurse but we don't really see much of her in that role despite all of the destruction around them. I have no doubt some of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor but I guess something has to give when you try to get this many characters in and keep the movie at two hours. I also wanted to see more Ken Watanabe, I thought his character was a tad under used. Then again this movie is more about how humanity overall would deal with a situation like this so it's understandable that all of the characters don't quite have the depth we might hope. Despite some of the underdeveloped characters, I did get really immersed in the movie and had chills in many places. The great sound design and rousing score together with the truly awesome visuals definitely helped there. I was gripped by the movie throughout and the buildup to the showdown in the end was expertly crafted by director Gareth Edwards. If you're looking to have a good time at the movies, Godzilla definitely fits the bill.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

Scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is not convinced, and determined to discover the truth. The characters are very well developed, the viewer certainly sides with them and their motivations. The plot is very different from previous Godzilla films, and recommended for an alternative Godzilla story.The creature is given an unexpected additional weapon in its arsenal that is used to great effect and well explained. However, what the film had in character and plot, it lacked in violence and threat. The effort they went to with CGI for the creature while swimming, or being generally observed, clearly didn't extend to CGI fight scenes. The fight scenes were slow and unexciting. The overall damage caused was below the expected scale, and unintentional. To say that recent Spiderman movies were more violent than this Godzilla movie would be entirely accurate. Tension was well created, but the resulting scene was often underwhelming.Watch for a different take on Godzilla, with new monster abilities!Michael NewtonCameras Lie","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Until I let it sit in and the more and more I think about it, it's kinda boring and underwhelming in some aspects.The positives:
Gareth Edwards's direction is absolutely amazing. He shoots Godzilla low and from human perspective which gives Godzilla a grand scale. The last 10 minutes are also really good and some of the best in Godzilla history.The negatives:
The human characters are really boring, besides Bryan Cranston. Everyone else just seems either bored or uninterested. It's like they were only there for their paycheck and could care less how they acted. And it's weird because the cast is full of really talented actors and actresses. While I praise Edwards for his direction, unfortunately, he doesn't know how to direct actors. The movie is also very dark but not like dark-toned but dark like where are the colors? You can't see the monsters fight at the end and you can barely see what the humans are doing at night.Edwards is very ambitious for teasing Godzilla. He doesn't come onto screen until nearly an hour in. I like the teasing but what kills it, is that the human characters are boring and when Godzilla is not on the screen, they are and it can be tough to sit through. This isn't a traditional Godzilla movie. This one tries to be more grounded and focus more on the humans, which I'm all on board for, but the characters are just terrible. But at least you know their motives and stuff.The movie also focuses more on the MUTOs than Godzilla. When you really look at it, it's more of the MUTO's movie than Godzilla's. It's not how much screen time Godzilla has is the problem, it's how it is used. They pretty much use all of it at the end and like I said, when Godzilla is not on the screen the boring human characters are. I don't have a problem with the movie being more character-based than action-packed but as I said, what kills the movie are the characters and since they have about 80% screen time, it can be rough.To sum things up: Ambitious but at times boring. Not the worst Godzilla movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The mind-blowing effects must have resembled the original Gojira in the 1954 - The CGI used in this movie gives the same impact as the physical effect used that day. I can say this even though I hadn't watched any Gojira before, because I am a huge fan of Ultraman series - which is another Japanese TOKUSATSU show(I have to capitalize it to show IMDb that wasn't a spelling mistake), first made in 1966 with the concept of watching a Godzilla every week on TV. The fight scene reminds me of the Ultraman fight I watched in my childhood. While there is a little 'bonus', or Easter egg, or whatever I couldn't find the right English word for it, but there was the sound effect used in the battle when Godzilla fights the two MUTOs at a time, had a feeling of the old 60 & 70s' Japanese TOKUSATSU genre. Now come back to this movie.Plot, good. Characters, damn good. Pacing, great. And effects as I said, pure awesome. Actually the plot wasn't very rich, and if someone writes that into a synopsis, it's gonna be quite boring. I have to say this movie is more character driven, you see how people react when disaster comes, the emotions within and towards other people, especially families. Although probably won't cry, but there are lots of moments that you would feel the characters in the film. If you are someone like me, while watching other blockbuster movies and care more about the civilization in the background (Man of Steel, just an example), this movie will satisfy you, because this film not only tells you what happened to them, but actually make you feel for them. Go see it. Because if you don't, it's going to be a loss for you.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

I can't say whether or not this movie is very cheesy or the monsters silly because at least half the movie is in darkness! What few glimpses of the monsters we had seemed in line with the old films, silly and huge. The attempt to make an interesting human story underneath the entire monster fight scenes felt contrived; the humans could have been removed from the movie and it would have only made a shorter film. The acting wasn't bad but it was pointless because in all honesty, there isn't anything a mere human or human military could do against such creatures if they aren't making a personal connection with them. I have never checked my clock as often with any other Godzilla movie. Bored out of our minds.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The stars of the film are definitely the monsters. Lots of money shots. That's it... for the nice stuff about it. I couldn't wrap my head around the heavy-handed, joyless storytelling. What happened to B-grade fun? Why so serious?!? I think the only light spot is seeing a few firemen kicking down a Nevada hotel door to Elvis' Devil in Disguise, but I choked down my uneasy giggles because I doubt anybody in the cinema got it. IMHO the director, Gareth Edwards got the monster element gleefully down but completely neglected the human element. This is a shame because I thought his debut, Monsters (2010) was an outstandingly balanced drama and the fantastic. I have no doubt he got the ""Gojira"" job because of it. The humans here barely registered a presence beyond the crazy one, the screaming one, the gung-ho one, the running one, the brooding scientist that no one bothers with but still keeps around for some alternative voice. I find all the big-named characters very cardboard-y and lifeless. It also didn't help that the story is so fatiguing with so much overbearing self- importance. Comparing this to last year's Pacific Rim, it makes Pac Rim feels like a masterpiece.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

This is mostly because I've heard most of my thoughts voiced better by other people. For example, I agree with Bob Chipman that the movie would have been better if it had focused on Ken Watanabe's character rather than the rather generic main family. While Godzilla is strangely absent from the movie, this wouldn't have been an issue had the main cast been more interesting.I will say, the movie is an example of really solid filmcraft. The cinematography, while dark, is also (usually) adequately clear. Godzilla almost always looks fantastic on screen (I actually think he looks better here than in the sequel).And there is one sequence I want to shower with praise, when the bomb-team is skydiving into the Kaiju battle. I've always felt that a Kaiju series would be best if its creatures were portrayed as Cosmic Horror, much like the Great Old Ones in Lovecraft. While this would have created an excessively delicate racial subtext in the Kong film, with Godzilla, I think it is appropriate. The skydiving scene, more than any other, captures the Lovecraftian angle. Not only is Ligeti's ""Requiem"" a suitable callback to the Cosmic Horror in *2001: A Space Odyssey*, but the cinematography has an amazing way of creating scale. The broad skyline shots, where they skydivers are mere specs and trails of red smoke, are interspersed with POV shots by the skydivers. Their POV is limited by their goggles, and we only see the monsters fighting in brief flashes of light. When we drift close to Godzilla, we get the first proper sense of his might and our own insignificance in his presence. The goggles too serve as an excellent visual metaphor for the ways in which our human perspective limit what we can see and understand. By constraining the sight of the audience, they communicate the constraints of our comprehension.It was just a magnificent sequence. I can't say enough in its favor.{MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE FORWARD}
One of my general criticisms is only in the light of seeing its two sequels, in that it seems like the Godzilla movie's are a little trigger happy with the nukes. ...Like... I get it. Godzilla is almost always about nuclear weapons on some level or another, but their overuse makes them feel a bit anti-climactic. Not to mention, I feel like their destructive power is ultimately underwhelming considering how few people they actually kill. The sequel's use of such WMDs would have been more satisfying if the nuke in this film had been successfully deactivated and if everyone had sighed with relief. Then the actual use of them in the sequel would have more weight.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

MUTO antagonists, 'Godzilla (2014)' perhaps features a few too many shots of objects moving into frame to obscure its large-scale action but mostly succeeds in creating a palpable sense of dread that escalates throughout the narrative. There is a strong build-up to the final battle thanks to this pseudo 'Jaws (1975)' strategy, which ultimately makes for a distinct and compelling experience. The ominous tone does a lot of the heavy lifting, separating even the traditional sequences of military men on a command deck discussing what tactical approach should be taken from their 'Transformers (2007)' counterparts, and it leads to a semi-horror aesthetic that works really well. The human characters are perhaps a little flat, but the whole point of the piece is how futile they are in the face of nature itself. They're serviceable vessels through which to view the destruction, providing us with a perspective that not only enhances the already massive scale of the gargantuan Godzilla and the monstrous MUTOs but also gives us a reason to care about all the chaos. In fact, the aftermath of these colossal collisions is often what's given the most time, with each moment of devastation being followed by a small but significant period of mourning. The affair does eventually give us the head-to-head battle we've been waiting for, but it makes sure to keep some human boots on the ground so that we never forget that even Godzilla's gentlest, most benevolent movement leads to a megaton of almost inconceivable carnage. Unfortunately, the finale is extremely under-lit, so it's a bit too difficult to see what's going on even when the affair actually wants you to be able to. That's one of the flick's biggest issues, actually, and it removes some of the catharsis that comes with the final confrontation. Still, it's not too detrimental to the movie's overall effect and is offset by the fact that the visual effects are fantastic. As is the direction, which features some notably brilliant blocking and shot composition. The performances, too, are solid across the board, with Ken Wanatabe's weighty line delivery and Bryan Cranston's strong but brief appearance being the standouts. Ultimately, this is a confident and well-considered monster movie that knows how to make its creatures feel certifiably humongous. It's perhaps a little too long and its purposeful obscuring does start to wear a bit thin after a while, but this is mostly compelling stuff that's enjoyably ominous for its duration.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Comparisons will only garner more positives for the newer version.C-G stands out. Oh let me correct, ""walks tall"". Despite repeated Dejavu's of Pacific Rim, this movie has an unique impact of its own. And these action sequences are brilliantly balanced by the father-son angle along with the husband-wife angle which only makes the movie more realistic rather than just a tell-tale of how a monster ran havoc on earth.The entire cast (notably Cranston, Wantanbe, Aaron taylor) have played their parts. No Oscar winning performances, just swimming with the tide and helping the screenplay. The other notable fact is that Godzilla is painted as a savior rather than a destructor. Though he roars like a T-Rex and is even referred as a dinosaur (by Aaron taylor's son) his sheer volume would make any other T-Rex run away in search of shelter.The camera crew have well complimented the C-G. Be it the HALO jump visualized through the helmet or revealing Godzilla through flares or the sequence on the railway track, the lords of the lens have proved their mettle again.Watching it in Inox (3D) was an added bonus.Godzilla: Stands Tall.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

To sum it all up, before the movie started I said that I didn't quite like the 1998 Godzilla and that it is one of the dullest movies I've ever seen..well I stand corrected, the 2014 version is actually going to be on my ""I don't recommend it, but if you want to waste 2 hours of your life then what the hell"" list.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

These bugs are huge, they're going to need a solid GODZILLA stump to be put down, and this film delivers. GODZILLA'S feet are extraordinarily big, and his legs look amazing. Now, did this film have fire-breath, yes. Did it have Mothra or King Ghidorah? No, those are in the next movie. But did it have Aaron Taylor-Johnson, mother of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" director Sam Taylor- Johnson? Yes, it did. The film opens with a GODZILLA buried in the ground, the scientists look at it and think ""This... is huge."" Next, cut to a nuclear asylum in Japan where American Joe Brody is hiring the Japanese. A mutant radiation bug tramples the towers, and Joe Brody is murdered. His son, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, grows up and vows to defeat the bug to avenge his dad.This is where GODZILLA comes in. Ford Brody prays for retribution, and GODZILLA is awoken by his pure tears. As the mutant bugs tear down more and more nuclear asylums, GODZILLA comes butting in with his tail, his breath, and his pure fury to bring down the bugs once and for all. Is GODZILLA the Savior of Humanity? Yes. 10/10 A+There are supporting characters in the film. Scientist man and woman, Brody wife, Brody wife 2, MUTO Mutant Organism, Holocaust professor, nuclear scientist. They each deserve a nod and serve as a satisfying figure of character in the film. Practically a character himself is GODZILLA, who is large and animated. The special effects in this film are done well, and I'm not just saying that because I was an extra in this movie. The sound design is phenomenal, the sound is practically a phenomenon to behold. When GODZILLA roars, it's not just a traditional GODZILLA roar, it's THIS GODZILLA roar.My ultimate conclusion about this movie is that it just plain rocked. There were better movies in 2014, but this was it. The Best Movie of 2014 wasn't Birdman, it was GODZILLA 2014, and here's proof.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

I will start off by addressing the human element. It's very weak and there were truly some eye-rolling moments. However, the film pulled me through to the many great scenes of chaos. Being a fan of Godzilla since I was a child, begging my mom to buy any of the poorly dubbed VHS tapes available, this movie truly delivered. I won't disclose much, but the enemies Godzilla faces are a wonderful addition to the city-stomping family of villains. They get more airtime than the big G but this is usually typical of the series, the anticipation and build-up of the final showdown and it truly is epic. I feel those uninitiated to the genre will expect more of Godzilla but this is not a Transformers movie, which dole out action to the point of tedium.The acting is good, but the characters are flat. Thankfully there's enough meat to this beast that it's entirely forgivable. The CGI is incredible, breathing life into these monsters. I did not feel the same disconnect that I do with other films that use CGI to the point of feeling like a cartoon. Kaiju fans and regular movie-goers get their money's worth here. Looking back on the horrible 1998 American ""Godzilla,"" and Toho's disappointing last entry of ""Final Wars,"" Godzilla makes a theater-rumbling comeback and delivers a welcome respite from the overly-saturated comic book hero movies. Hopefully this will pave the way for another film because it definitely revived the feelings I had as a kid watching these movies.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

The new Godzilla movie was so BAD. First of all the plot didn't primarily focus on Godzilla, secondly they didn't even use his original battle cry, and lastly Godzilla was only fighting other monsters for exactly 4 minutes and 18 seconds. (Yeah I timed it, don't judge me). I suppose the movie is decent for a giant monster movie, however this is very disappointing for a Godzilla movie. The movie had so much potential to please both Godzilla fanboys and newcomers but greatly failed.

Well I kind of did. It wasn't the worst but could have been so much better. The main issue unbelievably was the lack of Godzilla. Without giving spoilers away some other monsters pitch up and this tempts Godzilla to rise out of the ocean and do battle, almost like a turf war of sorts. He doesn't like them hanging around his hood. So whilst the others cause carnage we see glimpses of the big dog. A bit of a tail, a spikey back. It's only the final quarter of the movie he does his thing. I quite liked it when he did, I wanted more. The CGI was fine and I liked the way he looked although at times my wife did say he was a big chubby and really cute. The movie had a really good Japanese Manga feel to it, sticking to its roots, which I liked. I also liked the nuclear back story. What I didn't like were the humans involved. The young guy playing the lead was annoying and there were just so many plot holes where he was involved. Way to many coincidences happening just to make the lame human sub plot work. I also didn't like the way Gods was treated like a hero when in fact he added to the carnage and death that followed. I will watch the next one but my take on it is less humans please and more Godzilla, that's what I say.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I just can't stay mad at you. Now back to our movie.This is a difficult film to review without giving away a slew of spoiler info but I'll do my damnedest to not ruin it. Here goes, a massive accident at a Japanese nuclear power plant causes the quarantine of both the plant and the neighboring community. Joe Brody (played by verbosely well by Bryan Cranston), a supervisor at the plant, loses his wife when the reactor blows (It's in the trailer so I'm going to call 'no spoiler' on this one). Obsessed with this possibly being more than a mere meltdown, he spends the next fifteen years uncovering what he can about the quarantine zone and what the government is hiding there.After being arrested for trespassing in the quarantine zone, he is bailed out by his son Ford, a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. Fed up with his father's quest for the truth he decides to head back home to San Francisco to be with his wife (Elizabeth Olen) and son. During a layover in Hawaii, Ford comes face to face with what his father feared most now see, a spoiler would be great right about now but I'm not going to do it. Let's just say the ball starts rolling and this movie introduces the Godzilla element we all remember from the rubber-suited monster flicks of yester year","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In no way is this Godzilla comparable to the original, both in terms of the contents of the story and the message the film tries to present.

Many people who are praising this film are comparing it to ""Jaws,"" saying that it's comparable to the idea we never see the shark to the end. I'm sorry, but ""Godzilla"" here has no resemblance with ""Jaws"" in that sense. In ""Jaws"" we are introduced to the shark the first five minutes of the film, we just don't SEE it. ""Godzilla,"" on the other hand, revealed the existence of the monster 2/3 into the film, and only showed the monster in its completion for a fragment of that. Those who compare this to ""Jaws"" are incredibly misguided and don't understand what Spielberg tried to do in ""Jaws."" He wanted us to be aware of the shark's existence, just he didn't want to show it right away. Spielberg didn't introduce us to the shark at the end. I don't mind the fact we don't see Godzilla in his completion till later, but what I do mind is holding back the EXISTENCE of Godzilla in the plot to the very end. It makes me feel like this film should have been called ""MUTO"" than ""Godzilla,"" since the film was more about the MUTOS it seems.The fact that they dropped the nuclear warfare message was quite disappointing. Instead, they replaced this theme with a theme of nature and balance, an interesting topic to explore, however, that's just not Godzilla. Godzilla is historically recognized as an anti-nuclear warfare symbol. Stripping Godzilla of that quality is completely destroying what Godzilla was all about.The acting in this film was SO BAD I could barely stand it. The only good performance in this film, was, of course, Bryan Cranston, but he, just like the monster, has very, very little screen time. A major ball buster. Everyone else, including Aron Taylor Johnson, are unbearably flat and expressionless. There is no emotion being expressed, and the facial expressions made remain the same it seems. The emotional content was simply not there. I wanted to care for these people and the disaster they are going through, like in the original, but this version didn't offer that, instead it only gives us 2D characters with little personality.However, there are the good parts. The CGI, as you would expect, is amazing. I don't understand the complaints about the CGI, but whatever. And the final fight, as short as it was, was quite epic and exciting, and creatively done. Now, if they did this later on and had the story develop faster, the rest of the film could have been equivalently good.To be completely honest, I found the 1998 remake of Godzilla MILES ahead of this one. The 1998 version was not exactly a good film, but compared to this, it's like a Stanley Kubrick film. For those of you looking for an epic rebirth of the series, this is not it, unless you like bad acting and waiting to long to be INTRODUCED to our main monster. I though this film was called ""Godzilla,"" not ""MUTOS."". Go watch the original ""Gojira"" instead, it's a classic that will never be topped. Hopefully, if there will be another Godzilla remake in the future, they will be more faithful to the original meaning of Godzilla and have better actors.Really is not worth the time or the money. A major let down for those looking for an epic rebirth of our favorite monster.5/10","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

It was just serious enough, but with an amusing edge. combine that with an interesting cast, a great-looking monster and hundreds of little ones and you have a fabulously entertaining colossal-creature feature.The problem with the original Godzilla is that he's actually cute. Yes, he's 300-feet high, but he's cute. And that's the case in this 2014 version as well, but that's okay because he's on our side, I think.The plot revolves around Godzilla taking on a couple of like-size monsters called MUTOs (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms"") and the destruction of one city after another in Japan, Hawaii and mainland America. While these fights don't occur until the second half of the movie, the CGI is great, as is the all-around filmmaking. There's nothing wrong on this front.It's the human characters and their story where the film is mediocre. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the main protagonist, Elizabeth Olsen his wife, and Bryan Cranston his father. Also on hand are Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Richard T. Jones and Sally Hawkins. These actors are all perfectly competent, but the story-as-written never makes 'em click as interesting characters. As such, they're bland. And, since the first half of the movie is focused on the build-up to the monsters, it's more boring than compelling.Still, it is Godzilla and there are some memorable disaster-oriented moments.The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Honolulu, British Columbia and Nevada.GRADE: B-","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you're a fan of Godzilla you're gonna enjoy this movie. Godzilla had everything a monster film needs it had epic world devastating actions, stunning visuals, mind-boggling choreography and Alexandre Desplat's score of the movie is amazing. The movie is so jampacked with awesome moments that you're find it hard to decide which is your favorite moment though my favorite part was the sky dive from the HALO. The designs of the monsters were amazing and their concept was brilliant. However, the movie does have flaws the human characters from the movie isn't satisfying or engaging enough for you to connect with them to feel for them and they're and it's plot narrative is based more on the MUTOs the archenemy of Godzilla than Godzilla himself which makes you feel like Godzilla as a secondary character rather than the titular character plus in a movie named after Godzilla he hadn't had much screen time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The modern cgi really brings this character to life and finally gives us a good looking adaptation to the classic monster. While the plot bogs down the movie a little with its relatively boring characters and side plots, it does not take away from how tense and well done the monster scenes are! Godzilla himself makes this movie worth the watch, even if he's only in it for a total of 8 minutes, with how menacing and cool he is! Seeing huge fictional characters battling it out in iconic settings really is a masterpiece of modern film making. Overall making this a really good start to a new franchise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Millennium era proved to be a disaster both critically and financially before ending on Godzilla final wars which made very poor money and bad reviews and Godzilla returns to the big screen after 10 years. I liked it when I was a kid but now I'm starting to understand the problemsIt has god awful pacing. Nothing fun or exciting happens until the climax and they decided to kill the only character that was interesting was Joe but the writing had a bad idea of killing him near the climax and for a good chunk of the film from Joe's death and the climax it was boring as hell and then finally the interesting fight pursued which took like an hour to get to. Which is the only reason why I'm reviewing it as a mediocre film instead of a bad one. I'm so glad the writers and directors made it faster in the sequels but they fail on things this film got good, speaking of whichBryan Cranston's role as Joe {a.k.a. The father} is actually pretty interesting and the family dynamic is pretty sweet. He carries the first 2 acts because it is genuinely sad seeing him grief his wife and the life he had. But of course the dumb writers decided on killing him around the 2nd act which renders a good chunk of the film completely un-interestingNow let's talk about Zilla himself. He has a more realistic look than Toho's iterations, and he's less less reliant on his atomic beam than Toho's Godzilla's but I did not like it as much since Toho's iteration was more expressive and intimidating.But overall a potentially great film but it was bogged down by the god awful pacing that made most of the film uninterestingRating: 6.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That is what essentially Godzilla is. Gareth Edwards simply upgraded his film debut with a dose of a bigger budget and a famous brand stamp. Monsters is a film that relies on the atmosphere and the kind of documentary camera. More than anything it is a character study and a long tease before you see any aliens. But that's exactly the way to build suspense.Now with a bigger budget Edwards has a chance to let himself run wild and stuff his film with plenty of action scenes .. only some people might be bothered that they don't involve the title character. All the monsters in the film are here just to serve as the background, to paint the broader bigger picture. In the same way as, for example, in The Perfect Storm - the natural disaster serves as a background for the story.The film boasts an impressive cast, but some of these actors are seriously underused. Sally Hawkins just simply stands around doing nothing while being a female counterpart to Dr. Serizawa. Speaking of him, this character, played by Ken Watanabe, has got to be one of the most WTF characters ever to grace the screen. Most of his scenes have him gazing into the horizon with a terrified/confused face or spout exposition dialogue, because he is a scientist and Japanes. Therefore out of all the characters he has to know most about Godzilla, which equals satisfied Japanese audience. Bryan Cranston gives a stellar performance with his limited screen time. Main actors are Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. Johnson as Ford Brody, a soldier and bomb disposal expert, has a simple task to get back to San Franciso and save his family. His character has all the character traits I would expect from a solider, so no complaints here. However Elizabeth Olsen shapes up to be more than just another pretty face in the film industry.Gareth Edwards made a film that might not meet everyone's expectations. But if you go along with the take and the direction this film is taking, then I'm sure that you will enjoy this not very typical run-of-the mill ""summmer blockbuster"".P.S. What is most promising about this film is the director. The way he builds suspense will remind you of early Spielberg films. Some images are also reminiscent of Spielberg (train on fire, bodies in the river, conspiracy theory obsessed character), Edwards doesn't show the carnage, he shows you the consequences through the little bit of the puzzle, so you can work out what happened yourself. I just can't wait what to see what Gareth Edwards cooks up for his next film because out of all these young talents, he is shaping up to be the most talented.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

These are the words that spring to mind when I think about Godzilla in retrospect. When I left the cinema (I saw this film in IMAX), I was quite pleased with the overall product. Of course it is better than Roland Emmerich's 1998 incarnation; you only have to look at the trailers and even the posters to know that much is true. Gareth Edwards directs the film smoothly with the appropriate tension that is needed to propel the action scenes forward. Edwards reveals Godzilla slowly and carefully, it is only in the second half that we witness it in all its enormous, scaly glory. This is a director that knows exactly what he is doing and has a complete vision that he is carrying towards the audience. The film however is a completely different beast than that of last year's Pacific Rim. Which was loud, big and brash, not that I have any problems with that. Many audience members may want to know this fact before hand. Although there are several great action set pieces; one on a train is a highlight with a monster trying to kill as many people as possible, if you can overlook the other elements you may find excitement. Also, look out for a fight between Godzilla and the other monster, which is reminiscent of King Kong taking on a T-Rex. The action set pieces overall are few and far between until the last half hour or so. This is a criticism of many Hollywood blockbusters and does not reflect on just Godzilla at all. The film itself is well paced up until this point, it almost feels like the director felt obliged to put them there, just in case audiences felt shortchanged.When it comes to drama to propel the plot and story forward, the film trips itself up and in a big way. This is sad to see because underneath all the dramatic elements here is a film that had the potential to be an epic, in terms of its scale, story and dramatic tension. Possibly the last and most important element is lacking and that is why I feel disappointed.Though thought has gone into the film, the irony is that about an hour or so after seeing the film the initial buzz seemed to wear out and I did indeed feel shortchanged, but not for the reasons one might think. When you view Godzilla in the IMAX format your brain seems like it has been left at home. The reason I feel this way is that unfortunately this feels in far too many ways similar to another film that I would term – Summer Popcorn Fare. Sadly it is a film that was released seven years ago. You guessed correctly – Transformers, and Michael Bay directed that film. Bay made the dramatic elements laughable at best – with no relatable characters and this is exactly how I felt about this film. The characters seem more like caricatures then anything else, limp, and lifeless, without any joy or depth. They seem to have just had bullet points listed as their traits in the pre production process. Sadly it seems little has changed from that point. Take the character of Aaron Taylor Johnson, he resembles the all action, relatable hero or is supposed to, films like Die Hard have done this much better which is annoying. With a monster film you need relatable heroes and this film is completely devoid of them.The fact is Godzilla takes itself way too seriously for me to enjoy and indulge in it. The concept of a huge monster roaming around a city is laughable at best, a true Director would know that the concept is ludicrous and needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Brighten the atmosphere, stop making it as serious as The Dark Knight and lighten up! Almost every character seems extremely sad at some point in this film. Am I the only one that would laugh myself silly when Godzilla attacks? Probably. Even so a few jokes and hints that this is stupid would make it more enjoyable without entering the realm of Camp.It is my sad duty to report what could have been an enjoyable, exciting entry in the franchise is not so much Godzilla's roar as a colossal bore. The clichéd cardboard characters and dull script do not help matters and the set pieces cannot elevate this film from being a mediocre entry. For much better monster epics see the nearly decade old King Kong. You'll find much more joy watching it for the tenth time, than watching Godzilla for the first. If a sequel really is on the cards then Edwards get yourself a new screenwriter.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I heard that TOHO had to rename that monster Zilla and Zilla gets killed easily in Godzilla: Final Wars in 2004. The sense with Brain Craston were good but there not much of him in it. There's some other monsters too besides Godzilla and they're pretty good too. Godzilla in this movie I heard looked bloated and that his roar almost sounded like an explosion. He also has his nuclear breath where he breathes this blue fire and that's fire at it's hottest.The human element was kinda boring and bland and the only good parts are when there was Godzilla in it. I still think it's better than that 1998 one I can tell you that. In the end it's a nice reboot to a classic monster so give it a watch when you can.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This iteration of the plot picks up the story many years after a nuclear disaster in Japan. ""Ford"" (ATJ) is the son of the plant supervisor ""Joe"" (Bryan Cranston). They are not exactly close, but when they discover evidence near the ruins that the destruction was not accidental - and that a giant trapped, flying, ""MUTO"" - which feeds on radiation - might well be coming for more lunch, they can only hope that ""Godzilla"" might become aware and come to the rescue of a totally out-gunned mankind. It's a bit of a sprawler, this film. It takes far too long to get going, with characterisations that offer little of substance and a dialogue that borders on the inane - especially when the military are involved. The supporting cast features a sparingly used Juliette Binoche and Elisabeth Olsen, but they aren't really on screen long enough to add much value. On the plus side, the photography and visual effects are good - they flow with a realism that is quite convincing, but that's standard fayre nowadays for this kind of adventure. The rest of the photography really could have done with some more wattage. Darkness can add eeriness to a scenario, but after a while I do want to recalibrate my eyes! The ending is certainly effective, but I'm just not sure it was worth the wait - the whole film just needed something to bring it to life more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was actually bored the entire movie. It started during the opening sequence where the nuclear plant was malfunctioning. I suppose it was suppose to be emotional and suspenseful as the main character tried to save his wife, but for some reason the movie just didn't make me care. With the other main characters we get a 2-minute scene of dad coming home from active duty. The entire character development of the whole movie is based on that one 2-minute scene as if that's all we need to care about these people. It wasn't enough. And when you don't care about the people in the movie, you don't care about the movie. I have never been BORED while watching a disaster film, even if it was bad, but I was bored out of my mind on this one.

The trailer presents such excitement and intrigue (as many trailers do) but what makes Godzilla great is that it meets the expectations of what is advertised. The performances were fantastic especially that of Bryan Cranston and Kick Ass Actor Aaron Taylor Johnson, but what really makes this a great film is the mystery of Godzilla slowly revealed until his first appearance later on in the film. Though I heard many complain about Godzilla's late appearance into the film, I found that this only made the story better and more intriguing. Have you ever been told that somebody has a surprise for you and your imagination makes up the most exciting ideas, that is how I felt while not seeing Godzilla. Instead the viewer is put into the position of the victims who experience the quakes and the destruction which makes the story more suspenseful and frightening, and by the time we see the creature for the first time we experience what the characters experience: The immense threat that Godzilla poses. This is definitely one of 2014's strongest films. Godzilla is an Epic Movie!!!","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was therefore a very impulsive decision to watch this. And I'm glad I did, as I was really impressed.I was so grateful the film didn't have any annoying comic relief characters or annoying arrogant characters, which is very unusual for Hollywood blockbuster films. This was serious all the way, and was refreshing for this genre. In fact, I really enjoyed and rooted for all the characters. Bryan Cranston was excellent. Aaron Taylor-Johnson wasn't strong enough in the role of the hero, Ford, but he was very likable. Also, I think maybe the film was so much better because they didn't use any big shot Hollywood actors (think Dwayne Johnson) in the lead roles.The visual effects are very good. It's just a pity so much of the visuals were so dark - almost black and white, especially towards the end. Although I enjoyed the film and it was an unexpected surprise, I probably won't be watching it again in a hurry, but I'm certainly glad I did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As soon as the movie starts you are plunged into a dizzying array of realistic and actual nuclear footage providing the back drop and subplot for the entire movie. As the characters and plot begin to develop you begin to wonder how much time Godzilla will actually be on screen. Worry not because the giant monster makes his debut and all the scenes featuring him are of doomsday quality and important to the plot. The pure visual aspect of this movie is incredible and awe inspiring especially when seen on a 3d or IMAX screen. Godzilla has a very unique 'personality' and character in this film which is surprising to say the least. He takes on a role of an anti-hero of sorts and actual may have some heroic qualities within him that may add a novel aspect to his screen appearances in comparison to modern takes on the monster cult classic. There are some great dramatic footage in this film as well which add to the air of suspense only to be smashed and grabbed by the ultimate action packed monstrosity hitting screens this summer. Other films be warned, Godzilla is a blockbuster of extreme quality literally roaring off the screen in 3d and dolby digital and is destined to be a future classic.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A Near-Perfect Blockbuster...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3023825/?ref_=tt_urv","edgereviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40204638/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2014","'Godzilla' is directed by Gareth Edwards, who directed the 2010 independent movie 'Monsters'. I think that 'Monsters' is a masterpiece, and one of the best directorial debuts that I've ever seen. Because of 'Monsters', I had very high expectations for 'Godzilla', but I always knew that it would be a very different type of movie than 'Monsters', so I accepted that it would be different along with the fact that I probably wouldn't like it as much either. I was correct in my assumptions, because while 'Godzilla' may not be a masterpiece like I think 'Monsters' is, it's still an incredibly entertaining movie that's more intelligent than most other major blockbusters.I'll get the main negative out of the way first, and that's that the characters are pretty weak. Most of them don't have much to them, but this didn't bother me that much because let's face it, you don't go and see 'Godzilla' for the character development, do you? The characters aren't distractingly bad anyway, they're just passable. The main character, Ford Brody, is a perfectly competent lead, played very well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, but it's his father, Joe Brody, who I would argue is the best written character in the film and is put to great use by the always phenomenal Bryan Cranston. Elizabeth Olsen and Sally Hawkins are good as well, but I was slightly let down by Ken Watanabe, simply because his character really didn't allow him to show much of his great acting ability.Many people may be disappointed by the fact that Godzilla isn't actually in the movie a whole lot, and that this film focuses more on the human drama. I definitely appreciated that aspect, as I always like a good story over excess action, but this movie still had the amazing action sequences to compliment the excellent writing. I actually found Godzilla not being in the movie that often was very effective, as when he does appear on screen it's all the more impressive.This is a movie that is made to be seen on the big screen. Don't shrug it off and wait until it comes out on DVD, go and see it in the cinema because that's the best way it can be viewed. There's one particular moment in this film that's so incredible and awe-inspiring that I would name it one of the best cinematic moments I have ever experienced, and there are various other moments where my jaw just dropped, which is something that very rarely happens in a movie. The VFX are flawless, all of the action feels like it has actual impact and isn't just mass unnecessary genocide like in 'Man Of Steel'. The sound design is impeccable as well, there are many points where I had goosebumps because the creature noises are so perfect. Gareth Edwards is obviously a very talented director when it comes to monster movies, as 'Godzilla' maintains the excellent cinematography and intense tone that his previous movie had. The score by Alexandre Desplat is great as well, I'm not always a big fan of Desplat's work but his music perfectly accompanies the movie.Gareth Edwards hit the nail on the head with this film. It manages to create a grounded version of Godzilla without being so dark and gritty that it's not enjoyable. It's a movie that both fans of Godzilla and people who aren't familiar with Godzilla should enjoy, because it's a near perfect blockbuster.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

The action scenes happens mostly in darkness, and you can't discern much detail as to whats going on. It's like AVP 2 in this way. And to hang on it for 2 hours is rather a long ordeal.

I think the movie was refreshing. I am sure you can read the summary here to find out what it is about. It does a wonderful job of building suspense through out slowly telling a story about where Godzilla could have came from and now that he is here, about how human nature is to destroy and try to control everything. Yes it can be slow at times, and yes I can see why people were a little disappointed at the end. If the move does have a flaw I would say it is, in my opinion, They didn't show enough of the fight in the end. Other than that. if you like a movie like Jaws that builds slow to a climactic ending, than don't listen these people here and give Godzilla a try.

With the CGI today we don't need to hide the big monsters that could seem fake away, because they are really realistic, in the way they look, in the way they move and how they affect their surroundings. I think this has been done very well and even though their is a lot of dark places, it is only to help the imagination kick into overdrive, when these big giants fight :)I was entertained, the entire build up was very elaborate and believable, it was a good introduction to the film and the genre and how it was tried to cover things up with events that actually have happened. The story of the film supports the events very well and a kind of mad scientist to discover or reveal parts of the myths woks out very well.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In fact, it was one of my favourite movie of that time. Sure, I watched it again recently and it was no where near as good as it was in my memory but that didn't change my love for Godzilla. 16 years later, they released this movie and I was unbelievably HYPED UP for it. I had to wait 8-9 days since it's release to watch and during that time, I saw a lot of hate towards it. Lots of negative reviews, with most of them focusing on about Godzilla's way too less screen time, movie being boring and not many fights. IT got me worried. And to top it off, I watched it after X-men Days of future past, which was an excellent movie. But thankfully, GODZILLA DELIVERED!!The story wasn't anything outstanding, but it was good enough in my opinion and served well for the movie. It has some undertones like Nature restoring order, Man vs Nature etc which I liked. The movie has a more serious tone overall, no lame ass humor thankfully. It is also a slow burner, not your typical big budget block buster movie. And if you go in hoping for a Godzilla vs Monster mash or lots of fighting, destruction in a fast paced way like Pacific Rim or Transformers type movies, you will surely be disappointed. It is more akin to old classic monster movies, with lots of teasing and build up. And Gareth Edwards (The Director) delivered on that front masterfully. Sure, the movie feels slow during the first 20-30 mins and you don't really see THE BIG G for about an hour into the movie but the slow build up was DEFINITELY WORTH IT. I can't really describe how awesome it felt when Godzilla finally surfaced and we slowly get to see him in all his GLORY. My heart rate was unbelievably high. SO MUCH EPICNESS. This movie easily redefines the word EPIC. And that is thanks to the amazing camera work/cinematography and directing. Many of the shots are through POV and you get to really feel the huge scale. It was majestic. It was like the director just wanted you to soak in all the Epicness and scale of the moment. Soundtrack drops, eerie silence and all you can see is Godzilla or the other monsters and hear the rumbling of their presence. The amount of truly epic scenes in this movie is seriously too damn high. Sure, many of them don't involve Godzilla vs other monsters but I didn't care. Monster vs Monster action really doesn't get going until the finale as they tease it throughout the movie, but BOY what an amazing finale it was. UFFFF it was OOOZING with EPICNESS. People actually clapped and cheered during some scenes, which I haven't witnessed in quite some time now. The other creatures, M.U.T.Os (Massive unidentified terrestrial organism), weren't pushovers. They gave Big G one hell of a tough time. The CGI was amazing. The destruction, the MUTOs and Godzilla all looked great. Loved Godzilla's design. He is HUGE (not FAT) and mean looking. The MUTOs are creepy good. They gave them emotions too which was a great touch.Soundtrack was surprisingly refreshing. It felt like those old monster movies soundtrack which I actually don't really like. But somehow it really worked with the scenes in this movie. Also, that creepy chant or whatever soundtrack from 2001: A space odyssey was also used in the movie during some truly epic scenes and it made them EVEN MORE EPIC.This movie is not without flaws though. The human characters either weren't really interesting or the movie was so EPIC that it made them insignificant. :p Well aside from Bryan Cranston that is, who I thought was great. BUT he got very little screen time, which was a huge letdown. The scientist, military general, the family, all the clichéd characters that you see in such monster or destruction type movies were all present. There were some cheesy/cliché scenes too which you get with such movies. Overall, I would say that it is without a doubt THE BEST CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE in terms of EPICNESS. I have never been so BLOW AWAY during some scenes like I was in this movie. I really don't get majority of the hate. Even with its flaws, the EPICNESS far far outweighs it. And if there ever was a movie that was meant to be seen in a cinema, this would be it.8.8/10","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

I thought to myself ""Godzilla is finally in good hands.."" But.. that is somewhat not true now. The main issue of this film is how little they pay attention to Godzilla. How many scenes, you might wonder. Well he is on screen 8 minutes. And this is a two hour long movie. They didn't need to ""introduce"" him. He was well introduced for 60 years. In the trailers, they teased him. Which i can see, But they continue to tease him even in the film. Which is flat out ridiculous.The enemy monster is brand new, freshly created. And this begins with the films second issue. They spend a HUGE majority of the movie talking about these things. We all came to see Godzilla, not MUTO'S vs Godzilla.The film would have worked 80% percent better if it was JUST Godzilla. And if it actually fitted the dark and cold atmosphere of the Trailers. Which the Trailers displayed a dark and depressing tone, which should of been the entire film on its own. That would work perfect.. and it would might of been Oscar winning.On the bright side, The times when Godzilla does show up, Its amazing. This Godzilla is the biggest one yet (stands at 108 meters). And is spectacular to see in theaters.Godzilla has his atomic breath, too. Thank god.The only good actor in the film is Bryan Cranston. You really feel the pain he is going through and he expresses his emotions in such a realistic way. Everybody else's acting is lacking.The last flaw i have is Godzilla's nature. He ends up in this film to be the ""balance of nature"" But Godzilla should be the enemy. Having Godzilla a hero is just awkward. Sure he has saved Japan a number of times, But here he is pure Hero.quick recap:CONS:-Godzilla lacks a massive amount of screen time-Acting is bland-Too much attention to the MUTO -Godzilla is a pure Hero -Constant teasingPROS:-Godzilla looks better than ever -He has his Atomic Breath -Soundtrack is awesome-Bryan Cranston -Director has respect to original designs/films/conceptsPretty much, this was a film worth seeing in theaters. Okay to some fans, but most critics won't like it. Hopefully the 2018 sequel with Mothra/Rodan/Ghidorah will be good because they are done ""introducing"" him.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This incredible creature is a force of nature that has come to correct man's mistakes and arrogance. Director Gareth Edwards, remains faithful to the original 1954 Japanese Godzilla in terms of style and pacing, while taking the raw power of the creature to a whole new level. There is a slow build up till we see our anti-hero in full glory, but when he appears on screen it is truly epic. This is a must-see cinematic spectacle that will go down as one of the best monster movies of all time.Full Review:I really want to get to the meat of what makes this movie great. I'll also be skipping describing the plot, because it is best for you to experience it and all you need to know is this complex equation: Godzilla x Monster fights = Awesome^2. So let me get some general mediocre things about the movie out of the way. The main problem I can think of for this movie is the human element. It is simply just functional. There is nothing outstanding about the performances by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Bryan Cranston, or Ken Watanabe. They all did their jobs fine, portraying their characters realistically and grounded. This isn't even a negative, it's just something that could've been improved upon. I'm nit-picking at this point for negatives if I go any further, so I'll skip to the positives.Godzilla Oh my f*****g Godzilla!!! Seriously I'm getting goosebumps as I'm typing this. The thing I most liked about this version of Godzilla is that he really felt like a force of nature, completely unstoppable. The character designs are so detailed that you recognize even the subtle expressions and know exactly what the creatures are thinking. This adds a lot of personality to the monsters, they are not just CGI animals. Also Gareth Edwards brilliantly puts you through an emotional roller coaster from sheer terror to childlike glee. There were moments where I was genuinely terrified, to the point that I realized I was pushing myself into my seat and holding my breath. On the opposite side of the emotional spectrum there were moments where I was smiling ear to ear, jumping up and down on my seat with excitement, and even cheering loudly with both my fists up in the air. I am a grown man I never do that, and this movie made me react like that without hesitation.On top of all that, I really like the pacing of the movie. For a long time, the movie teases you with little glimpses of Godzilla. Much like the 1954 version, you don't really get to see Godzilla and monster fights in full action till the last 30mins of the movie. I can see how that can be disappointing for some, but it didn't really bother me. Mainly because the climax of the movie just pays off so well. All the fights are beautifully showcased and choreographed. You feel every bite, crunch, and punch.Summing up, you have to watch this movie in cinema. If you are on the fence about IMAX, I say go for it because the level of immersion in this movie is the highest since Gravity. I would like to end with a quote from the director himself when asked, what he wanted to achieve with this version of Godzilla: ""make it last 2 hours, and uh lot of foreplay, and so when there is the climax, it is the most powerful it could be."" Lot of intentional innuendo there by him, but honestly I couldn't describe this movie any better.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

After watching Gareth Edwards' film, Monsters, I had high hopes that Godzilla would go beyond the formula and the clichés. It is a soulless film that does not garner any emotion. In a few scenes it attempts to mimic the suspense and drama of Jurassic Park, but even fails at that. It is fraught with so many problems, I can't begin to list them all. Even if the screenplay had a chance at one point, my guess is that too many studio execs and too many focus groups destroyed any hope for originality. No suspense. No emotional connection. No reason to see this film, unless you want to study what not to do. From shallow, one-dimensional characters that nobody cares about to inconsistent special effects, it really is a disaster of a movie.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Nobody cares about the characters or really the plot, they just want to see Godzilla fight some stuff. And you do get that, but not really until the end.
There are three fight scenes in this movie and the first two are cut off right as they start, or they happen off screen. But the final battle is where you finally get to see some stuff go down, and it's okay, it's climatic and badass to see Godzilla destroy some stuff for sure, I just wish we got more.
I also wish that we had Bryan Cranston more in the lead role. Everyone in this, including Cranston was pretty decent. But Aaron Taylor-Johnson's acting in this was just abysmal, I truly dreaded every time he came on screen.
There were also some pretty awesome shots in this that are wallpaper worthy if you're that big of a fan.Overall a decent introduction to the MonsterVerse with some average acting, decent cinematography with a handful of awesome looking shots, and a pretty good, (yet nothing special) climax fight scene.I also have a very embarrassing and funny story about when I went to see this back in 2014 ... some interesting times.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie takes a long time to get there, but all is forgiven once it does. To get the negatives out of the way, I do have some issues with the movie. Anyone who's seen Gareth Edwards' previous film, Monsters, should have an idea of what to expect. Both his films are exercises in making monster movies where the monsters aren't the focus, a perspective that can be irksome to action junkies. The first scene where the monsters meet ends so abruptly that I was left scratching my head and eager for more of a battle. Furthermore, the characters in Godzilla aren't terribly interesting. Monsters had a complex and compelling love story, but Godzilla's cast is mostly there to provide some scale reference for the gigantic beasts roaming about. Ken Watanabe seems to be a doctor of standing around and staring out disconsolately at the horizon (although he does get the best lines).Yet the film's third act makes up for any flaws with some truly breathtaking effects and payoffs, making you realize what Edwards and co. pulled off with this entry to the Toho legend. Clearly inspired by the mounting tension of Spielberg films(complete with characters dangling precariously from things!), all the reveals feel immensely satisfying. The action, still viewed mostly from the puny humans' perspective, does Godzilla justice. The reintroductions of classic Godzilla elements, which you might have been expecting anyway, feel earned. And on top of all the destruction, I love that Godzilla is a benevolent force for good! It seems so silly, but so right, especially with a brief, but effective shot revealing Godzilla's inner humanity.Of course there will be naysayers. I've already seen opposing critiques, some arguing that there was too much action and not enough human beings, and others complaining about too much of a focus on humans instead of the monsters. While I lean toward the latter crowd, I still left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Let's hope Godzilla gets the chance to raid again soon.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Better acting, better plot and better characterization of Godzilla as we expected to see it. There is a problem though; as you see the movie you may see similarities to another movie, 'Cloverfield', and the reason, besides watching big monsters leveling a city, may be because of gimmicks that instead of 'giving personality' to the film, actually end up screwing it. In Cloverfield you get some guy unable to hold steady a camcorder with no image stabilization, and apparently the guy also has seizures and films the whole thing while trying to keep the equilibrium while juggling chainsaws with the other hand; there is no other explanation as to why they moved the camera so much that makes the spectator want kick both the director and the camera men in the teeth, as 'trying to give the impression of an amateur camera man' would not justify it. There is no problem with shaky images here; instead, somebody though that it would be a good idea to show a black screen and every once in a while show a silhouette or a border of something that you may recognize or not; sometimes you may even think that you are watching a shadow puppet show with some radio-drama on the background.

Shallow character development, cliché comic and plot elements, everyone staring at the horror in front of them instead of running, and the inept military causing as much or more damage as Godzilla . . . I could go on, but I want to push that wreck of a movie even further back into the depths of my memory, because ""Godzilla"" 2014 is a movie to remember.No spoilers from me, go see it. They take very few cheap shots throughout the movie, and most of them are in the 'announcing' of plot elements or character introduction, where it's allowable. The acting isn't superb, the characters aren't tremendously deep, but they aren't laughable and do not distracted from the plot at large, even help it along carefully. You get total immersion with this movie, and I didn't really find any distracting moments that broke my concentration. I give the movie a 9 out of 10 because the first half, maybe a bit more, is a little slow, but makes up for it as it gets nearer and nearer to the climatic finally. The whole audience applauded when the movie was over, and my brother and I are already planning on seeing it again. This may be among the few movies I purchase digitally or ad a DVD and add to my library to watch once and a while for kicks.Look, Hollywood, I'm a huge sci-fi fan, I'm a published sci-fi author (""The Terrans of Beta""), and I hate how horrible you people molest amazing stories to give them more cinematic, dramatic impact, at the sacrifice of quality characterization and captivating plots. You did well with this one though, and I'd like to see more. Here's hoping this movie is a blockbuster-hit, to lead others to follow its example. There is room for improvement even with this movie, but it's so much better than the normal fare out there that I'll support it with my patronage and public acclaim. Keep it up, please.

It feels more of a disaster movie than an actual monster movie. I'll give the movie credit, especially with fantastic visuals that makes the monsters realistic. The monsters show us the reason people want to see this, it's how destructive like in the Kaiju films. The acting is solid. And the action are, well, a few as there are, pretty epic even with the finale. What makes this more of a disaster movie is the movie would rely more on the humans than giving the monsters more screen time for the fight we would've seen. And the story is pretty weak. I get it wants to be a follow up to the original 1954 film, but the way the movie would for the most part present is just people panicking and evacuating. Just a small part of the action, then we get to the human characters. In terms of my recommendation, I can give you a couple of options. This movie is made to follow up the original film. If you would like to see what continues after it, even as a fan of Kaiju, maybe it's something to check out. That or you could just stick to the original film. It's not the best Godzilla film, but at least it was something.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Pretty cool the first time, gets worse as you watch it more. Also, too much teasing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3169194/?ref_=tt_urv","ohashmawi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47157890/?ref_=tt_urv","24 January 2015","Holy crap. Godzilla, it's finally here! Since the beginning of 2013 I had been waiting, one of the films that I've anticipated the most, and when I finally watched it, I was blown away, it was incredible. I got something a bit different than what I expected (as in the focus of it) but I still loved it. And then when the excitement died down, I realized that the movie isn't a perfect ten like I thought.The acting in Godzilla is really good, but more as a whole, because there is only 1 person who gave an absolutely spectacular performance, and that person is the always amazing, Bryan Cranston. That man is one of the best actors in the business. The scene at the beginning in the nuclear plant, where he has to make a very hard decision, that was the most heartfelt moment I've seen this year. I really wish he had more screen time, he was pretty much the only character I actually cared about. His wife, Juliette Binoche is really good as well, like Bryan, she doesn't appear much on the screen, but she's great when she's on it. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is decent in the movie, he plays that generic badass lucky-as-hell military guy. He doesn't emote much, but he plays his part well. Elizabeth Olsen, his wife, is talented for sure, but she doesn't have that much to do. The rest of the supporting cast is good as well, they just play the generic monster movie characters. What I really liked here is that there's not a false note anywhere in the acting, you could tell that every single person took it seriously.The script for this movie is good, they made an interesting and compelling story, they even managed to make it coherent to the 1954 original, I thought that was really cool. Also, this movie may be called ""Godzilla"" but it's not really about him, it's more about the human drama, the people dealing with the fact that there are monsters who are destroying everything. I had a love-hate relationship with all the teasing in this movie, all the suspense was cool, so was Godzilla's fearsome off-screen presence, but I was still really frustrated when they didn't show some of the fights. The first time it was okay, but twice? Seriously? It's just like, why the hell do you think people came to see this movie? Anyway, the film is very realistic, it all looks devastating, and you have to give the director credit for it. Godzilla doesn't grab a boat and uses it as a baseball bat, but what he does instead is WAY cooler. Speaking of the big guy, the movie holds him back for quite a bit, for the first hour it mainly just teases him, but when he first appears, that shot that travels from his legs all the way to his head, and then he lets out that awesome roar! Man, I was clapping and cheering so much, seriously, I just couldn't contain myself. I think they should have teased him less, we only see him fight in the final act, and he has 2 other confrontations which they don't show (total BS), it probably won't please people who prefers fast story-telling , but it pays off in the third act, when the monster fight begins, it is really, really awesome. The director, Gareth Edwards, deserves a lot of praise for this movie, which I hope he gets (he will from me at least). Everything looks beautiful, and not just the visual effects, every shot is done really well, it really shows the devastating consequences a monster attack would have, you feel the desolation Godzilla and the MUTOs leave in their wake with every image. He made it very eerie and suspenseful, and that worked really well for the movie's tone. And don't get me started on the CGI and visual effects, they are amazing, the sound is also really great, the monster roars just seemed to shake the theater. All technical aspects of this movie are incredible. The soundtrack is amazing! Alexandre Desplat and the editing crew deserve an Oscar for the opening credits alone! Hearing that track again made me feel the excitement all over again. I loved what they did with Godzilla the character, they made him very intimidating, vicious, badass and kind of scary.I had few complaints with this movie, but they were kind of big, the first one is that the movie could have had a bit less teasing, they could have showed us more of the second act. The second complaint is that Bryan Cranston was the only interesting character, he was the only one who really emoted, the rest of the cast is great too, but they could have been a bit more emotional. This movie is pretty cool, I simply loved it (the first time of course). With repeated viewings though, it loses its spark, much like The Avengers, an awesome movie that was amazing the first time you saw it, then less when you watch it more. If you liked Pacific Rim, and you're looking for something similar, then you might be disappointed, it's a lot more realistic, the monster fight is glorious, even more so than Pacific Rim, but it has a lot less awesome battles, it focuses more on the human drama, kind of like The Walking Dead, it has zombies, but it doesn't focus on them, it shows humans having to survive in a world with zombies. The story is very interesting, the script is good, the acting is very good, no false notes anywhere, the visual effects are spectacular. If you want a human drama which has freaking Godzilla in it, then watch this movie, just remember, don't expect Godzilla to fight a lot, which is likely to disappoint you. Still, Godzilla is overall a good movie.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

His penchant for scale is an ideal match for this material as everything feels suitably grand with real weight behind it.Akira Ifukube's iconic pieces are nowhere to be seen unfortunately but Alexandre Desplat succeeds in doing his own rendition of the same idea. This may be a blockbuster but Desplat's score sounds like a horror movie and is all the more effective for it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They are designed exactly like every other unidentifiable CGI crustacean dripping goo, from After Earth to Starship Troopers to Pacific Rim. The film wreaks of poor continuity, underdeveloped characters and nonsensical military operations, sometimes just for the sake of a camera perspective (like the superfluous air drop).

I first came across Kong: Skull Island and while it was okay, it didn't seem like the franchise would last that long (but at least it already was on movie #2, the Dark Universe already bombed on its first try, the Mummy reboot with Tom Cruise.) So I came in for this with low expectations, but with special interest as it will lead up to Godzilla vs King Kong.Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen who we more famously know as the wonder siblings Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So it was a bit disconcerting seeing them as a couple after adoring them as brother and sister. Having seen what Olsen can do, this movie was a waste of her talent, she can do what she did here in her sleep. But it was still a joy to see her in something outside of the MCU. The other great choice for acting is Juliette Binoche. Same with Tarantino, that scene with her was the longest since I have been affected like that. You do not do that to a Juliette Binoche!As for the story, it was decent considering it's been in development hell for years. There were too many loopholes to the point I've lost count and as someone who has personal experience with evacuation, you do not find someone that easily amidst the panic and chaos. Also it's weird I felt shorted even though apparently this has the longest exposure for Godzilla. I get the reference to Jaws, where we were being teased but maybe the pivotal scene was done in the dark that's why it felt lacking. It did not feel like I was there with them, it felt like I was watching and I can't see a damn thing. Which might be an indirect criticism to the human element of the film, it did not draw us in as much as they were supposed to. I barely cared if the protagonists found each other again, I was more invested in seeing the monsters go at it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had no recollection of the Godzilla story. All I knew was that Bryan Cranston, the main star of one of my most favorite TV shows, Breaking Bad, was going to be in it. And that was it. Now, I've never ever went into a movie blind, but I wanted to see if I'd get a different feeling, a different opinion of the film, unlike the way I would get my hopes up from the totally mind blowing trailer and footage they've released, and then feeling so disappointed afterward, that I would rate it with a biased opinion. So what would it feel like going into a movie with no opinions... no.. ANYTHING.And, WOW. Maybe it was just the movie itself, or going in blind, but that was just..WOW. Bryan Cranston was brilliant. The sound effects blew me away, literally took my breath away at certain moments. The CGI was out of this world! Every single scene with Godzilla in it had me thanking God for creating brilliant people to generate such an awe- inspiring thing. It definitely had its slow moments, I will admit. The main character, Ford (Aaron Johnson), played a military guy to a tee, but I wouldn't have picked him out of a group of navy seals. He had nothing much going for him, as a characters. He wasn't particularly leading any special missions to stop bad things from happening. He was just there, being in the wrong place at the right time, and following the rest of the military groups. I didn't really care if any of the characters died because that's just how weak the development was portrayed. This movie was not a character driven film. This movie relayed heavily on special effect and kick ass monsters and in THAT, they did very well.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

Godzilla, a gargantuan beast borne from nuclear fire, invaded the monster movie scene in 1954 and gave us a terrifying vision of Tokyo's destruction. Godzilla's reign persisted through nearly thirty movies, seeing the titular monster as both villain and hero, pitting him against a whole universe of monsters, aliens, armies, and machines. Then, after running through a whole gauntlet of battles in Godzilla: Final Wars, the beast was given a good ten-year rest.In 2014, Godzilla rose up again with a fresh new look and fresh talent. Even though the beast has been rebooted repeatedly before, he has never before hit the western shores as hard. In this American production, great care and detail has been given to provide a hard-hitting thrill ride that will remain true to Toho's original vision.In a somewhat Spielbergian fashion, Gareth Edwards' vision of Godzilla purposefully builds tension before giving us the actual monster combat. Much like Jurassic Park, the film steadily builds up the suspense with tremors, sound, and focus on subtle details. Much like Jaws, the actual monsters receive limited screen-time to maximize their impact when you do see them. And much like 2005's War of the Worlds, much of the action is subdued to the background, with a firmer focus on the characters' drama. Above all, Godzilla represents an evolution of Edwards' debut film Monsters, which accomplished all these same techniques on a more limited scale.What this amounts to is a film that builds and builds, taking its time on character-building and plotting before giving us what we really want: all-out monster bashing and city stomping. When you finally get to it, the mass destruction is modestly satisfying. Special effects are top-notch throughout, giving us an intense and epic vision of creatures smashing into each other and smashing into buildings. However, the action is not overblown or overdone, and it never overwhelms the plot.The actual story involved is pretty much on-par with the older Godzilla films; most of these give us a handful of military and scientist characters who figure out what's going on, then behold some massive monster battle. This film stays true to this formula, but the focus is constant on the characters and their struggles, whether it be the struggle to deal with the monsters, or the struggle to save loved ones. The film definitely tries to pull at the heartstrings by showcasing a father trying to reunite with his family, while also trying to save his father and fulfill his mission. While this can be a bit contrived and sappy, the film does have a little more depth and power to it than the older kaiju flicks. All that being said, the characters are still not huge stand-outs; their emotional struggles are pretty much the only thing we can latch on to, but they remain pretty shallow and flat. Plotting suffers a little as well, given that some parts don't always make sense, and characters don't always make the best decisions. Much like the older films, the story overall conveys a strong theme about the folly of messing with mother nature and abusing nuclear power.The film is competently made, with quality photography and editing. It is especially noteworthy in the way it masterfully reveals just what it wants to when it wants to, to draw out the suspense and make each monster's presence more powerful. Acting is okay from the whole cast; Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a pretty average everyman hero character, Elizabeth Olson is a pretty average as the guy's wife, Ken Watanabe is an average scientist dude, and Bryan Cranston steals the show in an all-too-small part. Writing is so-so. This production has some great-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. Sound design is phenomenal, with monster roars that's guaranteed to make the entire theater shudder. Music is pretty interesting.Finally, this has got to be the most intense and hard-hitting Godzilla movie since the original. Storytelling and characters aren't a big standout here, but never were in the older movies anyway; this version still offers a phenomenal build-up and a satisfying payoff, and anybody wanting a good monster-movie fix should be pleased. It'll be thrilling to see what directions modern film-making like this will take Godzilla next.4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Average | Film: Good)","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I really wanted to, but while there's some good aspects, they're counterbalanced by plenty of bad things. First, the ""storyline"" - two MUTO (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"")'s are awakened (why now?) and converge on San Francisco (why there?). Godzilla shows up to fight them (why?).It sounds like it could be a good version of 'Pacific Rim' - and while it's cool to see the giant CGI monsters, you don't actually get to see enough action/battle scenes. The major failing is the characters - you spend an hour with Taylor-Johnson & his Dad (Cranston) before you even see Godzilla! Despite that, there's still very little character development and you just plain don't care what happens to them or the other human characters. It definitely needed more of Watanabe. Also, there's a ridiculous number of coincidences how Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass keeps showing up in the right/wrong place.One of the major unexplained situations is where did Godzilla come from, and if they knew he existed, where has he been for 60 years? Hibernating on the ocean floor? And why does he want to battle the MUTO - for food? Apparently not! Therefore, what does he eat to sustain his giant bulk? The other major annoying thing for me was the stupidity of the humans - hey, these MUTO love nuclear energy, so let's try to destroy them with a nuclear weapon! Or they can emit electromagnetic pulses - let's keep flying planes & helicopters near them, surely they won't crash! Anyway, on a positive note, you do see some of Godzilla for the final 30min (but not enough) and he does, thankfully, have flame-breath.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film is a serious disappointment, as I love the Godzilla series, King Kong, and Kaiju movies. Do you know who else loves all these wondrous repositories of imagination? The great Guillermo de Toro. Please, please do yourself a favour and go see the much superior and joyous ""Pacific Rim"" instead. Seriously, go and watch it. *There* is a movie that honours Godzilla, and handles the material properly: with love.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

Quite different than any Godzilla movies I watched as a kid. There's much more of a story told from the character's viewpoint and the final battle scene was worth watching the entire movie. I found Elizabeth Olson's character and that of her son's character to be essential worthless. That's not a knock on the actors, just a knock on their roles. They don't really add anything except a love/family angle to the story. That's been overdone in blockbuster movies and less of that, more of the scientists interacting and discussing Godzilla's origin/nature would have been better. Taylor's soldier/son/husband character could have used a bit more depth as well. He's just kind of running in place with his role throughout. Overall, it's a fun movie and the giant monster battle scenes are good. I give it a 6 out of 10. Not a great movie but a good one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the middle of all destruction is a valid story to tell. Monsters have feelings and that makes them more charismatic than average movie monster. You can feel sympathy for the huge monster. They have a story to tell in middle of all effect rumble and humanity's nothingness against natures forces is well told. Gozilla is shown as a hero whose destiny is to survive human kind. Aaron-Taylor Johnson is quite vacant as a human hero, but survives his role as a father and soldier quite well after all. 3D works, but it is quite vain because they don't use it more cinematic. Plain 3D landscape is not enough, that is why I drop one point from five to four. After all Gozilla is a great summer movie and even I enjoyed watch it.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The only bad things I found in here was that they had little to no Godzilla then what I would have liked, and the movie felt a bit rushed.

And when the oh-so-American version came out in 1998, I saw that one as almost a comedy, and not in a good way. But this one? This new version of the oft-told tale is downright terrifying, combining a plausible origin with sterling special effects and not one but three really big monsters.Our story begins in the Phillippines in 1999. Scientists are called to a mine in which a huge skeleton has been unearthed; within this skeleton are two pods - one broken open, with a trail leading to the sea. Not long after, unusual seismic activity is recorded at the Janjira nuclear power plant in Japan. The plant's operator, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) sends his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and her team down into the core to check the sensors. But then there's this big explosion, and Sandra and the other scientists in the core are trapped. Publicly, the disaster, which affects all of Japan, is attributed to a 6.3-magnitude earthquake.Some 15 years later, the Brodys' son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a Navy bomb-disposer guy, to use the technical term, and he's a bit estranged from his dad, who's become obsessed with finding out the true reason for the so-called earthquake. Shortly after Ford returns home to San Francisco to be with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam, he learns that Papa Joe has been arrested in Japan for trespassing on the grounds of the old, now-quarantined plant. Joe insists that there was no earthquake, that an electromagnetic pulse was behind the disaster. And he may be right, because while Ford is in Japan collecting his dad, there's another incident, and a gigantic winged creature flees the scene. No, it's not Godzilla, but he's around somewhere.Fret not; Gozdilla does show up, and when he does it's a real heart stopper. He's not King Kong tall, he's more like ten or eleven King Kongs tall. He's Kanye's ego tall. He's Donald Sterling's racism tall. He's a big fella, is what I'm getting at here. Anyway, he and Winged Monster (called a MUTO, for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) are soon joined by another creepy dude, who's like Winged Monster although without wings. They both sort of look like the monster from Cloverfield, come to think of it, but much more realistic.Would it be spoiling things if I noted that all three beat the heck out of each other? Probably not. It's also not a spoiler to note that the armed forces attempt to use everything from handguns to tank ordnance on our friendly neighborhood monsters, to little avail. Nuclear weapons are mentioned. This is such a visceral movie. There's little in the way of shaky-cam cinematography, and you almost never get a full-on look at any of the monsters. This is good, because it highlights how damn huge these guys are; if you or I were there, we wouldn't be able to fully comprehend their colossal stature without moving back, oh, a couple hundred miles. All of this makes the movie feel very much real and as if you're very much in the middle of things, 3D or not. The CGI is worlds better than it was for Roland Emmerich's 1998 dud.There are plenty of jaw-dropping moments of terror, and there are a multitude of on-screen deaths, PG-13 rating or not. There's always this lingering feeling of being trapped. After all, you can't go into the water (Godzilla swims!), and you can't go into the city (Godzilla smash!), and you can't even go into the mountains, because these guys are tall, tall, tall. How tall? Grande from Starbucks tall. So you're trapped, and you can't figure out how to stop them, since bullets don't work. Turns out it's not complicated, but I'll let you see for yourself on that score. Anyway, although I watched the 3D version of this, I don't think the 3D added much to the experience. It didn't take away from it (that is, it wasn't distracting), but it did seem needless in retrospect. But the bottom line for me is that Godzilla is a lot less campy and much, much scarier than the version from olden times (1954). Think World War Z without zombies or the ability to zip around from continent to continent. Okay, so technically here we move between North America and Asia, but you get the idea.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The story of the main characters does nicely develop over the course of the two hours.There is a nice plot build up and lots of action and adventure. The cast is huge. There are lots of little nods to events in other Godzilla stories.The bad stuff: No humour. It's mostly filmed in the dark (possibly to make the SFX cheaper) and on a small screen you will often struggle to see what's going on.

In six words: One of the best movies EVER!!!! I have been a Gojira fan since birth, and, after watching all 27 previous Godzilla movies, I had high expectations for this movie. After seeing several trailers, I knew that the movie-makers were going to do their best to make a Godzilla movie worth remembering. Thus, I prepared myself to judge this new reinvigoration of Godzilla.My hopes were high, and my expectations were even higher. I couldn't contain myself! After waiting two years for the movie to come to theaters, there I sat on the opening night (5/16) in an IMAX auditorium, readying my brain for the adventure to come. I could feel the excitement radiate throughout the theater. All in all, I expected the movie to be good, but I didn't think it would be able to meet, let alone surpass, my expectations.By the end of the movie, something ridiculous had happened: the movie had obliterated my expectations and had revealed itself as not only the best Godzilla movie ever, but as one of my favorite movies of all time!!!!!!!! Oh my gosh, it was perfect! GO WATCH IT!!!! The acting was awesome, the cinematography great, the music ingenious, the plot was engaging, and the special effects were quite mind-boggling! One reviewer stated that the effects are ""like Pacific Rim times 5,"" which is completely spot on. It's amazing! Godzilla is introduced in a completely believable, fantastic way. The first time I saw his face in the movie, I was almost crying because it was so awesome! His roar is phenomenal!!! Truly, I know I am much too enthusiastic about this, but I enjoy being so. I highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this movie. Even if you're a critical moviegoer, you will enjoy the story and action. It's too good!!","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The basic premise concerning ancient giant creatures that feed on radiation is preposterous, the human characters are thin and behave in ways that don't make sense, the coincidences the story asks us to swallow are almost as big as the title creature, and the tonality of the performances is all over the map. Bryan Cranston cranks himself to 11 (his scenes with a natural talent like Juliette Binoche demonstrate how outclassed he is as an actor), Ken Watanable spends a lot of time staring wistfully and forlornly into space, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems set on sucking the life out of any scene he's in. Even the score by the usually reliable Alexander Desplat is forgettable. Yet despite all the flaws, this film has one awesome quiver in its bow and it knows how to use it, making it eminently watchable and entertaining. This is a super-sized Godzilla largely indifferent to humans and humanity, and as such is perfect update to the anxieties explored and exploited in the Toho original. In place of fears about unleashing the destructive power of the atom, now we quiver in the shadow of natural forces we monkey with but don't completely understand, forces capable of wiping us out while barely noticing us. Director Gareth Edwards and his army of visual effects and sound design gurus make sure that Godzilla lives up to his name and legacy. Yes, it could be a better film if the humans had more depth and the story wasn't so contrived, but it wouldn't be worth anything if that thrilling roar wasn't so convincing, the blast of hot breath so exciting, and the earth-shaking power not so awesome. The film delivers in a big way on the one character that really matters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is also nice to see Elizabeth Olsen back on the screen where she belongs, as she is one of the characters that reminds the audience that the story is as much about humanity as it is about anything else. Which brings me to the King of Monsters himself and I only have one word for that: epic. From the design to his role as both a savior and a destroyer, Edward infuses life into Godzilla like we have never seen it before.

"8","/10","While not without some flaws, 2014's ""Godzilla"" is ferocious monster-sized entertainment that's a ton of fun! It should easily please fans of the character.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3016547/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2014","I am definitely what you could call a fan of the ""Godzilla"" franchise. Maybe not a hardcore fanboy... but definitely a fan who has seen most of the films at least once, and has an informed-enough opinion to be able to point out my favorite characters, creatures and entries in the series. (Side-note, my favorite entry is probably a tie between ""Destroy All Monsters"" and ""Godzilla VS Mothra"", strictly for their strong entertainment value.)I'm also able to recognize that the King of Monsters has a bit of a dark past when it comes to American productions. Specifically... the 1998 Roland Emmerich film, which bared so little resemblance to classic ""Godzilla"", it was actually more-or-less parodied later in the film ""Godzilla: Final Wars.""So I went into this new film with mixed feelings. On one hand, the trailers and early buzz had me excited. But on the other hand, the last American outing left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, and had me worried. (Although I will admit, I don't think the '98 film was absolutely atrocious... on its own, it was just a mediocre creature film, but the fact it was called ""Godzilla"" really took it down a few pegs, because... well... it just wasn't ""Godzilla."")Thankfully, my hopes were met and even exceeded, and I emerged very satisfied from the theater. Because director Gareth Edwards' new reboot is absolutely entertaining, ferocious, sometimes emotional... and is pure, unfiltered ""Godzilla"" fun.The film predominately follows Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor- Johnson), a soldier who is pulled into a great conflict after he and his emotionally-scarred father (played brilliantly by an under- utilized Bryan Cranston) witness the birth of a creature referred to as ""MUTO."" (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"") While Brody attempts to help the military contain and destroy MUTO (while trying to stop the birth of a second, potentially more dangerous MUTO creature), another threat emerges from the depths of the world- the enormous reptilian creature known as ""Godzilla"", who has arrived to presumably follow an instinctual urge to hunt the MUTO creatures and destroy them.The cast is quite decent. Taylor-Johnson is a serviceable protagonist, although he comes across as a bit of a ""Mary Sue"" at times, which does make him boring in a few key scenes. Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody is a revelation, though. (Even though his role isn't quite as developed as we may hope.) Torn apart by the loss of his wife in a tragic accident, Joe is determined and dark, and gives the film a lot of depth early on. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife Elle, is a great addition to the cast. She pulls her weight and is able to give a nice sense of drama as she is caught-up in the chaos of the dueling monsters. And Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, a man with knowledge of the creatures and what is happening, is a lot of fun.But the human characters aren't really what most people are going to be looking forward to. No, we were all looking forward to seeing Godzilla and the other creatures, and boy, this this film deliver!Godzilla is almost always brilliantly portrayed on-screen. His new, updated design is fantastic, serving as not only a tribute to the iconic classic look, but also something a little new and a little different. (Though don't worry, he's still clearly Godzilla... he's just been brought into the 21st century in a big way, with some slight design changes that actually make him feel more real than ever before.) The effects work that brings him to life is extraordinary, and even though he's essentially just an animal, the film does a good job at making him seem like a true ""character""... you can sense what is going through his head through his body language and some great subtle facial expressions. Brilliant job on the big guy. The MUTO are also a lot of fun. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say their design is quite cool, and they do seem to pose a genuine threat to the world and to our anti-hero Godzilla.Edwards direction is top notch. I hadn't seen his first film (the wonderful ""monsters"") before seeing this, but here, he's able to present the film in a grand way, from the basic scenes of character development to the giant melee brawls between Godzilla and the MUTO. The script is tight and well-pace. The music is perfect, and emphasizes what we see on-screen. Set and costume design is top-notch. Overall, this is a fantastic production.However, this film isn't without some flaws. The biggest issue is that, well... Godzilla doesn't appear on screen all too much. Which felt funny for a film called ""Godzilla."" The film really seems to relish in its build-up to his repeated reveals, and it can get grating after a while. Although when he's finally allowed to shine, it almost completely makes up for how much the film previously teased us. I also felt that Taylor-Johnson's lead character wasn't quite as compelling as I might have hoped, causing a lot of the scenes between the human characters to be a little on the flat side.But I can easily forgive those issues, because when this film works... it REALLY works.This is pure ""Godzilla"" fun. It's a blast to watch him back on the big- screen, and it's a great relief to see him done justice in an American film finally. This film got me hyped enough that I am already crossing my fingers for sequels.I'm giving 2014's ""Godzilla"" a very good 8 out of 10. While flawed at times, the payoff is just too good to pass up.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The characters aren't interesting or have much of a personality - they're basically just stereotypes instead of real people - and because of that it's really hard to care what happens to them and so the whole movie becomes uninteresting. The actors do plenty of emoting, looking teary eyed at each other or at the mayhem around them and there's lots of personal tragedy etc. but it all feels lifeless.There's some impressive visuals in the movie especially near the end when Godzilla & co. really lets it loose, but sadly these gorgeous images are hollow because the story is lacking. The visual part of the movie is the only inspired part. The story just goes through the motions of a stereotypical monster movie with some themes of nature's balance or whatever thrown into the mix to justify the special effects.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

I've watched this when it first came out in Cinemas and I came out slightly disappointed. Now that I decided to finally rewatch it after 7 years, I wonder if my opinions will change or not? The premise is ""Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a Navy bomb expert, has just reunited with his family in San Francisco when he is forced to go to Japan to help his estranged father, Joe (Bryan Cranston). Soon, both men are swept up in an escalating crisis when Godzilla, King of the Monsters, arises from the sea to combat malevolent adversaries that threaten the survival of humanity. The creatures leave colossal destruction in their wake, as they make their way toward their final battleground: San Francisco"". So is it actually better than I thought or is still as disappointing as I remember it?Firstly, I actually really like the tone of this movie. After watching all the new Monsterverse movies and now going back, I think the serious and grounded nature are wonderful. It shows these Titans from the perspective of humans and makes them seem more fearsome and majestic. The original Japanese Godzilla portrayed the titular character as a force of nature and Gareth Evans (the director) perfectly captures this as well.I also really like the cinematography by Seamus McGarvey. The more tame colours really work in the movies favour by really giving it a war-like and disaster style feel to the movie. Additionally, there are some gorgeous shots in the movie and some stunning visual spectacles. The score by Alexandre Desplat is actually pretty good and at some parts such as the HALO jump is where the score really stands out. The final climax is also very thrilling to watch even though it is kind of dark though.The biggest complaint I had with this movie is the severe lack of Godzilla. He is the titular character but is barely even in it. Heck, the villain monster, the MUTOs, appear more than him. I think what is really jarring is that when Godzilla appears they then cutaway to something else. For example, when Godzilla arrives near the airport and about to fight a MUTO but it then cutaways to some boring human characters who see it on TV. It felt quite insulting that they wouldn't show these fights and instead just telling us the conclusion from some human characters. I was screaming internally throughout the movie, ""Let Them Fight"".On that note, the human characters really suck. I think all the actors do a fine job although Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays the main lead, Ford Brody, is quite lacking in a lot of personality in most of his scenes. Not entirely his fault as the character is written to be quite boring. Elle Brody (Elizabeth Olsen) is just playing the trope of wife and mother character, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) is a monster expert, Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) is monster expert right-hand person. This is literally their personality and nothing else which makes all the characters very uninteresting. There is one interesting character Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) who is the father of the main lead who also lost his wife due to unusual seismic activity and is trying to determine the cause of the meltdown that killed his wife. This screams main character as there is a backstory that is making us root for him. Plus he is played phenomenally by Bryan in every scene. However, they decide to kill him 30 minutes into the movie and replace him with his boring son. What a waste of a character and there was no real reason to kill him so early.Overall, it's an all right movie. I don't agree with a lot of the decisions made in terms of story and characters but it nails the tone, atmosphere and visuals completely. It's a good monster movie and also a good start to the ""Monsterverse"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What's Not: Everything else is purely illogical and BAD.I happen to catch the screening of the new GODZILLA movie. I loved the previous GODZILLA movie by Ronald Emmerich which was released in 1998. I was truly excited about this flick and it turned out to be total DUD. To start with, a nuclear test are performed at JAPAN to observe the magnitude of the test. It somehow gives a more than life shape to a chameleon which turns out to be a GODZILLA. According to the Japanese sayings its a creature made by GOD but so they somehow allow that large creature to stay in the ocean (Arrgh). After many years an American engineer Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston-Breaking Bad fame) is working on a project and suddenly their power plant ends up getting quakes which ends up in a total mishap and broken family. Now Joe is looking out for answers for 15 years. His son Ford Brody(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is in defense and plans to meet his dad to get back in life and they end up noticing the real reason for the mishap created 15 years ago. A new creature is born ""MUTO""-Mutant Unidentified Terrestrial Organism which looks like Large Mantis who feeds only on radiation. Anything that contains radiation is his food (Arrghh again) and now its not one but TWO large mantis. Now the female MUTO wants to deliver her babies requires radiation. So to stop these MUTO's the humans think of bringing in GODZILLA, and you guys can guess how it's going to end.So what do we see here, fight between GODZILLA and two MUTO's which sound fine but unfortunately they don't show the fight completely. C'mon they made up the situation to arrive at this point and no BIG fight. Also to mention the run-time of the movie is 2.5 hours and GODZILLA appears on screen for hardly 20 mins (KIDDING ME). Then why make a movie on GODZILLA?? coz the rest of the time they are just trying to give explanations which is purely BULLSHIT.I invested money to see the large creature and also the huge fight. NOTHING comes your way. It's purely waste of money and time.PURELY NON-RECOMMENDED.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Not just because it was a Monster Movie Epic,But also because of just how negative and false the reviews were from some of the films critics. Let me start off by saying I am a Godzilla fan and have never seen a Godzilla movie that shows off the King of Monsters so well. Many critics write negative reviews just so people will read theirs and be filled with so many negative thoughts before heading in to watch the film themselves. I walked in with some doubt, and walked out in complete and utter shock as to just how well done the film was! Gareth Edwards took Godzilla and did what many films before this couldn't, He made us care about the characters around the King. With the older films I noticed something. I like many others only wanted to see Godzilla and had no care for the human characters. Gareth took time to carefully and fully develop each character and make you care for them unlike many of the films predecessors. Edwards also does a fantastic job at giving Godzilla emotion and a sense of connection throughout the movie. You really feel for Godzilla in the end and this is something all Monster movies should strive for. Contrary to what many critics say, You actually see Godzilla Quite a lot, and the movie is anything but boring. I often times found myself wide eyed, mouth wide open in pure amazement to what I was witnessing. This movie gave me hope and respect for all Edwards has achieved with this beautiful film and can achieve in the future of Godzilla. So, to those hesitant about seeing this film in theaters, please go and enjoy. I can promise you will never see a Monster movie as well told and played out as Godzilla. I look forward to experiencing Godzilla again in theaters, and oh boy what an experience it was!","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

In fact I swear the armed forces were deliberately making life hard on themselves as far as taking the beasties out. The noble hero aspect of Godzilla was a bit Hanna-Barbra cartoonish.This movie isn't a patch on Peter Jackson's King Kong which has better human characters, while Cloverfield did a better job of bringing about the end of the world vibe that Godzilla's misleading trailer alluded to.The worst thing about this film is the untrue hype.

And I am completely satisfied with what I got.Because of the enormous amounts of money spent on genre films these days, many people are under the illusion that 'B movie' is a derogatory designation. That is nonsense. Some of my most beloved films are B movies - wonderful adventure thrillers, action fests, horror stories, westerns, mysteries. Sure there are B movies that excel and leap into 'A list' territory (e.g., ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly""). But there's nothing wrong in making a great B Movie - A lot of films by such as Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock were put together with no greater desire than to entertain a ticket buying audience. That's all a B Movie has to do.""Godzilla"" does that grandly. It IS a B movie; so is Hawks' ""El Dorado"" or Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" So it is in good company. And (like all great B movies) it is very entertaining.Edwards succeeds partly because he has designed the movie to look like a movie. This is not a visual roller-coaster ride. No shaky-cam or MTV editing here. The sometimes quick closure to action moments, like with Godzilla's first meeting with the MUTO, are clearly intended to bring the audience to the edge of their seats demanding more. This did not work for some critics, but it worked for me. I never felt like I was getting less than I wanted.Also, the pacing was far stronger and more rapid than many reviews had led me to believe. The narrative drive, once one grasps the real narrative, is utterly relentless. And what I mean by that is, the real story here is not about any of the humans. This movie is called ""Godzilla,"" not because he's on screen most of the time (he's not, although we see him far earlier than any of the critics have reported - like in the title sequence) or because he's the 'main' monster (he's not that either, although he plays a much more important role than the others do); but because it's HIS story - it's HIS conflict, and, being THE agent, HE has to resolve it. (The MUTOs are important because they are part of that story, and it is partly their story as well - and they are terrifying, BTW.) Edwards shoots this story slightly off-center, through the eyes of humans trying to cope, only because he has a human audience to play to. (If the audience were all just radioactive lizards, there wouldn't be a human on the screen. But it would still be the same story.)BTW, all of the critics complaining about the somewhat undeveloped characters here have missed the big boat. Whether consciously or not, Gareth Edwards and his team have achieved a remarkable conceptual construction here, staggering in its simplicity and audacity. They have grafted a ('90s) ""Heisei"" era Godzilla story (see, e.g.,: ""Godzilla and Mothra Battle for Earth"") onto a 1950's era Hollywood science fiction film - think ""Them!,"" Pal's ""War of the Worlds,"" or the original ""Thing from Another World."" As I watched these characters struggle to come to grips with their monster problem and still get on getting a job done, I kept thinking of the scientists and soldiers facing similar problems in '50s American sci-fi movies, responding in similar ways with similarly compressed explanations and suppressed emotions. Edwards makes up for any lack of depth to these characters by keeping the perspective on the monster action as close to humans experiencing it as possible - much the way that the directors of the '50s did. The complaints against Aaron Taylor-Johnson, missing this point, miss the finesse of his performance - he is doing what Edwards wants him to do, standing in as 'Everyman' avatar for the audience (much like James Arness in ""Them!""); any stronger performance would have been distracting.But the main story is of course the monsters'; that also has been missed. The humans are witnessing the culmination of a conflict beginning millions of years ago. Consequently, they are merely annoyances for the monsters who are enacting their ancient struggle for natural resources. This drama is in fact a fluidly unfolding whole, which critics who try to impose a classic '3 act' structure on it fail to see. This film has a prologue, the narrative certainly has connecting episodes, but there are no 'acts' - once in the present day, it just goes.Which is why the finale is actually quite satisfying. For the real protagonist of the film, with the big fight over, there's no need for a wrap-up - and surely no need for commentary from those pesky little hairless apes, who don't have the slightest clue as to what's really going on in the world they think they dominate.What more need be said? Like the '50s sci-fi movies it so heartedly evokes, the dialog is sometimes silly and cliché. The photography and design are solid; the music is not at all dull, it is supportive of the visuals without drawing attention to itself (which is a classic '50s era soundtrack composition rule-of-thumb, BTW). The CGI is state of the art (I saw it in 2D and it looked great). And there are a lot of 'Holy Crap!' moments that are truly memorable.And did it pay homage and honor to the source material, the original series produced by Toho, 28 films over 50 years? Absolutely. The story is very ""Heisei"" era, and as good a reboot as ""Godzilla 2000."" For a kaiju eiga junky, this film is seventh heaven.

Yeah Go back to voicing simba Ferris Bueller! You stupid idiot...ahem I don't hate Mathew Brodrick, he's just a really boring bland actor. In this new Godzilla movie we get slightly less bland actors, yeah! No but seriously the people in this movie act more like human beings with real emotions. I had to look up the actors names, but Bryan Cranstan, who looks an awful lot like Liam Neeson(if you don't know who Liam Neeson is then ;p) Bryan Cranstan was the guy in the trailers who seemed like the main character. *spoiler* He is not the main character, Godzilla is! *spoiler* No seriously the movie follows that dude and his son, who was like kind of like Shia lebeouf's character in Transformers, except this guy is in the military. Still it's kind of funny, optimus-Godzilla! lol. Anyways The movie begins slow, at first it's all like Jurassic Park, then it's like Alien, Then it's like THESE PEOPLE EXIST! Then it's like and so do these monsters. and yep...at the beginning of the movie they established that not main character guy and his son Shia le'not'beef sure exist, for too damned long! That is one of my problems with the movie. I get it we set up characters to feel sorry for when bad things happen to them. But I came to see monster gosh darned it! And when the monsters were finally on screen the movie was amazing from thee I won't talk about the plot, but it was pretty awesome.My only problem is this. So the military sends a small group into a city where the monsters are, and well. my question is. Why were the soldiers armed with AK-47s? What is a puny gun like that going to do to a monster the size of a skyscraper? You'd might as well through paper clips at the monsters, because your tiny bullets won't do much to hurt them. Like seriously I get that the soldiers should be armed, but really how is a little gun gonna do anything? like why not a bazooka or grenades something with a bit more bite than a rifle. Whatever.Anyways my suggestion is to go see it! Now, drop what you are doing buy a ticket online and go now. If you don't have money steal it from a homeless guy. Sell your body into prostitution for the tickets, I don't care how you get into the theater you just really need to see it!","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

I love how Godzilla was being portrayed here just like most of times in the comics. The design of the monsters were awesome and really made them look so terrifying Cast Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen really had that chemistry as husband and wife but to me the only thing that didn't make their marriage look believable was that they looked kind of young to be husband and wife and have a toddler son some more. Glad to see Ken Watanabe back. He did well for his part as so did most of the other castSome of my complains however would to be that I think the fight scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOS were not long enough and focus were given more to the humans. Apart from that, I'm was really hoping they brought some of the other classic monsters back instead of creating original ones(MUTOS) for the movie like his 2 main adversaries King Ghidorah and Hedorah The Smog Monster Overall the fights were still entertaining and Godzilla really looked grand and terrifying to watch. Fans of the series in my opinion will like this movie but casual moviegoers will have 1 or 2 questions on their mind","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Loved the new look of Godzilla. Great story line in adding the human element. The scenes were incredible, I liked the scene of the Hilton Rainbow Tower in Waikiki (an actual place) shown torn to shreds, it made it seem real. The sound effects were like watching jaws, you know what's coming but you still freak out when it happens. Everyone in the theater clapped after the show, we were not disappointed by this film. CONS: The star of the movie (Godzilla)did not have enough air time. The other actors were pretty flat, thankfully Bryan Cransen held up the story, he should get an Emmy for his performance.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

I do have one problem with the movie, which I am mixed with but I am keeping my mouth shut. Anyway, that is all I want to mention, and hope you enjoy reading my review. After the other American version of ""Godzilla"" that was made back in 1998 by Roland Emmerich, which it disappointed by many fans and considered to be the worst. Maybe not the worst, but there are some other Godzilla movies that aren't good. As I previously mention in my review of the original classic 1954 movie, I have not seen any of the Godzilla movies or the 1998 movie but I wouldn't mind checking them out. With that said, this Godzilla is awesome and really the monster you don't want to mess with. I got a chance to see it for its first screening and really had a fun time. The action is pretty darn good, and Gareth Edwards does a capable job to handle the action as well as directing. The cast did great in this movie. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were fine with there parts, but I give special praises to Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston. The music by Alexandre Desplat is very subtle, and some of the scenes work well without music like what the original did. The look of Godzilla looks brilliant, and it is cool to hear his classic roar in this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out because Godzilla is back and he is better than ever! I give it a 10 out of 10!","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

It's not like Godzilla could star opposite Jennifer Aniston in a cute, cuddly little romantic comedy. So, when the 'king of monsters' got an offer to star in a Hollywood retelling using his very own name as its title, he must have jumped at the chance (possibly causing a minor earthquake in his city).However, what the poor misguided monster didn't know was that his role in the film was little more than a 'bit part.' The producers probably mentioned that they also had the great Bryan Cranston on board, fresh on the back of his success in 'Breaking Bad.' I don't blame Godzilla for being optimistic. He probably expected to be engaged in numerous deep and emotional scenes with the man who played 'Heisenberg.' Yet it turned out that he was merely duped. The trailer for the film made it look like the two of them would be carrying the film together. How wrong they were.For a start, Cranston isn't in it much as the trailer and marketing would suggest and, secondly, you hardly get to see the monster! The film is two hours long. For the first half an hour we have Bryan Cranston. And, as you'd expect if you've watched Breaking Bad, you'll know he's awesome. He has the drama and screen presence (or at least right kind of manic nuttiness) to hold your attention. Then he goes out of it. So, does the monster take over? Well, not really.We see Godzilla's back. Sometimes we see his thighs (and, yes, he is looking a little 'out of shape' after being off our screens for so long). And occasionally we hear him roar. However, every time he's about to open up a can of whoop-ass on some bad monster, it reminds me of that scene in Reservoir Dogs where Mr Blond tortures a police officer and the camera pans away. This happens every time in Godzilla. As soon as the action starts, the camera cuts to something on the other side of the planet (kind of literally – if the monsters start a fight in Tokyo, the action switches to San Francisco).Yes, the end of the film (and by that I mean the last quarter of an hour of a two hour epic) you get to see the monsters finally get stuck into each other. But, between Bryan Cranston leaving the film and the 'HALO jump' right before the final stand-off, there really isn't much to keep your attention. I sort of get what they were trying to do. I'm sure the producers would call it 'building up tension,' but they take it a little too far. Imagine a Terminator movie where they only had the titular cyborg in it for give minutes. How well would that work? Oh, wait, they did – Terminator: Salvation. And how well did that go down?! I hear they're already thinking of making a sequel to Godzilla. I just hope the titular character gets his representatives to actually negotiate more screen time for the poor guy.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It could really enhance the film experience or ruin it. In a way, while I still enjoyed this film, it did kind of both.I will try not to spoil this film but what the trailers hinted at is that this movie takes place in a world where monsters exist. And given that zombies have taken over pop culture, Pacific Rim really needs some backup.The plot basically starts out with Heisenberg trying to figure out the truth behind an incident which he witnessed and that leads to the revelation that monsters exist. However Malcolm's dad isn't the central protagonist of this film, he actually gets cut short of screen time. Thats what happens when you get the 'and' label in the opening credits. However the amount of screen time he had, it was either go hard or go home, and he put his Breaking Bad chops into play.Actually the central protagonist is Kick Ass, and really? He's too damn young or at least too young looking to play a high ranking military guy and family man. Just because he's married to a lady twice his age doesn't mean he can play mature roles. And he's basically has a Brad Pitt World War Z story arc, trying to reconnect with his wife, a good looking Olsen sister I didn't know exist. There is Saito, who plays the scientist researching the monsters and has some pretty questionable philosophical views. And there are way too man expendable characters.I've been talking about the actors too much and that's because the movie focuses on the humans. Which is good story telling because it's easier to be invested in the story, just like the Walking Dead. But let's be honest, aren't we here to see monsters scrap? Well we kind of do but there's way too much buildup. Whenever we do see monsters finally come on screen the first couple of times it immediately cuts to the aftermath. You get serious blue balls. Eventually it does pay off, not the way you hope but it has some insanely cool moments.The imagery of this film, wow. Remember that 1998 Roland Emmerich film? Yea that's a Disney film, with all the markings of a pre-9/11 light hearted romp. This film has such beautiful but shockingly dark and brooding imagery. When the carnage and destruction takes place, it's a little disturbing but jaw dropping at the same time. It basically recaptures the sense of atmosphere by the original 1954 Ishiro Honda picture.This movie also has a not-so-subtle anti-nuclear power and weapons theme. Come on, Hollywood why do you keep demonizing something that you clearly don't fully understand? Nuclear energy is clean and renewable, and if disposed of properly the waste decays in time without doing much harm. And nuclear weapons while scary, will always be used as deterrents and not as actual weapons.In the end this film is a very solid effort. You will find yourself, like me, nitpicking the crap out of it, but still enjoying it. It is not disappointing at all like the 1998 movie and it manages to capture its tone really well.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

But it is with great regret I say that I was a huge fan of the Godzilla movies as a child. The amount of hours I spent watching Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla when I was 4 and 5 is more or less innumerable. I absolutely adored everything about the beast. And I despised everything about 98, American remake, which despite CGI and being set in New York was an insult to the Godzilla I had watched obliterating King Ghidorah and Destroyah. Fastfoward to 2014 and I was in the cinema with mixed expectations for the new adaption. It was a must watch, but I didn't know quite what I would think. So it was a huge surprise to me, when the movie took a turn from ''bland heroic effort for humanity to destroy monster ( read: Cloverfield, Pacific Rim ) '' into ''monster punchup ala classic Japanese movies and anime''. I totally was not expecting the movie to introduce other beasts than Godzilla, with massive appetite for destruction ( and nuclear waste ). So was the movie pleasing to me as a Godzilla fan? Well, the Godzilla parts was absolutely pleasing. When I heard the big guy roar at the top off his longues with his Godzilla roar, I was squeeling like a child on Christmas. If I would have been five years old, the scream would literally make me cry in happiness. This is however, the problem with the movie: As good work as Edward has done with much of the movie, most of the film is not about Godzilla. Most of his appearances is teasing and while it keeps you hungering for more, it doesn't keep your appetite wet. And that is courtesy to the cast off humans that try to make sense out of their circumstance and integrate the situation. Most of the characters do not quite feel like they a cog in the mechanism off the movie. They did for the first 30 minutes, where Ryan Cranston delivers with true charisma. However, the rest off the cast is sadly 2 dimensional and many off them could have died in the first five minutes without any change in sense really. It is of course, necessary with these human characters, otherwise we would get ''short attention span'' type off movie. Unfortunately, it is not pulled off very well and while it is clear that the human interactions are meant to make the movie ''the dark knight'' of Monster flicks, it just isn't very interesting.But in sense, this is still the dark knight off monster flicks: the movie quickly catches up in an epic finale of monster clashing, that managed to maintain my massive throbbing erection. For that I am willing to forgive the movie for it's mistakes, whosever fault it is that the character development was poor, I am willing to forgive that, as long as it would in a potential sequel would managed to catch up. All-in-all, you can sort off say that this is a movie analogous to eating ferrero rocher dipped in wet paper. It's not a bad experience in any sense, it just makes more sense to buy your ferrer rocher at a different store.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The only props I can give are:1) they do a good job of portraying Japan without being racist - except for the fact that just about everyone speaks with perfect English accents and that a white gaijin (foreigner) is throwing around orders at a nuclear power plant at the beginning of the film. Yeah right. But they use actual Japanese actors (err.. one) at least. Watanabe Ken!!!! However. Evoking the fear and pain of Tohoku earthquake and subsequent fukushima meltdown in certain scenes (Hawaii, Japanese power plant) I won't spoil, was really, really cheap. Hollywood evokes the terror of 9/11 all the time, so using disasters as an easy hot button isn't new or surprising. But for God's sake, we haven't even fully rebuilt Miyako yet. We only just this year even confirmed the death toll. Couldn't they wait a couple more years for God's sake? Too soon, man. 2) the action scenes were pretty cool - as to be expected from a high-budget Hollywood film. Anyone giving this movie a high rating is probably thinking of the special effects, because most people seem to be easily dazzled by flashy CGI. But the CGI is all this film has got. This production team was so lazy they even CGI'ed friggin' Mt. Fuji instead of filming on location. Seriously, why bother even using real actors? Make yourself another Final Fantasy travesty, why don't ya. It's too obvious... and there's nothing worse than really obvious CGI. But the story is terrible and filled with plot holes. Just because the concept is fantastic doesn't mean you have to make it COMPLETELY implausible. If a movie that takes itself as seriously as Godzilla completely dispenses with believability, it interferes with the audiences ability to escape into the movie because they're too busy saying, ""yeah right"" to themselves.

Now I grew up watching the Godzilla TV show. I saw some of the B movies too! It was fun. I am ashamed to say it was not until adulthood that I learned from my older brother there was an original movie Godzilla the Japanese made in the 1950s. Well, low and behold the AFI theater in town showed the original with subtitles this spring and I saw it! I was surprised how serious it was and also how GOOD! I so enjoyed it. I really don't think I would have received all the punches of the new Godzilla movie if I had not seen the old one, I feel like almost a prerequisite. I was frantic the whole movie which I love being breathless! LOL! I only wish I had seen it at the theater!","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

If the movie had been free I would have demanded a refund. The best thing I can say about this movie was that it was boring. Very boring. I could hardly stay awake. My wife described it as the most boring movie she has seen in a decade, and I would have to agree with her. Frankly, half way through the movie I began to wonder if we were in the wrong theater since the only monsters that had appeared were the 2 MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), male and female. Although Godzilla's fins had been seen a few times earlier, It was almost a relief when Godzilla finally got out of the water to do a little fighting. Frankly, if I were you I'd rent the old 1954 Japanese Godzilla. Just an aside: in the original movie the older people remember when virgins were sacrificed to Godzilla to appease his wrath. Probably would have improved this movie to sacrifice a dozen virgins or so.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

Bryan Cranston's character is NOT the main character, has a minimal role in the movie, and really the first 30 minutes of the movie that feature him could have been removed from the film entirely. Also, a lot of pointless back story. The Japanese scientist brings up Hiroshima to a Navy general in a very forced manner that adds NOTHING to the movie other than giving it a faux deeper meaning or morality or some crap. All of the acting was TERRIBLE. This may very well be the first film I've seen that did not feature a single good actor or actress. Also, the monsters are only on screen for maybe 30 minutes and that's a liberal estimate. This movie is NOT about Godzilla. Finally, the worst thing about the movie was its plot which was entirely nonsensical - the transporting by train, the Golden Gate Bridge scene, Yucca Mountain - nothing in the plot made any sense at all. Horrible, horrible, horrible movie. Stay away from this junk.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

I can't finely pinpoint but somewhere in the rain (again) and behind the Vegas take down there is some sort of snore factor that takes precedent. I enjoy a destruction film but when a filmmaker becomes too preoccupied with the pretentious ideal that the film in question is somehow more than a destruction film, then there is so much human drama fodder to sift through in order to get to the good stuff. The flip side – the good stuff is truly awesome and relentless without skipping on annihilating as much as possible. Maybe I just didn't care about the main characters and their lives? Maybe I just didn't care about anyone's existence if it meant that the destruction would have to cease? Maybe I am just annoyed that Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston seem to set the precedent of how great the performance in this movie is going to be but then it turns out that they're the best thing that isn't a special effect? Did Aaron Taylor-Johnson worry about how hot he looked constantly? Yes. He was ripped. The end. Did Elizabeth Olsen get to flex anything other than her sob skills? No. She cried so much. She cried probably just as much as Ken Watanabe stares, into the distance, at screens, out windows, he stares so much. But the title is Godzilla and as far as the title is concerned, the film delivers. Godzilla is definitely well worth it. The humongous, roaring, destructive anti-hero with rocky-leathery skin and the somehow illusive existence is fun to watch. The build up was well timed. And the action was nicely paced so the viewer could soak it all up.The story - Basically there are two new mutant creatures out to destroy all in order to procreate and destroy even more. In steps Godzilla because why should something else destroy what he is not? What more does one need to know? Oh, Godzilla is loud. 6.5/10","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

So i popped down to my cinema and got comfy for what i thought was gonna be 2 hours of epic monster beat downs but no it turns out i spent most of the film just a bit bored. I found there was one moment in the film that completely summed it up for me so there has been news reports of these giant creatures having a bit of a smack down The camera then follows the flying creature as it flies past a office block and what do we see in the office block people sat at there desks i mean seriously in full suit and tie sat at there desks. Now i am aware that there are people who don't watch the news anymore but seriously you might have heard about the 3 bloody giant monsters kicking the crap out of each other and thought you know today i am not going to work. I mean if you didn't turn up whats gonna happen after the giant monster apocalypse your gonna get fired. Lots of things in the films where utter rubbish but that bit really irritated me that the director decide there would be people sat a filing, was this to add a sense of dread that these people where gonna die. Well in this humble reviewers opinion i did not feel dread for these people i just thought of Darwin and if these people where stupid enough to get out of bed they deserved dying by Godzilla's fart rant over I'm gonna go watch a man in a rubber suit destroy Tokyo","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

I will say that some aspects of this film let me down a little, but overall, I was very satisfied with the film and highly praise director Gareth Edwards for his take on the King of the Monsters. This movie completely surpasses ""Godzilla"" 1998 in almost every way (which, for all purposes, shouldn't even be called ""Godzilla"" anymore) and is also quite comparable to the original 1954 Godzilla film that started the franchise, as it faithfully retells Godzilla's origins in modern times while still exercising similar themes felt in the classic films. I thought that the monster scenes were fantastic, and the visual effects that created them were equally beautiful. The characters were a little bland and plain, but were overall okay. This movie isn't your typical action flick where every other scene is boom-flashy-explosions. It makes you think a little more and challenges today's audiences to put down the Transformers DVDs and return to the standards that made monster movies classics. I compare the teasing of the monster action to Jaws and John Carpenter's The Thing, where, you don't get to see the title character all too much, but the presence of them is felt throughout, and when they do appear on screen, it's a sight to behold. I recommend this film for all monster fans, but for the common audience, you should be well aware of what this movie represents and the cultural icon of Godzilla before you decide to go see it, it may impact whether you like it or not.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

This is such an incredible disaster movie and truly the best Godzilla movie since the 1954 original. The way Gareth Edwards expertly brought up the original themes with even some Showa-era messaging that, didn't anthropomorphise Godzilla too much, yet could also make the movie with direct intervention from the US military is quite a spectacular feat. The suspense and dread throughout the movie, and the brilliant visuals that also managed to mirror different real-life disasters all together make this such an amazing movie. Elizabeth Olsen really shined in what would have been such a small cliche role if it was anyone else. Ken Watanabe gives a measured performance that is meant to show the empathy needed in this world as well as the hint of silliness that is earnest in awe of these monsters.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Mostly because I really, REALLY like the head sculpt (I know its CGI, but its CGI designed to look like a guy in a rubber suit).""He was only in 20 minutes of the movie."" - Yep. Should have been more Godzilla in a Godzilla movie. But part of that, I think, is the fact that it was just too damn long. Way too much peripheral crap that didn't really add much. However, I understand that's Edwards' thing (highlighting the human drama and using the creatures as background), and again, I can accept that.""The MUTOs were lame/stupid/unimaginative."" - Meh. Can't really say they were any lamer than Baragon or King Caesar, and Mothra really wasn't the height of imagination either. Still, these are antagonists that we love. So I can easily accept the MUTOs into the pantheon of Godzilla foes, though they should have had names instead of acronyms.""The story was crap/The characters were one-dimensional/I can pick out xxx things that were ridiculous."" - yeah, there were a lot of dumb things in the story. No point in going through them all, I don't have space. But again, it's a Godzilla movie. No one should be going to see this for anything other than the title character. Anyone who wants to nitpick this obviously hasn't watched 'Godzilla vs. Megalon' in its full glory.""Its way better than the 1998 version."" - Duh. That wasn't a Godzilla movie, that was a monster movie. Hell, other than his uncharacteristic luck with Stargate, anything with Roland Emmerich involved is probably going to be pretty stupid anyway.""It had an Olsen sister and the Kick-Ass guy in it."" - yeah, it did. Certainly not a big enough issue to pan the film, at least for me.Anyway, those are the biggies, and if they were all, I could easily have given this movie a 7 - it WAS entertaining after all. Unfortunately, my biggest issue is one that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere (though I could have just missed it): Legendary/WB/Edwards didn't use Godzilla's roar. Let me say that again... THEY DIDN'T USE THE ROAR. One of the most iconic sound effects in movie history, and they failed to use it. Unforgivable, and a game-changer, at least for me.It may seem like a small detail, but think about the reaction to a Star Wars movie that had Darth Vader without James Earl Jones' voice. Total fail. And that's exactly what happened here.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I'm glad i watched it on the big screen in 3D, because on home cinema i't won't be very impressive, but overall special effects and especially sound effects were really good, and sometimes very haunting.

Jones,Carson Bolde, and Sally Hawkins, Directed By:Gareth Edwards Review As a child I always wanted to see a Godzilla movie in theaters but unfortunately when there was one in America I was too young to see it and watched that crappy Zilla film from 1998 and my father said""Hey son it's Godzilla."" I responded ""It doesn't look like him daddy."" After waiting for twelve years I finally got to see a Godzilla film in theaters but does it live up to the predecessor from 1954? You might or might have not seen the original 1954 film,if you haven't I suggest you do it's amazing.But this reboot like all the other reboots and countless sequels to Godzilla it connects because it is his origin. In the opening sequence of the film is what in 1954 between America and Godzilla. Godzilla in this picture is not as silly as Americans have thought in the past. If you want a serious film go see this it will be very worth it. If you have followed my other reviews of Godzilla films you would note that not all of them had interesting characters, only three of them. But this finally has both interesting characters and emotional depth with some of them and this is a Godzilla film were you actually get to feel for Godzilla. Bryan Cranston plays a scientist who in 1999 saw his wife die at the nuclear plant where they work and believes that it's being covered up for a reason. His son on the other hand put it behind him, and he has a loving wife and a kid. But after joining his father to pick up some old discs to prove to him he's not crazy,they get arrested and find a giant ball that has electromagnetic radiated energy. A monster is unleashed from that ball and starts wrecking havoc. The rest is left to be seen. The movie is very dark like the original from 1954 and is very real with it's special effects by having a man in a suit of the new designed Godzilla and with some enhanced CGI is made to look like your actually looking at a monster, just like the Japanese films from the past. (if the new monsters were guys in suits or just CGI,I'm unaware.) It isn't as pix-elated as zilla from 1998,it's fooling into believing that your actually looking at a monster on screen. It will be the best CGI you will ever see in a film this year. A lot of the film centers on the human characters Ford Brody(Aaron Taylor Johnson), Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), Elle Brody(Elizabeth Olsen), Dr. Ishrio Seriwaza(Ken Watanabe) and Sandra Brody(Juliette Binoche). There might be some Godzilla fans who really don't care about that(I never really like those types of Godzilla fans and neither should you). The acting was the best thing about this movie. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen give the best performances out of the movie.

Instead of lots of monster fighting scenes there's lots of scenes of humans acting and delivering dialog, cause that's what people who go see a Godzilla movie want to see. When the monsters do fight and no actor is delivering worthless dialog, its either at night or in a dust storm, thus insuring that ninety percent of the fight is obscured. It's like the people who made this Godzilla did not understand the core concept of a Godzilla movie- it's supposed to be all about giant monsters that fight, watch any Godzilla movie other than the two American ones, it's all giant fighting monsters.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's about intensive heat; either with the humans back story, how these creatures originated and survive and the films constant tension and action. Sneaky & unique opening credit sequence immediately has you intrigued. Not a wasted frame or moment with a fast moving storyline. So many of the negative reviews posted concern amounts of time given to characters and action. These people apparently share the same broken watch. The first hour build-up moved lightning quick with suspense turned up high. I was jolted out of my seat at last four times throughout the film and was always excited. Everything positive you've read in prior reviews is spot on. Honestly, I was enthralled with the non monster situations / action sequences as much as the battles and devastation scenarios. I'm back for another visit next week. Best film of 2014..... bar none!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was expecting it to be great! It seems to start well but literally in the first 5 minutes you're brought into the middle of a family's life and expected to care about them. Admitted Bryan Cranston gave a fantastic performance (as always!) but the writing just wasn't that good. There wasn't any reason for us to worry about what would become of these characters because, well, no one gave us a reason. I couldn't tell you either parent's name without looking it up. I only know Ford's because I just saw it on the cast/character list when scrolling. It kind of felt like someone had smushed a story around several lengthy Godzilla battles... which looked awesome I have to say (although got repetitive very quickly), but it took away even more from the characters we're supposed to be rooting for, which was a shame. I wanted to care, a great bloody disaster was unfolding for crying out loud, but it just didn't work.I saw Monsters, Gareth Edwards' seriously low budget monster movie, which I really enjoyed. The story seemed original, the characters were believable and the special effects brilliant. Then you hear it was edited by just a handful of people in hotel rooms during filming. Unfortunately I didn't see this brilliant film-making I had been hoping to see much in Godzilla. It was there, but only briefly.It was good to watch, but only that I'm afraid. It's pretty but lacking everywhere else.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

First off, many people say this film is bad because they themselves lack patience. I praise this film for that. It brought me right back to the first time I watched Jaws. The anticipation of seeing the creature was just killing me. The constant teasing of the title character throughout the film was perfect. Second, when people say that Godzilla is barely in it, they make it seem like nothing is happening when he's off screen. The MUTOs keep a balance between the humans and Gojira. Speaking of the MUTOs I've also heard the complaint that they have nothing to do with Japanese culture. While I understand that Godzilla originates from Japan and the terrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this is an American interpretation of the character. That is not a requirement for this interpretation. I've also heard that the 98 version is better than this version. While Godzilla isn't on screen for very long, it is better than the 98 which lacked the character entirely. You can argue that the 98 Zilla is an American interpretation of Godzilla. But Zilla lacks certain characteristics of the Japanese version to even be considered the American Godzilla. Now I won't defend the acting of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. Taylor-Johnson was stoic and mostly boring, but what can you expect from a script written for a marine character. And Olsen really didn't contribute much to the film other than the dramatic reunion at the end. Offsetting that would be Bryan Cranston's powerful and driving acting and Ken Wantanabe's Gojira obsessed scientist character. While I will admit that there are some stale and cheesy moments that isn't enough to justify calling it a bad film. The good definitely outweigh the bad, and I hope to see The King of the Monsters again in American theaters.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

In this movie, after a nuclear reactor meltdown it awakens a roach looking creature in Japan. This creature seeks to mate and travels the world looking for radiation and its male counterpart. In comes Godzilla, ready to save the day with its fire breath and larger body that tears into major cities as it fights these two larger ""cockroaches"". The effects are pretty amazing as downtown Las Vegas and San Francisco are destroyed, the power grid failure makes you sense how vulnerable our modern apparatuses can be. Our military seems amateurish as it seeks to destroy these threats. Many scenes are reminiscent and pay homage to past Godzilla renditions when you see folks running and stopping in their tracks as they yell out ""Godzilla"".","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

I was expecting to be blown away by the visuals and boy it was good. I am not saying this has a great plot, no. But it has just the plot to make the movie look brilliant. The storyline was a bit slow, I agree but the pace was just good enough to give the Godzilla a deserving entry. The movie had a worthy opponent which was in my opinion the highlight. It also had the visual punch which I think was missing in the previous movies. The monster was very well depicted and if you are someone who in the middle of the movie worry about the plot could have been altered here, it will not disappoint you. I mean you know you are walking in to a movie with a gigantic fictional character who is best known for toying mighty tanks and withstanding direct missile attacks. If you should still expect story line or LOGIC you are clearly wrong. I relived the 9 year old boy in me. I jumped when I saw the monster in daylight and the pure roar of this beast gave me bumps.Godzilla is not the cup of tea for serious critics but god it was great fun.

Now, in Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla,"" he is a god, the alpha predator, a force of nature. Warner Bros.' has not only crafted an exhilarating ""Godzilla"" movie here, it has pulled an incredible P.R. move, transforming a brand last known for having Matthew Broderick as its spokesperson.David Callaham, writer of ""The Expendables,"" and Max Borenstein have grounded this version of ""Godzilla"" in historical fiction. Nuclear tests in the '50s were not tests but an attempt to destroy Godzilla, a last remaining vestige of prehistoric times. They also ground the film in characters, taking a lengthy amount of time to tell the story of Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). These characters both humanize the story and get us in close to the main plot.First we are taken back to 1999. Joe and his wife (Juliette Binoche) work for a nuclear power plant in Japan. Increases in seismic activity worry Joe, yet his superiors refuse to shut the plant down. When a spike in these electromagnetic pulses causes a nuclear breach that eventually destroys the city, Joe loses his wife. In the present, Joe has become crazed attempting to find answers. Ford, his son, an explosives expert in the Navy, reconnects with him when he must leave his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son to go bail his father out of jail. Joe eventually convinces his son to go back with him to their old Japanese town and discover what the governments of the world are hiding there. Turns out the pulses are happening again.What results this time is the release of a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) that begins to wreak havoc as it moves across the Pacific. As the military creates an action plan, a Japanese researcher (Ken Watanabe) and his assistant (Sally Hawkins) draw upon what they've learned from Joe and Ford and theorize that Godzilla could be their only hope, the alpha predator looking to restore order to the food chain.Painting Godzilla as an ambiguous ""good guy"" we know little about works to the film's advantage and suits Edwards' style quite well. Edwards' indie monster flick (titled ""Monsters"") expertly created mystery, fear and awe around its monsters and Edwards does the same for Godzilla and the MUTOs (that's right, there are two). He captures the same sense of scale that Guillermo del Toro did in last summer's ""Pacific Rim"" and there's little doubt the master monster-making filmmaker would praise this effort.Edwards works a nice balance of teasing us with the presence of these creatures and giving us solid glimpses, walking the line of monster blockbuster and monster art film. He prefers shots that keep the human characters involved or come from their perspective so we not only get a sense for just how big and terrifying the creatures are, but we also feed off the raw energy of the actors' performances. Taylor-Johnson has been a leading man before, but he gets a lot thrown at him in this movie and makes it all work. Somehow (conveniently) he constantly finds himself in the monsters' warpath and it keeps things interesting.Multiple monsters also proves essential to the entertainment factor of ""Godzilla."" Yes, monsters fighting is enormously more delightful than a single monster leveling buildings, but it also gives us something to watch for as an audience to keep the wheels turning. Ultimately, this drives our interest in the film; not what happens to the human characters, who serve as a moderately compelling excuse for us to ""get in"" on the action. The resulting effect is that we get a Godzilla who is not just the big scary monster terrorizing the city, but an elusive creature driven by biological impulse, an ""X"" factor and one that we can root for. That's how it should be. ""Godzilla"" doesn't have to belong in the horror-action genre; he can be part of a supernatural action thriller. Godzilla also doesn't have to be the entire focus of the movie. Joe and Ford's story centers around what's going on with the MUTO, and Godzilla just sort of jumps in.Urban carnage is the theme du jour for blockbusters, so what Warner Bros. and Edwards have done with this new ""Godzilla"" isn't trend-shattering, but they've taken great care to their approach with reinventing a giant monster movie for a modern audience. They also don't assume that the people most interested in seeing a giant monster movie lack the sophistication to appreciate a little artistic nuance and thoughtful storytelling.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Mr Michael Bay, your time is well and truly up my friend!","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Chose to be Good Instead of Popular","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3017488/?ref_=tt_urv","alexpskywalker","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40551654/?ref_=tt_urv","17 May 2014","This new Godzilla movie could have easily fallen into the trap of being a mindless action movie. It could have been a quick cash grab the next 'Transformers', but instead this movie chose to have a soul. From the start Godzilla is a very emotional film, and continues to be the entire time. This movie managed to make me care about the humans which few (if none) giant monster movies ever have. However, Godzilla isn't truly a 'giant monster movie', it is more of a disaster film.Other good things: The director cleverly uses camera angles to portray the humans as actual humans, not just a crowd. Similarly, main characters a placed in key positions that make every act of destruction meaningful--every action has a shown consequence. Finally Godzilla is the as cool as he's every been. He's very animistic, and very large. If your worried about him being CGI don't be, he's more emotive than ever. Complainants: Not enough Godzilla and not enough action. Most of all the action is held for the end, and most of the movie had to be carried by the actors. Recommendations: Don't go in expecting a lot of action. Go in expecting a lot of emotion. Don't bring kids, they will be bored. My 10 year old brother saw it with me and loved it, but anyone much younger would probably be bored. Conclusion: A very powerful very original movie that manages to create very humane, humans. Also not a traditional action film, but a disaster film with monsters in it. Biggest problem is not enough of it's title character. I highly recommend to non-Godzilla fans as well as Godzilla fans. 9/10","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Even when we don't see monster until 40 minutes into the movie, the passing is well carried and I never got bored. The CGI and photography was excellent, and the story was simple but makes a good excuse for a very simple premise. The only thing I didn't like, is the military behaviour. Are they really so short minded? would they really act always shooting guns even when it's clearly useless? in the hypothetical situation of something like this happening, would they only think of sending soldiers with guns to shoot? do they have anyone actually thinking in the headquarters? Anyway, I guess is the point of making it a bit stereotyped for the movie. I really liked how the story is told from the the point of view of the humans but the movie never loses the focus in the monsters.Very good photography, good story, acting and sound. I definitely recommend it for monster movie lovers.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

Sure, the monsters looked great, and Godzilla itself was looking like the real deal, compared to the 1998 dud; but it's a MONSTER movie, not Terms of Endearment. It's supposed to be summer slam-bang entertainment, not one of those Oscar seeking type. The preview hype made me expect something along the lines of the first Transformers' movie - brawn AND brains. When it should have had more throat grabbing monster fights, Godzilla ended up being given less screen time appearance than some of the actors. One moment he appears, and you adrenalin goes up expecting a big pow-wow; next, the scene cuts to Elizabeth Olsen's character- not the kind of letdowns you want in a summer movie! And the acting - other than Cranston & Binoche, everyone else was wooden - including the great David Strathairn and the usually dependable Ken Watanabe. Look closely, and you'll find unreal expressions from the likes of Sally Hawkins. Aaron-Taylor gives an almost perpetual blur look for the duration of the movie. The Plot too- weak. Sections of the script seems to borrow from a typical Syfy channel do - why is it always down to one scientist who discovers the 'plot'? What are the guys at NASA or the UN doing? And why is it nobody believes that scientist until everything goes kaboom? You think with a budget of some $160m, they'll at least try to bring the script up to date in this age of the internet, but no. I'm giving it a 5 and not a 3 or a 4,only cos of Cranston's short but effective appearance, and cos of Godzilla's monster-awesome looks. Otherwise, this is a biggest letdown since The Dark Knight Returns.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

It was definitely a lot different compared to what I was expecting. That's for sure. But, in my opinion, the movie that we got (with Godzilla as the semi-heroic monster battling against the antagonistic M.U.T.O.'s) is preferable to the movie I had predicted (with an antagonistic Godzilla wrecking things all the way through the movie). This is my new favorite incarnation of Godzilla: a dark guardian protecting the balance of nature, no matter the cost. The special effects are fantastic. The acting is good. The story is great. I have been a Godzilla fan for years, and this is all that I could ask for from a Godzilla movie.

This is one of the very few films which do live up to their hype - and even surpass it in some scenes.Everyone worrying about the new Godzilla, can calm down and watch this film. It let's you forget about what Emmerich did to Godzilla 16 years ago.The cast is great and I would say even better than in many of the Toho originals. Every actor transports the size and drama of the circumstances and events in a very believable way. Bryan Cranston plays his part with such a power and presence, you can only love his character. Ken Watanabe, although playing with a rather stiff facial expression, is believable and likable as the sometimes surprised, sometimes shocked scientist. And Kick-Ass... well he does a good job in playing the running man as well.The plot is what you can expect from a monster movie like this. Humans cause trouble, Godzilla arrives, big monster fight scenes. However, what Edwards and his writer make out of this formula is far better than average. The characters are not too stereotype. The reason why Godzilla appears and why the plot evolves how it evolves is explained in a rather believable way.The filmmakers made a good job in throwing all kinds of different scenes at you. Character drama, intense suspense (I just say railroad bridge), action, battles. Adding the well paced suspense curve, especially in the second half of the film, this film never gets boring.The production design and the scale of the devastation is often caught in big aerial images. Thankfully, Edwards and his cinematographer avoided the use of shaky cam shot expect in 1st person or very close range shots. The big, calm images of Godzilla, the chaos and the destroyed cities transport a very realistic tone.Thanks to the perfect sound design, the audience can feel the strength and the scale of Godzilla and [...] (No Spoilers, right? ;) ) and the devastation. His scream, every step, every crashing building is perfectly sounded. The bass is so intense, it pushes you in your seat. The seats were shaking. Go watch this film in a cinema with a very good and bass-y sound system. You won't regret it.The CGI effects, and now we come to the master himself, are outstanding and simply perfect. If the Academy were open to this kind of film, I'd say we got our CGI Oscar winner here. Godzilla himself looks breathtaking, even with his gained mid-life-crisis pounds. His presence alone are great scenes and his fight with [...] are the icing on the cake. Those scenes are so good, I wish they had more screen time. Which is my only complaint worth mentioning for this film.Godzilla himself gets two, three very strong scenes in this new film. I'd even say some are the best ever in the series. His full size reveal is an outstanding scene and made the audience cheer in my screening. Those scenes truly are ""HE IS BACK, B*TCHES!"" moments.In my opinion, every scene in this film destroys the complete Emmerich film. Even better, in some scenes, it seems to make fun of the 98 film.For me (us 3) as monster movie fans, this film is one of the best Godzilla movies to date, one of the best monster movies in years and it does not need to hide behind the Toho originals (as they were involved in some basic decisions).9 / 10","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Give the build up a chance, Godzilla is not your every day character/monster/hero. He is a Mythical Creature, a Legend, a God of sorts... that comes to fruition and delivers. That's what this is. Godzilla doesn't require much screen time to make a statement. Harsh critics are expecting too much, and it's that kind of thinking that leads to an over exposed sequel. So to those that find Godzilla too fat, and find him lacking screen time, let me recommend the (1998) Ronald Emmerich reincarnation of Godzilla. Some reviews have stated that the structure, pace and delivery of the story is similar to that of The Dark Knight, however, I found this story to resemble the structure of Batman Begins. The story-line is strong, doing a great job of building up the character of a creature we can barely imagine in our minds. Gareth Edwards then takes our expectations and delivers with visually epic and scaled scenes that represent the enormity of the central figure (Godzilla). There really isn't much more to say, this is a Godzilla film that intends to go down as a Classic and rightfully, it will.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

A H-U-G-E improvement over the 1998 Tri-Star bastardization(I know, that's not saying a whole helluva lot but still..). A very intelligent, plausible approach that wasn't insulting to your intelligence & stayed faithful to Godzilla's true origins. The film had Lots of drama & excitement plus a few surprises. There's also a new nemesis for the big guy that can only be described as a cross between the monster from Cloverfield & Gaos (from the 90's Gamera films). Can't really go into too much detail without possibly spoiling it for others.Positives: Good story arc (kind of reminded me a little of the plot from ""Gamera Guardian of the Universe""). Great performances from Bryan Cranston & the guy who played Dr. Serizawa etc.. Good (not great)monster action. The tsunami & various other scenes of chaos & destruction are awesome.Negatives: Godzilla is all CGI & that might take some getting use to especially for those traditionalists like myself who grew up with the suitmation approach. Godzilla is thicker in the body & neck & his roar is slightly different. Don't worry though, his atomic breath remains intact but is not over-used. The other negative might be that they went a little long on the human drama. It also would've been a nice touch that as the credits rolled at the end they would've used Ishiro Honda's original Godzilla theme music.Overall: A definite see for fans of the Big G. 8/9 out of 10","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

GODZILLAIt has been a long, grueling ten years without Godzilla. After seeing this 2014 film directed by Gareth Edwards, I can say the wait was worth it. Edwards only directoral job came from the B-Movie 'Monsters' so you could say this is Edwards directoral debut. I must say, for his first 'real' film, Gareth Edwards did a fantastic job. Every aspect of this film was perfect and I would not want anyone else directing this film after seeing the way Edwards did.The acting in this movie is great. Fresh off his role as Walter White in 'Breaking Bad', Bryan Cranston delivers an amazingly powerful performance. His on-screen presence is so mesmerizing and you want more each time. This is definitely Cranston's best movie performance. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a great job as well, you could hardly even tell this is the same actor from the Kick-Ass' series. Ken Watanabe does an incredible job in this film. Each and every line he speaks is so powerful and delivered with such knowledge, yet fear. I believe this is Watanabe's best performance to date and I believe that most his lines in this film will grow to be classic quotes. Edwards and writer, Max Borenstein did such an amazing job with creating these characters because you really feel for each and every one of them and when they speak you could really feel the terror, or the sorrow or whatever was being delivered from them.This film is absolutely beautiful and so pleasing to the eye. This aspect of the film surprised me so much. The cinematography in this film is perfect. One thing Edwards made clear when directing this film was he wanted to make sure that this was a reality. He wanted to make audiences feel as if this was actually happening and was being documented. I think this was perfect and really brought a sense of terror and dread to the film, making for some really spectacular and memorable moments. For instance, when you get that first look at Godzilla; as the camera pans from grounds level of his massive feet, up to his head is so chilling and iconic. The visual effects in this movie were absolutely breathtaking.That sense of wonder and amazement you got when seeing the dinosaurs in 'Jurassic Park' for the first time is the same way you will feel when getting that first glimpse of Godzilla. These visual effects are so incredibly realistic, you feel as if you are pitted in the same environment with these beasts. Honestly, this was the best aspect of this film and if you have ever seen 'Godzilla' films as a kid it will make you feel like a child again. I know that is how it made me feel. I would be very surprised and disappointed if this film does not get an Oscar nomination for visual effects. I can say with 100% honesty they are the best effects I have ever seen in a film.The score in this film is great. The costume design is good, it serves its purpose. Makeup effects are pretty good. The editing is done great. The sound effects in this film are so strong and it is so well done. The screenplay is perfect. Writer Max Borenstein does a fantastic job and I would really hope he is coming back for the sequels. Every line in this film is perfect and I truly believe there are some classic quotes in this film.Some people complained that Godzilla got too little screen time in this movie. But you have to think back to 'Jurassic Park'. A two hour film, and only a total of twenty minutes of dinosaurs were shown, why? To preserve the wonder and reality. If you were to just have a movie filled with dinosaurs, or Godzilla fighting there would be no amazement. Edwards did a perfect job with the screen time of Godzilla. Every time you see him he is a forced to be reckon with and there is nothing but awe when you see him. I have seen this film a total of three times in theaters and the 'wow factor' never seems to go away. Every time you first get that glimpse of Godzilla you get chills. The iconic roar, the visual effects, the fight sequences it is all just so mind-blowing. I have so much faith in this franchise and I feel it has so much potential to be a huge success like the 'Jurassic Park', 'Star Wars' and 'Dark Knight' franchises. Just thinking of all the success and possibilities makes me so happy to know that kids of this generation and everyone can experience what I did growing up watching all the 'Godzilla films.If you are a huge Godzilla fan you will be overjoyed by this film. Even if you are not a huge Godzilla fan, I think it will be pretty hard not to love this film. Every aspect of this film is perfect, but the cinematography and visual effects will take your breathe away. This is leagues above the 1998 American 'Godzilla' film and Gareth Edwards really did fantastic. This movie offers a lot of thrills, terror, triumph, as well as heart. 'Godzilla' receives a perfect 10/10 from me.","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

Typical blockbuster action movie, the director uses Hollywood convenience to make up for the massive loss of life. From a realist perspective, the effort put forth by the military would leave anyone with a basic understanding of modern weaponry clueless. The lead actor clearly didn't fit the part and it was obvious in the dialogue. Bryan Cranston was terrific in the movie and clearly able to break out of his Walter White role from Breaking Bad. The CGI was terrific, however the cheesy dialogue and poor plot killed it for me.

It did neither, it was in the middle.There were some bad things about it and some good so as always I'll start with the good.I went to watch Godzilla after making a very hard choice between the new X-men movie and edge of tomorrow. Before I went to watch it I read the user reviews and the critics reviews and after reading both I realized equal amounts of users and critics have liked it and equal amounts have, we'll not really liked it. So anyway, I thought why not and I went to watch Godzilla.Opening scene and the few scenes following it, I thought was a very good start for a blockbuster monster flick. Throughout the movie there were nicely filmed scenes with different filming angles and all that made this film very modern and i believe the director of Godzilla is the director that's got the closest to being as good as Christopher Nolan in directing. With epic camera shots and perfectly timed sound effects and very well picked music that gives this movie a very grand touch in the same time making you shiver in excitement, especially the part with the U.S. Soldiers jumping off the aero plane with the red dust or whatever it was and not to forget Godzilla looked quite real and scary.Now for the bad, the acting to start with. Acting was very poor I thought and especially when you take children as some scenes main focus, you must know that the acting should be good, the only acting I thought was excellent was Heisenberg's as always. Also the destruction scenes and the fight scenes and all that are supposed to be epic have been made too epic, which is a bad thing because it makes it all silly and sometimes I wanted to close my eyes and wish it wasn't there in the movie because it was making me well less like it. The storyline was OK, not that bad and as I said it was the fight scenes and the destruction scenes that looked a bit silly which also affected the storyline a little.As I said the first half of the movie was good but as it got to the second half it only got messier and less realistic and by the time it got to the end the story and all was just chaos. Still it was a watchable movie and if you want to watch something else instead then watch something else as this won't be as great as the movie you'll be looking forward to.Not as bad as pacific rim and I think it was the cool filming and the music that really got it at least seven.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Well, it's not the greatest movie in the history of film (that accolade is still reserved for the late Tony Scott's 'Unstoppable'), but the cinema is still intact and completely un-charred.People who see this movie will be split into two groups: those who have seen Gareth Edwards' directorial debut 'Monsters' (the minority), and those that haven't. Those that have will be delighted that all his early promise and potential has been realised in such an impressive manner. How many other directors could render a 300 feet tall plasma- breathing monster so as to elicit such sympathy and support from the audience, or, as my son put it: 'He made Godzilla subtle'. Those that haven't seen 'Monsters' - well, you're missing a treat. And as for those complaining that Godzilla didn't feature enough, remember that sometimes less is more.In conclusion, this is a bloody brilliant film, which, after the abortions that were 'Prometheus' and 'Pacific Rim', has restored my faith in the big-budget blockbuster.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

But after sitting in the theatre for 123 minutes, Godzilla blew my mind. It really was incredible. A movie that really deserves a higher rating than 10 and that's saying something. To me, it was the perfect monster thriller everybody has been wanting to see. Jam-packed with action, a great story and a well-chosen cast(don't listen to the people that say the acting was cheesy), Godzilla will be seen as a one of a kind movie for years to come.The CGI in the film was the best I've seen in any movie. I've never in my life seen CGI as great as this. Think Pacific Rim, and multiply it by like 10 and that's the CGI to expect in the film. It was a dark and almost realistic movie from start to finish. A large kudos to Gareth Edwards for directing this blockbuster - he has a great eye for detail and story and hopefully will make more great films like this one. The true King of the Monsters, Godzilla reigns supreme over all monster flicks with its originality and freshness that one expects to see. Why Godzilla has a 7.6 currently on IMDb baffles me - don't listen to the haters. Go in with an open mind and you will sit there on the edge of your seat enjoying what will be a classic in years to come. GODZILLA!!!

The story is not very original and there are major plot holes that one thinks will be explained before the end, but no. The characters are mostly forgettable. With the best ones being the father (played by Bryan Cranston from breaking bad) of the main character Ford Brody (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and a scientist (played by Ken Watanabe) are relatable and worth following. Ford Brody and his wife and child are really not worth getting upset about when they have hardship. So Perfect movie if you just like action and monster fights and so forth (that part is epic) but just not enough to carry a movie in this day and age! If you want big fights watch pacific rim.

This at least happened 3 times conducted by studios Sony TriStar and Toho Ltd. Co.This time, it was the most suspenseful one out of the handful. It had great story telling through multiple ways which I cannot spoil. If you like to see a movie with a similar style to the Dark Knight Rises or Contagion, you will love this film. It's pacing was very similar to the first Jaws. But, if you want a Michael Bay Transformers or Guilmere Del Toro's Pacific Rim. You might just be disappointed in the lack of action scenes and missed opportunities for the said, anticipated scenes. The good: The camera work was amazing. It had a variety of shots and transitions like a James Camero film. The sound of the music, and the FX were spot on. The tone of the movie was serious, and you would feel like you are on an Earth where this is really happening, and you would be sitting at home watching the news report om it 24/7. Unlike then 1998 Godzilla, this one captured your emotions. Something a monster/kaiju movie rarely does. In conclusion,an epic CGI movie with more than CGI.The ugly and SPOILERS: The Las Vegas and the Hawaii scenes were disappointing, to an extent. You just can't have a shot pulling away from the best parts of the second act. They have teased enough, that was an overdose of teasing. They did cover up to it at an extent with the 3rd act. A long battle between the gargantuan creatures hit one of the best climax's I have seen this year. The movie is a Godzilla or monster movies fan's dream, but an action movie fan's simply nice (not extravagant) movie.*This is my first review, I'm pleased to be a part of the IMDb community*","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Godzilla, King of the Monsters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3017202/?ref_=tt_urv","DinoMovieFan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52762397/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2014","I just went into theaters to see ""Godzilla"" with high anticipation that it will bring justice to the titular monster. Sure enough, it did more than just that because at the end of the movie I was proud that the movie had exemplified him as the ultimate force of nature as he originally was.First of all, the visual effects blew me away. Jim Rygiel did a well-done job in creating a credible and believable world where Godzilla and the M.U.T.O. really existed. The texture and the visuals of the monsters are really the highlight of the film when you can see how detailed Godzilla's scales and fins are. The environments were suitably covered in fog, dangling vegetation, and dust with the low lighting in some scenes to enhance the dark, gritty tone of the movie. Having a veteran visual effects supervisor like Jim Rygiel, who previously worked in the critically acclaimed Lord of The Ring Trilogy, really helped to pull of the realism and grittiness of the Kaiju interacting with the human world magnificently.Second, the choice of the cast was really well-thought out and their performance on screen was solid. Big credit goes to Bryan Cranston, who plays as Joe Brody, a disillusioned physicist who bore emotional scars of the incident that destroyed his wife and tore his family apart. The way Bryan delved into the emotional performance of his character did more than enough to convince me that what he went through is a HUGE, serious deal. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was a good choice to play Ford Brody. Even though he might seem emotionally bland at times, but those are minor flaws that are far and few in between. He still managed to genuinely show emotions that borderline on fear, anxiety, frustration, care and concern when he had to help his suffering father in Japan or when he had his wife and son's safety to worry about in the midst of the chaos in San Francisco.The movie's other strong points would be in the pacing of the film. More akin to Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" where it shows only glances of Godzilla until halfway through the movie. Then when it comes to the battles, they are not instantly one thing after another that makes the audience tire quickly, but they are cut at certain points for a long time to allow the viewers to catch their breath in between until it reaches to the climax where all that anticipation is released in a satisfying and jaw-dropping moment. Some of the people who like to be gratified with instantaneous shots of action and mayhem may not agree with this, but I thought that it was a smart move on the director's part to do so Overall, I rank this movie at 9/10 for its brilliant visuals of the monsters,strong story and plot, the solid acting performance of the human cast that signify above average character development, and the excellent choice of the film pacing that echoes Steven Spielberg's style.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The main character, Ford, zigzags from the center of the action in once scene to the center of the action the next scene. He manages to meet all the monsters eye-to-eye a half dozen times, and lives!! The movie is mostly about him, with Godzilla there just as a backdrop.It's better than that Matt Broderick movie they made in 1998, but not by a lot.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

This was everything I had been hoping for in the 2 years I had been waiting for this movie. They did this right.Now like any movie, it has its flaws. The human side of the story did not live up to its potential. Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston's characters were wasted and did not get the screen time they deserved. These are two great actors with lots of potential who could have done so much more in this movie. Another problem is that it had been said that this movie was going to take a very realistic approach. They wanted to show what would really happen if giant monsters were attacking Americas cities. However, I did not get this feeling from the movie. The reactions from onlookers seemed incredibly underplayed and not very dramatic. Now this is okay, but I came into the movie expecting what they had promised, and I didn't get that.HOWEVER. If you are a Godzilla fan of any kind, or even just a casual moviegoer who enjoys some good action. This is so for you, and it is worth every penny to see it on the biggest screen possible. It is a slow and steady build up, that will have you on the edge of your seat just waiting for the inevitable.. and oh boy is it amazing. The third act alone makes this movie a 10/10 for me. My theatre burst into applause at the end, and you could hear the ""holy crap"" and ""oh my god"" at certain parts coming from everyone there. Also, the cinematography in this movie is breathtaking. It was simply a beautiful movie to watch.So, as a movie itself, I would give this an 8/10. But as a Godzilla movie, and coming from a Godzilla fan, this is a 10/10, and fills my spot for second favourite Godzilla movie, first being the original 1954 classic.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

They can make huge disaster movies, with multi-million dollar budgets and an all star cast yet when it comes to this Japanese legend, nothing seems to work. The previous attempt in 1998, was heavily criticised yet was a decent movie with a good cast. Now we have this modern day hugely hyped up monster movie which only offers more of the same. The film seems to follow an over complicated story line which fails to convince and as you wait for 'Him' to finally appear, it's lost in overly long action sequences and poor dialogue. The only plus is 'Elisabeth Olsen' who like most female leads in disaster movies, is under used. I never go into a movie believing the hype or buying into a pre-conceived idea of what it is going to be. I just watch it as a movie comparing it to my expectations based on the genre. Sadly what we have here is no more than an over glamorised B-rate movie with a big budget and a legend it fails to live upto!!!!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I would say this is a great, albeit imperfect film. The trailers are just deceptive enough to get you in the theater without knowing exactly what to expect. I say take this ride without any expectations plot-wise and you'll do just fine. This film was fresh and original, but also pays respect to Gojira(1954) and Godzilla 1985, two of my personal favorites, as well as the many films ranging from the 60s (kooky) to the 00s (badass). I feel like this was written for fans, but anyone who enjoys monsters will have a good time. My only criticisms are that G doesn't get enough screen time, some scenes of monster action are too abrupt, and the human story lines are not very compelling. This last criticism about the human element is just an inherent problem with G films--but I feel that they could have done better. I waited a darn long time for a good American Godzilla, and I believe my thirst has been slaked. For now. Yes, go see this and support future entries in the American Godzilla franchise, and if we get lucky we'll see a sequel or two. Even better, maybe a future Japanese Godzilla will be shown in our theaters for the first time since Godzilla 2000--now that would be awesome, too!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Loved Final Wars and it was a good film to get my feet wet so to speak in terms of being introduced into the Godzilla universe. I know I need to watch the 1954 original which I plan to do here real soon. I was told to avoid the 1998 version which I saw a video clip of the ending of Godzilla 98. Pretty much that Godzilla looked like a roided up T-Rex from Jurassic Park. Not impressed. So I go into this movie after viewing trailers for it and I was getting excited. had a feeling that this was going to be a kick ass monster movie and it is. I watched this in iMax 3D and holy crap on a cracker..... utterly impressed! Love this movie and I am puzzled as to why its getting a 7.3 on here??? I guess you can't please everyone but man, this is just awesome!! Its great fun, has a great story line and the performances are really good.

Listen when I tell you that all 160,000,000 million dollars of their budget must've been spent on this bad boy because he was unreal. Now I personally saw the movie in IMAX so i'm sure the experience that others may have had who didn't see it in IMAX wasn't as good but i cannot imagine it was anything but Spectacular. Now that iv'e gotten that out of my system time to tear the movie apart. Bryan Cranston appeared to be the face of the film in the trailers and when you actually watch the movie the brief amount of time he is in the film isn't all that spectacular. In a wrap he is a necessary catalyst that could've been played by a less notable actor and achieved the same feelings. But please understand that in no way was he bad in the film, it was just that his role was underwhelming given how much you see him in the trailer. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a great job in their roles and I give them a warm applause. Ken Watanabe was either the worst actor to come across the face of the earth or was told to do some of the stupidest things i've ever seen. Throughout the entire film he just stands around watching monsters with a stupid-ass look on his face (Pardon my French). By the end of the film I think that he was a professional at having his mouth hang open because that is essentially the ONLY thing he does for the entire film. All in All I REALLY liked the FILM but I did not approve of the Actors for the most part. I feel as though some more reliable people could've been put into some roles. In Cranston's case they needed to have more screen time for him or just get someone else and with Ken well Ken's just a lost Cause. I would say this film is great for anyone looking for some CGI and great action scenes filled with non-stop action, excitement and peril. But if your going for the build-up of a story and great acting, don't bother it isn't worth your time. Sorry if I come across as a little Cynical but you can see from my rating that I did truly enjoy the movie but i'm a critic and i have to give it to you the way it is.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I grew up on those classic films, and devoured them like Godzilla devours radiation. I'm very forgiving on all things related to Godzilla, and I even refrained from bashing the inept US remake from 1998. It's best forgotten...Godzilla 2014 on the other hand will not be so easy to forget. That's because it is AMAZING. No movie can stack up against a fans dreams and desires, but Gareth's Edwards and his team come very close. Sure: Bryan Cranston over acts his wig off, the female characters seem a bit weak, the new monsters are just that: new, and the King remains in the dusty shadows until the end and OK, the monster battle scenes could have had more ""contact"" and grit to them but..,Who cares about all that! THIS IS GODZILLA!Don't listen to the negative opinions. Especially from those claiming to be ""hard core fans"". A true fan would be worried about only one thing: money. The movie must make money, lots of money. Why? SO THEY OPT TO MAKE MORE!!The good news? It did just that: Godzilla ruled the box office on Friday May 16th with a stunning $38.5m take. The KING of the MONSTERS is back, and with him, let's hope that MONSTER movies are back as well.

I still remember the first time i saw Roland Emmerich's ""Godzilla"" in 1998, to be honest at that time i quite liked the movie. But, the movie was a major flop, not getting a thumbs up from critics as well as from the audiences. It took total, 16 years to make ""Godzilla"" happen again with worldwide release. The other Godzilla movie only released in some of the Asian countries. The hype with this flick was enormous. As the first trailer rolled, people went buzzards to see the movie as soon as possible. So, does this live up to the hype? The Answer is YES, obviously.The movie starts in Japan, in which a young scientist, Joe Brody played by the ""Breaking Bad"" fame ""Bryan Cranston"", studying the seismic activity around the nuclear plant he & his wife is working in. He believes that the seismic activity that has been going on is not due to earthquakes but due to electro magnetic pulse & believes something is hiding in this place as it is the only plant & place who is experiencing it. In all this, Joe loses his wife due to a lethal gas leak in the plant & due to this seismic activity, whole plant is turned into dust & is named a ""Quarantine Zone"" after the incident. After, 15 years, his son ""Ford Brody"" played by ""Aaron-Taylor Johnson"" is in US Army's Bomb Disposal Team & is now living happily with his wife, Elle, played by ""Elizabeth Olsen"" & his son Sam. But, Joe is still finding his way to know the truth that what caused that activity, to which he goes to his old house in Quarantine zone with his son, but sees that their is no radiation in that zone & Government, is just covering it up. He gets, what he has come for, the documents & disks which tells that something responded to the waves that were sent by Joe, to know exactly what is going on inside the earth's core. Police finds both father & son & takes them to the plant, which was said to be closed but in real is not. The scientist, ""Dr Ichiro Serizawa"" played by ""Ken Watanabe"" (Inception fame) & his team has found something which is showing a very high radiation. To, which Joe, says that he already knew that it was the earthquake, it was something else hiding underground. When they see that nothing is happening they decide to kill the structure but it turns out that the structure needs radiation to get more power. So, in turn to kill it, they free out a creature named ""MUTO"", who is man-made genetically engineered monster. In order, to kill this ""MUTO"", Dr. Seriwaza believes that only & only, ""Gojira"" can kill this monster. Will Gojira be able to stop this monster?, Is MUTO alone?. Well, i will give you no spoilers as many people are yet to see the movie.""Gareth Edwards"" is the director of the movie, who has the made the small budget, sci-fi hit ""Monsters"". But, he needed something big to this movie & he has done that. Edward;s latest venture ""Godzilla"" is not just a 3D bonanza, but he also maintains a fine grip on the narrative as the action-adventure moves on. The movie's script has an interesting spin, which i cannot discuss in detail, or that would be spoiler for all. I would just say that ""Godzilla is a Good Guy Here"".The human drama content in this movie works. I hear people saying, human part was a bit-too much, now you can't just see ""Godzilla"" for whole 2 hours on the screen. It had to be there. This creature feature film, that is primarily meant for violence & special effects, the movie has got some good & interesting names in the movie, Aaron Taylor Johnson plays the role of an army man & also Joe's son, he quite good in his role, providing some insights of the life of Joe & Ford, as dad & son. But, sometimes looks stiff on the screen. Ken Watanabe, has a good role & is amazing in it. Elizabeth Olsen, shown as fun loving girl, who loves his husband & son, is a fun to watch, even with a role that is very short. Bryan Cranston, is spectacular in this short role & the emotions he shows during his scenes are fantastic. Now, the main hero of the movie, oh you know, ""Godzilla"", some of the people in Japan said that this Godzilla is too fat. Well, they are right, he is a little fat. But, he is as fit as a fighter, when he fights in the movie. The time he comes on the screen, the visuals are breath-taking & the entry he gets, you would just want to ""clap"" for the beast to come in.Warner Brothers, played a deadly game to come up with this project, after the debacle of Sony's ""Godzilla"" in 1998 & they have done a smart job. I can see, a whole new franchise for ""The King Of Monsters"".GO WATCH THIS BEAST! RECOMMENDED!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

But in 2004, Godzilla the king of monsters hung up his crown after a disappointing Final War. But soon, giant monsters started returning to screen; 2005's KING KONG, 2006 korean movie THE HOST, 2008's CLOVERFIELD, all vying for the title of king. Now 2013 comes up with PACIFIC RIM But No king is going to let a kaiju army steal his thunder! So up from the depths steps GODZILLA to show these usurpers how a monster movie is really done.In shaping Godzillas future, the creative team look back on the big G's past, digging deep into the earlier, darker themed Showa era Godzilla movies and combining the best elements of 60 years worth of sequels. Like the first 1954 original, the monsters' appearance is teased and glimpsed through the human focused tale. This is slow build up and reveal calls back to classic monster movies like JAWS, ALIEN, and the original GODZILLA. Yet director Gareth Edwards successfully builds the tension right up to the big payoff clash of titanic proportions. With No oxygen destroyer, masers, mutant soldiers or other wonky scifi stuff from the Japanese movies, this new Godzilla movie is grounded firmly in contemporary reality. A dangerous move which the 1998 giant lizard remake tried to pull off, though one that ultimately paid off here.Godzilla's design raised mixed reactions from viewers, but when seen in full motion, this bigger, meaner but definitely not leaner Godzilla is amazing! The design just screams ""power"" and makes sense for a creature of that size; thick skeletal structure, low centre of gravity, tough meaty exterior and smooth streamlined shape makes it believable that this creature can survive the ocean pressure near the earth's core, swim from Hawaii to San Francisco in a matter of hours yet support it's weight out of water. In motion, this is not the awkward lumbering Japanese rubber beast, but a menacing massive yet graceful Titan with an intelligent spark in his eyes. This wearied, bulkier looking Godzilla feels like an old champion wrestler forced back into the ring to reclaim his title.Perhaps this was what the creators were going for. The feel of an apex predator who, aside from some pesky atomic bombs giving him a mild sun burn once in a while, has not had a decent giant monster challenge in eons. Godzilla is aching for fight and when a couple of mating obsessed MUTOs wander through his turf........let's just say nobody lays eggs in the King's back yard. Director Gareth Edwards eschews frantic close ups for wide angle, full view cinematography, allowing every monster appearance on screen to be seen in its full glory. Special effects by ""moving pictures company"" and ""amalgamated dynamics"" bring the king of monsters to life, rivaling that of the more renown ILM or Weta.As mentioned, this new movie just oozes with the best elements of 60 years of GODZILLA movies without any of the goofiness. The two enemy monster MUTOs resemble Orga and Megaguirus, two kaiju created in the millennium era Godzilla movies, in their fighting style and design. This bigger, bulkier Godzilla takes design cues from the Heisei era and Godzilla: Giant monsters All Out Attack, while his almost human-like intelligence recalls the ""heroic"" Showa Godzilla movies. Even Godzilas nuclear breath is a burning blue stream of irradiated particles like the Showa ear, rather than the dragonball Z styled giant laser beam of more recent Godzilla shows.But enough about Godzilla. How do the mandatory human characters fare? Well Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody is magnificent. He brings gravitas to his character and a heart wrenching emotional touch. Sadly, he is under utilized as the script focuses on Ford Brody. Aaron Taylor Johnson's performance is a little disappointing considering his character is a soldier. He mumbles his way through the movie in a wimpy little voice, sharing only a passing chemistry with his wife, played by Elizabeth Olsen.Fans of all action monster mash ups like GODZILLA FINAL WAR or DESTROY ALL MONSTERS would no doubt find the slow burn build up boring. But fans of the 1954 classic and the more serious Showa era movies would have much to cheer about. With a nostalgic score by Alexander Desplat clearly inspired by the late great Akira Ifukube, GODZILLA serves as a harrowing metaphor of nature's supremacy over mankind. Where the 1954 classic was an analogy for the atomic bomb, 2014's movie brings to mind the tsunamis and nuclear plant meltdowns that shocked the world.

When it first stomped and screeched into the screen in 1954, it was a creature of rampant destruction, born out of nuclear radiation. Over the years Godzilla transformed itself into a savior, ridding the world of other fearsome creatures. Godzilla 2014 was a marvelous experience. This version pays homage to the Japanese versions by aping the look and feel of the monster, in addition to promoting its character of being a hero.The year is 1999, and Japanese scientist Serizawa travels to Philippines to investigate the discovery of fossils believed to be of ancient dinosaurs. It is not only fossils though, as something that hatched escaped and causes a nuclear power plant meltdown . Thousands die, including Sandra Brody, wife of plant engineer Joe Brody while the Japanese government covers up the incident as an earthquake. 15 years pass by, and Joe continues his endeavors to find the truth behind the accident. His son Ford, who is an explosives expert aids him in his latest foray, and they find out that giant creatures, called MUTO that feast on radiation were the cause of the meltdown, and are being contained by the government.""The arrogance of men is in thinking nature is in their control while it is the other way round""Nature is not to be contained then, and when things get out of control, Godzilla rises from the depths of the seas to restore balance in the world, in a spectacular, epic battle. Godzilla in this movie is a god, a primordial alpha predator who lives close to the earth's radioactive core. He does not really love humans but the stability of the world is important for his own survival, and so he fights the good fight, even after being attacked by the military. As far as the outcome goes, we all know what will happen since Godzilla never loses.Godzilla is a very different kind of kaiju film. Unlike last year's stylish, in your face Pacific Rim, the monster does not take center stage. It does not get to show off, and for some people there may be too little of Godzilla in his own film. Rather, most of the violence, chaos and liquidation takes place off-screen, or gets featured in massive tracking shots, the beauty and detail of which certainly require second viewings.Director Gareth Edwards does a fantastic job in doing the unpredictable, and creating a suspense film out of a monster brawl fest, much like Cloverfield or World War Z. Like Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Godzillá faces the camera a long time into the movie, but when it does, it is a goose pimp-ling moment. He has put on weight, but that calls for all the more respect, as his wallop packs even more power. The visual effects are breath-taking, and this is a movie that is a must watch in 3D. Godzilla finally delivering the coup de grace to the female MUTO is iconic.Though the star cast consists of heavyweights such as Bryan Cranston, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche, Ashley Olsen and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, humans essentially become bystanders in a monster movie. While they all perform competently, there just isn't too much for them to do, but be awestruck most of the time.Godzilla is an excellent effort, and probably this summer's biggest non superhero movie. Go, watch it. Pander the child in you. I was shouting in the theater.There is nothing profound about it, just honest to goodness fun, and an exhilarating cinematic experience. 9/10","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The movie practically changed the way I perceived reality as a kid. This recent Godzilla movie was a total let down on every front imaginable. First of all the story was nothing like the original, it looks like they didn't watch the original movie. Its the same with terminator one and terminator two (horrible sequel). The Godzilla was far from believable. The special effects let me down so hard. Also I didn't understand why the meth cook from breaking bad was in this movie, this made it very confusing for me because I was watching Breaking Bad the night before. So I thought at one point, what is Godzilla doing in breaking bad. I thought it was one of those meth trips from the 1970's. But then suddenly the guy from Kick-Ass shows up, and I was sure it wasn't breaking bad anymore.This movie, which was a total Borefest, had little to no story to it. The action was boring and monotonous. Why is the drug addict Olsen part of this movie? Are they trying to tell us something? Well they paid her enough money to buy more drugs.Also, let me tell you something about the ""director"". Roland Emmerich did such a poor job, you can barely even call him a director. More like a guy who is cutting images together in some sort of pretentious collage. Even my mother is a better director and she hasn't seen a movie in her life.The reason I give this movie 2 instead of 1 is because I had a good night with my mistress after. I'm usually not a very hard critic, but this movie really got on my nerves. Still a 2 is better than 1.Hope you like my review,","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The reason for this I think is that besides the opening centered on Bryan Cranston's character and situation you really don't care about anyone else in this movie and it takes toooo long to kick off.Even Godzilla who shows up fully far too late in the game after a series of frustrating near and minor reveals (one of which literally has Edwards shut the door on what had built up to be the kicking off of the main event, teased with a split second of monster on monster action before shutting us out)just seems like a giant punchbag/wrecking ball for the other monsters and there just isn't enough of him or enough characterisation to make us give a sh*t. He turns up out of nowhere for no good reason and then just disappears like nothings happened at the end.In my opinion the painfully slow burn hurts this. I mean it's not like we don't know what Godzilla looks like from either the myriad other movies before it or even from the trailer for this one. Lets face it if you go to see a Godzilla movie you want lots of monsters a$$kicking each other to kingdom come and breaking sh*t all over (admittedly there IS plenty of destruction) you don't want to have to wait three quarters of the movie to see it. On the acting front after the strong drama at the beginning the young lead just can't compete with Cranston and you feel that black hole throughout the rest of the movie. You initially feel like you might actually be getting A list performances but that ends quickly and you're left with exposition and flunked by the book emotional beats.On the plus side Godzilla himself looks phenomenal and the FX are awesome as are the fight scenes but overall I think this movie is a disappointment.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Let's just say it wasn't worthy of my money, which is sad, because I was hopeful for this movie...Bryan Cranston stars as Joe Brody, a scientist who discovers the existence of Godzilla, as usual they don't believe in him, 15 years pass and is now up to his son Ford Brody as played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson to protect his family in a monster breakout.The screenplay by Max Borenstein is, without a doubt, the problem with this movie, the movie is too long for it's own sake, and there is too little of Godzilla, he appears in the climax, and by then you're already bored of the movie, trying to build some emotion in Ford's character, but it fails completely on the degree that I was falling asleep...To give the movie credit, the ending battle scene is indeed really awesome, but was it wasn't worth watching it all the way to it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yes, holding Godzilla back until roughly an hour in was sort of a letdown as well as killing off Brian Cranston(the only actor who seemed to give a **** the entire film) but this film mostly suffered from what I felt like was under-developed characters and over-all a somewhat too ""human centered"" movie. Yes, showing the human side of Godzilla's path of destruction is a much needed quality to these movies but not to the extent of giving your title character around 24 minutes of TOTAL screen time(+small appearances in the beginning). Besides, most of the movie showed the humans being stupid and trying to nuke Godzilla(who feeds off nuclear fallout) and the MUTOs, the entire human aspect of the film could have been done a lot better then the simple ""lets nuke em"" approach. I didn't have as much problems with the MUTOS either but I more so had a problem with how they were pushed up to be some unstoppable force but were easily destroyed in a rather awesome fashion by Godzilla. The fight scene towards the end really made the movie for me as a whole and the final appearance by Godzilla was glorious as well. All in all, I feel like this movie was very well done and provides a lot of hope for a string of successful American Godzilla movies.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I will approach this objectively now. This will be a long review since it's a movie I've anticipated so heavily:Was it worth all of the anticipation and hype? In short, YES. Is it a perfect movie? NO. I'm not going to sit here and sing its praises as if it there's nothing wrong. So let's get what's wrong out of the way first:The script (while sometimes smart) REALLY bogs the movie down during its middle act. Some cheesy lines (that were fun but clashed with the overall serious tones) here and there, and don't get me started on the military incompetence clichés that run rampant through the middle act. Yes, I will say it now that it would have been nicer to have more Godzilla. I'll get to that later though. The music was a little dodgy and I would have preferred something moodier. The soundtrack aimed to echo the works of Godzilla composer Akira Ifukube, but unfortunately it fails and doesn't elevate the film (except for some moments). Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance was serviceable at best in my opinion. Some of the incredible talent in the cast is wasted but I can't say much without spoiling. Basically it makes the film feel like it is separated into acts. Overall the biggest drawback here isn't the human characters so much as the script. There's a lot to nitpick about.As for what's good about it Well, there's much to say here. Bryan Cranston is awesome in the movie. Ken Watanabe was pretty good and probably my favorite character. The cinematography... I'm in love. When I heard they were going to get the same guy who was the DP on The Avengers, I thought this movie would fall into generic visual territory but my goodness was this movie a visual treat. Even the more intimate character moments were enhanced by the camera-work. It's a beautiful marriage of steady wide-shots, POVs, and smart use of hand-held camera-work. The CGI is top-shelf. The monsters move around with a good presence. There isn't as much Godzilla in this movie as you'd probably expect, and that is the most interesting aspect about this film. There's plenty of screen time for the monsters in general and there is a lot of action, but not so much Godzilla in his full glory. There is a strong human focus. You're introduced to his opponent first, and you see Godzilla when he shows up to set things straight. If this structure doesn't sound familiar to you, then you mustn't have seen many Godzilla movies at all. After seeing the film again, without any bias, I can say that it's much harder for me to relate to the complaints about the title monster not being in the film enough. To me, this slow burn was just a little exaggerated and actually works given how stunning the final climax of the film is. Seriously, probably the greatest monster throw-down I've ever seen. It's a payoff that wouldn't excite audiences as much as it did in both screenings I've attended if it was milked throughout the film (seriously, people were cheering and clapping when Godzilla showed up). When you see Godzilla in this film, he's glorious, and it's because of that slow buildup. Unfortunately now I have a strange assumption that modern audiences get bored too easily. This is what made movies like Jurassic Park and Alien so great.The bottom line is that they got Godzilla right this time. The movie is a throwback to all the great monster movies of the 70's and 80's, but with some gritty Nolan attitude added in there. Most importantly, this movie was made for the fans, as it feels like a genuine Toho film. Perhaps it caters a bit more to the fans than it should (the script really is poor on multiple levels, bringing to mind B-Movie level cheese and stupid plot points on occasion), but ultimately Godzilla delivers the most exciting spectacle I've seen all year (Halo jump sequence, I'm pointing at you) and I can't be happier with how the film turned out. I'd highly recommend you see it on the biggest screen possible. There's a lot to commend about what Gareth Edwards has pulled off here, despite some shortcomings. 8.5/10","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

These people do not remember watching Godzilla from 1954, clear up through the recent Toho productions. Godzilla got as much screen time as a Godzilla fan would expect. Most of the older films had extremely cheesy stories (Godzilla vs. Megalon anyone?), but this one I felt had a little more substance. I was more afraid that we would end up seeing a film where Godzilla would be the all-out villain, with the humans trying to mercilessly kill him. Instead, they tastefully gave me the ""hero"" that I adored as a kid. When I was growing up, I loved Godzilla. I liked when he was scary, but I also liked when he was the hero. I loved how Godzilla was unstoppable, godlike, and powerful. When he took more of an anti-hero role in the Heisei era, I (and my childhood friends) cheered him on all the more. This movie portrayed Godzilla much in the same way. However, they left us wondering. I felt Godzilla and the main character were sharing somewhat of an affinity toward the end, whether real or imagined, the director knew what he was doing and I think it worked. It doesn't mean that Godzilla is our friend per se, but I like how he wasn't necessarily portrayed as an all-out villain. In my opinion (and I have watched and own every single Godzilla movie ever made, except 1998), this was a fantastic movie. I hope to see Edwards do one more. It was great to see the Big G on the big screen and the monster battles were epic.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

""Gojira"" in Japanese, which gets corrupted to Godzilla in English by the untrained ear) makes a reappearance as a truly cosmopolitan monster, and not just the bane of Tokyo. I've sure the Japanese are relieved not having their capital city destroyed yet again.The effects are very good, and this is of course what holds the movie up - with any disaster or monster movie, disbelief must be suspected to enjoy the movie. That being said there are some scenes that are not just dubious and silly, but outright stupid (had me rolling my eyes a couple of times), in various ways, not just what is possible, but what is meaningful or makes military sense. Seriously, do the soldiers really think that a measly assault rifle will do anything whatsoever against a monster the size of a skyscraper?The acting is overall fair, but superficial, and handicapped by that the scriptwriters didn't do any character development or meaningful interaction with each other. No significant show of emotion is on the big screen, which makes the human part completely forgettable (apart from the opening of the movie, but that stands alone).Worst of all is Ken Watanabe's part - which is more that of a prop than an actor. He spends a lot of his time just standing around, looking dumbfounded, and not saying a word. Why did the scriptwriters waste his talent such? Why did he agree to taking this role in the first place? Didn't he read the script? The movie wouldn't have lost much if the humans were cut out. Annoyingly, the most we see of the human race here is the brave American military (smirk).Overall, this is quite watchable for your typical movie night, but also quite forgettable. Only re-watchable for fans of 'ol 'zilla.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In anticipation, or more accurately hope of the next film being good I revisited this movie this morning. And it was even worse than my first time.After the utter travesty that Godzilla 1999 was, how is it that a major reboot is handed two writers that have neither a solid history or film under their belt - one much more than the other? And how, or why is it that the director's chair is handed to someone that made a 'monster' film with no monsters in it? Seems on paper it's just as horrid a choice as it was in the end. Want to see a Godzilla film ultimately about a human protagonist being everywhere at the right time with plot armor that would make any major Game of Thrones (HBO) character jealous? Want it topped off with blatantly generic, unpolished writing, complete with bland generic characters? This might be for you then... But it sure irritated me throughout. I grew up watching Godzilla and friends every Saturday, and this my friends, is not what we should have been given. With the exception of Cranston and Watanabe the characters and acting is on par with the 1999 'Godzilla' film. The dialog is equally awful. On Godzilla approaching Hawaii to intercept the generic MUTO a Navy crewman on a carrier reports ""Object incoming from the Pacific."" Most people should realize that the Hawaiian Islands are surrounded by the Pacific... This film is chock full of this sort of thing. Due to the inability to write these writers had to construct ridiculous acts to fill the plot; such as putting nukes on a train for San Francisco when they could have been slung under helos. I really could go on and on, and then some, but you get the point. And the cherry on top? How about constant cuts away from the reason why we watched this film to begin with - Godzilla. These cuts are so frequent that it almost tricks, or rather convinces you, that they were watching their CGI budget. Or how about watching his real appearance through a TV in some kids living room from across the room.I'm literally dying to know how some of these people get paid to write for screen.Which brings me to my fears regarding Godzilla: King of Monsters... One of these two writing duds remained on board for it. Thankfully there some fresh minds in there with Dougherty, but looking at his writing history also has me in fear due to his involvement with superhero films and making three versions of the same horror movie.Godzilla 2014 - 2/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So I was definitely looking forward to this movie. The repeating of trailers to the release left me on edge. After the movie, I did very much enjoyed it like most big Godzilla fans around the world with a few exceptions. I thought also that big G had less time on the movie then the MUTO creatures who I thought posed no real threat to Japan or NY. There only objected was to procreate with no real origin, and powers?!?!?! EMP?! They could have done better then that or choose of monster(s) to face the obvious strong Godzilla. They stood no chance at all. As for Godzilla himself, look great to me except for what it look like he put on some extra weight..lol. it was funny. I believe a sequel should definitely be under production with 2 different monsters for Godzilla to face and more viewings of who I thought was the star and main character to the movie.....GODZILLA. Hopefully it will get better.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

One of my best childhood memories was watching monster movies with my Dad on his old black and white TV in the back office (Mom did not want to hear it) of our house. It was our special thing-holed up in his dark, masculine office, munching homemade popcorn while being mildly terrified by various creatures and fiends, but Godzilla was my hands down favorite- he wasn't a warm fuzzy dude, but he fought with passion and he was misunderstood. What is great about Godzilla 2014 is that despite the high tech CG arsenal at his disposal, director, Gareth Edwards, with amazing restraint, created a pleasing retro vibe in tune with the original film and capitalized on the pathos and mystery that is the essence of Godzilla. Bryan Cranston is brilliant, as is Ken Watanabe. They are the human soul of this movie. Sentimentalism aside, I took my 14-year-old son to see Godzilla and he loved it too! He is in that Hollywood age demographic that Summer movies are designed for and like most kids his age, he is a tough sell-jaded by the CG, steroid pumped movies that have proliferated in recent years. Godzilla is a win-win- grownups, teens and kids will enjoy it.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

This film is, though, basically a fiction dealing with an imaginary creature, isn't it? Forgetting this fact, the director seems too eager to make the story look real to keep the balance between fantasy and reality.In other words, he took too much care over the destruction of the power plant, or what Muto is like, or how the armed forces should carry missiles to destroy those gigantic creatures.I was too bored with his scrupulous attitude, waiting for the appearance of Godzilla! And he appeared ! After that, however, how few minutes we saw him ! When the film was over, I gasped with too much frustration!

The trailer for this monster reboot immediately wet my curiosity. The story was obviously going to be done with finesse there seemed to be an air of mystery, and was being told as if it were a serious drama. I've realized that when fictional tales are told with a dramatic flair making the tone more realistic the more serious I take them. Case and point, there was a campiness to the last Godzilla that added to my distaste for it, not to mention his lizard-like appearance, then came this latest offering and I am filled with the same excitement for Godzilla as I remember having as a child. There were some questionable actions and scenes by some of the characters such as Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) having encounter after encounter with skyscraper sized monsters and narrowly escaping with his life just too many times to be believable. The monsters however were absolutely believable, and I have made no secret of the fact that I have a great appreciation for first rate the special effects and in this case they were very worthwhile to watch. I also appreciated the scientific explanation for Godzilla's existence and feeding habits as detailed by Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins). I have to say that I am now looking forward to expansion of the series, with an updated Mothra, Rodan, MechaGodzilla any other combatant for Godzilla and anywhere else the film makers want to take us in the monsterverse. On another note, yes I look for 'Us' in every film, so it was nice to have Captain Russell Hampton (Richard T. Jones) on the job in command and defending the world from the carnage.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I thought the relationships were well done and the music was great also. I'm hoping we get to see some sequels down the road with this type of feel to it. I really think they can reinvent this genre for as good of a job as they did with this one. If is maybe one minor minor complaint, it may be that the second main actor outside of Crantson doesn't quite own the screen the way Bryan does, but Cranston is just such a great talent that this isn't really a big gripe!","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The biggest problem with this movie is that most of the monster stuff takes place at night and you can't really see what's going on. It's annoying. The cast and the acting are okay at best. Bryan Cranston's performance is as bad as his wig. I don't mind stars making a cash grab. They should strike while the iron is hot. But they should at least try to do a good job. Cranston, however, seems to be mailing this one in. He's a real detriment to the movie. Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a mostly forgettable movie.

Much of this new version's strength lies in its look at nuclear proliferation. The opening credits show the various and sundry tests that the US carried out in the Pacific - many of which resulted in birth defects among the Pacific Islanders - accompanied by credits made to look like censored documents. And then the incident with the nuclear power plant in Japan is a pretty clear reference to the Fukushima explosion and subsequent cover-up (such as a controversial State Secrets Act). Another thing that makes this version interesting is that the title character isn't just some giant lizard going around wreaking havoc, but in fact has to contend with another set of monsters.I will say that the movie goes a little overboard on all the stomping and smashing, but the look at excessive reliance on technology makes up for that. If an electromagnetic pulse occurred and knocked out all the electricity in a certain radius, people would probably go nuts, with or without a monster to create more terror. I enjoyed the movie, and I hope that it spawns more debate about the safety of nuclear weapons.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Some 1* reviews said it's the worst movie, unwatchable, these people are either trolls or were drunk/high during the screening.It's a tad different to the last one because this time there's not just Godzilla humanity must worry about, without giving too much away the other creature called Muto is equally as large and terrifying (they remind me of earth's weapons from Final Fantasy 7). The film isn't tongue and cheek like the Matthew Broderick one, it's realistic and darker with some quite tense and emotional moments.The pace isn't in a rush or snail slow, it builds and has good story, at times catches you off guard. Until the brutal showdown.Definitely worth paying £5 at my local cinema. (I watched in 2D as 3D to me is like watching a darker less colorful screen that doesn't look that 3D) but if you like 3D I'm guessing the film would be good in it.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Why was it so dark? Impossible to make out anything in many of the scenes. There are some great visuals when they can be seen - the planes falling from the sky; the Golden Gate Bridge sequence; the halo drop - but so much is missed for most of the rest of it. I would have loved to see what was happening in Hawaii but sadly was unable to make much of it outWhat was possible to make of the actors was that they were underserved in what they were asked to do - they should be bringing the heart and be our bridge to experiencing the life of the film. They sadly did not, partly due to having little asked of them to do and, in some cases, being all too sadly forgettable when they did. It might have been an idea to switch the actors round and have Elizabeth Olsen play the bomb disposal expert - she's a far better actress than the lump of man meat we had playing the main role. You could also arguably switch Juliette with Bryan and Sally with Ken...The monsters...? Meh-nsters more like. Barely enough Gojira to warrant the film being named after them - I understand the need to maintain suspense but I've paíd to see the dummy thiccness of that ass; not much was forthcoming. The Muto's were a generic, designed-by-committee pair of pointless awkwardness. There must be some book of such monsters floating round the design studios of Hollywood, for production designers to pluck from random: shame this is what was plucked on this occasion.Altogether a solid 5 out of 10. I'm sure I could have given more stars but I awarded based on what I could physically see.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I am a fan of Godzilla and will tend to give anything with Godzilla in it more leeway than it deserves, and even still, I have to say this was not a good movie. I don't know what the bug-things were, but I was hoping for a classic character to be the antagonist. Godzilla was not in the movie much, which is sad because he is the main draw. His scenes were all dark and from odd angles, making it harder to enjoy what little screen time he received. I expect this was a artistic decision, but I disagree with it. In a movie like Cloverfield it works, but in a movie named Godzilla where everyone wants to see Godzilla, it does not work as well. This movie gets 4 stars because Godzilla was in it, and I like to see Godzilla. One final point, which will likely render the rest of my review unreliable by... just about everyone. Bryan Cranston. There are people complaining that he did not get enough screen time, and they are correct, he is not the main focus. But my issue is... All I see is Malcolm's dad. I watched one season of Breaking Bad and stopped because it was so unrealistic for Malcolm's dad to be doing those things. Did no one else watch that show???

After the mediocre 1998 Godzilla theatrical film, I never thought Godzilla would be brought justice on the big screen. But in 2014, this film came out and I am proud to say it is much better than the last Godzilla movie. The story is deeper, and there is more creature action to be had. I liked the design of Godzilla, even if it looks like he was injected with hyper steroids. I also thought the sound and Alexandre Desplat's score were also highlights of the film. Gareth Edwards's film is about this discovery which awakens these two carnivorous predators named ""MUTOS,"" which in turns waken an ancient dinosaur named Godzilla. With millions of lives at stake, Godzilla must hunt down these MUTOS, as long as the United States Army does not get in his way. The film does boast an impressive cast. Aaron-Taylor Johnson does a good job in shedding his ""Kick-Ass"" mask to play a responsible Marin, Ford up near the front lines fighting these monsters. Bryan Cranston does a great job as Ford's father, but sadly his role is limited. Ken Watanabe is a mixed bag. He is a great actor, but it seems his skills were not as sharp in this film. Also, David Strathairn made for an interesting army colonel, even if his character was clichéd. Overall, this Godzilla remake is much better than Roland Emmerich's version. This is truly a terrifying monster story that has the added bonus of a human story with is rich and engrossing. It could have been a straightforward disaster film, but luckily the film uses its story to add emotional depth. I had doubts when this movie was released, but those doubts have since vanished. Also worth noting is Godzilla is the main star of the show for a variety of reasons. My Grade: A","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Excited after seeing first teaser. But I was little unhappy over model of Godzilla, which was more outdated. I mean the blueprint for creating monster was borrowed from '54 version. Which was originally a man with costume performed stunts then later played it on a big screen where actors performed their act in front of it. Now everything is different, we got the technology, then why should choose fat one rather update it with fine anatomical structure. Because usually water animals won't be a fat one. That is why '98 Godzilla looked so perfect with slim and long legs just like an enlarged version of Iguana. Other than not redesigned 3D model, the Godzilla was presented awesomely on the screen with the great visual effects and sounds mixing. I loved to witness it on a large silver screen, it was stunning.The movie began with a few opening credits and a decent story till forwarded all the way to later 15 years. The boring portions started. Wanted for something to happen somewhere, but had no luck. It only teased me with some sudden loud noises and briskly camera panning away from the characters just what the monster appeared from nowhere, but it didn't. I think the human story and monster's did not synch in with a clean perfect one movie. Humans and monsters were completely parted. At least collision between them would have been very interested, just like the car and helicopter chase in the '98 version.All the human characters were very weak including army general, the protagonist and his silly mission. I wanted a gutsy person like Stephen Lang, who was excellent in 'Avatar' as a lieutenant colonel. You gonna love the graphic side of the movie, but this story badly misses the rockstar characters like one from Ron Perlman for 'Pacific Rim' and Jean Reno for '98 'Godzilla'. Aaron Johnson was good, but not good enough to handle whole movie himself. The inclusion of another couple of well know actors would have helped better in my opinion. Maybe the surprise entries are kept for a sequel, I guess.Like any other Godzilla fan, I fought for my ticket that I booked a day earlier and saw on the first day itself. Actually, I enjoyed a lot this movie, but it will never be my favourite Monster movie. 'Favourite' and 'good entertainer' are two different categories. All the good entertainers are not my favourite. Though I cherished this film in a few scenes. Most importantly, this movie making opportunity was landed on the pair of a good hand. I liked 'Monsters', the director shown his caliber in that low budget high quality movie. So I had faith in him, but the thing was he's a documentary style movie maker. I was wondering how this commercial movie gonna shape up. Well, he proved that he can pull the trigger of the bazooka as well. It was visible that he was given freedom to make his way, at least in the majority of the movie.''Let them fight.''Must agree this is the best version according to the appearance of the monster. So the credits must go to all the members of special effects and visual effects team. No doubt stunts were breathtaking. It was a 2 hour movie, in that first half was dragged with human drama that I did not like much. It was drifting away from the main picture. So I was lucky in the exact beginning of the second half where the 'king of the monsters' appears in front of us completely with a huge roar. There's another flying monster in the movie called Muto. This second hour is all about them fighting each other. In a couple of the scenes I was totally disappointed where the fights between them were smartly concealed other than showing us through cable news channels and in few other tricky ways. Well, they saved it for the final battle. I guess it was a little late, but in some way it convinces us to satisfy after a long wait.During the final battle something did not look good. I thought Godzilla was an animal, suddenly he becomes very intelligent and uses his fire-breath in a particular position to defeat his enemy. That's not at all, walking back to the sea was kind of looked like a Disney's fairy tale concept. Because monsters should behave like one not like one of a Marvel's superhero who concerns for human safety. That is the portion made me think like is it a children's movie? Because I just saw it till the end without aware. That small mistake was one of a drawback in the movie. They desperately wanted it for a sequel and so they did it without harming humans around.There's a generation gap, fighting over different version won't change anything. My favourite version will remain the same and so yours and others. The purpose of all versions is to entertain the audience and so it does. As far now my review was mixed respond with a bit slides toward the negative side. In one line to say what's the wrong with this movie is that human portion of the story was a big letdown, though the vfx tried its best to lift is as much it can.Overall, I believe repeat viewing this movie won't help us to love it. The first impression is the best, if you got it, then fine, if not, so you must be either '98 or '54 version fan. If you are a Godzilla fan then it is a must see movie whether you like it or not. Put all your faith and take a chance, who knows you may like it better than me.7.5/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Edwards has rewarded that confidence by bringing all the skills apparent in his guerrilla debut to a very large property indeed, and making a highly accomplished and enjoyable film. Godzilla has, of course, seen numerous interpretations over the years, but Edwards' take is still fresh. He recognises that the human aspect is how the audience relates to the film and its hero, and there is no better actor working today at carrying the audience's empathy than Bryan Cranston, whose presence and performance ensures that the viewer is on board. The relationship conveyed by Cranston and Juliett Binoche in a few short minutes of screen time is immediately convincing and provides an emotional platform for the film. It's a pity that Aaron Taylor-Johnson does not seem capable of taking this emotion forward, and his stock action protagonist and relationship with his doctor wife Elizabeth Olsen is the most disappointing aspect of the film. Thankfully, we need not dwell on this, as the main event is Edwards' highly effective handling of the monsters. Their design is excellent, clearly the subject of careful consideration, but Edward's peerless talent is in his recognition that these creatures are governed by the same biological imperatives as humans - eat, reproduce and compete. The Mutos' laying waste to human cities is just a by-product of this,. It is the key to the film's success, and the reason Godzilla deserves to be seen, as much for the monstrous performances as the human ones.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I did not know what to expect from the new one and I have watched the trailer a couple of times, but I will not spoil it for you. If you like action and Sci-Fi a lot, like I do, you will not get disappointed.Last Friday some friends and I, had an arrangement about watching this new version of Godzilla. We agreed to watch the 3D version of the movie. The 3D really gives the movie that extra WOW! effect and with the THX sound system, I was literally blown away in the cinema! Watch it in 3D and bring your friends or family for an awesome movie watching experience. You will not get disappointed and even though I find the trailer ""boring"", the movie is absolutely NOT boring! Sitting on the edge of your seat or holding your breath, is also a part of the action, and ""oh no, are they going to make it?!"" experience.Would I consider watching this movie in the cinema again? Heck yes I would! And in fact I have invited my parents to the cinema today, and we are going to watch Godzilla together in 3D. I have also told my friends and colleagues about how awesome the new Godzilla movie is. Godzilla is a, ""you have to watch it in the cinema"", movie. To top it off, I love 3D and Godzilla has changed how movies should be watched in the cinema.Would I recommend this movie? Indeed I will and what are you waiting for?! Do yourself a favor and watch it!Over and out.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Granted, the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but the human drama and sense of peril is much more believable than Roland Emmerich's shlock 1998 remake; which despite having some entertaining moments, never captured the dark tone of the 1954 classic monster flick that introduced to the world one of the most beloved and iconic monsters of all time, the G-Man!!! I came in with low expectations, but when all hell breaks loose and the situation becomes more and more dire, that's when things get REALLY exciting. The fight between Godzilla and the Mutos, is nothing short of exhilarating. I only wish that the fights were longer and more intense and not so much focus on the human characters, but in the case of this film, it's justified in getting the audience to have sympathy for the human protagonists, but me personally, I was more enamored with the G-Man, than the humans; mainly stemming from the fact that I'm a HUGE Godzilla fan, and have been wanting to see a film in his original glory for years. Thankfully, it delivered, and by the box-office business this film is doing, we'll be seeing the G-Man in another massive monster mash in the future.Great film. Best one in the franchise I've seen for a long time.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Come on, where is the relation between the boring family story and the theme of the film? Basics explained in any screenplay class!.In the second hour comes the fight between monsters, but Edwards has a problem with the tone of the story and what is finally shown is not believable: that shoddy military stuff, the lack of large-scale of what is happening, the sometimes too calm reaction to those astonishing events. The director also seems to hesitate between subtlety and explicitness.And the visuals were very disappointing, except two terrific moments: the parachute scene and the Godzilla roar scene accompanied with the piano notes. The rest is lacking in imaginative use of the camera, too 2D (and i'm not referring to the movie format), very little sense of depth and lack of physicality in the action.

"8","/10","Godzilla is an awe-inspiring spectacle that truly delivers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3016264/?ref_=tt_urv","YJLcool","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34627686/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2014","After the failed 1998 version of Godzilla, a Jurassic Park ripoff (there are many scenes lifted shot-for-shot from Jurassic Park) which nearly destroyed the franchise by making the titled monster looked nothing more than a giant iguana with spikes, Hollywood decided to make another American reboot again for the well-known Japanese pop-culture icon. The Japanese hated the 1998 version so much that they named the Iguana monster as 'Zilla', without 'god' and they even have a film (Godzilla: Final Wars) where 'Zilla' get blown to bits by the real Godzilla. So, this time, does it truly deliver? YES.From the menacing look...the thunderous roar...the humongous 107m (350ft) size...the trademark back plates...the gargantuan tail whip...the signature atomic breath...Godzilla is a word taken from 'Gojira', a combination of two Japanese words: gorira (""gorilla"")and kujira (""whale""), implying his enormous size, power and aquatic origin.The newly-designed Godzilla is more faithful to its Japanese origins, done with Hollywood's state-of-art CGI effects (instead of a man-in-suit costume). The film respects of the monster's dark nuclear roots by showing the nuclear tests done in the past as attempts to kill it (although it enhanced the creature, making it bigger, powerful and stronger than before).The film done a great job in portraying the monsters, showing them as animals that tries to survive, trying to do what it takes to defend their territories or reproduce. The CGI was really good and the shots of godzilla or the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) appearing on screen were nothing short of incredible. The film chooses to hold back the Kaiju battles until the end and gradually reveal Godzilla's body parts (the spiky back plates in the Pacific, the gigantic tail, the stomping foot, the massive chest, etc) from various human viewpoint camera angles before making his full appearance.While many would think this might cause frustration for the impatient ones, but this is not the case. The film gave us several breathtaking closer shots of the MUTOs to keep us entertained before the big guy comes in. It builds up the anticipation for the climax. At the same time, these shots give us a sense of scale, an understanding of monsters' massive sizes before the climatic battle begins. Otherwise, an overexposure of monsters earlier in the film might leave the audience feel exhausted and develop repetitive feeling of scenes as the film progresses. I was genuinely awestruck during the moment when godzilla first appears on-screen, stomping on buildings and makes his first roar.The monsters remain as the central story that ties many of the human characters together in the film. Gone are the silly, cheesy acting, lame humor, and tone of the 1998 version. The level of seriousness in the film gives the sense of urgency and danger for events that about to happen. First, we get to see the Ford family and how the existence of these monsters affect their lives, the research team that tries to understand the creatures behaviour, the Navy troops that tries to stop these creatures from wiping out the entire human race. These stories works together as a functional narrative that connects all the pieces (although it feels contrived and too convenient at some point).The acting was good. Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche and Elizabeth Olsen all provide decent performances in their respective roles. Bryan Cranston delivered a brilliant on-screen performance despite his limited screen time in the film. However, Aaron Taylor- Johnson's character does fall a bit flat and it's a shame that he has most of the screen time compared to the rest of the casts.Overall, Godzilla is an awe-inspiring spectacle that delivers. The climatic battle in San Francisco is truly rewarding and worth the wait, it left me wanting for more.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-godzilla.html Rating: 8/10","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This is what Godzilla fans(and movie monsters fans as well), were waiting for! And even more!It represents extremely well the force of nature as it was planned to do. A great scenario for great actors and actresses. Epicness, pure madness, some really poetic moments of destruction and of freedom.Sometimes, when Godzilla roars, I was(and it's true!), holding the armrests of the sit as he was taking his breath; and when he finally releases his roar, this is purely astonishingly awesome! Everything is here to spend two hours, (not that long, actually), in a really great joy. They show us that despite the fact they are monsters, the closest living creature from the Mutos are the spiders, and Godzilla, the lizard, obviously; this shows us one thing: the monsters(all of them), are humanized. But i won't tell more to avoid any spoilers. The man is the species which is actually shown like the real monster, with all those nuclear weapons unfairly threw on innocent people. Just go watch this movie in theaters, without 3d, it will give a better look at the special effects, especially for the monsters, I believe!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

""The military have no effect on the plot, they're useless"". That is the point, their scenes may be pointless and ineffective but that is because they are dealing with Godzilla, the God is in the title. We are never given too much Godzilla because it is bigger than us, all we can do is watch from the sidelines while it wrecks havoc. It's a movie about nature taking back and how little control we have over it, we can send the army in but in the end it doesn't matter. The storytelling choices are perfect because they make us watch through a TV screen or from the soldiers on the ground. Godzilla shows just how irrelevant humans are, one minute we're here and the next minute we're gone and it doesn't really matter. The characters are the way they are because they're not really characters, they're just another group of ants in the colony that is slowly but surely being purged. This is a god damn horror movie and to quote Matt Zoller Seitz, ""it's all about perspective and point-of-view—not just what you're seeing but how much, and under what circumstances.""","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This is largely due to Bryan Cranston's (Joe Brody) acting skills. But by the time Godzilla made his first appearance, and Joe Brody was killed off (both happening roughly an hour into the film), things went downhill fast. The CG effects were abysmal, and not done in a tasteful manner at all. ie: night-time scenes (to hide the lousy CG),and at times the monster's appearance/size was noticeably disproportionate from scene to scene. You'd think Hollywood would have gotten at least that much right. From the middle of the film onward, the acting was also terrible, as was the script. It didn't even seem like the same film by this point. Maybe the writers from the first half also met their demise and were replaced by half-wits? And Pearl Harbor as a back-drop?? Lol, c'mon...typical American/Hollywood bullshit, so no real surprise there. Way too many clichés, as the hero in these films always seems to be a cop or military guy, and his wife works as a nurse in some hospital. Highly predictable, as the two are separated during the chaos, but miraculously reunite among a crowd of tens of thousands towards the end. I thought only Roland Emerich was guilty of such cheese. Though I'm sure some were delighted by the film, I felt ripped off, even though it cost us nothing to see, thanks to freebee company passes ;)","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Godzilla 2014 is a great example of a film that makes a movie right with amazing characters, plot, and overall a very great cast of producers and directors. Plus, just because his name is in the title of the movie does not make him a main character. It's a disaster movie, where Godzilla and the MUTOS are the natural disasters with the humans being the main characters and not Godzilla which is a GOOD THING!!! If Godzilla was the main character then will just get a 20 minute or so movie with no plot at all.

Screw things up pretty ROYALLY..Of course there were Japanese versions (pre- 1998) of Godzilla but then i am taking 1998 movie as the benchmark.Now about 2014 movie,Most amazing things about it :-1. Mammoth size of godzilla. 2. Godzilla fighting other Mammoth size creatures. 3. The other creatures were beautiful and super furious. Their food is pretty amazing. 4. The way movie builds up ( first 20 minutes) is absolutely amazing. 5. The unique scream of Godzilla... WOW...Now the Sad and stupid parts of the movie..So the way they start, i thought they will do justice to ""The Godzilla"" ( Gojira). Simply put, they did not show enough destruction. Graphics were pretty bad.. The story in the middle went BONKERS.. During one scene, i thought ( in fact, everybody in the theater thought) that Godzilla is swimming with Humans and we have some sort of understanding and the other moment we were firing all we got on that poor Bear Faced thing.. Also, i felt that every now and then Godzilla's size in the movie kept variating ( if that's a word) as in, in some parts he appeared huge, in others, well not that huge :D.. Ohh ohh !! you don't even want to see the end of this movie.. i laughed like a crazy man... We actually took Godzilla for a Superhero..what is next Godzilla and Hulk are drinking BEER TOGETHER !! ahahahah..No no no.. they just didn't do justice to the ""Godzilla"".. Excellent Back Ground Story.. Could have had 1000 times better direction. Movie is pretty distorted after first 30 minutes.. I wanted to see more fight from the Godzilla.. they showed him as a giant chocolaty cute monster.. no.. not done... I wish somebody remakes this movie.. And ALERT... OUT OF NO WHERE, this Godzilla can puke lightning or something ish.. Biggest turn off of the movie.. Wasn't his size enough? ( i know Japanese versions did show something similar..but common, we don't watch Japanese movies. Do we? ) Boy.. what a disappointment ..","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Go (censored)!!! This was the best Godzilla movie ever! No I won't be expecting any Oscars anytime soon. I'm not that far off or delusional, but considering what they had to work with to begin with? They did an insanely good job! I'm a Godzilla freak! Very well acquainted with the genre. This movie is sure as heck 10 times better than that stupid giant iguana Matthew Broderick lizard movie. What you have to understand is this is based on the later Godzilla genre (may be the reason people hate it). In later Japanese films Godzilla, with all his monstrous capability actually became the hero. Almost to the point to where it became really corny and sappy. Heck even back in Godzilla verses the Smog Monster - very creepy and graphic for this kind of movie (gave me nightmares as a kid dead body parts and everything) - at the end I think they have the little boy running after Godzilla thanking him for saving them. This Godzilla 2014 movie is based on THIS genre of Godzilla movie... but without the stupid sappiness. It's sort of this genre fused with Godzilla 'King of the Monsters' - loved that chyron (homage) on the news feed by the way. Anyway, whoever worked on this script, oh holy **** am I impressed. Because of how much they toned it down, yet still kept the essence of this, without ever coming out and flat out saying it. Doesn't mean he doesn't tear crap down and kill people, lots of people... Just realized some of the quotes...Oh holy ****, this movie bloody nailed it Hollywood style! If you're not a Godzilla freak and/or a Hollywood wannabe you're probably just not going to understand. Whoever put this story together... does understand!... Time for me to go check 'the numbers'. Prob. failed like EV on the Snake River... Awesome, the haters are wrong. I'm right. It made money. Wish I had supported it at the box office.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This one is plain constant feeling which sums up to zero. Godzilla arrives and it feels just like it has left. Even the great CGI, which sometimes can compensate for a bad plot, could not save the day. It went just unnoticed in the whole feeling that the movie is just extremely bad and boring. We don't need another ""so bad its funny"" movie. The Asylum provides enough of them, with less money spending while doing so.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Even the Lord of the rings trilogy had a couple of spots that were kind of rough. Speaking of which, special-effects genius Jim Rygiel returns to give us his visual interpretation of Godzilla and Motu.I'll add this: I really liked in the 1998 version as well, because I believed it was New York City's turn to be smashed into tiny pieces of rubble.For too many years Tokyo has been the main recipient of Godzilla, Mothra, and all of the rest of the monsters attentions. It is time for new cities to be totally rubble-Ized, and in this film it is Janjira, Japan; Honolulu, Hawaii; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Canada, Er, I mean San Francisco. In this film once again Vancouver, British Columbia becomes the ""virtual"" San Francisco.Therefore, because most of the action occurs in San Francisco, Er, I mean Canada, this television show, Er I mean movie appears to be a reunion of Stargate-Atlants-SGU-1 Guest actors and actresses including Jill Teed of Wormhole Xtreme. You will see the Russian ""General Chekov"" speaking to Bryan Cranston at the beginning of this film, on the USS Saratoga you will see the girl who played the Comms officer in the Stargate SG-1 episode ""Prometheus"", when they try to take the A-for-Atom-Bomb Train to San Francisco you will see one of the Goa'Uld system lords from Stargate SG-1, in Oakland you will see the actor who played a younger version of a General Hammond from the episode ""1969"", and there are a few more faces dropped in here and there for effect ending with Jill teed as Liz Olson's friend.That is mostly why I enjoyed this movie, even though it was good enough even without all of my favorite Canadian actors doing cameos.The imagery is realistic even though the plot line if any does seem to jump around a lot and these monsters, these huge monsters seem to easily get from Japan to California in 60 seconds flat, who cares about any of this? It is a form of nitpicking I do not participate in. I enjoyed it, it was a good movie. And the fact that more and more of these negative reviews are written by people who just happened to join IMDb to write only one review of one movie makes them not valid at all, I don't even read them.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I always have a quick peek on IMDb spoiler-free reviews before actually going to see a movie. Having seen all the one stars it made me curious and so I paid for regular 2D instead of IMAX which is actually less than half the price. I am so relieved. Godzilla bombed!I know you probably liked the trailer as did I. The excitement surrounding this movie is rife. The movie just doesn't cut it though, not by a long shot. It's a marketing gimmick... Godzilla greatest monster malarkey... drama, fighting, action... n to the o - NO!The trailer is the end. Believe what you read when they say you only see Godzilla for 10 minutes throughout the entire movie. And yes it matters, we paid to see Godzilla after all. A good human story would have been a bonus.The battle scenes are cleverly cut in that we know the monsters are fighting but they are not played out on screen for us to enjoy. The focus is always put back on the human story, which is weak, boring & forgettable. You probably feel compelled to watch this movie regardless of what you read here but I would recommend the cheapest ticket as it's likely you will feel a level of disappointment and/or regret. You get 90% boring human story and 10% Godzilla. Not worth extra cash IMAX, nor 3D. Yet 2D is shown sparsely whilst the others are pushed in our faces. Thank you one star reviewers, I would have been so p'd off. Not simply because I'd have felt robbed but my high expectations of this movie would have been crushed. Somehow I don't care for the price I paid.This movie is borderline rental. It will make millions only because the trailer tricks us and it's Godzilla, nothing more. Don't believe the hype, it's not real unless I'm missing something.This movie is 5 at best for special effects and the short time we get some Godzilla action. I have given 3 because it's so minimal.The movie is overall boring. Thanks for reading :D","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie was hyped, but I expected another poorly made, badly acted, mindless explosion/destruction/monster fighting/pacific rim nonsense. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe are both awesome in their acting. Godzilla himself is a slow build, but once this movie gets going it really gets going. The final battle is one of the greatest monster movie fight scenes I've ever seen, and they do a good job of giving this movie heart. Well done. The only reason I don't give it a perfect 10 is because some of the explanations of HOW gigantic lizards and bug-things exist aren't really convincing, and much of the Physics and logic is off. But who cares? It's freaking Godzilla! Also, speaking of him, he looks more like the classic monster than the abomination that was the 1998 Matthew Broderick flick. It was a nice nod to his origins while the amazing advances of modern CGI made him a million times as scary. I freaking loved it","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I understand trying to surround Godzilla in shadow in mystery for the first half the movie, but my Jesus itsssss Godzilla we have seen him a hundred times before. When any action does happen its good for all of five seconds then we cut to the trials and tribulation of Kermit taylor Johnson and his useless plot point of a wife Miss Piggy Olsen. Over all the only mass destruction was my aching brain to which there is no damage control.

It's suspenseful, exciting, fun and almost everything I could have possibly wanted it to be.But may I please get some more Godzilla in my Godzilla movie please?What the movie gains in tension and suspense is sadly lost with a lacklustre delivery of the guy we all came to see, I just don't think Godzilla appears enough throughout the film to justify calling the movie ""Godzilla"".Godzilla appears mostly in moments intended to make fans ""squee"" and I can see now why these were the scenes they played at festivals to promote the movie.Also it appears that much of the storytelling is delivered with a lot of labour, everything has to be explained in detail removing a lot of the mystery and intrigue behind the monsters. Also making the dark-super- serious Godzilla almost feels redundant because it's impossible to escape the series' shlocky B-Movie origins. Gareth Edwards was one of the best choices to direct this movie and he has a distinct eye for little moments amidst scenes of big scope, but by focusing on the humans instead of Godzilla most of the time it cheapens the spectacle and it feels very disappointing.It is good movie, and i'm recommending it highly for what it gets right, but I must emphasize the lack of Godzilla in Godzilla.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story is good with the action and excitement of the story. The movie had a good beginning to the end. The movie Godzilla been around for years but mainly in Japan. The movie Godzilla is huge in the country of Japan. The United States Company Hollywood only made one Godzilla movie that were back in 1998. The movies was a fun action flick but not serious. The 1998 movie was okay unlike Godzilla, 2014. Brief of the Story.The Story was very good from the beginning to the end, it started out good with how they were trying to stop the monsters. The story started in The French Polynesia in the pacific. It than lead to The Philippines, Japan, Honolulu Hawaii United States, Nevada, Las Vegan, The Forest and finally San Francisco. These were the locations of the story mainly based. It mainly took place in Japan and San Francisco, United States. The character started though in the Philippines with the scientist investigating, then goes to Japan where we meet the main characters.In these locations in the movie they each had their moments, some scenes were sadden like the nuclear plant in Japan and Hawaii, San Francisco where the monsters caused the most damage and wreckage. I enjoyed the story the most about the movie Godzilla. It not a movie for someone who does not follow what is happening from the beginning to the end. It easy to follow if you are a focused person that can understand what is happening. The story of the movie is wonderful in different ways.The first set of characters in Godzilla goes by the name of Dr. Ichiro Serizawa with his assistant who is a female. Dar. Serizawa who is the head of the Science Team and lead investigated of Godzilla and Muto. In Japan we meet Lieutenant Ford Brody the son of Joe Brody and Sandra Brody. There been a tragedy at the a Nuclear Plant in Japan. After The Nuclear Plant Disaster the goes 15 years into the future where we meet older Lieutenant Ford Brody. It lead to different events throughout the story.The human side in the movie did not play a big part in the movie. They mainly investigating and trying to find a way to stop the monsters that were causing havoc across the world mainly in Asia and North Americans continents and The Pacific. The three species made the movie interesting though especially in the beginning when leading up to the final showdown in San Francisco, California. My favorite part of the movies was with The Military in certain locations and the final fight scene between Godzilla and The Two flying beasts who were breeding. Godzilla had to defeat the Flying Beasts that were in the movie.The ActingThe acting was pretty good in the movie. There were some flaws in the movie but it was not terrible. The movie had some good actors. I though don't know many of them but that not a bad thing, it always good watching new and different actors. I know couple people from other movies and TV shows that I watched over the years. They made the story pleasant but it was The Story that made Godzilla great that I think should be along with other good SciFi movies.The Overview.The movie is enjoyable and they did a fantastic job on the movie. The designs of the creatures and settings were very good, it almost like Pacific Rim and Man Of Steel, Inception in movies. The movie focused more on the story than the action which most SciFi-Action movies focused on the action. I think it important for movies to focus more on the story than having non-stop action.I know Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures produced better movies with story and action. Godzilla is a good movie for those that like science fiction, monsters, action and adventure as well with story and action. The movie is easy to follow to understand what is happening. It not a movie for those that can't understand what is happening from the beginning to the end. Overall it easy to understand and it's a enjoyable movie.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I thought the casting was fine, except the main character, Ford, was badly cast and was used way too much. Just too much ""soldiering"" in general. I really have no clue why he was chosen, there had to be someone better available. I felt like they went wrong with the way they ""exposed"" the mutos and Godzilla too. I think a better way would have had the first Muto tear up Japan, with Godzilla showing up just a little too late, and maybe show the Muto flying away, with Godzilla watching, and then turning around, and start heading for Hawaii. A CNN anchor could have been shown saying, ""What the hell is that thing?"". In the meantime, have Muto #2 come out, and SHOW it trashing Vegas, then go back to Hawaii, where ""round 1"" of the Godzilla/Muto fights happens, with Godzilla beating up the Muto pretty badly, and then having the military screw him up by lobbing shells at him, and the Muto gets away, and heads for the US mainland. Godzilla heads for Frisco, while Muto #2 and then Muto #1 screw around, totally trashing the city, laying their eggs, etc, along with destroying the Navy pretty easily with a lot of stuff blowing up. About the time they finished off the military, Godzilla shows up and the big finale happens, with a similar outcome to what happens in the movie that was actually made. I think just cutting the Ford screen time alone would have made a better movie. Putting a better actor in the Ford part would have, too. If the Godzilla/Muto fights could have been done better, in an escalating way, it would have pretty much erased all the negatives of the Ford character and all the ""soldiering"", but it didn't. All in all, a disappointment.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

You don't even see him (Godzilla) for more than half the movie. But that doesn't disappoint because once he arrives, the movie just hits a different level. Please note that I am giving a ""9"" rating for the Movie, not just the monster Godzilla. Here's why.Screenplay is very gripping. There is not a single moment in the movie when I felt bored. Of course dialogs could have been better at times. The movie does well on almost all other departments. But the Direction, Cinematography and Visual Effects are just impeccable. I mean, there are many scenes in the movie which give you a jaw dropping experience but you really have to pay attention to details to see the extent to which it can amaze you viz., Train falling off the bridge scene where the lead character too is jumping right in front of it; and the entire Soldiers skydiving sequence to mention a very few. I don't want to add spoilers so let me stop right there.And Godzilla! Oh ""God""zilla. You have never seen anything like it nor will you ever see anything like it again! No exaggeration. And when you see it, you'll love him. You'll love his size, his looks, his ferocity, his heroics and... his judiciously used ""atomic breathe"".I am going to watch the movie again. In theaters.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Will it be a hit this time unlike last time? Well unlike Ronald Emmerich helmed 1998 remake, which I haven't seen so far, this is the best monster movie made in Hollywood since Jurassic Park. In some parts it is even better and more creative than Jurassic Park. Only thing lacking is the humor and memorable character like Dr. Ian Malcolm or Dr. Alan Grant from Jurassic Park. But enough with the comparison, let 's talk about the film on its own. This movie is non-stop entertaining that's for sure. It is entertaining even when the scene does not involve monster fights and human drama. And main credit for this goes to Bryan Cranston(whom we said goodbye on TV last year as ""Walter White"" on incredible finale of equally incredible ""Breaking Bad"") and Ken Watanabe who steal every scene they are in as scientist due to their incredible acting despite the fact they are in supporting role. As for the leading characters played by Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen as husband and wife, they are okay in their performance, but are not convincing enough to be a parent of 5 year old, since they themselves look like a teenager. However when they are not together, they do their job decent enough to hold their scenes tight.Enough about performance, let's talk about the action scenes. The fight scenes are pretty awesome. They would be one of best fight scenes you would see this year. Some of the monster-vs-monster fight can give competition to last year's Pacific Rim. Unlike some monsters in a PG-13 film, here monsters are really scary not only because of their looks (kudos to creature design department) but because the not so experienced director add enough build up, momentum ,unpredictability and thrill without any clichéd jump scares, to make the atmosphere scary.The film is brilliant technically. And by technically I do not mean just the special effects but the cinematography and sound effect. But most impressive thing is art direction. Here everything is not Grey or dark, which is the case in movie like these, but here each and everything looks beautiful, be it architecture of Japan or close up shots of insects(yes, insects!) which looks like they are from National Geographic Channel.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I will start with the positives:1) Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe... need I say more? 2) The CGI was beautiful! It was some of the best monsters I have ever seen. Godzilla looked the best he ever has. Yes, the list is pretty short for the positives. So now the negatives:1) Other than Cranston and Watanabe, the acting was just awful. Some dialogues just made me cringe. But overall, it is a Godzilla movie; so how much acting is really needed? That brings me to my next point.2) Where was Godzilla through most of the movie? He is hardly in the movie at all. And when he is about to battle some monsters (I will hold back their names as to not give anything away), the film goes back to unnecessary character development. Then once these useless scenes are over, it goes back to the city to show it absolutely destroyed. The monster battles were the best parts of Godzilla movies. Why would they cut these out entirely?3) The food source of the monsters was absolutely ridiculous. I think this was just an attempt to bring the movie back to the US. Stop trying to Americanize films and just film them where they rightly should occur. Overall, this movie was incredibly boring due to the excessive character development that was absolutely unnecessary. I never cared about any of the characters. And for a movie about Godzilla, he is only in it for about 10 minutes of the two hours. What a waste.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's like watching fireworks: the human perspective is lost. You could not care less what happens to the characters in the story.In stead you are watching a high tech spectacle which is only appealing the first half hour when the fear of the monster is mostly suggestive. The main characters who could have offered a public point of view on the battle are shoved to the background.I was wondering what the director was trying to prove here: what is the point of introducing human characters if they nearly do not interact in the battle with the monster.The previous adaptation is often ridiculed for it's humorous undertone, but this one is too bloody serious. How bloody serious can one be about a monster with a radio active breath which gets bigger with each remake?Overall I found it a huge waste of movie budget and especially of the overpriced 3D tickets which make the film even darker than it is already.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

And unfortunately, for those out to see a monster film that has the monster spending 1.5 to 2 hours wreaking havoc on the planet and destroying everything in it's wake for good or evil, this movie will not fulfill your desires.This film offers a developing plot, some interesting character development, and some mystery for the moviegoer, as well as suspense which leads up to the monsters; but the plot builds to a monster storyline we do not expect. Although I must admit I didn't find the ""villain"" monsters interesting once they (spoiler alert) completed their metamorphosis, in fact I thought they were somewhat of an awkward looking creature and clumsy at that. The monster of the hour, Godzilla came to the film late and how the director captured the role of Godzilla in this film was a risk, a unique spin on the stereo type but it worked. Instead of us always expecting monsters to be evil, scary and that ""they must be destroyed"", the film changes our mindset putting Godzilla in a positive light. Godzilla (2014) was a breath of fresh air among the many sci-fi, monster movies that have been released recently that simply deliver CGI explosions, fights, destruction and lots of endless noise.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It features the legendary monster Gojira (Godzilla), the metaphor the Japanese created for the nuclear holocaust.Unlike other representations, here Godzilla is good (probably signifying a shift in the perception about nuclear power?) and fights for humanity (albeit misunderstood).Visually the movie is well done, with a particular nod to the monster- fighting scenes which can be breathtaking at times.However, the drawbacks are more prevalent. - there's no real story: monsters appear, wreak havoc and die/disappear. No motive is ever given except for a shrug which apparently states that it happens at times. - the human characters are irrelevant to the point where nobody would miss them if they weren't there. - the script is awful - Ken Watanabe is awfully underused and it seems to be a poster-boy for meditation, spending most of his time staring blankly and mumbling irrelevant things - there's some attempt at character development which is a waste of time as the 'characters' aren't really of any consequence in the story.This movie feels like it should've gone straight to Bluray and I see little reason why someone would pay for the exquisite torture of watching this in 3D in cinemas.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Growing up I always rushed to the TV on Sunday afternoons to try and catch which ever Godzilla movie they happened to be showing that week. They were loud and silly movies for the most part, but I fell in love with the King Of Monsters and it was for that reason I was excited to see what they would do with a new movie, especially one without Matthew Broderick. So how did Gareth Edwards and company do? Pretty darn well. Godzilla is a terrific looking movie with some incredibly breath taking scenes, especially the halo jump. The effects on Godzilla himself and the Mutos is flawless, He has never looked better, in fact, then main complaint everyone has is that they do not see enough of him, and I have to agree. There was a little too much human drama, and even my daughter who is ten was surprised at the small role that Bryan Cranston played, Although Ken Watanabe was terrific as the voice of reason, ""Let Them Fight!"". All in all, Godzilla is a wonderful start to a new series for the King Of Monsters, and I am looking forward to see where they go with it.4 Beards Out Of 5","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought the movie was a big letdown. Right from the acting to the main actor in the movie- Godzilla.. Bryan Cranston of course will act as he always does- Superb. But the rest of the crew was just doing everything in a listless manner. Sometimes they looked as if they didn't even belong on the screen. The CGI was decent (when it was there) but that is something that has come to be expected of Hollywood. There were various scenes in which they were trying to build up the movie or a scene both emotionally or sometimes for a suspense but it was left to the audience to lend a hand to their effort. And don't even try and think during the movie. The moment you start thinking along the lines of why and what, you will start getting irritated cause there are no answers in the film. In the end, at no point in the movie was I carried along with the script or the scenes. I was starved for scenes to make the movie worthwhile. I can't write anymore without giving spoilers (which i hate) but it felt like the majority of the movie and the vision of it must have looked grand in the director's eyes but i just can't share his story or vision ..

I noticed this was over 2hrs and realizing I still had another 45 or so mins to go I just couldn't even bring myself to watch the rest. And normally I can watch the stupidest movies to the end and maybe even get something out of it, but this was just plain awful. What I did see from the beginning the guy playing Ford looks like a decent actor, hope to see him in more action films, but this was just an incredibly ridiculous movie! Someone mentioned the earlier version tho didn't realize back in the 90's, thought it was earlier than that but that was a TERRIFIC movie, loved the plot/storyline, and was even sad when Godzilla was killed. I thought this would be a continuation of the earlier version after the ending from that one or at least a redone version to continue to further sequels. This movie needs to be scrapped and burned and tell the producers to take a look at the earlier one for some insight into what a real movie is.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Shame he is isn't in the movie that much. The realism is great with governments disguising monsters as earthquakes, it quite interesting. Also, Ken Wantabe, even though he is given cringe-worthy lines like ""Let them fight."" but his character was understandable and likable. Also, the action (the little of it) is well directed. Godzilla is well portrayed as an animal, and actually feels BIG.Now to the bad, Aaron-Taylor Johnson, don't get me wrong, I like him but in this movie he is the most generic, uninteresting character, I've seen in a long time. I just about cared for him and his family to survive, but is the main character and add to the next problem. There's not enough Godzilla, there's a moment where you think ""Oh, stuff's about go down!"" but it cuts away from the monster fight that Godzilla is know for. What the actual hell! If this movie is about Godzilla at least let him have more screen time. If the is a good example is Pacific Rim, that movie was self aware and focused on epic fights and succeeded at that. Godzilla thinks that it can't have a bit fun. Speaking of fun, there could be better humour, to kind of lighten the mood and still feel serious, this is something that Marvel does well and would be good here.My verdict is that Godzilla isn't bad, it is enjoyable and fun at moments but when you stand back and look back at the movie you see the potential it had and how good it could of been. 7/10 or a good time, no alcohol required.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Where yes there is some human drama but once the second half kicks in we get the monsters and the idiots.With idiots I mean the humans. How joyfully stupid they can be in this movie, how yes there are horrid plot points about being apart of your wife and child. Or how one of the heroes picks up a lost child to later. Oh come on you know what is coming. BUT unlike the 1998 version at least we have the monsters. And even though the fights aren't that long we get to see some nice fighting. Some lovely use of the Godzilla story and actually not a bad idea when it comes to the enemy monster. I don't know its name but certainly it is a fun time! In short this isn't Citizen Kane but I didn't want to watch that movie tonight. I wanted a fight between big monsters and I got it. This makes up for the terrible movie in 1998. I love how idiot the people are, how jokingly referential the plot line is, how yes even the irritating child only exists to point out that he is irritating. WE HATE YOU STUPID IRRITATING CHILD and this movie knows it! Ah eh back I guess to the special effects, I seen better I seen allot worse. They are good enough and well used. So great movie much better then those mysterious ""Oooh what is the monster"" crap we had to deal with.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is very different from Tristar's 1998 film of the same title where its monster loves to eat fish and wreaks havoc out of pointlessness which is so cheesy and laughable in a very bad way. Edward's version has a more tolerable reasoning. And it was improved even more by its impressive cinematography, wise and humble usage of special effects and the CGI creation of Godzilla, which looks almost completely faithful to the 1954 original.I am somehow enjoying the form of this film. The action is bigger when it involves humans. As much as possible, when the monsters fight, it limits itself to be action-packed by setting the camera work in the human perspective and sometimes at an even more distant range. It's not that the monster action isn't happening. It's definitely there and special effects are used but its style tries to make its audience be a part of the scene and also to tranquilize its nature to succumb in clichéd action sequences.I actually prefer it that way. Comparing this to last year's ""Pacific Rim,"" ""Godzilla"" is definitely more exciting. Why? Because ""Pacific Rim"" is fully drowned in monster mayhem and uproarious action so mindless it will make you yawn or scratch your heads. It gives a very detached, easily weary effect (although its other elements like its human drama and stunning visuals made it irresistible). In ""Godzilla"" however, the lesser focus or up-close look on the monster action gives more immense anticipation whether it happens or not.The movie is also impressive on not showing its monster feature so easily. Patience definitely builds excitement as in Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws."" It slowly introduces Godzilla, starting with the body parts first in creeping silence. But when it finally show Godzilla's full image and roars so mightily, the scene easily becomes iconic. That was such an epic entrance. And it doesn't end there. It is filled with so many remarkable images of Godzilla. The wide shots of this monster are considered the best as it shows its entire scale while enamored by the subtle palette of its canvas.Godzilla is the main star of this picture although it has less of him. He roars so great and his fiery breath dominates the film with inexplicable power. Honestly, I think no one could have it the other way around.To generalize it all, ""Godzilla"" is an epic monster-invasion picture that triumphs greatly because of valuing its CGI and special effects by utilizing it more in achieving an artistic statement and immersive quality than just exhibiting heavy cataclysmic action. It effects are into impressive visuals that emits beautiful imagery and the cinematography anchored it with competence.Recreating Godzilla in a rare, perfect form is definitely something. But without having an idea on picking elements to collaborate it with,it would be almost like burying this iconic monster into the deepest trench of the ocean. I'm glad that this version has met some wise decisions. It wasn't for everyone but at least it shows utmost respect.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had some idea at the time of the cheesiness of the special effects of the day and puppeteering. But I still enjoyed the movies nonetheless.Fast forward a few decades, and I believe that Godzilla is getting the makeover that the monster richly deserves. I felt the same way when watching the Mandalorian and seeing Luke Skywalker introduced, battling the droids. Particularly after seeing what they did with Luke Skywalker's character in the sequel movies (no, I'm not a fan of the way the character was changed). Getting back to Godzilla, I think the monster has been shown the proper respect. He's not completely invincible, but he takes a hit and keeps going after his enemies.The only thing I find unrealistic in the movies are how easily the cities are destroyed. I would expect to see a little more collateral damage in terms of human carnage.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

At some point (the scene with that kid on a train) I stopped watching and went to IMDb to see if there is an Asylum ripoff called Godzilla and I accidentally downloaded their version, as it did happen a few times before. And it only got worse after that scene. This movie really is as bad as any of the Asylum movies (no plot whatsoever, bad acting, no character development,...), except for the mediocre CGI, which is slightly better. There's one more thing that puzzles me, why do all action scenes in modern Hollywood productions take place at night and when it's raining? Did someone in Hollywood read some movie making book (some movie maker's bible or something) where it's written that the audience enjoy action scenes better if they can't see them? This movie isn't worth seeing it in theaters. If you really wish to see it, download it.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The monsters he fought were just as stupid-looking and impossible in a real world where the laws of physics (weight, flying, quick movement by zillion-ton creatures) reign, as G was.

I personally think it's the only remake that successfully captures the spirit of the original, which I think we tend to forget was actually a genre film about a serious subject.Adam Wingard's ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" mostly style over substance (a fun ride nonetheless) and Michael Dougherty's ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" was kind of a balance of both Edwards and Wingard (albeit overstuffed with too many kaijus).Edwards' ""Jaws""-like approach to suspense and dread was masterful and it made the final battle just pure *chef's kiss*! I really enjoyed director Gareth Edwards' independent feature debut ""Monsters"" and when/how he chose to reveal/show the creatures, so I think that prepared me for how he approached ""Godzilla"" with a slow-burning fear of the unknown.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I won't get into details, I'll just notice that Gogdilla has nothing to do with Gareth Edwards 2010 Monsters. I don't blame him for that; we very well know that this is a producer movie.

I think this one is a victim of one of those films where the second one is better then the first. I say that because king of the monsters is much better. This movie is cool for the idea that we are gonna film the movie from the people point of view rather then a monster fight movie. This more reminds me of a disaster movie like a clover field etc. I like the idea but I think they miss the Mark with that's not what Godzilla is. I still like the movie for what it is but but I give it an 8 because it misses the Mark of not having Godzilla in it a ton and there are not really fight scenes that you can see clearly because they are always showing it from the POV of a person or helicopter with the exception of a few shots. But 90% is from human POV. It still is good though and a different take. If I'm being honest see this movie so you can then watch king of the monsters and king skull island. Then of course King Kong vs Godzilla. You get much more of the classic fight scenes like you want from monsters in those and even though the one is not out yet you will get fight scenes. As far as this movie this is for sure a rent compared to the next one that was a buy for me. It is still good though and like the idea but ultimately this is a movie that is solid but but not a knock out of the park or a Godzilla fan. It's more of a drama where they try to make people to involved. Of course they make stupid decisions and don't listen to the people who clearly know what they are talking about etc. You will like it though!!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was a fan back in the day when you couldn't find the original movies. You would see a few of the same ones at random movie rental places, but some were never to be found anywhere. I remember finally finding some mail order place that had them all, and I would save up and order a new one every time I had enough money. The first US Godzilla wasn't Godzilla. I enjoyed it at the time, I think I was 14, but it just wasn't Godzilla!I had been waiting for years to see the real Godzilla in modern special effects on the big screen, with a gritty story to match the original movie. I think this hit the mark. I hear so many people complain that Godzilla wasn't plastered on the screen the entire movie. The way they minimally showed him really worked for me. The only time it bothered me is when they cut away during one fight with the MUTO. The CGI, audio, size, and character of this Godzilla made such an impact when he was on screen, I didn't notice his lack of screen time. I really liked the story, I liked the MUTO's, I loved the backstory of Godzilla with the nuke ""testing"". It wasn't perfect. I would say a strong B+. With how much I also enjoyed Kong: Skull Island, I am really excited for King of the Monsters, and eventually seeing a serious take on King Kong vs Godzilla. The Japanese version is camp, although fun for what it is.

If you are a monster and dinosaur fan under 16 and you haven't seen Pacific Rim yet, definitely ! And maybe if you have on a rainy day off and you are bored from internet and you absolutely do not know what to do. And if it was for the last reason, even here you do not feel that this movie will stay longer in your brain as exactly this rainy afternoon. At least I will have latest by tomorrow completely forgotten about this movie and this is the good thing about it. Only scene which has left me with a little ""wow"", that was when the army forces plane jumped. That was visually interesting and with the Space Odyssey 2001 sound laid under even acoustic wise interesting. All the rest, but really all the rest of the 118 minutes left, I have seen already 5 times in the last 2 years. What was the point of doing this movie ? I will tell you. Only point about this movie is keeping the people at work. So many salaries are in such a Hollywood crap that they often do not care at all what they are feeding the audience. This is somewhat sad and certainly sad for Ken Watanabe, the actor from Inception (he played this time so lousy) and the people from Legendary. Binoche was only in it for her name and to fool the willing to pay audience that there could be some real acting in this film. And why, why, why, always the same f.....g kind of story ? Muscle army husband has to leave his family to fight the monster and cutie blonde wife and cutie kid are left behind but for sure, 1 hour later, for some reason, back in the middle of the war zone. And sure, Godzilla (or it's counterparts) had to be fought by Americans in San Francisco, but hey, so intelligent, in the Chinese quarter. That makes it feel so real Japanese. No, I really hoped for something at least similar to Pacific Rim but this is by far not the case at all. 3 points out of 10 for quiet flawless CGI and some nice 3D moments in the beginning of the movie + plane jumpers. So it's not complete rubbish but nearly.","8 out of 26 found this helpful.

I have to point out that Godzilla barely appear that much in the movie because most of the time he either swimming or a short fight scene with MUTO. But i do like the build up towards his appearance and the tension that happen in the movie. I also do like the background behind the new monster on their history and motive in the movie. While most of the destruction and fights happen pretty quickly and isn't that suspenseful, it does show the damage it cause to a city and the struggles after a monster attack. The only interesting character is Joe Brody who have depth to him with him trying to figure out the truth and the performance by Bryan Cranston who does a great job in the movie.Unfortunately the movie mostly focus on the wrong characters because they are not interesting at all. Ford Brody is the character who they focus on too much because I found him to be really bland and is easily predictable that he reunited with his family. The other characters aren't that interesting to talk about because all of them are bland and dull throughout.I really like Godzilla new design in the movie because it update the character looks and is pretty cool looking. MUTO is the new monster who are interesting creatures with their background and design which is cool looking. I wish we see more of them in the movie and their abilities they use throughout.Overall, it's a great Godzilla movie that need more Godzilla in it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Yet another lifeless remake","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3016743/?ref_=tt_urv","nycmode75","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12397882/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2014","It's been awhile since I had the urge to review a film, but after seeing the preview for the latest Godzilla film, I feel it's my civic duty to offer my less-than stellar opinion.Any fan of Godzilla films will immediately notice that the spirit of the films didn't simply lie in the campy or satirical nature of the movies. It wasn't always about the guys in monster suits or ridiculous English overdubs that these films were memorable for. Ultimately Godzilla was a modern day metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power - and the consequences of mankind's hubris in the face of mother nature.While this film removes some of the bad taste from 1998's lizard fest remake - the movie makes some of the same mistakes that doomed the previous film 16 years ago. First of all - the failure to coherently tie-in the nuclear allegory literally kills the film from the get go. The audience is treated to a vague flashback to a Fukushima-like event which sparks a series of events that ultimately leads Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) to set off on his own personal quest to find answers to these mysterious questions that had huge ramifications on his own family as well. The problem here - despite some interesting references to the ""truth"" behind a series of Eisenhower-era atomic tests in the Pacfic - over time, there never really is any clear link between the nuclear story and the evolution of Godzilla and other similar monsters.Unfortunately it's up to Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his sidekick, Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins - in a totally wasted performance on the heels of her excellent run on Blue Jasmine) to provide viewers with equally vague explanations of what's really happening as these monsters start appearing out of nowhere (despite decades of government cover ups and nobody noticing for 60 years). Yes - most of the movie is just as illogical. In the end - we're treated to hours of human interaction that is poorly developed. Audiences are introduced to an endless series of new characters such as Joe's son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson - in a performance that was as vague and boring as most of the film), his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen - looking completely most of the time) and Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn - clearly just collecting a paycheck) - and yet it's hard to care about any of them. All this because any time we get a glimpse of their motivations, the movie swings to the next ludicrous crisis and the actors are left to fill brain dead roles in yet another Hollywood disaster movie.The biggest failure here beyond all that was simply the fact that for a film billed as a Godzilla movie - the legendary monster actually isn't in the film for a good deal of time. Even the final marquee battle (that was well shot) feels laborious, partially because at this point audiences are so exhausted by the confusing and lackluster human element stories that they just want to get the movie over with. Rarely do you watch a monster movie and wish that the beasts quickly destroy whatever city they are in so we can all rush out the door.In the end this film can't decide if it wants to be a 21st century summer blockbuster, a cautionary tale of nuclear energy, a B-movie aimed at pleasing fans, or simply a special effects demolition derby. One thing is for sure - the lack of character development, reliance on poorly developed human stories that seem insignificant in the face of monumental disasters and the lack of Godzilla for most of the film makes this yet another poor rehash that's destined for obscurity as soon as the next 2014 summer blockbuster is released a week later (X-Men)","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A new life for Godzilla, after years of being mistreated in the cinema.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5523057/?ref_=tt_urv","filipemanuelneto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53053227/?ref_=tt_urv","2 March 2020","I confess that I was never a fan of Godzilla because it always seemed unrealistic to me. The amount of bad movies with the city-destroying monster doesn't help either. So, it is no wonder that I had little expectations for this film and decided not to see it in the cinema but at home, when it was on TV.I felt, right from the start, that the film is concerned with creating a logical story to sustain the monster. The nuclear theme is there, but now it was not created by human bombs, it existed for thousands of years, drawing power from atomic radiation, like a chargeable battery. Even so, I did not feel completely convinced, given that radiation kills and, here, human beings seem at ease with a gigantic creature that certainly emanates more radiation than fifty thousand reactors. There are more times when everything sounds false and the story reveals weaknesses, but it is better not to take these issues further if we want to give the film a chance.The script is simple: it all starts with a tragic nuclear accident in Japan and Joe Brody's search for what really happened. His search causes him and his son, now an American military man, to stumble upon a hidden truth: that there are colossal creatures in the world, older than Humanity and mostly asleep, who can wake up and endanger our lifestyle. They are monitored by a secret international organization called Monarch, and one of its leaders, Ishiro Serizawa, places hopes on the strongest and most powerful of them - the Gojira lizard - to control all the rest. The rest of the film is a trail of destruction, with humans screaming, soldiers firing, things on fire and colossal creatures in titanic battles.The film features a cast full of famous stars but it is not the type of film we see for the interpretive quality of the actors nor do we have the opportunity to truly care for the characters. Moreover, most of the actors have little time on the scene and little to do. This is the case of Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen and Juliette Binoche. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is weak to lead the film but works reasonably as an action figure. Ken Watanabe is the most striking actor in the entire film, functioning as a kind of ""Master Yoda"" who knows more than everyone else and always has a cliche of wisdom up his sleeve. Watanabe always knew how to stay above the rest of the cast and give us a good job.Technically, the film is grandiose and justifies the millions in the budget. Bet on creating a threatening environment, with a lot happening at night or in cloudy scenarios, where we don't see everything. There are cities devastated to the ground, a lot of noise everywhere, dust and animalistic deafening roars. The sound and visual effects are to be congratulated, as well as the entire CGI and computing department. Well-made sets, good props, good sound mixing and editing work are also very evident. The soundtrack, responsibility of Alexandre Desplat, is competent but not impressive or epic, as it could be.Of all the films I've seen involving Godzilla, this is certainly the best. But it is the best because the others were too bad or too weak to compete with a film that has more money, more sound actors and better production values. It is a film that could be better, but it is good enough to be worth it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Gosh, this is a bad film. From being about 45 minutes too long, to awful acting to a plot exhibiting so many flaws. The so called lead, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody is woeful, so out of his depth he needs to concentrate on getting another role in Casualty on a Saturday evening. David Strathairn as Admiral Stenz - what can I say? These are just two, I could go on. Yes, the CGI is decent and the destruction caused by Godzilla and the two MUTO's is very good, but it represents two hours of my life I won't get back. Maybe it was a step too far for director Gareth Edwards. I liked his first film Monsters but maybe going from making a film in his bedsit to a big budget blockbuster was just too much at this early stage of his career.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

I was initially a little confused though as I was under the impression that Godzilla was the spider alien looking thing. I realised this was not so when Godzilla and the MUTO started to battle. But you know, it still worked for me even if I wasn't completely aware of what was going on.Aside from the somewhat hard to follow storyline everything else about this movie was great.

The monster action is great and I got goosebumps every time I saw Godzilla. My only problem with the movie is they don't show much of Godzilla.

Why not kidnap all the talented people associated with Godzilla 2014 and make their own movie? Far out, Dude. To avoid spoilers, I won't divulge the boring details of the kidnapping of talented directors, writers, special effects artists and actors originally hired. All the stoney students were BIG fans of Breaking Bad, so the only original cast member was Bryan Cranston. He quickly began asking too many hard questions, so they killed off his character after only 20 minutes into the movie, paid him his millions, smoked another 20 bowls and continued on.They worked hard into each night, fueled by drugs, pizza and caffeinated soft drinks. Like all stoners, good ideas came and went, unrealized. They tried real hard, but their drug fueled fuzzy thinking permeates each and every scene. The premises sounded good, and the THC influenced authors were certain everyone would get it.They began running out of money (several million was spent on Domino's alone) so they hired children to fill out the scenes. They worked cheap. Eventually, they ran out of pot, pizza and capital, so they threw together a dumb ending and finished. The real filmmakers were released, their budget spent, their original ideas gone and the substitute film in the can. They decided not to go public, since the product was watchable and probably makes sense to stoned 12 year olds. This movie is not ""so bad it's good."" It's so bad that it's....so bad. It's more fun to rewatch the one made in the 50s.Now the true story of Godzilla 2014 can be told.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm not a big fan, at all. All I wanted was an action movie where some monsters fight each other... i got that more or less, but it's an insult to the intellect of anyone who has studied some basic physics in school. Where to start describing the atrocities? Well, there's those monsters who eat radiation, but no actual living thing can do that... radiation kills in reality. But maybe that was in the original comics/films, whatever. Second, they go to a nuclear fallout zone and wear gas masks on their face... for freaking WHAT? radiations are extremely high frequency radio signals, they are not some goddamn air poison. Third, regarding those frequencies, they show some spectrum analyzers with the sounds of the monsters on screens... they show them many times throughout the movie, only thing is, those are not audio spectrums, wavelengths, or whatever way to put sound into graphic form. Then there's the door in a nuclear power plant - a thin sheet of metal... right, like that's gonna offer any protection. and then we have the classical stupidity of people - shooting with small caliber guns at the monsters, and also just standing still and not running as the world around them is about to be obliterated... and the list can go on, and on and on. The movie was mediocre but the way they insult one's intelligence is just unforgivable. Sound was OK-ish, did not intrude that much. Cinematography was also normal, not much of the transformers shaky cam stuff.In the end, watch this one only if you want to punish yourself for something.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

A super summer movie blockbuster? or A desperate attempt by Hollywood to cash in on a foreign franchise with mainstream appeal? Let's find out, as I go skin deep into this monster of a movie.-GODZILLA PURISTS BEWARE - Whenever a ""Murican"" attempt at Godzilla is addressed fans automatically get up in arms about the disaster piece that was Godzilla '98, but hope among hope that something more along the lines of Godzilla 2000 is released on a bigger scale. Back then, mistakes were made,and hopefully lessons were learned when it comes to adaptation and homage. Godzilla fans know that TOHO co. is Godzilla & that all the rest are merely imitations but one can't help but admire the attempt to finally get Godzilla right in his journey to an over seas audience. However the fear and of the failure from 98 still looms large.The Trailers and advertisements for this film gave us such hope and filled our hearts with anticipation, but how did it pay off? Well for all the fancy effects,big budget design, cutting edge state of the art technology,and over paid, super educated film makers that Legendary Films threw at this, you would think it would be a sure fire success, but the devil is in the details, and it's best not to count your chickens before they hatch.This movie somehow failed to utilize the main ingredient...Freakin Godzilla ! ""Hello Mc Fly !"" Ya know the guy on all the posters?, the name on the ticket?, the whole reason people stopped their busy lives ,drove to the theater, and emptied their wallets? ""Do You understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?"" Yet the developers managed to screw up the single most important aspect. Certainly the movie had other flaws and favorable features but to value them higher would be like scraping the crust from underneath a pie.-WHO LEFT SUCH A BIG PLOT HOLE? - The beginning of the movie is a real puzzler. It really fails to establish much of anything & that which is does establish gets erased within 20 mins. It reflects a deprived use of popular actor Bryan Cranston whose character is so detached that it's absurd and quickly gets lost in environmental conspiracy a la ""2012"". The subplot of the need of the son to unite with his father is so quickly swept out from the audiences feet it will leave you looking like actor Ken Watanabe as he stares dazed and confused. This character delivers the awe struck and utterly bewildered look so many times you begin to wonder if you missed something important or if that was his only direction as an actor. Seriously how many times can he appear to be so lost in thought just before muttering a whisper of some half coherent Japanese philosophy. Likewise, the female lead couldn't have been more oblivious.After a ton of hyperbole, we finally get a vague description of what's been happening. At this point I was almost beginning to wonder if Godzilla was even in this dang movie.I can't for the life of me understand why the director chose to spend so much time on vague., monotonous military Ops. , and pointless filler of , non recognizable characters, with little to no dialog whatsoever.They also felt the need to pull the cam completely away from the incredible giant monsters fighting back towards the empty streets or broken buildings.Furthermore , Godzilla's adversaries, while impressive in their own right, needlessly stole precious screen time from our main attraction. After what seems like endless minuets of further military run around, the movie shifts focus to the other giant monsters. This becomes the emphasis 3 quarters of the way through this slow moving, misguided movie, while Dr. Japanese (Watanabe) has an astounding epiphany: ""Let them fight."" uhh duhh? How were you going to stop that anyway?At this point you think they are saving all the Godzilla scenes for the very end, until you inevitably realize all those scenes are going to be spliced and short. However, the brief battles were worth their weight. I truly enjoyed the action. Godzilla was in top form: glorious and awe inspiring. Not only did he look astounding, he fought impressively. The hope and expectations of Godzilla lore were embarrassed and well represented as his dominance became clear from the devastating atomic energy breath, to his un mistake ably recognizable roar. I for 1 was wonderfully thankful for that.The final moments of this film were basically it's only redemption in an otherwise meandering prelude of emptiness. Perhaps next time Godzilla returns from the land of the rising sun, his presence & purpose will be the main focus and biggest priority of the story. Until then we have the dozens of Toho classics & modern movies to fill our hearts with epic roars, tail swipes, and super atomic flame breath!I'm Jesse, I'm a professional writer, and I love movies.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

One dimensional and incredibly bland human characters do nothing to hold our attention, while we impatiently wait for some oversized well rendered pixels to level cities and fight each other. There are some exciting, well directed set pieces, but they feel like bookends to some truly atrocious human drama. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is so vanilla as a lead and has such little screen presence, that if they digitally erased him from every scene, I probably wouldn't even notice. Elizabeth Olsen feels tacked on last minute into this narrative and she has nothing to work with and Bryan Cranston mugs for the camera. But quality human drama is not why you watch a Godzilla film, but that's really all that's served here - minus the quality.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The story is simple, and the cast does a good job. Though personally, I would take more monster action over human drama any day. But I understand why some of it should be there.Until studios making these films begin taking notes from monster movies like Godzilla Minus One, this will probably be the best Godzilla America will be able to make.But at least it's better than Godzilla 1998.IMDb: 8/10

It's a much darker Godzilla story then what has been shown in the previous 1960-1990's Godzilla movies. I will agree that Godzilla was shown for not much time and they definitely should have found a way for him to come in earlier. There were also a few scenes that didn't happen that definitely should have happened. I think we all know what scenes they are *cough cough* airport *cough*. There were some things I was disappointed in, but it did so much right for Godzilla. Every bit of Godzilla you see in this movie is the real Godzilla. He is back and ready as ever to kick monster ass. He is NOTHING like 1998's travesty of a monster. The MUTO's were also very well designed and interesting monsters. The fight scenes are excellent and well choreographed. Overall I thought it was a great Godzilla movie with a lot of homage to the original 1954 Gojira. It was also a great way to set up the monster universe. I'm very excited for the upcoming movies and really hope that they don't pull a lot of these mistakes a second time. It works effectively this time, but a second movie like this would kill it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

One positive aspect, is how this version of 'Godzilla' seems to be closer to the original version. In other words, the Monster needs another opponent than the ordinary humans. Wait! Did I say humans? No I meant the military. And not just some military, but the US military. However, there are some actors who pretend to be common civilians as well. OK, that is the story. The whole problem about this movie is its title, as a lot of such movies. Why name it Godzilla, like this would be the main actor, the most important part? No, this part belongs to General Strenz, and his military companions. The stereotype of world saving soldier, and there are a lot of them, plus their vehicles, land, sea, air. And missiles, rockets, explosions, a lot of gun fire, yes, and a school bus. In my opinion this movie's appropriate title would be, 'Another Adventure of the US military against (Westcoast) Godzilla'. Since there already was a (Eastcoast) Godzilla. they have a lot of these adventure-type films like US Army vs. 'TheBadGuy' already, the eastcoast gorilla & the super bad ass stereotype munster in new york, the whole world, the super dangerous aliens in all shades. The koreans, north. Well, you know the military, sorry, ... the story. 5 out of 10 for the nice ambiance and FX.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The lead is also way too young, again Hollywood ageism and stupid casting, to have a son of seven or so years old. The 3D was nothing short of annoying and painfully distracting in fact whilst watching this film I made a mental note to make it the last time that I see a film in 3D, all it does is remove the viewer from the experience not immerse them.Overall this was not the revelatory existential monster movie I was expecting but was merely more Hollywood popcorn fodder that the teens will love but it'll leave everyone over 25 stone cold.

This version is more of the radioactive, laser-beam shooting Godzilla - the complete opposite of the 1998 version of Godzilla. From the start, you can tell the movie was making Godzilla out to be the good guy (kind of like King Kong - he destroys the city, but then they make you feel bad for him). The acting was very poor, and the movie just didn't seem to flow at all. The characters were doing things that made little to no sense, and nobody seemed to really care that giant radioactive monsters were killing people. It felt like I was watching a poor late-90s / early 2000s movie. Not to mention Bryan Cranston's character dies (in a very anti-climactic way) before the main part of the movie even begins (and nobody even cares, not even his son or daughter-in-law). At one point, there is a scene of the main characters' old house, which was destroyed over 15 years ago. It is completely overgrown, the walls have collapsed and the foundation is torn apart. And yet the ""Happy Birthday"" banner that the father's son made is still hanging up (those are some pretty strong thumb tacks). It was dumb things like this that occur throughout the movie that make you say ""Really?"" and ruin the movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sixteen years later and another attempt has been made to relaunch this monster franchise.Early scenes start promisingly enough with Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston in a bad wig. But Binoche's role is just a few minutes and Cranston while passionate also has limited screen time. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are wasted with almost non characters.Worse, Godzilla is in effect a cameo character in his own movie. It literally is a walk on part. If there is some monster mayhem action it takes place in the dark. Never mind 3D glasses we should had got night vision goggles.The plot is about a pair of parasitic giant insects called Muto's who are causing havoc. At the same time Godzilla is also on the rampage and it seems he is set on encountering the insects. On a human level Cranston's son is trying to make his way back to his wife and kid in San Francisco, after finding out the truth about what happened to his family home in Japan 15 years earlier.The film starts off interestingly enough but gets lost in bland, clichéd characters and plotting. The script never rises above average. Even some of the action scenes such as the destruction of Las Vegas and San Francisco look undercooked. Yet the film does enough to keep you entertained so its not that mediocre.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Some of the characters in the movie seemed not fleshed out. Most baffling for me is the character Dr. Ichiro, played by the famous Ken Watanabe. The character looked confused throughout the movie and I never fully understand why he was there other than just an adviser. My least favorable character was Vivienne Graham (played by Sally Hawkins). The character seemed marginal and no one will really miss her character if it was not in the movie. Aaron Johnson-Taylor's character was mediocre, and I only wish Brian Cranston could give him 20% more of his character's emotion in the movie.The monsters animation was one of the best to grace the screen and I believe they did a great job on Godzilla. Glad now the official reviews are in and its favorable; therefore a sequel is in the plan. If done right, this reboot will create a good franchise for all the Godzilla fans.All criticisms aside, I still give this move 10 out of 10, because I think this movie is good and deserves more sequels. There is just so much material we can build on this franchise. Great job.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

A fat creature called godzila quarrels with two other wired creatures and all the people get in the middle get there all plans wrong. Is that really a movie? You don't get to see any creature fully in the movie just ones. In the day time it appears too far or too close. At night only it comes to a range to have a good look at it. But it is still night. You can't see nothing. C'mon man, just once. Is that because those creatures are naked? The main character makes a promise to his wife to come and take her away, and just forgets it. She almost got killed, waiting for that promise to be kept. I don't know why didn't she slap him at the end of the movie. She also being a weird mom, sends her child with another woman to only god knows where. Then finally the kid is magically with his dad. C'mon again, there are thousands of lost people, but the kid is just found. The army is the other foolish part. Are you kidding me? You are telling me that any of us don't have a weapon (at least one) to resist a nuclear attack? Grow up men, we are in the 21st century. We had a cold war between two great nations for about 50 years who had nuclear power. Are you telling me that no one build much advanced weapon. The army boys are about to jump out of the plane and loading revolvers. Revolvers? Seriously? A basic principle in forces is to dump any unnecessary crap in an emergency situation. What are you doing loading your revolver man? The navy escorts Godzila for a long way along the sea knowing that it is not on its way to buy some bread, where they could have easily killed it with minimal collateral damage. But when it enters Vegas they shoot at it with thousands of people around. Hiks! I couldn't help it and Laughed and hooted in the hall for that joke. It is the only movie that I have seen in recent times where human's plans go totally wrong all the time. Only thing they manages to do is to send the last nuke away in a boat. (The boat is disabled by radiation. But that funky guy stars it in car robbery style. More Laughs!) In 1945 when US attacked Japan the people who lived in the sight range of the nuke didn't stand a chance. But in 21st century, with more advanced and larger bomb you can trigger it, let it float in a boat and have a nice view of the blast being in a chopper. Hick! Hick! Hikiz! Waste of Money.

Yes it has some flaws but the positives far out weight the negatives. Without giving away spoilers I'll say the biggest negative and the only one that kept this movie from being a 10 for me is that Bryan Cranston isn't the star of the movie. He has a smaller supporting role and the movie is mainly carried by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Johnson's character has very little emotion, though I believe that was by design as he seems to bury his emotions after suffering through a tragic event. The movie really needed that strong emotional component Cranston brings to the beginning of the film for the entire movie. I liked the Contrast Cranston and Johnson had at the beginning seeing how each has dealt with their shared traumatic event and would have loved to seen that carried through to the end. The other negative that didn't bother me too much was I wanted a little more Godzilla. With that being said, every time he is on screen it's money shot after money shot. Even though Godzilla wasn't on screen for a ton of the movie the Director did a great job of making you still feel his presence and the Muto creatures don't disappoint getting you to Godzilla. You feel throughout the movie that a giant prehistoric beast is lurking out there somewhere. That leads me to what I loved about this movie. The directing was superb. There are so many amazing shots in this movie. The HALO jump was incredible, the bridge scene was brilliantly shot, and the final battle was amazing and contains the best fatality ever on film. I loved where Edwards placed the camera in this movie, it really gave scale to the giant creatures in this movie. With the sequel announced I'm excited to see how this Godzilla universe gets expanded. Great summer blockbuster, go check it out","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Very tense and thrilling. This movie?? Yawn... yawn ..yawn.... It's just a ""visual FX"" and destruction-fetish movie with decent casts and nothing more. The pace is too slow. The tension is never going up. The monsters are not scary. The drama is not there. The roles & script are weak.

The whole 'monster movie' has actually been pretty dormant recently, with only a few movies like Pacific Rim to give the genre some life.Now Godzilla is back; with solid action and CGI as well as a competent cast. The action is very well paced, and the monster itself moves in a realistic way; it feels like Godzilla is truly powerful as well as massive - reportedly the biggest it has ever been. The animation rarely calls itself into question too, and the massive amount of CGI used doesn't detract from the movie at all. The impact in the battles is so believable it made me flinch, if you're thinking of seeing Godzilla it has to be in 3D! Bryan Cranston does a great job in his role, as one expects, and the rest of the cast are okay too... most of the cast, anyway.The human protagonist for much of the movie is Ford Brody, Bryan Cranston's character's son. Played by Aaron Taylor-Johnston, and I have to admit that this character wasn't up to scratch. I never got a connection from Taylor-Johnston at all, I genuinely didn't believe a word he said and I didn't buy into his motivations at all. I'm not a Taylor-Johnson fan, and the fact that he has been cast as Quicksilver of the Marvel Universe makes me nervous.Godzilla is an overall good movie, dotted with some noticeable flaws. The two hour run-time contains loads of surprises that the trailers didn't give away too, which is nice. If you've read this far into my review then you must be interested - go see it, you'll regret missing it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Being a fan of the original Toho films of the fifties and sixties I never thought that any modern version would come close to the enjoyment of those flicks.How wrong I was. This film is a joy from start to finish. Now I know that some people have written that there isn't enough Godzilla in this movie. It is fair to say that the MUTO's get more screen time, and much of the film is spent with the human side of what is taking place. I have to say though that this sits fine with me. This is a film which believes in taking its time, setting the scene and delivers with a big payoff at the end. This was a proper film with a beginning, middle and end. You find yourself engrossed in the story, knowing that the big guy will unleash himself when the film is ready for it. To me this works far better than just having some two hours of monsters mashing each other like a Transformers film.My favourite film of the year so far, and one that will probably take some topping ( though I have a strong inkling that Guardians of the Galaxy will manage that )","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The latest ""Godzilla"" has exhibited such technology, and also such a loss in its soul. You can't produce a film thinking of technology first, with the story much second. The result is the likes of this film: visually extravagant and mentally crippled. Certain bits are breathtaking, but they can't save the soulless whole. Human characters in this film are entirely unnecessary, worthy perhaps only to reduce costs of technologically-depended scenes. Even Godzilla himself/herself is not allowed to show more heart and mind. There is a talk about ""balancing nature"" from the Japanese character, and that important sentence gets totally wasted. For this film, nature balance seems to let mindless creatures fighting one another to death, with the human onlookers learning nothing. Same as ""Karma"", most western filmmakers translate the term almost as ""irresponsibility"", while the actual meaning is more dynamic, relevant, and useful to their dead-end lives. This ""Godzilla"" is not even enjoyable. My best guess is that this bunch of filmmakers has a death wish for Godzilla and its most famous franchise.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I liked the way he did not show Godzilla throughout the film, that was very clever and suspenseful. This film felt very similar to Edwards' previous work ""Monsters"". I highly recommend you to watch ""Monsters"" before watching this film. I have read a lot of negative comments from the audience, it is sad that people do not appreciate the awesomeness of Gareth's work. Godzilla (2014) is not your average blockbuster, and the best thing about it is that it does not rely on the special effects. It focuses more on the human perspective and cares about its characters.Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a pretty good job, but his character was somewhat boring and I would be okay if he died. Elizabeth Olsen was fine, even though I did not feel 100% engaged with her character, I still cared about her. Bryan Cranston was terrific in his role, his performance gave me the chills. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins were excellent too. Also, there were some little roles in the film that were very effective: the bus driver in the bridge sequence, and a little girl in the tsunami scene. This movie has a few flaws and one of them is that spends too much of its running time developing its characters.It is a film with a huge emphasis on realism and human perspective. It requires a lot of patience, you have to wait an hour to finally see Godzilla, and that is not a bad thing. The movie has a bunch of exciting moments throughout. There are a lot of people saying that there was not enough of Godzilla in the movie. The big guy had 12 minutes of screen time, and that was fine to me. I left the movie theater completely satisfied and happy because the payoff was huge to me. I was on the edge of my seat during the last 20 minutes. The third act was a huge payoff, a mind-blowing spectacle of dazzlingly special effects and an epic battle between the three monsters.I saw it on 3D and it was an awesome experience. The visual effects and the sound mixing were just breathtaking. Just imagine all the work that was required to make the design of the MUTOs and Godzilla. Gareth Edwards and his team clearly appreciate the monsters. Moving on, the fight sequences were bold, exciting and the CGI looked so neat. These monsters are masterfully designed, and they look scary as hell to me. I am so glad that the trailer did not show too much of the final act. Also, the musical score by Alexandre Desplat was great and fits with the tone of the film. The tsunami scene includes one of my favorite tracks.Another strength of the movie was the beautiful camera work. Edwards wants you to feel as if you are right there seeing a monster through your eyes, with his camera movements. I felt like I was into the movie. Also, there was a scene that reminded me of the 9/11 attacks. It was very short and many people missed it, but it is one of my favorite moments in the movie. It was just a plane crashing into a building and it looked quite real. Overall, Godzilla is a slow-burn spectacle with a huge emphasis on human perspective and empathy, very similar to Edwards' previous work ""Monsters"". Despite a few dull characters, it delivers exciting action, stunning camera work and a payoff. (A-)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The trailers just looked so awesome! So today I saw it. Here's what I thought of it. You already know what the plot of this movie is. A giant monster comes to the city and wrecks stuff. And in this adaptation we have Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen. In this movie, Bryan Cranston plays an engineer who has suspicions that the government is hiding stuff. What will he discover? If you're guess is Godzilla, then you are correct! Honestly, I found the story in this movie to be kind of forgettable. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was fine, especially with this source material, but nothing really stood out. Within the story, I mean. With everything else that's a completely different ball park. Let's start with the performances. First off, Bryan Cranston was awesome. You all knew he would be awesome. Even the people that thought the trailer looked stupid probably thought he was going to be awesome. And he is. However, he isn't in the movie very much. It kind of feels like he's shoehorned into the movie so that they could get more people into the theater, but I didn't really mind that much. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the absolute main character in this film (besides Godzilla, of course). He does a pretty good job in this movie. Some people might think his delivery is a little emotionless and dry, but I thought it suited his character well. He's a military soldier who had to fight in some pretty tough wars. He's not going to be all drama filled. The cinematography is impeccable. Everything was shot so well it feels like you're actually there. And that helps the fantastic special effects. Godzilla and the other monsters in this movie just look so awesome. One of the things that I like this movie is that it focuses one the humans. It is about Godzilla, yes, but it follows the journey of the humans. It's like The Walking Dead. Zombies are in the movie, but it's not about the zombies. It's about the people in the show (and no I've never seen The Walking Dead but I really do want to). While this is a good thing, I wish Godzilla was in the movie more. When you seem him he's cool, but I want to see his coolness more. That's my one true negative to this movie. The first two-thirds or so of this movie is build up. It's a little slow, but it's necessary and it works in this movie's favor. And then, when that last third hits, HOLY FREAKING COW! This movie becomes so awesome! It's intense, it's exciting, its action packed, it makes nerds across the world have an orgasm! Who on earth could not think the end of this movie is awesome!?!? The fight scene at the end of this movie that will make so many jaws just drop right to the floor. And mine did a good deal of that fight. Overall, this was a great movie. While I found the story to be forgettable and the lack of Godzilla to be problems, I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you want some intense monster fight scenes, then you need to see this movie. If you couldn't watch the beginning because you thought it was too slow, just wait. I thought this movie was awesome and I can't wait so see it again.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

That is the only real great thing about such a movie. From watching the trailer I had such high expectations, but I was let down. This movie has a budget of $160 million. They put most of that into the special effects and not into the acting, story, etc. The only actor worth mentioning for another great performance but rather brief is from one of the best actors of today, Bryan Cranston. This film is awful and I would not go out of my way to watch it again.

Could have been better with more focus on certain characters, especially the main feature of the movie.--- SPOILER PART --- (stop reading now if you don't want the movie to be SPOILED for you) What the hell is with focusing on the son??? And how dare they kill off Heisenberg so early!!! The trailers misled me into believing that Walter White had so much more to do in the movie. Instead, the best shining actor is killed off so early leaving nothing more than a mediocre actor and actress trying so hard to win empathy from the viewers but ultimately failing in the process. The movie is Godzilla. Instead, you get so much focus on human interactions with each other that Godzilla seemed totally irrelevant to the movie itself. Godzilla's total appearances amount to nothing more than 15 minutes MAX. And these are divided into short glimpses of the actual GODZILLA.You are thrown left, right, and centre focusing on the Rookie Admiral, the Clueless Doctor, the Irrelevant Son and Daughter-in-law of Walter, and all other extras all trying so hard in their own efforts to do something to look busy and occupied, and hogging screen time away from GODZILLA.Ultimately, this movie cannot match up to any of the CG monster fighting movies, or even scenes with monsters in them because of the lack of focus. Pacific Rim makes this movie look amateur; Pacific Rim's trailers promised you monster brawls and followed through with this promise and gave you more than you expected. Godzilla broke its promise to deliver enough of both GODZILLA and Heiseinberg.I must say they did a good job at weaving together the origins of GODZILLA and the MUTOs, but fail to deliver a satisfying monster battle, and even worse, failing to deliver what the movie is titled after.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I don't understand why some people troll on this. Godzilla isn't a hero. He saves humans from the MUTOs and kills hundreds at the same time. He doesn't give a crap about humans. He's an anti-hero like he usually is. Godzilla was awesome in the movie even if he doesn't have enough screen time, but he has the amount of screen time as jaws and the t-Rex from Jurassic Park. This movie is very dark, serious, and atmospheric as the trailers promised, but it wasn't as scary as the trailers looked. I didn't like Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character too much, he was bland and you didn't connect with him. I like it when you connect with the protagonist more than the supporting characters. I also didn't like it when they cut back to Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character in the third act then cut to the monster fight. I don't know why people say the characters are boring, Ford Brody was the only boring character. Dr.Serizawa and Elizabeth Olsen's character are the best characters because you connect with them more. Bryan Cranston was awesome in the first 30 minutes even if he was killed off early. Overall, Godzilla is an awesome summer blockbuster. Even if there aren't enough monster fights, the third act made up for it. This movie goes back to the gritty roots of the original, making Godzilla a force of nature and restoring balance.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Special effects were really well done. The cast was absolutely great, but this didn't feel like it was a monster movie. I came in expecting to see a Godzilla movie. To see monsters fight each other. For some reason the director decided that whenever Godzilla is about to get in a fight it would be better to cut to something else. The first time it happened I was kinda annoyed that they didn't show the fight. The second time it happened it got frustrating. Even the final battle didn't show enough of the monsters fighting. This movie could have been really good had they actually shown the fights. I feel cheated. I came out of the movie not satisfied. If I knew they weren't going to show the fights, then I wouldn't have gone to see the movie in theaters. Too bad really, 'cause the rest of the movie looks great. It's just not a monster movie.The best comparison I can think of is that when you watch a porn movie and just when things are about to get interesting, they show you news or sports clips instead of the action.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was a little disappointed because you barely even saw Godzilla really. there was so much time spent talking about it, and almost seeing it, it was just kind of annoying in the end. when you finally did see Godzilla though it looked great. the effects were pretty good and the destruction was perfect. but I didn't like any of the main actors so much because I didn't believe their performances. oh well.

This film marks yet another attempt at a resurrection of the famed gigantic nuclear lizard. The last go round we saw Ferris Bueller running through a basketball stadium being chased by tiny Godzillas, so the bar has been set nice and low. The 2014 version, directed by Gareth Edwards, has the giant reptile taking a far more traditional shape and role which should thrill old school fans. The CGI is exceptional and the fights are classic old school knock down kaiju style monster battles. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers didn't think that would be good enough to sell this iteration of the movie. Instead, we're subjected to useless, crammed in melodrama from Brian Cranston, Elizabeth Olson and Aaron Taylor-Johnson of Kick-Ass fame who in this movie should be named ""Lt. Coincidence"" and Ken Wantanabe who takes on the role of trying to futilely explain the ridiculous premise of giant monsters fighting each other to modern audiences which just becomes embarrassing after a while. All in all, Godzilla is a good movie but it gets its priorities mixed up on what it should focus on which just makes it AT BEST an OK movie.

A few scenes came close, but overall I went home slightly disappointed the first time I watched it.I watched it for the second time the next day and enjoyed it much more. I could see what the director was doing with it. I still wish we saw a really long battle that didn't cut to humans so often, but I am sure they'll do it in the sequel.The acting was OK, but the human characters were not supposed to be very interesting in my opinion. The two monsters' had depth and character even compared to Godzilla who was pretty laid back the whole time. Though the mutus did look almost generic, kinda like the bugs from starship troopers (which were cool at the time), but I found it easy to get over that.Overall a great film. I really hope for the next film that they create more interesting looking monsters, polish the human contribution, and give us longer awesome fight scenes.

They wanted to add a new twist to the story so added two new monsters and made Godzilla a savior. Thankfully they dint propose to start a cult for worshiping it. Its actually quite funny to watch the Naval carriers cruising alongside the monster and to note that neither the monster gives a heed to them nor navy is slightly worried about the chance of the monster sinking them to the bottom of the ocean. The movie is riddled with such scenes. I sat to watch this movie, actually without doing much research blindly hoping that it would be good and that turned out to be a mistake.

There were quite a few very good scenes in the movie that had you on the edge of your seat but overall I feel that after a hour this became slightly dull; I also thing it wasn't put together as well as it could have been but needless to say it is a very good movie, it just needed a bit of tidying up.

It really has been 2014's most divisive film yet and I wanted to be sure of my original opinion (You can't say I'm not fair!) But, despite a bit more forgiveness this time, I still find it to be a poorly executed film.Doctor Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) has been following an ancient parasitic organism and tracked it down to a nuclear plant explosion in Japan. He finds one of the physicists there to have information he needs on the creature (known as a MUTO) but as the creature hatches and causes global destruction, Serizawa believes the military is not enough... and that an equally ancient creature is their only hope...Now I'd like to stress, first and foremost this is not a bad film, it is simply very easy and very necessary to view the many problems it has. I like the film's audacity: in a time were big monster/robot movies are light or popcorn munching flicks (Transformers, Pacific Rim etc) this Godzilla attempts to merge what is a very rich legacy of films. On the one hand, we have the original 1954 film, for its time it is an edgy, morose and compelling blockbuster, but on the other hand we have the ridiculous and often laughed at monster battle movies that Toho Studios are famous for. Here, Gareth Edwards appears to be wanting both. An atmospheric, realistic (and almost philosophical) monster battle movie. We don't just get Godzilla, we have other monsters for him to fight, as well as human interests to follow! That is a big ask, for a film just two hours long, and I do respect the attempt.The film looks great; there are some proper moments that are very cool and give a great sense of awe and enormity (Godzilla is staggeringly huge in this rendition) the marine ""halo jump"" scene is an intense sequence. I like the monsters as well, both traditional and new. The music too, upon the second viewing, is great! Going from low, trembling fear to bombastic chaos in a heartbeat. Ken Watanabe is also good in the film, giving a sense of origin to this otherwise all-American story.But... (and it is a big, Godzilla-sized but) the storytelling, premise, motivations and character arcs are absolute garbage. I honestly have trouble understanding people saying this has better character motivation and emotion than say the aforementioned Pacific Rim or Transformers. This film is choked with some of the most unnecessary clichés of any typical blockbuster. ""Oh no, mass destruction of a major city, BUT WILL THE DOG SURVIVE!?"" There are some terrible oversights in logic also, making the military depicted appear completely incapable of rational thought, while the characters themselves work off an asinine script (something Gareth Edwards ""claim to fame"" Monsters also suffered from, a terrible script) All of this makes the human subplot, or should I say main plot, appear confused and redundant. Ugh, to stop a rant from developing again I will move on.Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad features heavily in the film's trailers, yet his part has almost zero bearing on the film's story. Don't believe me? Watch it again. You could cut him out from the story completely. He should have been the focus of the film; he gave the most impassioned performance, but no, we follow instead his son, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford, a cardboard soldier who is forever under the feet of these monsters regardless of which country he's in. I know Aaron Taylor can act, I liked Kick-Ass, but here both the script (and mostly likely the director) gave him nothing to work with. A cynic could say, and I do, that Bryan Cranston's involvement was merely to boost ticket sales.It is a difficult film to like; I can see a lot of it working (a sequel as a lot of potential for improvement) but it becomes so frustrating over time and two hours starts to stretch on for eternity. The monster fights climax wonderfully, but with literally one hundred minutes of build up, either of teeth-grindingly tedious character fluff, or continuously teasing grand battles with merciless edits and cut-aways (dare I say this is as bad as Cloverfield) the entire experience becomes a frustrating endurance.I don't see why we needed a first act that is nearly pointless. Cranston's character could have been cut and replaced with more of Ken Watanabe's character giving Godzilla (you know, the titular character!) an actual backstory. We have an audience who believes the Roland Emmerich 1998 Godzilla is ""the original""! That is blasphemous; Japan and Toho actively distance themselves from that film. This was the opportunity to tell western audiences about Godzilla... and the film fails to do that.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Story, visual effects and all-round feel of the movie have improved drastically since the 1998 version, but still fans aren't happy?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3020002/?ref_=tt_urv","OlieRendch","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28985407/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2014","When I first heard they were remaking Godzilla I thought to myself that the Roland Emmerich one wasn't too bad and that there were better films to be made. Of course I was using memories from my childhood sitting on the sofa watching a huge dinosaur-thing smashing around New York. Come to 2014 though and through various leaks, posters, announcements etc. I'm starting to get into the Zilla mood, and then one day I saw the teaser trailer. The best trailer I've ever sen in my life. That brought me on board for definite. So after seeing the movie and hearing how divided the fans are I was a tad disappointed, not by the movie, just how many didn't like it. To me this new Godzilla was a very atmospheric movie, the feel of it can sometimes send shivers down your spine, the sounds it creates and the music by far make it what it is. The film also grounds itself into realism too, don't go in expecting Pacific Rim, this is very different regarding execution, it doesn't show Godzilla every five minutes, it focuses a lot on the human story, almost as if the giant destructive forces of nature now appearing were like a back-drop. That I think that is where it lost a lot of its fans; I myself thought it was interesting way to go and didn't mind it. Don't get me wrong you do see full shots of Godzilla and what he does which are some of the best scenes in cinema, the CGI is barley worth mentioning as of course it's going to be fantastic. As a film critic though I do have to share my negative points and that was that one or two times there are instances where unrealistic things happen concerning locating a massive creature (or lack of) which do take you out of the movie. Other than that and what I would say quite an abrupt ending Godzilla 2014 was time well spent.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The supposed main character Godzilla made a brief cameo fighting a pair of insect-alien like monsters at the end of the movie but is not enough to save ""Godzilla"" for being a blockbuster that delivers something different from a big budget Godzilla movie. The main character is a obvious superhero marine called Brody ( a citation from jaws) that is handsome and brave just like every others marines and he has not even a sidekick, except for a Japanese children that he saves, like spider-man. And the other thing..those giant monsters are weightless,they come closer like ninjas,they don't shake the ground even if they weight thousands of tonnes,they don't smell, and appears in front of you like magic.

Direction: Don't know what he wants to show us. Definitely i couldn't see anything in theater. I recommend director to remake this movie with some ""LIGHTS ON"". If he cannot make high resolution graphics, he shouldn't have started the project. I felt director has played a practical joke on public.4.

If you loved Godzilla version of 1998, then this Godzilla will tell you loved a fake Godzilla. In this 2014 version, Godzilla returns in its pure ancient form where he is quite distant in size and behavior from lost race of dinosaurs. This movie works because it's a sincere cocktail of monstrous beasts, their fights, illusion of humans that they can control the nature, heroism of Godzilla, right amount of suspense, drama and emotional connect through well etched characters. First half is a bit slow, takes its time to create the felling of danger but second half makes sure that you do not blink your eyes otherwise you can miss the finest CGI effects done for a monster movie. The noisy roar mixed with emotionless eyes of Godzilla helps establishing Godzilla as the ruthless hunter. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Godzilla. If you are already fan of this monster then you can't afford to miss it. If you are first timer then you would end up being a fan.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This time around, director Gareth Edwards took all the best aspects of his 2010 indie Monsters and a healthy respect for the original Godzilla films to create what is easily this generation's Jurassic Park. In fact, the first quarter of the film was incredibly reminiscent of the opening of Michael Crichton's book, which focused heavily on several characters trying to figure out where these strange, unidentifiable creatures were coming from.Unlike Emmerich's ode to Michael Bay-stylized vapidness, Edwards managed to pack a surprising amount of soul into a movie about prehistoric monsters using skyscrapers to beat the crap out of each other. While Emmerich's version had a cast full of talented actors, the writing was so god-awful that there wasn't much for the cast to do but stand there and look surprised as New York was leveled. This time around, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Johnson, Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, and Elizabeth Olsen have a well-crafted script to work off of, which makes the film all that much stronger because the audience has the chance to actually care about the people whose world is literally being rocked.With an actual plot, fully-realized characters, and a never-ending sense of tension throughout, Godzilla is the best in its genre since 2008's excellent (but polarizing) Cloverfield.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I saw it at the movies and it was awesome. But after seeing the 2014 version, I realize now how much that other one really sucked.This movie goes further than just paying homage to the originally Giant monster. It's almost works as a reboot or even a sequel to the classic monster franchise. With CGI they manage to make the monster look similar to the guy in the monster suit, but at the same time showed animal movements. They gave us the best of both worlds.After now 60 years, it's hard for anyone to be frighten of the greatest monster hero ever, yet the filmmakers managed to show how Terrifying being so low on the food chain can be. They did this by exploiting a world post 9/11. It's not hard for any one of us to imagine what it's like for a city to be devastated suddenly by an unknown menace, than your fears to be escalated when you realize what it is. Godzilla was not treated like a cartoon like they did in 98, people died in this flick attempting to battle the forces of nature. Lucky we have the troops to save us.Aaron Taylor-Johnson really Kicked-Ass (who got that?) as the human protagonist whose story we follow through the movie. Still rippling with the guns he developed playing a super hero, he was a good combination of action and emotions as a soldier more interested with reuniting with his family, after a long stretch in the service, than battling a monster, but a soldier's got to do what a soldier's got to do. The movie has two crazed scientist in Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe who interesting enough, role in the movie was similar to that of Raymond Burr in the American English dub of the original film. I do wish that Elisabeth Olsen's role in the movie as a nurse and soldier's wife was a little better as I've become a fan of hers.The movie also had an interesting surprise that I was not expecting so I will not be the one to say just in case you don't know, but like I said, the film acts more like a sequel than an adaptation.First Pacific Rim and now Godzilla. The Giant monster is smashing and bashing it's way back into movie screens with a vengeance. Go see it in IMAX.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's the first 'Godzilla' film in ten years (following 2004's 'GODZILLA: FINAL WARS', which marked the character's 50th anniversary) and only the second 'Godzilla' movie filmed entirely by an American studio (following director Roland Emmerich's 1998 remake). It was directed by Gareth Edwards (who previously directed and wrote the 2010 ultra-low-budget monster flick 'MONSTERS') and written by Max Borenstein and David Callaham (co-writer of 'THE EXPENDABLES'); three other film writers did rewrites but were uncredited (David S. Goyer, Drew Pearce and Frank Darabont). The movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche and David Strathairn. It's another origins tale and it also has Godzilla taking on other gigantic creatures. The visuals are great and the kaiju fight scenes are spectacular but the film as a whole is disappointing and mostly a bore! The story begins in 1999 when two scientists, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Hawkins), discover two pods in the Philippines (one of which has hatched). We then meet a nuclear physicist, named Joe Brody (Cranston), and his wife Sandra (Binoche), a nuclear regulations consultant, who work at the Janjira Nuclear Plant (near Tokyo). The plant has a meltdown, which kills Sandra, and the disaster is witnessed by their son Ford (CJ Adams) from his school nearby. Everyone in the area is evacuated, while it's quarantined, and fifteen years go by with Joe obsessing over what caused the meltdown. Ford (now played by Taylor-Johnson) is a lieutenant in the United States Navy (and bomb disposal expert). He also now has a wife (Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde) of his own. Joe is constantly being arrested, for investigating his conspiracy theories, and Ford travels to Japan to help him. Once there he reluctantly returns to his old home, with his father, where the two discover a government cover-up (proving Joe was right). They meet Dr. Serizawa and learn that giant monsters (which feed on radiation) have been wrecking havoc all over the world (for many years). A Muto (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) is currently on the loose and Serizawa believes that a monster he's been studying for years, called Godzilla, is the only thing that can stop it.Monster movie fans often say these movies would be better without any humans in them; I usually disagree but in this case I'd say they're right. None of the people are likable in this film, except for Dr. Serizawa (he has all the best lines and Watanabe gives the only decent performance). Cranston overacts, Taylor-Johnson underacts and everyone else seems almost nonexistent. If you cut all the humans out of the movie it would only be like 25 to 30 minutes long though and having an entire feature length film full of just monsters fighting would be pretty boring as well. The visuals are cool but the tease of never fully showing the fights (or monsters) in their entirety, until the end, really doesn't work. It works in movies like 'MONSTERS' and 'CLOVERFIELD' because in those films the humans are interesting and fun to watch; this is just way too dry, overly long and slowly paced. I think Edwards is a talented director but with all those experienced writers you should be able to expect a much better film than this (a twelve-year-old seriously could have wrote it)! The fight scenes are cool though and the ending is a blast; it's great seeing Godzilla on the big screen and it is better than Emmerich's version. It doesn't even come close to the best monster flicks though (and I'm a huge monster movie fan); Peter Jackson's 'KING KONG' remake and Guillermo del Toro's 'PACIFIC RIM' (from last year) are so much better than this. Del Toro wants to do a crossover though (of this and 'PACIFIC RIM'); now that would be really cool!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PJuAEBeRQ","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

We poke and push its being, but rather than no longer suffering our presence, it simply paws and kills us in reflex like something insignificant. We're nothing to a bear, a komodo dragon, an eagle, or even a Godzilla.But we are something to each other, especially where family is concerned. Unfortunately for Ford Brody, tragedy and estrangement strike his family at a young age. Emotionally drained from his past and military life, glimmers of happiness and spots of denial cross his face during intimate moments with his own family. But as estrangement leaves, responsibility follows. It's the last time Ford's emotions truly take over, as he steels himself to face the monsters of his past, protecting his family and humanity alike.His wife and son, Elle and Sam, are unfortunately blank slates. Believable in personality, acting as any family would, but frivolous beyond their roles as the people Ford MUST keep safe. Joining Ford is the level-headed Admiral Stenz, someone willing to go to any lengths to stop the monsters, but guilty enough to know what those lengths might entail. And joining Stenz is Serizawa, a half scientist, half cultist, and all enigmatic person studying the monsters on the loose.The film is shy about letting any of its characters express their inner psyche, but this isn't about who they are on the inside. It's about who they are on the outside, on their actions, realistic responses to the monsters running amok from Japan to America. There's little in the way of jokes from them, being black humor at most, before the faces of Ford and his men tremble in disciplined fear as they're often too close for comfort with the monsters.And even when anyone is far away from the monsters, the effects of their presence still shows. Sometimes the ocean sweeps in their wake, other times it's like a solar flare or earthquake invaded whatever city they strolled through. They don't have it out for humanity; they are simply animals awoken, doing their own thing, but with a nuclear-age sentience that makes them as identifiable as any of the people in this film.Oops, I went from a casual look at the monsters but it magnified into a metaphor for nature's wrath. To the say the film represents nature getting back at us for not fixing climate change would be an exaggeration though. SomeTIMEs there's deeper meaning, but it's otherwise simply a story of how people would react to giant monsters mucking about. And unlike the deeper aspects of its human cast, the film isn't shy about showing the beautifully crafted destruction that increases in scale and frequency as the story goes on.Nor is it shy with its soundtrack. The opening sequence is a throwback to monster films of old, but composed with enough care to make this noticeable as a modern piece. This, and the rest of the music, is fully realized orchestra that creates a memorable soundtrack and unforgettable tone for the film. And of course, the blood-curdling roar from Godzilla is never short on its unnerving dissonance, while the other monsters cries are understated but demand all the more attention for it.But since I mentioned 'attention,' that brings me to something crucial I need to mention.Godzilla isn't fast-food entertainment. It takes the time to realize its human characters, but they're far from being the most complex around. The story is rich on how they deal with the monsters' presence, but poor on keeping an impatient viewer hooked because of its punishingly slow pace. There's action, but people deceived into believing this is just an action film can be disappointed.Enjoying Godzilla requires an ability to ignore smaller aspects individually, as the film is more than the sum of its parts. More than the human drama anchoring it. More than the monsters running amok. More than 100 meters tall, rising from the depths, is a monstrous star ready to show the world he's still got it. He shows his Hollywood age at 60 years, but Godzilla still proves to be King of the Monsters.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed his film ""Monsters"", but wouldn't have picked him to direct a high action Monster flick based off of that film. But I ended up very pleased with Edwards' take on Godzilla.From the look of the trailer I was worried this would end up being a disaster movie instead of a monster movie. By that I mean I felt there was a possibility this would be more ""Day After Tomorrow"" than ""Destroy All Monsters"". But my worries quickly went away once I saw Godzilla in action. The film does a good job of modernizing him but capturing his classic essence at the same time. All in all I really enjoyed ""Godzilla"". It had a interesting enough story and it was packed with monster action. Don't expect a masterpiece, but if you are looking for some monster fun this is perfect. 8/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even though I don't usually love monster movies, this one kept me hooked even after a somewhat normal 20 minutes. From then on, I really got into it and ended up having a wonderful time. It comes to me as a surprise why so many people disliked it, but I guess to which his own.While there are some subplots, the main focus of the film is on Aaron Taylor Johnson's character Ford Brody, as he will be brought up against all sorts of chaos stirred up by the monsters. As for the title character itself, he will act more like an anti-hero, serving as an assistance against the true baddies the MUTO's. I personally didn't hate the main story line, even though it wasn't the most interesting thing ever. It was at most okay, not terrible. Getting to the good stuff however, the movie lives up to its summer blockbuster status as it offers great action sequences that don't give you too much at once, but rather a visual treat of destruction.Maybe it will become a guilty pleasure of mine, but for now I firmly state that this movie was ,quite frankly, awesome. Sure the story isn't the most engaging, yet for me it was a great background for what I wanted to see and that was the spectacular effects and fights. If that's your thing, then I strongly recommend it.Rating: 8,5/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

All the below is true: well, I was disappointed. If you want to live a great movie experience, don't go see it, whatever large screen and good sound : you won't be astonished. The plot is so bad. Indeed, CGI & sound effects are truly amazing, and ""massive"" (that is the good word), and no one will argue on that. Furthermore, all these shots featuring visual and sound effects are very well done by Gareth Edwards, however most of audiences were tired of hearing autobots sound or pacific rim. Yes, some will complain about his screen time, because they expected to see something similar to Godzilla 1, but no, it is never like it! Edwards had the opportunity to put in place his own directing, and even though some parts of the movie are slowing it down (thinking about classic blockbusters scenes introducing a conventional plot or military quarters scenes), the movie remains original, epic, and boring since humans are not really our heroes on this one.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Do they really think it will give more suspense to their crippled plots and non-existent intrigues? Or is it just to save money on props, make-up and SFX? The usual result, like in the new Godzilla, is totally unwatchable, with bits and pieces of misguided action badly glued together by stretches of some dark matter (probably filmmakers' brains). The team seems to be proud of the fact that Godzilla is actually shown for only ten minutes in this over-two-hours-long movie, but there's nothing to be proud of. Let's be honest, in monster movies we want to see monsters, not your cardboard characters' contorted faces. They also seem to take some pride in the fact that their monsters are more realistic than the original ones (someone from Toho saw him in the 1950s and ran back to the studio to make a movie about the creature and was trying their best to remember and draw it - I quote the trivia here). Come on. The man in his ridiculous rubber suit was far more terrifying than your digital creations that move like Lego transformers (and sound like ones, too). You sensed real madness and terror there.To boot, the music is toxically bad. I really don't know how they still hire notorious M. Desplat to do soundtracks, honestly. After watching it, my wife and I thought about writing a manual on how to make your own Godzilla movie at home. First, you have to crawl into some dark space with creepy acoustics, like into the cabinet under your kitchen sink. You have to have two graphic novels with you (different, preferably no relation to each other), a flashlight, and a small but resilient dog (or cat). Tie the flashlight to the dog (or cat). Turn it on. Start reading your graphic novels to each other at the top of your voices, showing panels to each other with no regard to their continuity, while kicking your dog (or cat) around the insides of the place with creepy acoustics you're in. It won't let the animal fall asleep and provide you with desired lighting effects. Don't hurt the animal, you'll need it for the sequel or the next franchise reboot.The result will be the same, the radio show ""Dinosaurs in a Tunnel.""","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Humanity's last hope rests on Godzilla, who seems to do more damage than good, but nevertheless saves the day...more or less.

"8","/10","An exercise in rousing action and style","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3018676/?ref_=tt_urv","StevePulaski","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23483288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2014","Gareth Edwards' Godzilla is the only Godzilla film I have ever seen, leaving me nothing to compare this new adaptation to whatsoever. My knowledge of Godzilla movies is similar to my knowledge on the Rocky sequels, none of which I've seen; I can tell you a number of the villains and some of the plot-points but nothing so much as a description as to why each film deserves to exist. What I can say is that the latest installment in the hulking monster's filmography is a marginally successful spectacle of special effects and impending doom, featuring a great array of strong actors and slowburn action.The story opens in Japan by showing two egg-shaped objects, one of which hatched and subsequently entering the sea. Nearby, a nuclear plant starts experiencing rapidly growing seismic activity, with the nuclear plant's supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) running out of options as the plant eventually works its way into an all-out nuclear meltdown. In the midst of the meltdown, Joe's wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) dies inside, and the entire area surrounding the nuclear plant is quarantined and labeled uninhabitable.Fifteen years later, we acquaint with Joe's older son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is an explosive ordinance disposal officer in the Navy, living with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and kid. Ford and Joe reconnect in Japan, where Joe is hellbent on trying to label what caused the earthquake and the nuclear meltdown of Japan. As we know, there can only be one real explanation and that's the presence of a gigantic, lizard monstrosity by the name of Godzilla.For starters, as a non-Godzilla fan, there is a thought that has been racing through my mind for quite sometime. Traditionally, Godzilla films were characterized by their low budget special effects, cheesy acting, and sometimes hilariously bad plot-points. Isn't cleaning it up to fit the standards of the populous defeating the purpose? Isn't making the film exist on a larger, more polished scale, where action and special effects are all backed up by hundreds of millions of dollars kind of against the film's original blueprints? That's not saying that Godzilla immediately fails, but perhaps it's just the shock of seeing once cheap, rather unremarkable material in terms of aesthetic and look all of a sudden get the extremely expensive upgrade.Nonetheless, the film makes sure to at least have us spend some time with the human characters of the picture before Godzilla is even brought into the picture. We see ample amounts of Cranston and Taylor-Johnson - who gives Godzilla a run for his money in terms of how much screen time he is given - and writer Max Borenstein eases his way into introducing the monster. He may ease a bit too much, in fact, seeing as when we do get to see Godzilla, it's still in glimpses fit for teaser trailers rather than the actual, feature-length product. While Borenstein pleasantly avoids overexposure of his titular character, he manages to keep him a tad too humble and limited, preventing larger, more thought-provoking ideas concerning the character to come through.Aside from the slowburn writing, Gareth Edwards' direction is easy to praise for one particular reason - he keeps things clear and easy to follow in terms of action. Given Godzilla's size and ability, the film could've been a nonstop parade of special effects that captured nothing but the cold tendencies of action filmmaking. Edwards keeps things alive and stylistic, infusing long-shots and large-scale shots that encompass all the action, rather than extreme close-ups that do nothing other than confuse and disorient when edited together.Godzilla also gets additional points for not immediately feeling like a project that exists for the sole purpose of setting up a sequel or a franchise. Films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Prometheus seem to have a difficult time living in the now and dealing with the present, and instead attempt to setup story lines and characters they're not even sure are going to materialize and how. Godzilla manages to stay fixated on the current issues facing its characters rather than looking to set up its third and fourth sequel on its first run.The film will likely appeal to the masses as a piece of rousing action and style; I have no idea what hardened Godzilla fans will make of it. There's fun to be had in the form of style and slowburn drama, for one, and the excitement that comes from seeing Godzilla is something to marvel. As I stated, I was hoping for something to have a bit more fun with itself and utilize a more basic aesthetic. Despite being the grandfather of all monsters, there seems to be something rather interchangeable here. I fear that Godzilla is on track to getting the treatment many superheros, beloved movie characters, and cartoon icons are already getting which is ubiquitous marketing and conventional setups in mainstream motion pictures.Starring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. Directed by: Gareth Edwards.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

So its nothing to do with the quality of the story, or making sense, or anything. They at least all had something; tension, likable characters, over-acting, really rubbish effects, etc. This film simply has nothing. And as its a modern film you'd think they'd update with all the latest military technology, but no. Also the MOTU monsters were pathetic. The only worthwhile acting was Cranston (his usual), but he was hardly in it. I really have no idea why they even thought about making this.

It shows you how off the 1998 version was, even if you liked it. Though this new version is fun to watch and gets a lot right, there still are some bumpy times to be had.Behind the camera calling the shots this time is Gareth Edwards. Four years ago he was responsible for the the small, but very effecting monster film, ""Monsters"". His skills made that film impressive in the sense that he did it with a very small budget. It was a no brainer to have him make the reboot of Godzilla. Here, his monster is more of a supporting character that gets stuck behind some of the most interesting actors in film today. While some of the story works, other parts fall flat to mediocre story telling and overly dramatic parts. In 1999, an event rocked Tokyo causing a fall out at the Nuclear power plant. One of the victims was the wife of Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston. Any qualms about the other actors are put to rest when Cranston is on screen. Even though he has limited screen time he makes the most of it. His character's motivations are crazy but Cranston makes them sincere and real. While the public was convinced by the government that an earthquake was responsible for the fall out, Joe knows something bigger was at play. One of his escapades lands him in jail. In America, specifically San Francisco, Joe's younger and estranged military son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson, is home with his own son and beautiful wife, Elle, played by Elizabeth Olsen. He is called to get his father out of jail. After he gets him out he is then whisked away on another one of his father's crazy missions to uncover the conspiracy that began in 1999. We find out that all the radiation from the nuclear tests have created a pair of monster like creatures named, ""MUTO"" (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). The more radiation that is present, the more they will grow.While these MUTOS have been given a scientific reason for existing, Godzilla is given a more mythological one, even though he has been created the same way. According to two scientists, played by Ken Watanbe and Sally Hawkins, Godzilla is nature's way of fighting back against the forces of mankind. ""The ignorance of man is thinking that we are in control of nature and not the other way around"", remarks Watanbe's character. It is a nice set up for why Godzilla exists in this world. It gives the character a bit of mystery. Edwards decisions on the big green guy are ace. The size and weight of him are perfectly captured. You will believe that Godzilla exists and is walking amongst the frightened citizens. The animation of the beast is absolutely breathtaking. Whenever he is on screen he demands your attention and you will give it to him. Edwards teases battles by cutting away from every one outside the final one at the end of the movie. It is a decision that may irritate some but fascinate others. When the final battle does come, it is worth the price of admission.Of course, the movie can't rely on the title character to do everything. There has to be some human element to the story. While the story, outside of Godzilla isn't as bad as some might say, it is where the movie does feel a bit wobbly. When Cranston leaves, he actually takes some of the energy with him. All the actors are good, but they are given very little to work with. Scientific evidence comes off as mumble jumble at points. Olsen's character is given nothing more than being the concerned wife who cries a lot. This isn't going to be Shakespearean and she does give it her all. This isn't a knock against Olsen because a lesser actress probably would've destroyed the role and brought the movie down. The ending to the film is very overly dramatic and reminded me of something that should have been stuck in the 90's version of the story. What is a nice touch with the film is that before that ending the movie establishes the fact that Godzilla is just doing his own thing. The movie nicely separated the events of the humans and Godzilla. They were just in his way and he was in theirs. You can't fault the film for this extra cheese final minutes though because outside of that it does do pretty okay. Some of the shots Edwards conceives are a joy to watch, especially in a big theater, because of the epic scope of it all. He films some of the action using the first person technique that adds so much to scene that contributes the danger the characters are in during the monster scenes. One breath taking shot, from the trailer, has one of the paratroopers passing Godzilla on the way down to the ground. The dark clouds quickly fade away and we immediately see Godzilla and a MUTO battling, all in the first person perspective. It really brings home the point of how big and powerful both the MUTOS and Godzilla are and how minuscule the humans are against these things. Edwards establishes the atmosphere quite well through the film. These things are scary and powerful, unlike the walking lizard in the '98 version.The action movie has evolved with films like ""The Dark Knight"" where the story and acting are as good as the effects. Though sometimes it is nice just to sit back and watch a well made movie that wants to have fun doing its thing. This is what ""Godzilla"" does. It never reaches the lows of some of the brainless movies that crowd our theaters. Edwards stages action with such an amazing eye that makes it both epic and suspenseful.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

His theory is that the authorities are hiding something, but he doesn't know what.Fifteen years later, his son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) plays a bomb disposal Navy man and finds out that the authorities were hiding monsters, and now they're awake and ready to attack.This movie destroys the ideas of the original film, and I found that to be disturbing. The original Godzilla was a warning against nuclear war, but in this film, nuclear war is kind of besides the point.Mr. Taylor-Johnson and Ms. Olsen don't react well to green screens and to each other. I thought they were both pretty wooden. The special effects were fine, but the story just dragged on without too much action. And the music was bombastic and there was a lot of ""catching"", where the music is aligned to the visuals too much.Don't waste your time on this snooze fest.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Director Gareth Edwards does a great job of bring this movie to life despite some flaws which I'll get into later. The cast did a good job with what they were given. Aaron Taylor Johnson wasn't as bad as I think some critics made him out to be. His performance isn't Oscar worthy but he's alright as the main character Ford Brody. Ken Wanatabe, Elisabeth Olsen, David Straithan, Juliette Binoche, and Bryan Cranston were believable as their characters. Cranston and Binoche roles however are cut rather short. The special effects are incredible. Godzilla himself and the MUTO's felt very real for a film about giant prehistoric creatures that thrived during a time when the Earth was highly radioactive. I think Godzilla was in it just enough. I'd say he gets maybe 20-25 minutes of screen time mostly during the 2nd half and the climax. The build up to Godzilla's appearance was effective and his atomic fire breath is awesome. So was his roar. He makes his first appearance about 45-50 mins into it. I liked the glimpses we got of him before the full reveal at the Hawaii airport scene. Godzilla's look closely resembled his original one with some differences. The Kaiju fights between him and the MUTO's were cool although there could've been a little more of them. Their fierce final showdown at the end was worth the wait. Some of the characters weren't really developed but it's just a minor criticism. There's action scenes throughout to keep you on the edge and entertained. Overall I really enjoyed it a lot more than the Amazing Spider-man 2 so far this year. I recommend it to any looking for a good monster movie to watch that delivers.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Godzilla (2014) washes out the bad taste of Roland Emmerich's very dumb effort as this new version pays respect and homage to the great Japanese series.In the Pacific Ocean since 1954 a multi-national organisation has been hunting a mysterious creature, using nuclear weapons to kill it. In 1999 a mining company make a discovery and awaken a beast which causes a nuclear meltdown in Janjira, Japan. Flash-forward to the present day Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an explosives expert for the American military and is called to Japan when his father Joe (Bryan Cranston) is arrested for exploring the quarantine zone, planning to expose the cover-up of the disaster. But this could lead to humanity facing its greatest threat.Monsters' Gareth Edwards was hired to direct this reboot of the series and it is clear his experience of that film was influential on Godzilla. His sense of world building is shown, particularly the destruction and abandonment of Janjira, the chaos that was caused and large scenes such as a tomb for a mysterious creature. Even small things like the use of TV news in the background as it highlights events internationally. Monsters was a film with impressive special effects for its budget of $500,000 and with Godzilla he has $160 Million: a budget he effectively uses to bring Godzilla to life and showing a global scale. His version of Godzilla plays out a little like what a Monsters prequel could have been.Edwards and his writing team show that they have a great knowledge and respect for the franchise, knowing what works in the series whilst taking the serious approach and accepts the environmental themes of the original 1954 film. As a monster film you get the fun massive creatures trying to beat the hell out of each other and keeping the human drama as civilians look to survive and the military try and fight creatures that treat humans as nothing more than bugs. Fans of the series will notice little Easter Eggs and homage's.At times Godzilla plays like a classic disaster film as the monsters are unstoppable force of nature as ordinary people watch on and the military fight helplessly against destructive creatures. The human drama is just as important as the monsters as they sort out family dramas and fight for survival. Yet at times this element comes off as melodramatic and heavy-handed, despite the actors' best efforts. Godzilla is very much a film about the build-up to the fight between the monsters, allowing us to appreciate the battle, but the drawback is the waiting as we only get glimpses. Even when the monsters are fighting, the military are still in play.Edwards makes a visually impressive film with solid action sequences, particularly at the end and he keeps a brisk pace constantly. The idea of what the monsters feed on makes them an even more potent threat. But other ideas are on the derivative, being used in many other sci-fi films. Examples include the military diving into San Francisco being similar to the wingsuit jump in Transformers: Dark of the Moon and the preventing of monsters having offspring is the same plot point from 1998 version of Godzilla.Godzilla assumes a great cast of actors, Taylor-Johnson, Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and David Strathaim from The Bourne Ultimatum. This would be a cast that any production would be happy to have. Cranston and Watanabe are the guys whose performance is the best and give the most dialogue porn. But Olsen does not get to show off her obvious talents as Ford's wife. Fun fact, this year Taylor-Johnson and Olsen are husband and wife, next year they will be twins in The Avengers: Age of Ultron.The excellent composer Alexandre Desplat supplies a truly unique sounding score, a mostly bombastic piece of music that plays for a large portion of the film. With The Grand Budapest Hotel, Desplat has had a very good year.The 2014 version is respectful to its source material and offers a lot of big monster fun as more major cities get destroyed. It's great to hear that Godzilla roar once again.Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This was a complete waste of 150 million or what ever this movie cost. It should have cost 100,000, just so the director could pay using the U.S. Army equipment and the 4 or 5 people that had dialogue in the movie.I don't understand how people would talk about Godzilla when it's daylight outside, then when you see Godzilla in the next scene,it's raining and fog and total blackness is all over the city . This is cheap movie making . When the movie is over , you left with, who are these people hugging after the city is wrecked ? And why does the camera keeps showing this weird kid who makes the same face throughout the movie, is the kid related or something to Godzilla??I didn't see any fangs or fire coming out his mouth.This was a total waste of a movie and time filmed .

Let them fight.""Godzilla is by far the best film of 2014 in the visual department thanks to some stunning special effects and beautiful cinematography. It is different from last year's Pacific Rim in that you get far less action scenes and much more teases. Some people had a problem with this, but I loved this approach from director Gareth Edwards allowing the tension to slowly build and not making this just one giant battle sequence after another. What didn't work for me in Pacific Rim, worked perfectly for me in Godzilla because I got exactly what I wanted. The human drama might have been weak, but it was enough to engage me and make me care for them as destruction was heading their way. Some may argue that a film about Godzilla should focus on the monster and not just have it on screen for a mere 10 minutes, but I disagree because without seeing him, his presence is felt throughout the film. We may not have gotten the full scale monster that we were expecting at the beginning, but the way Edwards teased the audience by showing just small parts of Godzilla or the path of destruction it left behind was enough to engage me and leave me wanting more. By doing so, Edwards kept the audience engaged and slowly built some memorable and gripping climactic scenes towards the end. It is what other great films like Jaws, Jurassic Park, or even Alien have done, and Edwards inspired by them borrowed those elements and directed a remarkable blockbuster film. If you thought that Godzilla should be on screen for almost the entirety of the film in order for it to be the true star, than you were mistaken because even though it isn't on screen much, its psychological presence is felt throughout the film turning it into the real star. This argument reminded me of Hitchcock's Rebecca which was a film that centered on the title character without ever showing her once on screen, but her presence dominated every single scene just like Godzilla does here. Godzilla's presence is felt throughout the entire movie and that is what distinguishes this film from Roland Emmerich's 1998 version which may have had more monster on screen, but with disastrous results.Ever since Ishiro Honda directed the original 1954 film, Godzilla has remained the king of all monsters in cinema. After an impressive debut in 2010 with his small indie film, Monsters, director Gareth Edwards was given a much bigger monster to work with. With a larger budget and an all-star cast, Edwards had a heavy load on his shoulders, but he delivered. The screenplay co-written by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham may be the weakest link in the film, but it works nonetheless. The film opens by introducing us to Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) who is responsible for the security at a Japanese reactor plant. His wife, Sandra (Juliette Binoche) also works at the plant and their young son, Ford (CJ Adams) studies at a nearby school. Joe has been picking up some strange signals after a series of quakes had affected the region, but his officials refuse to allow him to shut down the plant. What appears to be a big earthquake ends up destroying the plant and Joe is forced to shut it down leaving his wife and hundreds of workers underground contaminated by the nuclear reactor's leak. Fifteen years later we see Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) all grown up returning to San Francisco from his military service to his wife, Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and his young son, Sam (Carson Bolde). Elle receives a call from Japan that night, and it's the police who claim to have arrested Joe for invading private property. Ford has to travel to Japan to bail his father out of jail and convince him to come back home with him, but what they end up discovering there will change their lives forever.I really enjoyed the performance from Bryan Cranston (after the success of Breaking Bad, I don't think there is anyone who doesn't like this guy) and I thought he gave the film a powerful dramatic narrative. Aaron Taylor-Johnson may not have what it takes for the lead role, but he delivered. The best dramatic moments took place during the beginning of the film and they were enough to keep me interested in what was going on. I really thought Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, and Ken Watanabe were all underused. They are all talented actors and should have been given stronger characters, but they all felt like cardboard cutout characters. Watanabe's character especially didn't seem to serve no other purpose in the film than to inform the audience and explain what was going on. The human drama along with the screenplay didn't work as well, but the spectacular visuals and great action scenes carried this film a long way. The score by Alexandre Desplat is also spectacular and helped set the tone of the film. The final 15 minutes of the film are gripping and there are also several memorable scenes like the one that takes place in Hawaii or the HALO parachute jump scene. I'm not one usually blown away by CGI, but this time I was really impressed with Godzilla. This isn't a perfect film, it has many flaws, but it works way better than other recent disaster or monster related films.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

He showed me the trailer of Godzilla: King of the Monsters when it first came. I was so much filled with awe, I decided to watch all the movies in Monsterverse. This was the first one, and the very reason why I got interested in this cinematic universe. I did watch a couple of other Godzilla movies and saw how this is different, since this movie has so many negative reviews compared to them. But turns out this is still good.The thing which struck me about this movie which makes it different from other kaiju movies is what made me like it so much. This movie shows Godzilla from the humans' eye view. Because of this it shows the intensity of Godzilla's movement. You can actually feel his weight every time he walks, runs, growls or uses his atomic breath. Every time he moves dust falls out of his body, which is probably how insects also see us. My favourite scene was the one where some people are in a casino and it is being shown on TV that Godzilla is coming. Suddenly the power goes off and then the roof comes off.The two MUTOs are also way better monsters than the Skullcrawlers or the ones from King of the Monsters. Unlike them, here we get to see exactly what their motivation is and what is at stakes here. They would lay their eggs and populate earth, destroying all the small life. Unlike King Ghidorah or Rodan, there are both male and female MUTOs who can lay millions of eggs which will make their work spread for centuries. This is more in likes to Skullcrawlers except it would be the whole world instead of one island.People here are complaining about how much screen time is given to talking and army instead of the monsters. But this isn't a problem actually. To show such a realistic kaiju movie we would require a boat load of money. The thing is, the showing should not be inconsistent, something which ruined King of the Monsters. When the monster fight is shown, it's shown. It does not cut back to the humans until the fight is finally over. After that Godzilla just wakes up and walks into the sea.Godzilla is a fresh take on something we have seen many times before, except with a different point of view. It's nice to see monsters from a human's eyes. It's like all the fantasies I dreamt of as a kid with extinct animals. I really wish this franchise becomes super successful in the future.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Plus everything seems to be set during the night and when there's loads of smoke/dust so you never really get a good look at the monsters. There are a lot of little things wrong with it but you should be able to look past them.

The main 'character' seems to have had his face frozen before filming, so his only expression is one of bemused disinterest.2) The military can see that guns and bombs have no effect on the monsters, so they continue to attack them with bombs and guns. Once they learn that the Muto has an EMP weapon, they continue to use electrical equipment. In fact...3) Everything the military did was so half assed and poorly researched that I found myself shouting at the TV screen. Special forces making all that noise, and their torches shining all over the place? A HALO jump without proper preparation? An naval OED luitenant with HALO experienceand training? We don't have time to open the casing of the bomb, sowe'll carry it through the city for a couple of miles and put it on a boat. yeah, that will be much faster and not dangerous or stupid at all. Not with that huge monster that feeds on nuclear bombs searching for it after we killed her entire brood.4) The bomb, we are told, makes the one that levelled Hiroshima look like a firecracker, goes off about 2 miles offshore and causes absolutely no damage to anything at all. Either it was a dud, or we have to believe that American engineering, and indeed Americans, are impervious to things like blasts, fireballs, concussion or radiation. Not like those Japanese weaklings. USA! USA!5) When the monsters reach SF, we see Godzilla wade through the water which is just about up to his knees, but then a Muto dives in head first and disappears for a few seconds.6) EMP would have no effect on a petrol or diesel powered engine. It might stop the ignition, but once its running then it is mechanical rather than electrical.7) Have you any idea how heavy a nuclear warhead is? You don't just pick it up and carry it around. But hey, one American soldier saves the world, yet again.8) Godzilla. OK, its hard to make a big monster look real, I understand that, but to make it so flat and unthreatening must take at least as much effort. it remeinded me of the old Chewits advert half the time, the other half I was wondering where he/she was. There is about a minutes worth of Godzilla screen time thats worth watching, the rest he/she is either playing hide and seek with battleships of sneaking through the city, hunting Motus for some reason thats never adequately explained.9) The bomb. Yes, again. That really angered me. When we first see the Motu nest, its about 150 feet down a crater, but the marines just appear at the bottom and somehow manage to appear back at the top a few minutes later despite carrying a live and armed nuclear missile.I could go on and on about flimsy plot lines, the cardboard cut out cliché cast and absurd twists etc, but the whole film would fall apart. This int a creature feature, nor is it a thriller or an action movie. it is entirely fraudulent and deserves to be erased from history. 1/10","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

In this film, Godzilla is matched up against other dangerous creatures that threaten the existence of mankind. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Cranston play father and son who try to get to the bottom of what happened at a power plant roughly 15 years earlier. They uncover something much bigger and deadlier than they imagined. I was incredibly hyped for this movie when I first saw the trailers. The movie looked absolutely incredible and I am sad to say it is not incredible, but it is still a good movie. First, the positives: The tone of the movie was great, very dark, gritty and realistic(for a monster movie). Bryan Cranston was fantastic in the movie and the only character I truly cared about. He displayed his true acting talent and made me actually feel bad for everything that happened to him. Godzilla and the other monsters looked fantastic and incredibly real and menacing. Many people complain that Godzilla is too stocky but I do not believe so. The ending was also very well done and I enjoyed it. The visuals of course were the most impressive part of the movie. Now the negatives: Almost all of the characters displayed no emotion so even when they were in grave danger, I did not really care. If you are going to include 80 minutes of plot on humans in a monster movie, it better keep my attention. But, ""Godzilla"" did not. Also, there was not enough Godzilla in this movie. I understand they did not want to show too much until the epic climax but even five to ten more minutes of fighting would have kept this movie more interesting. So, aside from the poor characters, a somewhat weak script,and hardly any Godzilla, this movie was good and I recommend seeing it,even though it is not perfect. But what movie is?","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The only reason I'm doing this review is to knock this movie's rating down a peg. Hopefully I'll save some poor sole the agony and expense of making the same mistake. If the movie industry is using IMDb user ratings to determine what people want to see, that explains why Hollywood is making so many awful movies nowadays. I'm something of a military buff and a technogeek. The technical flaws in this movie are outstandingly BAD! They must have hired Dianne Feinstein as their technical director. Why did they put smoke flares on the boots of HALO jumpers? Why did they transport nuclear tipped MISSILES by train and boat instead of simply firing the MISSILES? Why did they haul the entire missile instead of just the warhead? Since when did Minuteman Missiles use mechanical detonators the size of a dorm room refrigerator? Military aircraft are shielded against electromagnetic pulses so they can operate near in a nuclear war zone. If a magnetic pulse was strong enough to knock out all of a fighter aircraft's electronics, its highly likely it would have knocked out the ejection seat electronics too! Yet pilots ejected from stricken aircraft.There was nothing SPECIAL about this movie's special effects. The effects were no better than the campy effects used in the old Japanese Godzilla movies. It looked as if the monsters were people in Halloween suites. By the size of Godzilla's derriere, I thought Godzilla was being played by Roseanne Barr.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

There are two other creatures in the film, as well as a few human characters. It's not often I see a film where ""big Hollywood special effects"" as balance with a good, solid, well-told story.

Nearly the first thirty minutes of this focuses on the drama of the father dealing with his wife's death from fifteen years earlier- completely irrelevant to the story. It didn't need to be in the story, it was only there to make the hero (if that's what he could be considered) into a formulaic tragic hero, trying to redeem himself. His daughter-in-law, waiting at home for her husband, was only there to give us a generic hero-must-save-his-family drama. Wholly inept attempts at characterisation. The characters need to be interesting, and add something to the story, rather than become cardboard cut-outs; caricatures instead of characters. The character story in Jaws, for example, tied in perfectly and blended perfectly with the story of the shark, we learned the character's stories, and why they are the best men for the job, as they were hunting the shark. But here, the characters are just stock caricatures laid on top of a supplemental monster/ disaster movie plot. If one is going to do a movie with nothing but caricatures like this, don't take it so seriously, and give the audience its share of cheeseball fun or charm. Ken Watanabe seems like a good actor, and left the most impression on me (most of the rest of the other actors just seemed to be phoning it in) but he has nothing to work with here, and spends most of the film looking like he's in shock, which dulls its effect after a few scenes, and makes it appear as though he is in a trance. The effects were good, the climactic battle was good, but when Godzilla is reduced to a supporting character role, not fully appearing until four fifths of the way into the film, it seems like a waste. I'm not saying that Godzilla should be in every minute of the film , but a 100- minutes long build up to a 15-minutes long battle is too much. By the time the climactic battle began, quite frankly, I was bored, and just didn't care any longer. Gargantuan plot holes, like the US military *not* noticing the HUGE hole blasted into the radioactive dumping grounds, and *not* noticing a 300- tall creature strolling toward the city, further sink this one.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

As my usual readers know, I am not one for the usual summer fare that comes out each year. Superhero films, sequels, prequels, big budget action films with a lot of special effects. None of that is in my range of taste whatsoever. I prefer the fall and winter seasons, because then you have all the award worthy films trying to win Oscars coming out and sure not all of them are always great, but it is a much better selection and they are better films quality wise than what we are subjected to during the summer time. That being said, I was not sure whether or not I would like this new version of Godzilla. It was released during the summer time, had the special effects, 3D glasses and big budget and all the things I usually avoid from a summer movie release. The last time I saw the character Godzilla, on the big screen was Roland Emmerich's 1998 version, which I saw when it came out and I thought it was absolutely terrible and for obvious reasons associated with that, I have never seen it since. A few years ago, The Criterion Collection issued a DVD and Blu Ray release of both the original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla, directed by Ishiro Honda and in the same package also included the 1956 American version directed by Ishiro Honda and Terry O. Morse and starring Raymond Burr. I ended up getting that DVD release and I enjoyed both the Japanese and American versions of the film (while I still did like the Japanese version better). With this new version of Godzilla, I have to say that overall I quite liked it. It was better than I thought it would be, not a masterpiece, but for a film of this kind, quite good and it exceeded my expectations for it. I have read online that a lot of viewers were disappointed with this new version, but for the reasons they did not like it, it seemed like those were a lot of the reasons I did like it. The film while it does have scenes of monsters, destruction and mayhem, did not focus exclusively on this and actually built the story up a fair bit before we are actually even introduced to Godzilla. I liked how it showed how these events occurred and sort of setting the tone and mood for what would come later in the film as well as giving a back story both to the human characters in the film as well as the monsters as well. So for that reason alone, I think a lot of people who just wanted non stop action for their two hours were disappointed because the film actually had a lot more to offer than that, by way of a fairly well developed screenplay and characters. I am not usually a fan of 3D, or the glasses, but I did not find that this version used it in an overwhelming, or self indulgent way as to take away from the story. The 3D really did not play all that big a role in this film and focused more on story and characters instead of the monsters themselves, or the explosions and crumbling buildings and I thought that was the right way to go. The film had a good pace and captured my interest from the beginning and continued to hold it to the end. Also while some of the Godzilla sequels over the years (we might even include the 1998 version in here as well) got very campy and silly, this version played it seriously and got rid of the hokey ness and bad effects and acting of some of the other versions in this 60 year long series. While the acting was not really good, or bad in this new version, I did feel that the performances suited the film and the tone they were trying to go for. We have a lot of good actors in this new version and I would not say they were wasted here, but rather they all came out to do a film like this and probably had fun and now they can all go back to the serious and dramatic roles that we are more accustomed to seeing them in. The effects for the film were impressive, but not too flashy, or in your face either and the action was handled just right, so it seemed believable enough without getting too ridiculous, or far fetched with it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself during this film and overall I was entertained which is the job of a film like this. Would I buy it? No. Would, I see it again someday? Maybe. As it stands it works exceedingly well as a summer popcorn film that actually has more to offer on the table than your usual summer blockbusters and has more of a thinking person's mentality to the film and giving it a certain edge of seriousness and taking away all camp and silliness. The film was more about story than explosions, or action and that is one of my main compliments for the film and while it may turn some viewers off I know it will win over more, including people in my camp and stance for these kind of films as well.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Bryan Cranston's character seemed to be developing into the brains behind mankind's ability to survive the unthinkable. That disappointingly fizzled into nothingness. The ONE thing he discovered was not something the scientific minds that had been studying the situation for umpteen years could figure out on their own???! What?? Ken Watanabe spent the entire film looking bewildered, shocked, and/or confused. His assistant was even more useless. Then our leading man, the hero...I'm still trying to figure out what he did and what made him worth following around for near two hours. In a Godzilla movie, I mean. He did ONE really cool, smart thing...that had no effect on the overall monster problem. The rest of the time he was just as confused and helpless as everyone else. He was an upstanding serviceman and I would never count a real man of that stature any less than a hero. But in a Godzilla movie what about him made him worth filming more than any of the other military officers fighting to save humanity?? I got sick of watching Godzilla swim! After the first TWO times-dope as it was, they overdid that mess. They didn't even properly insert Godzilla into the story. They talked about him and then he just showed up swimming. We didn't get to the fun until the very end. And the stuff leading up to it was not worth while. NO COMIC RELIEF!! NONE! It was so dry, I started to get cottonmouth! I actually remember a moment in my mind thinking, ""my goodness, I'm bored. Am I...surely there must be something wrong with me. Am I in a bad mood? It can't be the movie's fault. Surely not."" But alas, it was. I had little expectations, but I expected to enjoy myself in some kind of way. This script was so unoriginal and lacking I started fantasizing much better lines and performances characters could have delivered in real time. It's as if they copy and pasted a few Hollywood clichés because they needed to kill time so that they could get away with spending all their resources and efforts on graphics. That might explain the lengthy list of virtually unrecognizable cast members. They even killed of one of their top billers 20 minutes in. Cheaper cast makes way for more expensive graphics I guess. They put no thought at all into this billion dollar prank, while somehow over-thinking it. The story about the monster issue was all they needed and that would have probably produced a better film!!The good about this film: There was little to no profanity. I can't even recall if there was any. There was no sexual content. Like...none. I was extremely impressed. There was a short moment shared between a husband and wife and, where Hollywood has conditioned me to expect it, the over-indulged sexuality did not follow. Lastly, the graphics were excellent.All the same, I've never watched a movie with so many anticlimactic sub-stories. It really had some great moments visually, a couple action-oriented sequences were great. But man...oh man...somehow they managed to bore me. And I don't bore easily. They should get some kind of awards for that...boring me in a Godzilla film with Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe takes some actual skill, I think.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I also found it fascinating how the American army turns up and takes over a Japanese nuclear plant claiming this was now an International incident, what about the rest of the world, UN, British Army/navy, are they not concerned?

As a matter of fact, since the plot for the monsters was actually good, I sat there thinking that it could have been good if there was no human plot at all. It also didn't help that the Cranston family's last name was Brody. If you're gonna draw attention to that monster movie, you'd better deliver.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"8","/10","""Godzilla"" Movie Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3063354/?ref_=tt_urv","ILoveFilm1998","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37971346/?ref_=tt_urv","5 August 2014","""Godzilla"" is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is set in the present day, fifteen years after the unearthing of two chrysalises in a mine in the Philippines. From the pods come two giant radiation-eating creatures, known as ""MUTOs"", which cause great damage in Japan, Hawaii and the western United States. Their awakening also stirs a much larger, destructive, ancient alpha predator known as Godzilla, whose existence has been kept secret by the U.S. government since 1954. It stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston.First off, let's address the elephant in the room. Godzilla lack of screen time, and having more focus on the human characters rather the titular character. Personally, I'm rather fond of this decision. I appreciate that the film wanted to build tension, and have the audience wanting for those glorious monster fights. It's not often that I see from most modern blockbusters, to actually build anticipation and value subtlety over shoving special effects down people's throats.Now for those that was wanting more, I can understand where you are coming. Would of it be nice if the movie have more awesome monster fights? Of course! However, I think Gareth Edwards made the smart choice of not going all out on the first round. If that was the case, the sequels would have trouble to be able to top themselves without being too silly, and I certainly don't want to see silly in Godzilla again. When compare to ""Pacific Rim"", a movie that embraces and indulges in the fun goofiness potential of giant monster battles, and that is awesome. However, this film was going for a gritty and realistic route. Being restrained with it's monster presentation, and making the climax all the more memorable.The cast is great, with Byran Cranston, Ken Watanable, and David Strathairn, and Elizabeth Olsen. However, it's time to address the second elephant in the room. Aaron Taylor-Johnson performance. And to be honest again, I actually like his performance and the character of Ford Bordy. It because I'm been starved of noble, brave and just overall good heroes in my movies of late. While not the most compelling character in the film, Taylor-Johnson does show human emotion in his performance, and I was rooting for him to get back to his family. However I agree that Bryan Cranston character is a lot more tragic and interesting, and Ken Watanable role, while interesting, needed more depth. They are great in the film, but they feel a little bit sidelined too much.From the technical side of ""Godzilla"", they are absolutely fantastic. Not just the CGI, but Gareth Edwards directs the movie extremely well, with shots that are breathtaking. At points, my mouth dropped. Beautiful to say the least. Edwards style of shooting a film was very unique, and he manages to bring a human perspective on these creatures. Doing that makes the monsters feel huge, and their massive destructive capabilities. I also love how these monsters feel like animals. They're not trying to cause chaos, but trying to survive, which adds to the movie's realistic tone. And the score by Alexandre Desplat is intense and added a lot to the action.Overall, I say ""Godzilla"" was really good. I appreciate the approach to it's monster presentation, which I found refreshing compared to a good number of monster flicks. I like the characters, and the technical aspects were marvelous to say the least. It opens the door to a sequel very well, and I am really looking forward to. I say check it out, but understanding you not going to get ""Pacific Rim"", but a character-driven narrative instead, which is fine with me.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

As a civilization, we are capable of observing phenomena light years away yet barely know what's under our feet. With rather peculiar yet impactful trembles of unknown origin near nuclear reactors in Japan, lives are lost, the region is evacuated and people's lives are turned upside down. This is no simple matter. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) realizes the dismissal of quite disturbing events that are apocalyptic in nature and works extensively to prevent another catastrophe. Being the only individual privy to sensational information (i.e. immediately ominous futures), it's hard to fully convince others you are sane. With the stage set for a man to challenge society's greatest conflict, Godzilla is sure to impress...but it falls short. Whether it's the human-helping Godzilla, cliché reunions or poor dialogue, this film starts strong but deteriorates afterwards. What begins as an interesting scientific investigation results in an effort of the world (Americans more specifically) fighting to restore balance. The build-up of an intriguing inquiry of a man who lost everything ends up in a shallow battle.I must say I was excited watching Godzilla but was sadly disappointed as the movie progressed.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

No one does: Most people didn't see it, and those that did left sorely disappointed. All we wanted was big disaster actionis that so much to ask?! Fret no longer, Godzilla is here to fill that monster-sized hole at the theatre, roaring past expectations. Possessing impressive and unique action scenes, gorgeous visuals and compelling humanity, it's a conspiracy theory drama that pumps adrenaline, reminding why Godzilla is such a revered creation. The story is nothing new: humans wake up monster(s), monsters destroy civilization, humans must deal with consequences on macro and micro levels. There are the ubiquitous exposition scenes, a handful of one-dimensional characters, some corny dialogue, and a few too many coincidences. Mostly though, there is an enormous amount of care and skill in every shot. The cinematography is the best of the year so far; beautifully dark and meticulously framed. Moreover, I can't remember the last time a movie was so flourishingly consistent in showing its gigantic scope, never leaving the audience behind, and always placing us smack in the middle of the terror. Nonetheless, within the huge scale, the personal stakes of the characters is present and successful Edwards clearly studied the best of Spielberg in his handling of the monsters and their human counterparts, all the while presenting a truly singular auteur vision. The pacing is patient but not boring, the story is familiar but not ordinary, and Godzilla himself is just plain cool. This is creature-feature movie making at its finest, and will wipe away the tainted memory of the 90's Matthew Broderick Godzillayikes.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Was everyone hoping this new take was going to be to the famous Japanese monster, what ""Batman begins"" was to Batman? Because it really isn't! What a rancid disappointment it actually is. How could they have genuinely messed this up again?! I don't even know where to begin? For starters I should probably ask what the hell is wrong with the ""critics"" that have been praising this disaster for being way better than the 1998 one? Thank God for websites where us normal folk can share our opinions. What exactly about this movie makes up for Ronald Emmerichs widely panned (though it too was bad) 1998 ""Godzilla"" exactly? From all I can see, these new guys have avoided the mistakes that movie made, in favour of ideas that are too obviously bad for even Ronald Emmerich to have made! ""Godzilla 2014"" promised us a Godzilla for the 21st Century. One that would look more like the original, fight other monsters, and even breath his infamously fiery breath! And on top of that a recently rediscovered great actor was hired (Bryan Cranston) to hopefully add some human drama to the proceedings.So, what is this?!! (The Rest of this review contains unavoidable spoilers, that I have to include because I am THAT annoyed with this movie) Not only is Cranston ""disposed off"" early on. Too focus on the dorky adventures of the Wide eyed Mathew Broderick style kid from ""Kick-ass."" But just when I thought that they were making way for the real (giant lizard) star of the movie. HE BARELY FEATURES!!! Yes, there ARE giant monsters here. But I want Godzilla in a Godzilla movie! and I'm sure the fans and a majority of everyone else wants that too! What really makes these huge glaring errors unforgivable in my opinion though, is the way in which this flick blatantly teases its audience into thinking our giant lizard is going to appear/fight these other monstrous beasts time and again, without actually doing it until the very end. Though the special effects are amazing I must agree. This doesn't matter when they're amazing in the wrong places! The one I blame for this Godzilla mess (perhaps too much) is director Gareth Edwards. Hired off the back of the critically praised, though itself, dismally boring ""Monsters."" This guy seems to like leaving what we want from the movie till the last 5 minutes. Well, he's at least done it to me twice now, and I don't wish for him to do it a third time. He's already getting added to my most hated list. Hopefully his success is short lived after this film, and no doubt an M Night Shyamalan style career beckons.Godzilla meanwhile, will no doubt have further adventures following the frankly depressing success of this one. He gets hailed as a hero at the end of the film for trashing the place, so maybe he'll come back and cause some proper destruction next time eh?","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

On the one hand it has some very strong points but on the other it really lacks. First of all it is clear for whom this film was written; mostly for Godzilla fans. And it is very successful at that. We all remember that horrendous remake in 1998 and it is great to see Godzilla as we all want to see him, great, massive, destructive and radioactive (yep he is finally laser-breathing again).However, this movie wasn't just faithful to the original, it was its own story and a surprisingly good one. It is true that the science behind it doesn't make any sense, as many people have complained about, but did anyone expect anything different? Admittedly the plot is at times hard to follow but there only very few potholes or inconsistencies, something rare in such an ambitious movie that wants to take risks but also be taken seriously. Anyway, the storyline is pretty interesting, almost believable and realistic. Another great thing of course is all the visual. We get some great fight scenes, impressive CGI and some simply awesome visual (admit it, you were amazed at the scene where the soldiers were jump out of the plane).Now some of the bad stuff. The acting is quite forgettable. We get a few talented actors but even they fail to deliver. It is clear that they all are two dimensional and there this little to no character development. However, this shouldn't matter because Godzilla is what the movie focuses on, right? Well, it seems that we all agree that there wasn't enough Godzilla in the movie. Instead we are introduced to two new monsters, which even though are pretty cool, are not and should not be our story's focus. Finally, another thing that many people complained about are the fight scenes. The CGI is of course perfect but many say that the fight scenes, and generally the whole movie, are not action packed. I couldn't agree more. The point is, though, that many people expected to see another Pacific rim, while this movie has a completely different point of view on a similar theme. It is more serious and ambitious and tries not to be a simple B list action flick.So, in general, is Godzilla worth watching? I think it certainly is. Even though it has some weaknesses it is still a great film, depending of course on what you are watching it for. It gives as an interesting and comprehensive story, some outstanding visual images, suspense and amazing fight scenes. It is the perfect chance to relive the original Godzilla (modernised and improved) or simply be appropriately introduced to the ""Godzilla-world"" (without that awful 1998 version).","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Also, watch out for Godzilla's expressions! His disgust and anger at the MUTO's is evident!On another note, you can also infer a point that nature is way more potent that nuclear weapons.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Director Edwards has implemented the film brilliantly with excellent scientific theories, which requires audiences to pay close attention to conversations, characters development, outstanding CGIs, stunning visual effects which is on par with destruction as per in 2012, as well as powerful scores and cinematography efforts. The film has turned into an entertaining adventure which brings a strong message that human is not intelligent enough to control the nature and creations of God.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Two thumbs up for the entire cast and crew .The plot was awesome .I mean I still can't get over the fact that Godzilla was the good guy . It was not a brainless scifi flick , I mean you get answers. Though I still couldn't understand why the Godzilla attacked the MUTO's . The Godzilla was prodigious . Portentiously designed . Same goes for the MUTO's .The movie was scary , dark , thrilling and gripping .I will give it an 8 because Bryan Cranston dies suddenly and it was not clear what was the relation between the Godzilla and the MUTO's . Rest off course , it is a typical summer blockbuster . GO FOR IT FOLKS !","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The movie doesn't have a complex plot or any real depth to character development but that's perfectly OK because Godzilla takes center stage & he's not just some giant monster that kills everything in his path either, he actually seems to have a heart & cares for mother nature & the human race. In one scene when the Navy were firing upon him at the Golden Gate Bridge he stumbled & grabbed hold of the bridge but knowing that there were people on the bridge he gently let go (as gently something his size can be) so not to harm anyone. To me he's the majestic guardian; so take the time to look into the heart of the iconic giant & you might like what you see. Even though Godzilla didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked I still enjoyed the movie & would recommend seeing it.

I am not sure if I am the only one out there but I just had to speak my mind. To be honest, I went to watch the movie with high expectations (above 7 rating on IMDb does mean something) but I was utterly disappointed. To start with, It is a Godzilla Movie, where, you will not see the beast enough. I mean out of 2 Hours in the cinema we witnessed the beast on the screen for around 20 minutes max...... I mean come on.... I remember looking at my watch in the middle of the movie, may be after 1.5 hours thinking Is it really going to end this way? I mean its about to end and still we didn't see enough of Godzilla?????? The story line was okay, but to witness the action and as it was the most anticipated movie, I just feel rating it above 5.5 will be unfair for the fans who would like to see the massive creature on their cinema screens. I don't want to compare but I remembered Peter Jackson's King Kong that came out in 2005, while I was sitting there, I would like to add that, that movie was something, the details, the clarity was astonishing. I came home placed my Blu-ray in the drive and watched King Kong, while the details flew out of my screen and filled my hunger with its powerful and strong presence. It is really up to you if you still want to go and see it for yourself, I just felt that if I had read something like this before I went to see this movie, I would've saved my money and would've stayed home. I would not recommend it, even if you have nothing playing in your local cinemas, I would ask you to save your money. Rest - this is what I felt. The story too was unsatisfying for me. Take care guys and if I interpreted the movie wrong or if I missed something then I apologize. Take care you all and Happy movie watching :)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then the official trailer came out, it was even better, Bryan did the voice over really well in the trailer. On May 16th 2014, I went to the cinema to see Godzilla, 2 hours later, I felt like it could of been better. My problems with this film is that Godzilla gets 10 minutes and 3 seconds of screen-time in a 2 hour film, the reason for not enough Godzilla because the film focuses on the MUTO monsters too much and Ford Brody, In a film called Godzilla I expected to see Godzilla most of the time then the MUTO creatures, it should be the MUTO that has the less screen-time not Godzilla, it would of been better if the MUTO gets a build up. I would like to point out that when Godzilla arrives it cuts away from Godzilla and goes to a different thing which bothers me a lot, when he roared at the Hawaii airport I was expecting a fight but it cuts to Elizabeth Olsen and her son watching TV, yes we saw a little fight on the TV but it doesn't last that long 12 seconds or more? it doesn't happen once it does it all the time! there's Godzilla *CUTS* it doesn't stop! the first time Godzilla comes around the 55 minute mark we don't see much of him so all this time we've sitting our butts on seats waiting for Godzilla and we don't get a prize for it!?. Arron Tyler Johnson didn't do well as the main character, it would be fine if he was a side character, a main character that is boring and is just there to disarm the nuke. Elizabeth Olsen was the kind of character that is the main character in the city, we follow her instead of a bunch of other people. In fact all characters but Bryan Cranstan didn't do well. The CGI is amazing, there's nothing really wrong about it. I know I'm going on and on about Godzilla but isn't that what we wanted to see? right? I will have to say though that the new Godzilla design is my favorite out of all Godzilla suits. The music is great, it suits the film good. Godzilla's roar was making the speakers in the theater at the max volume, it was making the floor shaking, nice feature there. What I hope for the sequels that Godzilla at least gets 20 minutes of screen time or more and let the other monsters have build ups please? no cutting away from Godzilla, maybe for the other monsters. and better cast. Please please...please respect my opinions and mind yours to, people need to give honest feedback, don't attack the haters just for hating the film, just let them be it please, stop defending the film and put up with it! I also like to point out that you DON'T have to follow the rules of other Godzilla films, its optional choice!!!4/10 - Barely Godzilla action in a film called Godzilla!!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

What do you expect? Its a Godzilla movie with monsters fighting monsters. IMO the effects are great and the story line is what you would expect. Its a little slow at times but you can tell there was some attention to detail in various parts. Is it outlandish? Of course it is, but its Godzilla for heavens sake! Way better then the 1998 version. This Godzilla portrayal is perhaps the best one yet. I was also impressed with the 'Monarch' creature. I'd really like to see them make another one and hope they do. Now if we only had real primeval monsters traveling the world consuming nuclear bombs - no more cold war.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Godzilla 2014 is not what one expects after having seen the 1998 version. Perhaps biased from that movie i must say this one was a surprisingly disappointing story and some acting which i didn't appreciate either.Sure there was action, cgi effects, and the story which one doesn't expect, but i liked it too little. Giants battling each other? Pacific Rim does justice to that.

My history (and love) with this franchise dates all the way back to my childhood, becoming something of a passion, and since I have grown I have come to appreciate what Godzilla and his fellow kaiju stood for, as forces of nature meant to remind humans that we are not as superior a species as we like to think of ourselves. At the same time, the kaiju themselves have demonstrated what it means to be human, showing emotions and character not typically seen in general American monsters. In 1998, Roland Emmerich failed miserably at his attempt to make his creature Zilla pass as the King of the Monsters. For sixteen years we have had to live with this outrage, but now newcomer director Gareth Edwards takes center stage with his re-imagining of Godzilla. It was worth the wait! Plot: In 1999, nuclear physicist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) saw the death of his wife due to a strange tremor in the nuclear plant they worked in. Fifteen years later, Joe realizes that this was no natural disaster and goes looking for answers. He and his distant son Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) soon discover that man's arrogance has unleashed ancient, malevolent beasts called Mutos just as it had decades ago. With everyone's lives at stake, including Ford's wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), the military attempts to contain and eliminate the threat, but Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes only one thing can stop the malevolent Mutos, something just as ancient and equally terrifying. Nature has a power to restore balance and that power is in the form of the giant reptilian monster known as Godzilla. But, is Godzilla a friend or foe to humanity? Who will survive in the war of the monsters? Since ""Godzilla 2000"", I have waited fourteen years to see another Godzilla movie in the theatres and my wish was granted, fan-boy joy and all. Gareth Edwards made sure not only to deliver great kaiju action and special effects, but also a well-written story with compelling human characters and good themes just as the original film ""Gojira"" had done.The human element of this reboot is exceptionally well-done, with notable performances done by Bryan Cranston brilliantly delivering the tragic nature Joe Brody and Ken Watanabe bringing the insightful wisdom of Dr. Serizawa (a fitting reinterpretation of the original character). Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen do alright in their parts as a married couple trying to pull through in helping others at a time of crisis. A few other characters play there parts well enough at different points of the story. I like how some of the humans don't just sit by and do nothing, they really do their best to play their part, particularly Ford Brody.There's some darn good kaiju here as well. Godzilla is presented as he should be, like an angry god who will stop at nothing until his enemies are destroyed and balance restored. There was a great deal of build-up to his grand reveal and when he shows up, it's all worth it. His design was awesome, sticking close to the classic look but updating it for today's standards (take note of this, Emmerich!). Some may question a few design choices here and there, but when one thinks about it they all make biological sense, bringing some realism to a gigantic radioactive dinosaur. Big G's roar was a nice sound effect, loud and pretty scary. Granted, Godzilla should have had more screen-time in the film, but I was at least satisfied. In the other corner, we have the Mutos, who are great additions to Godzilla's rogues gallery. They have a unique design that makes them look quite alien but still having traits that make them seem like real-life animals. Both kaiju are terrifying monsters, but Gareth Edwards made sure that they all have a sense of emotion and character, to which he succeeds, making us fear them but also empathize with them.There are other elements that also make this film great. The suspense in the first half of the film is done almost perfectly, leaving you in anticipation for the arrival of the kaiju and the action in the second half. The music befits the dark tone of the movie, especially the surprisingly-catchy main theme which has a truly foreboding mood. The action scenes are excellent, shot with superb cinematography giving the sense of scale (important for creatures as big as these) and bringing increasingly great thrills. The battles between Godzilla and the Mutos are especially awesome to watch, smashing everything in their path as they brutally tear each other apart like savage animals. All of this is achieved with special effects that would impress even the greatest of filmmakers.With a stellar cast, impressive special effects, spectacular kaiju, ominous music, impressive action scenes, and a few nice themes, Gareth Edwards has created an American reboot that is worthy of the license. Godzilla's creator, Tomoyuki Tanaka, would be so proud. Pacific Rim may have brought back people's interest in the genre, but Godzilla has officially cemented the fact that giant monsters are making a comeback (heck, Gamera is said to be coming back next year). It is SO GREAT to see the King of the Monsters grace the big screen once again and I look forward to seeing him in more. Sure, this movie does have a few flaws, but I would strongly recommend you check this action out.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I managed to make it through the entire film for those concerned (only due to the fact that I had coughed up £10 for the 'pleasure' of doing so). Considering the title of the film is 'Godzilla' you hardly see the terrifying creature. The majority of the movie is clogged up with poor story telling and confusing sub-plots. I found myself questioning whether Godzilla was the hero or the villain? (I think he's meant to be the hero?)All in all the film is misleading by making us movie goers think that this is all about the 'King of Monsters' Godzilla, it's not. It's centered around Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character and his poor one dimensional acting. If I had to compare Godzilla to anything else it would be World of the Worlds. Not because War of the Worlds is a poor film, I actually enjoyed it, it's because of the contrasting stories.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

The result can be a bloated, contrived spectacle with no heart, meaningless plot, or worse still, disappointed audiences and a broken brand. Cinema is littered with example upon example.This isn't that. It's a different beast altogether. It's a spectacle, agreed, but in the most agreeable, exciting, and entertaining way possible. A film that knows what it is, what it wants, and how to get it. Much like the protagonist itself. There is enough heart through the human story delivered by very capable actors to draw audiences in and commit to the world it portrays. And by staying close to believable scenarios set in real locations, it keeps the viewer connected and interested throughout the incredible scenes that unfold.And incredible they are, with benchmark-setting CGI and visual effects, sound that would shake stadiums, and design and rendering of the monstrous creatures and their environments is of the highest order. Coupled with an overall tone that maintains the ominousness of the plot whilst staying true to the origins of Godzilla, you've got a package that speaks on the passion and genuineness of the filmmakers who will no doubt be recognised for this achievement in due time.Gasp, squeal, wonder, then clap. Repeat as necessary.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

They were never dug deeper into a real theme of Godzilla, which is of course, nuclear problems. After all, those films were purely ""kids entertainment"" and was not intended to put terror in there.When we come across the terror of what we have made, Godzilla, is never on our side. You can't forget that.And now this film says it would be ""solid serious"" with ""a little"" change in a plot.""All the nuclear experiments by USA and Soviet were to kill Godzilla""......Really? So now you think you can justify your nuclear problems under the name of ""Godzilla?"" I mean, it was westerners who decided to call him ""Godzilla"" instead of ""Gojira"". Why? I thought they knew better idea of what God is; what Judge is.I can talk about how poor the CGI was and so the camera works etc. But I'd rather get to the conclusion.This is awful remake of ""Gamera"".

After having seen the fantastic Pacific Rim, I didn't know how Godzilla would ever match up. Well, allow me to extend my most humble apologies to the filmmakers. This new film's director, Mr. Gareth Edwards, created a ""monster movie"" with heart. But, this is not merely a monster movie. This is a movie about ordinary everyday people having to deal with the consequences of toying with nature. The cast here is well put together from Bryan Cranston as a determined scientist to David Strathairn as a no-nonsense Navy admiral. What really makes this film shine is the script and director's sense of realism. The musical score works very well here, particularly in the film's creepier moments. My only complaint here would be the film's running time. I wouldn't have minded 10 more minutes! lol. Finally, the monsters.

You might prefer the originals because the cheesy special effects were what made them fun (or because of nostalgia), but this was a good entry in the series. It starts off with a scientist having to shut the door to cut off a nuclear cloud at the expense of his family while investigating some strange ""goings-on"" in the Philipines. 15 years later, his son is in the Navy with a family of his own, and is called to Japan because his father has been arrested, and monsters are being investigated. Of course one of them is Godzilla. Nuclear explosions are to blame, they reach San Fransisco, and epic battles ensue as our hero's family is in danger.I think the monsters' battle scenes are a main highlight, and the vast majority of this film was well done. It could have used some character development, though. I still liked it a lot. You will love it! *** out of ****","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But there was talks about a 40 minute godzilla movie directed by the guy who directed godzilla vs hedorah but nothing very came out of that . But then legendary studio picked up at and then it was announced that we were going to be another American Godzilla movie . Fans where excited to see godzilla coming back and a little nervous because of the last America made a godzilla movie . On may 15 the movie came out well is very split among fans . So people praising it because Bryan Cranston and other people hated it because godzilla was it to much so what do i think about it . Well I really liked the movie it definitely has problems but its was a welcome return to franchise that had been dormant for way to long . Bryan Cranston is amazing in the films and it sucks that he's not in the movie all that much. Brody was fine just your typical hero character .his wife was fine she just worried a lot and that was really it. Dr ishrio serizawa is the second best character in the movie . All the other characters are pretty forgettable .some of the shots in this movie are freaking fantastic they shoot. The monster from low angle which make them fell bigger and powerful . Very similar do what they did in the original film . The music is meh i do wished they used the classic Godzilla theme but they did in Godzilla king of the monsters . The MUTOS are ok they are very similar to the cloverfield monster and they weren't all. That original but it was nice to get some new monsters instead of using the old. Is pretty unfortunate that the MUTOS are the main focus of the film and not godzilla but yet again this isn't the first godzilla movie to do this . Now onto the king of the monster himself GODZILLA he was amazing and easily the best part of the film . This godzilla felt huge and powerful and yes why is was disappointing that it wasn't a guy in suit still was pretty damn awesome . Now people had complained that Godzilla wasn't in the film all that much and that didn't bother me . Invasion of Astro monsters is one of the best godzilla movie and he's in that movie for 5 minutes . The one thing i really hated was the cutting away from godzilla. Whenever godzilla was going to do something awesome they cut away. Despite it's flaws i think this is a good movie and welcome return for the best movie monster of all time hail to the king baby.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a style only the original possessed, until 2014 when Gareth Edwards got ahold of the product. That's why one of the main reasons Godzilla 2014 worked for me, it pays more tribute to the Original 1954 piece more than the others. It could have easily been a Pacific Rim-style beat em up, but it took the risk to not go with that style. (Instead it waited for ""King of the Monsters"" to do that) A G-fan may watch this movie and complain about the lack of action and more anthesis on the characters, and to that I say the original 1954 one had more anthesis on the characters too and, once again, this film is paying tribute to more of that then all the other ones where the action and entertainment is higher. When the monsters fight in this movie though, it is one of the best brawls of all time. It is extremely satisfying and that's why I don't mind the rest of the movie having slow buildup. This film is not only a good monster movie, it is also a great disaster flick.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"2","/10","Great Godzilla movie - NOT","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3108742/?ref_=tt_urv","thegene-2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12886794/?ref_=tt_urv","21 October 2014","I settled in to watch what I expected to be a great movie. AT 71 and a viewer of many Godzilla movies, as I like monster movies and Godzilla is a classic one, I was expecting this one to be even better than the Matthew Broderick one which I like very very much. I have never written a review that I could only find one redeeming thing about it. Until now that is. This movies has but one and only one good thing I can say about it. And that is that it is (a little) better in special effects than the very old Godzilla movies out of Japan. MUSIC–I guess there was music though the movie was so bad that I paid little attention to it as I spent most of my time trying to figure out what was going on. SCENERY–Most of it was showing destroyed major cities. Not all that neat to look at. CONCEPT–My mind kept trying to understand all the totally impossible things that were taking place. I will not spoil the movie for those that want to see it, as there must be some redeeming qualities since it gets over a 6 rating on IMDb, but that sure makes me wonder if maybe there was some built in subliminal messages at the theater showings that told people what they were watching was not all that bad. BASIC STORY–Well, the movie did not explain much of what was going on to help me even to begin to understand the many elements of the story. Without background information and relatable context, much of what went on just seemed like random happenings. ACTING–This was for the most part like reading a line and getting out to go eat. I won't say it is as bad as watching high school kids acting (though some of them are pretty good) but for sure no one is going to win any awards – or even be nominated. To give you an idea of it all, I will just say that one of the main character's spent most of the movie making faces and not talking. He was good at that but I was watching the movie for entertainment and he was not that entertaining. SPECIAL EFFECTS– There was so much wrong here that it almost killed the movie for me. It showed lots of destruction but not the destruction taking place. Thus, the part that made sense was left out, which makes no sense. It looked like in a lot of cases they were trying to put so much into the special effect that it made my mind jumble to the point that if would eventually just shut done when it continued to happen. GODZILLA–This is the main character. Is not the movie called GODZILLA? Maybe the movie should be called MISSING GODZILLA since he was seen very little. It took forever for him to come on scene and when you saw him you almost felt like that they went to the person that designed the original one for the Japanese movies and asked him to do the design. In the rare parts that you could really see him, he looked like a man in a Godzilla suit walking – which is probably what it was. FIGHT SCENES–These were pitiful. I would like to say that they were at least doing a ROPE-A-DOPE, but they would show a few seconds and then cut away to something else and you were not sure what was going on. What they did show was almost pitiful in special effects, and often either too dark to see or too far away or too much background that they blended in and you could not focus on them. I am not against movies that use jumping forward or backward in time (like saying 13 years later or 5 years earlier), but there needs to be a solid tie between the parts. I must have blinked as that sure seemed to be missing for me. There was far too much going on most of the time to be able to understand a lot about what was going on. That destroys a movie for me. Of course I suppose it gets a high rating because there are a lot of people that just like Godzilla . I ended up watching the whole show as I knew I was going to write a review on it and I actually expected it to get better as it went along. It didn't. In all fairness I guess I could watch the movie over and over and probably get more of a sense of what was going on, but that has one glaring problem. And that is that I would have to watch the movie. I gave the movie a 2. One point for being a Godzilla and one point for special effects being better than the original Godzilla. I suppose if this would have been just a monster movie and I had never seen a Godzilla move I would have given it a higher rating, but I don't believe it would be all that much higher. I guess I could compare it to a bunch of the older Godzilla movies and it would get a higher rating as well, but again, I can't see how that be much higher. Maybe that is what they were trying to do. Film one just like in the olden days with the technology available today. Now if that was their goal I would probably give it a lot higher rating, like a 4 maybe. BOTTOM LINE – If you expect to see a modern day Godzilla movie with good modern special effects and a story line that is good, acting that is good, and all the other components that make a movie good, do not waste your time. If you are interested in how not to make a Godzilla move, then your time will not be wasted if you watch it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Aaron Taylor-Johnson who was cast as the lead role did a decent job and wasn't made to be a Prince Charming character and his wife played by Elizabeth Olsen wasn't made to be some princess waiting to be swept off of her feet as she was seen to be pretty much the same as everyone else of the support cast in terms of emotion. Ken Watanabe who was cast as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa again did a decent job of playing his role in the film but his assistant was incredibly over emotional at times in the film at times which it was not needed.When the action happened the cities it happened in the cities were pretty much destroyed (as you would expect) so you would see how powerful the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object) and Godzilla were, not to the point where you were on the edge of your seat not wanting to distracted but to be fair the CGI in the film of them fighting was pretty decent in total.Overall a solid Godzilla film with a nice change of direction of how Godzilla was made not to be the enemy but as an ally.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a monster movie, not a disaster movie!I was actually quite excited when the movie started out in Japan and thought it might be so clever as to have it play there - but sadly it changed and went to US...Godzilla is just a side character, rarely seen in 130minutes the movie mostly focuses on irrelevant rubbish like human side characters (in the most overdone American disaster movie way - looking into the sky with awe waiting for the monster to blow something up..etc), Infantry soldiers preparing to fight the monsters with handguns, or KIDS ...yeey maybe next movie we'll have ""the son of Godzilla"". WHat is it with American movies and kids that never die... wouldn't it be for once a twist that the kid dies and the father/mother goes out for revenge? Change it up Hollywood! Make me actually give a crap!The lead character is completely pointless and the movie would have massively benefited from cutting this guy out (die as kid in the first half) and shifting focus on to the Japanese scientist and the lead characters father (the only characters you actually get to know and care about, a bit)!I watch a Godzilla Movie to be entertained, to laugh at its corniness and not to TRY to root for some random characters I am supposed to feel for but instead wish every second of the movie to die so I can actually see the monsters instead of some forceful rubbish ""human disaster drama""Besides this the military is at its most stupid - beating in its stupidity its predecessors in the classic Godzilla movies, and even the 1998 version...No real plot twists, predictable...The only thing worth watching of this movie is the CGI/Mattepainting and about 5 minutes of monster fights at the end.

"4","/10","Want a good monster movie? Stick with Pacific Rim","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3033228/?ref_=tt_urv","NickMullins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32156266/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2014","First of all I should say that in general I am not a ""monster movie' fan. I watched Pacific Rim and thought it was just ""O.K"". However when I heard who was directing Godzilla I got excited. I have great respect for Gareth Edwards and thought that if anyone could make a good American version of Godzilla; he could. And my excitement only grew after reading the awesome reviews for it. Unfortunately after seeing it in theaters with a few friends I have to say that honestly this is the biggest disappointment in theaters of 2014. Now don't misunderstand me, this movie does have its good parts, but they are out-weighed by the negative parts. I'll go through both the positive and negative parts, but in the end you'll just have to decide for yourself. 1. Story 7/10 OK so I want to be clear that the story is not where this movie goes wrong. Without spoiling, the movie has an enjoyable plot. As far as monster movies go this one isn't particularly stupid. It's not exactly ""Inception"" but its not as basic and straight forward as ""Pacific Rim"". But what made Pacific Rim good was that it didn't take its self seriously, so it was really enjoyable and could be stupid without pretending to be serious and smart. Even though Godzilla isn't completely stupid it takes itself way to seriously. 2. Visuals 7/10 There's nothing really that wrong with the visual effects in this movieI mean they aren't exactly super original, everyone already knows what Godzilla looks like. All the CGI is pretty decent, the monsters attacking Godzilla aren't exactly exciting, but they are passable. The main thing this movie has going for it in the visuals department is the lighting, the lighting, although pretty unrealistic is very cool looking and stylish, so as far as visuals gono big complaints. 3.Acting/Characters 5/10 This is were I start having problems with the movieThe acting and characters. Now Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a good actor, but the character he portrays is your average good looking muscled but rather bland main character. I really wish that the movie had put some effort to having original and enjoyable characters instead of the cliché lead that they chose. The rest of the characters are just as clichéd as the lead the smart scientistthe doctor for a wife the cute kidnone of them particularly good actors, EXCEPT for Bryan Cranston. I expected his character to be forced in just to sell tickets, but I found that he was the strongest both in acting and in character. In the short time that he is on screen you really feel sympathy for him. Another enjoyable character is that of his Bryan Cranston's character's wife, played by Juliette Binoche. Like Cranston, the short time she is on screen she shows a great performance. Unfortunately aside from the two strong performances, the rest of the characters are cliché and disappointing. 4. Directing/Pacing 3/10 Ahh yes, here we go. This is where this movie really falls apart. Its also the most disappointing part of this movie, as I said before, I really liked Gareth Edwards. This movie does start off pretty well, Cranston and Binoche really draw you in. But as soon as the first 20 minutes are up the movie completely falls apart. I think that the main problem is it acts as if no one in the audience knows who Godzilla is or what he looks like. So they seem to be building up to make Godzilla's appearance startling and shocking. If I didn't know anything about Godzilla that would have been fine, but even though I have never seen any of the older original Japanese Godzilla's I still know the story of Godzilla and honestly was rather bored by the constant teasing of the monster for the first two acts. When Godzilla finally does fully appear at the last act I snuggled down into my seat ready for some awesome monster on monster battling. But instead of focusing on the monsters, it focused on the things that the lead character was doing around them. This was definitely the most aggravating thing about the movieas soon as the monsters really started throwing punches the camera would cut away. At one point there seemed to finally be an awesome showdownGodzilla and one of the monsters were running toward each otherGodzilla was about to monster punch it in the face when it CUT TO THE MAIN CHARACTER RUNNING ON THE SIDE WALK. As soon as that happened the whole theater let out a groan, a few jears, and several ""C'mon man!""'s. The ending is just your average action movie endingpredictable and not really interesting at all. 5. Final Evaluation 5/10This movie will definitely make some people happy I'm sure. But it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, so I would suggest just stick with Pacific Rim and don't waste your money.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The rest of the time, we see a lot of soldiers running around, people looking very concerned, and two other monsters, which look almost exactly like the monster from Cloverfield.We hardly see any action, most of the time you just get to see the destruction after and a lot of demolished buildings, and if there IS any action, it is always at night, in the dark and in the rain, so you are constantly trying to figure out what is going on on the screen.Worst of all, the 160.000.000$ Godzilla looks Exactly like a fat guy in a rubber suit.Go see Emmerich's Godzilla, it has at least a lot of action and Godzilla looks cool.....","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

In this film when you see Godzilla, however rare it might be is awe inspiring, the shots of him really make you think, ""Oh god that is absolutely huge"" and its always epic when he is on screen. The acting was mostly great although at times Aaron Taylor Johnson was a bit dull, he portrayed a soldier fairly well, easily the best performance was by Brian Cranston who was so entertaining to watch, in the first few minutes we watch him In a nuclear meltdown in a power plant in Japan. I'm not going to spoil it but that scene is very emotional.

Every remake has been a travesty and a sad attempt at pulling the money out of your pocket.The latest bomb has been Godzilla, a long time kaiju fav of all us in the mid-older age group. Even the 1998 Godzilla was better than this one, at least it was entertaining and had some humor to it. I fell asleep during this train of boredom that never changed tracks...1. How can you make a Godzilla movie that Godzilla (the title monster!!!) has less screen time than lame (and over-used) cockroaches and bad acting? 2. Then you figure in all the dark lighting, dust, and fog. Just so it's cheaper to pay the CGI companies. Seriously!!! If you put the money and effort into making a great kick-ass Kaiju movie you'd get return fans... Look at Pacific Rim! Great Movie, great action, plenty of huge fight scenes. Goal!!! I wouldn't Watch Godzilla 2014 again unless I was taken prisoner, strapped to a chair, and my eyes were taped open.Acting = 4 flat. Nobody even cares what happens to them and generally just get ticked that they are taking scene time.Picture = 4 Would have been better if they put a guy in a big rubber suit and smashed a bunch of cheap miniature buildings (and they would have saved some money).Bottom line. It would have been better to make a cheapo classic Godzilla movie with 1/4 the budget and they would have made more money. THis was just a crap attempt to get old fans in, and try to grab a younger naive crowd. Battleship was better than this movie and that's enough said!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Last year's Pacific Rim was a fun entertaining experience, and this is no different. Something very rare happened at my screening. Everyone was cheering. The only other time that's happened was at the ""Doctor Who"" 50th anniversary movie. The beginning is slow, but by the end of the film, so much awesome stuff has happened that it's forgivable. This film is not cheesy like the originals. It's incredibly well done and I wouldn't be surprised if we got a Pacific Rim/Godzilla crossover. (Make it happen Warner Brothers!) This is a very exciting, fun movie. There are a couple of jump scares however, so if that's not your thing, rent it. For the rest of you however, I highly recommend seeing it in the theater. Just like Pacific Rim, it's a BIG movie, that you have to see on a giant screen. The acting in the movie is somewhat flat, but if you're in it for the monster mayhem, it's easy to forget about the average acting. There are a few unneccessary conversations that drag the plot out, but by the time Godzilla appears, all is forgiven. It's a big monster showdown movie that's incredibly awesome. In summary, Godzilla is a fun time at the movies.

Despite being well cast, the story was rather thin. The characters were not ones I became drawn to, which really just left a film that showcases special effects and action sequences. The actors did their best with an ordinary script and deserve credit for keeping the audiences in their seats. I've not seen Elizabeth Olsen in a film before, but was actually surprisingly impressed with the quality of her acting. The effects were exceptional, though 3D was not a great choice as most of the action scenes were quite dark visually. Ultimately, the amazing effects and good acting could not save a film with an unoriginal story that appears to be from a predictable Hollywood action template. In fact, I think the writer gave up on the story half way through.-----Special effects: 9 / 10 Story: 3 / 10 Acting: 7 / 10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's a human story but just watching him destroy stuff is cool too. I've been watching monarch too and it's fun seeing some connective threads between the show and movies.I've watched this several times before throughout highschool so it felt predictable, I knew what was gonna happen and I was still excited. I did notice Godzilla doesn't feature too much but I think that's mainly due to hearing complaints about it. It never bothered me before and doesn't now, but I get the sentiment. Minus One followed the Godzilla movie formula where he shows up at the start for some action then doesn't show up for a while until big action sequences in the third act. While in this he doesn't show up in the first half.However I thought he had a really good intro, the airport scene- crashes and explosions in the background, a mighty earthshaking footstep as seen from inside the building, the momentous silence before his roar-I still find the experience of witnessing his steps as exhilarating as the first time. Like it's ingrained into my mind. Also, I prefer Hollywood's portrayal of Godzilla's appearance over its Japanese counterparts. The clicks and cries of the other MUTOs were also a detail I particularly enjoyed.Sure the human element in the Hollywood Godzilla movies could be done better, but I don't care man, I just want to see some epic stuff when I walk into these. Bryan Cranston forgetting his birthday reminds me of my dad forgetting his own as well, I think of him every time I see this.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If a Godzilla fan walks up to you and tells you it sucks, because Godzilla isn't in the movie that much and the human story is boring, they're not worth listening to. That's how it goes in almost all of the Japanese movies and no one ever complains about that, so they're just being biased...and they won't admit it.

You might prefer the originals because the cheesy special effects were what made them fun (or because of nostalgia), but this was a good entry in the series. It starts off with a scientist having to shut the door to cut off a nuclear cloud at the expense of his family while investigating some strange ""goings-on"" in the Philipines. 15 years later, his son is in the Navy with a family of his own, and is called to Japan because his father has been arrested, and monsters are being investigated. Of course one of them is Godzilla. Nuclear explosions are to blame, they reach San Fransisco, and epic battles ensue as our hero's family is in danger.I think the monsters' battle scenes are a main highlight, and the vast majority of this film was well done.

It's like the film makers were trying to emulate the old Godzilla movies without realizing that the film makers back then would have liked to show more Godzilla, they just didn't have the budget for it. Hence the cuts.So yeah, the film doesn't exactly deliver like it's supposed to with this kind of budget and expertise. I wouldn't even mind, but we just saw Pacific Rim last summer, a far superior monster film by far. This film spends way too much time following around these soldiers opposing Godzilla and the other monsters, than it does showing us these monsters. I literally had to pick up my jaw a couple of times. So baffling were these focus choices.And yet, it does work, kind of. Because the film starts out phenomenally well. The suspense builds up slowly, the mood and the atmosphere are both bleak, intense and dark, the setting is introduced with care and we actually get some really good characters and character moments. Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody is a great character and I'd have loved for this movie to be solely about him, and perhaps Ken Watanabe. But then we start to focus more on Brody's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Godzilla shows up, turns out to be a big disappointment and it all spirals downhill from there.It's not a bad film. A disappointing one, yes, but it has enough bang for your buck. The first act is great and whenever the actual monsters are on screen, the film immediately picks up in quality. If only they had had the sense to not shy away from the monster, this could have been an excellent movie. Now it's merely average.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yeah, some could say that holding Godzilla back until roughly an hour in was sort of a letdown as well as killing off Brian Cranston(the only actor who seemed to give a **** the entire film) but this film mostly suffered from what I felt like was under-developed characters and over-all a somewhat too ""human centered"" movie. Taylor-Johnson is passable and Olsen is also enjoyable but other than Cranston, Hawkins, Strathairn and Watanabe the movie could have benefited from a better lead actor who could take command of the screen while not feeling like such an emotionless rock someone like Chris Pratt, Matt Damon (doubt he would do it) or even a Tom Hardy would have been much better suited for the role than Aaron Johnson. Yes, showing the human side of Godzilla's path of destruction is a much needed quality to these movies but not to the extent of giving your title character around 24 minutes of TOTAL screen time(+small appearances in the beginning) which is why I didn't have an issue with it. But on the flip side, most of the movie showed the humans being stupid and trying to nuke Godzilla(who feeds off nuclear fallout) and the MUTOs, the entire human aspect of the film could have been done alot better then the simple ""lets nuke em"" approach. The fight scene towards the end really made the movie for me as a whole and the final appearance by Godzilla was glorious as well. All in all, I feel like this movie was very well done. Say what you want about Godzilla's screen time but you can definitely feel his presence being felt as they cleverly took a page out of classic movies like ""Jaws,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" at holding their biggest and baddest monster back, allowing you to feel his presence off screen before unleashing him onscreen.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not like the 'classics' from the 50s are critically revered, they just seem to exist. I get the symbolism of Godzilla with the Hiroshima bombings and I do think that it's quite thoughtful, but as a piece of cinema, it's never come to par. This is no better than the infamous 1998 version, in fact, it might be worse. While that film was tonally all over the place, this one has none. Never have a seen a brilliant cast so utterly wasted. Maybe Gareth Edwards was just intimidated by them but he didn't seem to give them much to do. They just stand there clueless, Ken Watanabe being the biggest sinner of this, or deliver some dry exposition. The only actor given something is Bryan Cranston, but his storyline is so saccharine that it's hard to take seriously, as hard as he may try to make it work. He can't help but feel incredibly insignificant in light of the inevitability of what's to come.Naturally, something like this will be terribly contrived, but even its optional choices such as the point where it tries to communicate that Aaron Johnson is a good guy by having him babysit a lost child just doesn't work because of the limited exploration of the narrative. If you were in that situation, then you'd get off at the next station and get the next train back. No way does that train go nonstop until nightfall. But that's beside the point, these things feed into character choices that are completely vapid. It's like a committee has decided what things should be and too often came up with a deadlock so they decided nothing will do instead. It has a huge problem with juggling the way humans would actually respond to this. Instead of awe-spiring wonder, it's vague terror at first and then a whole lot of gormlessness. It's eye-rolling, especially when they end up quite casual about what's going on.However, the biggest problem is that it's void of atmosphere. The smaller scenes don't blend well with the bigger unconvincing CGI and it never has any cinematic texture which could so easily come. Instead, it shrouds us in the dark and our imaginations run distracted and bored. I laughed at the first reveal of Godzilla. And then the film wraps up by calling it a hero, as if we'd jump to such conclusions, and then it struts out of town like it knows it's a stud. Just a total joke that lacks all vision. It just doesn't mean anything or have anything moving or entertaining. At least Desplat's score is quite nice for what it is. Exciting marketing really mislead us with this one because they spent way too much time polishing the posters and the hype than working on this film. I'm sure Gareth Edwards is better than this and I will certainly give his Monsters a chance at some point, but this is a passionless misfire.4/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is just based purely on if the movie was entertaining and it was. It was not what I excepted the movie is more about humans and dealing with the issues that come from Godzilla It surely felt more like the original Godzilla movies. However I thought there wasn't enough time spent showing Godzilla himself and the destruction he causes but as I was watching it I didn't seem to care as the human story lines became better than seeing Godzilla destroy everything in his way for 2 hours. Other than that it was a great movie with superb actors and effects.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved the movie ""Monsters"" so I was really hoping that this movie would be as good and be a solid step forward for the director. But this movie sucks. I mean the CGI was very impressive but other than that there wasn't a shred of logic to it, the characters were boring, I hate to say it but Bryan Cranston was overacting like crazy for pretty much his entire role, and the government and military were just stupid stupid stupid the entire movie long. There were dozens of good choices they could have made to fight these monsters but they clung to doing what had already failed them because it was convenient to the plot. Their complete inability to keep track of the movements of a giant monster despite having satellites and super-sonic aircraft at their disposal was not believable in the slightest. The science was a complete joke and the movie would have been much better off with them just saying ""Yeah, we're not really sure what's going on... something with radiation we think"" and just leaving it at that. Overall it felt like a movie where the writer or director came up with a bunch of ""cool scenes"" (like Godzilla swimming under an aircraft carrier) and then tried to just string them all together into a story.Just a complete waste of everyone's time and money and another failure to produce a decent Gozilla movie. I give it a 3/10 for the pretty CGI and the visually impressive sequence of them dropping into the city in the final act of the movie (y'know, the sequence they showed in the trailers for it).","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm not saying the movie doesn't have a good human story that keeps you interested – it does, but we understand who's in control when the movie is over and I think that was the original intention of the Godzilla legend when it was created in 1956. This 2014 version is visually almost perfect and has a storyline that keeps you interested with a twist making Godzilla not necessarily the enemy of mankind. Early in the movie some other monsters are discovered hatching in a couple of areas of the world being disguised as seismic activity, and they start feeding off the energy sources around them. Some of the Japanese folk are aware of Godzilla's existence and these occurrences happening before – so they are called in for assistance. An American who used to work for a company that originally discovered the first monster believes this 2nd occurrence is a cover-up and him and his son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, become involved. Godzilla is then awakened basically because these creatures can upset the order of nature including destroying mankind but also being higher on the food chain then the before mentioned Godly, King of the Monsters. The creators of this film, with Director Gareth Edwards, have now re-awakened the classic monster movie and upgraded it for this generation not necessarily because of the special effects, but because of the great storytelling. The monsters are not really that unique conceptually for this age(I even wondered if Godzilla was partially played by a man in a suit like some of the early films but don't believe it was), but a lot of care was taken in making the story unique and quick-paced. I don't believe those connected with the genre will be disappointed and neither will newbies. An overall triumph despite the many different variations of these movies that have been made over the years from this classic monster.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Over all movie is below average. The involvement of humans vs monsters is less as compared to first part. The action involved is a bit messy and the ending of themovie is unexpected too. It looks like a bit fantasy than science fiction movie.

Even their sex lives. Graphic depictions of reproduction by gigantic, ancient, supernatural, monster, insects. Even that's boring. They can't carry this film. In part because their supposed capacity to be a parasite to Godzilla is oddly bypassed..... That's gotta be the real story angle with this set up surely!? But no. No. It isn't. Possibly designing them to resemble the beast from 20000 fathoms would have injected some non-boringness into them by being a kudus gaining reference for monster movie fans?! But no. No. They didn't.As many people have said this film is structured as a slow burn story, mainly availing the audience of snippets of Godzilla until he is unleashed in the climactic engagement with the Muto's. Snippets eventually have skirmishes added to them until the big kaboom fight.It's nice to know that the monsters in this film have read their fair share of film scripts. So that they know how to behave. Entirely the opposite of the monsters in the director Edwards' breakout film.By contrast the madness and of the Japanese Godzilla is gone. Why make Godzilla films if they're not mad? It's the main crazy enjoyment that I get from them! Sometimes watching Japanese Godzilla films I'm not sure if I have any sense of any sense at all and that's utterly absent in this film. The film makes rigid sense.Also Godzilla himself is surely a direct agent acting on humanity within Japanese film traditions: either as our enemy/destroyer/agent of judgement or as our odd/mad protector. From space alien giant robots and other denizens of ""Monster Island"" and such like.Here Godzilla seems remote to humanity as a whole. Apart that is, from one American family possessed of truly prodigious ""right place right time"" capacity. It's good to see that they read film scripts too!As another attempt to make an American version of a Godzilla film this is to my mind a failure.For me the actual artistic design of Godzilla has some good in it and his smashing sky scrapers with impacts from his prone body is actually quite cool in it's solid way. The skydiving military sequence is a proper piece of blockbuster filmmaking in my opinion.Therefore personally I rate this film 3/10; a notch above barely dismal level because one or two sequences of good visuals, one scene outstanding, are included.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Godzilla is a film in which you almost never see Godzilla. The plot is unclear and sometimes extremely boring with dramatic notes inserted on the human protagonists, of which I do not care anything! A Godzilla movie must be an action-packed movie and you can't give 3/4 of the duration to humans and their relationships and instead only a few moments to the real interesting part of the movie: Godzilla, because that's the truth. The cast is good, Bryan Cranston makes a great performance but also Elizabeth Olsen and CJ Adams have made a good impression. The characters are not even ugly but sometimes they also interest and the dramatic notes feel, although some deaths are really poorly organized. The special effects are good even if sometimes CGI lacks a bit. The action and photography are beautiful and chari and also the setting and costumes are good. Now let's move on to the problems, which are big: as I said, the plot, useless for this film and I did not arouse interest, the writing, horrendous, in many points of the film you could not perceive anything, the rhythm, the film is of an absurd boring. But now the biggest mistake, which, as already mentioned, is to make a film about Godzilla in which we talk about everything but Godzilla. During the film I was just waiting to see the titan in action but they have inserted very little and in my opinion in a very wasted way. I think this new Godzilla movie is a tremendous missed opportunity. I don't think I'll see this movie again..

And most of the last 25 minutes or so are quite cool. There, that's all I can see that the movie has going for it. Hollywood took 18 years to try again and remake the Japanese classic. Let me say they are still struggling.It's as if studios were criticized once too often that blockbusters lack characters so now they cram sad excuses for characters into every movie and forget what it was supposed to be about. Think of Transformers which fed viewers the personal life of Sam Witwicky instead of fighting robots (or their characters). Think of Iron Man 3 which was about the personal struggles of Tony Stark instead of, well, Iron Man. This Godzilla is about an American soldier and bomb expert and his relationship with his beautiful wife and little son who miss him a lot because he's away a lot. It's also about his relationship with his father who went a bit cooky after loosing his wife. The movie is also about the US military who are mainly there to look cool and fail heroically. It's furthermore about the Japanese scientist who has been studying Godzilla, has some unexplained motivation and is mainly there to look concerned. Do you realize which character I've been leaving out so far? Yes, it is, of course, Godzilla, the literal father of all ""dai kaiju"". I am sorry to report that he doesn't appear very much in what's supposed to be his own movie. In fact, you could probably skip to the 90 minute mark and not miss much of him. There is a new kaiju, which vaguely reminds me of Mothra, and it seems to get more screen time than Godzilla.Another reviewer compares this to old horror films, like Jaws, that (driven also by technical limitations of the time) would tease the viewer with glimpses of the monster until the climatic reveal. I disagree. In Jaws you would not see the shark but it would always make its presence felt - it would kill people. Actually, think of Cloverfield as a kaiju movie in which, I think, both the focus on the people and the monster-teasing worked pretty well. You get some backstory of the characters but from then on the monster's presence drives everything they do.I'd recommend Shin Gojira instead of this one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Come to think of it I've been on here that long I probably have a review of the film on here!Anyway got to say that I thought the 2014 Godzilla was pretty entertaining. The story revolves around the reawakening of 2 monsters which causes Godzilla to also wake from his slumber. The good thing about this is that there is good acting in the movie as well as the monster destruction! You do have an interest in the characters and care whether they live or die and the same applies to Godzilla! A pretty entertaining summer blockbuster!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As a big fan of the original film, I was willing to give them a chance, which was hard after the 1998 American reboot. While that film was a giant mess, this film was amazing.Directed by Gareth Edwards, director of Monsters, and one of my favorite documentaries In the Shadow of the Moon, delivers an amazing action film. If you are expecting a perfectly developed film with a perfect story, you simply are not going to get it. Frankly the original film didn't delivery in that department either. It had a simple idea and ran with it. Same thing in this film. Of course Godzilla was going to be CGIed in the film, can't use those puppets anymore, and Godzilla still looks amazing. Much better than the last attempt at creating Godzilla. The action scenes are amazing. Top notch, and best of all, the final battle is at least ten minutes I would say. The actors generally work and fit well together, and I would say the acting was top notch. Bryan Cranston was amazing. A little hard to get use to him again with hair after Breaking Bad, but his acting was amazing. Elizabeth Olsen was a gem to watch. She is one of the top actresses today. Ken Watanabe, a legendary actor, was fabulous to watch in this film, a real treat. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is probably the only actor I would give a barely above average rating to.The film was written by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham. Dave Callaham is known for his writing of the Expendable franchise. Much like that franchise the action was big in the film, especially towards the end, and he deserves credit for bringing in those ideas to the film. The overall story of the film is fairly basic. These gentlemen aren't going to win an Oscar, but they do stick together the film nicely overall.The film was composed by Alexandre Desplat, and I must say as a huge fan of movie scores, this was very good. Not perfect, and likely won't win any awards, but top shelf no doubt about it.Overall this is without a doubt a must see film of Summer 2014. Big epic action, that is worth it in every aspect, and watching this film in IMAX is even better. The thunderous surround sound of the IMAX really shows off how amazing the film really is. As for the 3D, it was not anything to write home about. It adds some depth to the images, and a few things come out towards the screen here and there, but the 3D itself could have been left out. So once again, go out and watch this film, it is well worth the price of admission.8/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The accident at nuclear power plant? Awesome. Jump through the clouds? Breathtaking. Rail road encounter? Intriguing enough to forget that you actually want all these dull characters to die, because the script is so bad that it makes you laugh every time someone says another stupid line with shocked or bitter face. There's absolutely no reason - and no excuse - for adding so many flat human characters: most of them don't even influence the story, making their presence nothing else but irritating. Fortunately the monsters are compelling enough to save the title; they seem not to care about other creatures in the move - and so should we.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Content rated for 'a mature audience.'Considering the premise, one might presume this movie's unsuited to a teenage audience.At its core, Godzilla's a horror story, no?In terms of genre, it belongs under the 'Giant Monster Movie' heading.Here's my top six, from best to worst -1. Pacific Rim (2013) 2. Godzilla (2014) 3. Cloverfield (2008) 4. King Kong (2005) 5. The Host (2006) 6. Gojira (1954)To be fair, those are the only six.Like most people, I missed 1998's Godzilla starring Matthew Broderick for two reasons.One: It's a unanimous flop.Two: My sole attempt at rental was thwarted.A decade ago, after biking three miles to Blockbuster, I realized the disc had never been returned. Because why would they take down the cardboard insert, even years after the actual DVD disappeared?I borrowed the subtitled original instead.Never watch Gojira. Ever. It doesn't hold up.It's noteworthy as a pop cultural touchstone, particularly in Japan, where it was clearly received as horror. But check Wikipedia if you're interested - I don't support ironic viewings.Rent this year's Godzilla if you're looking for an inoffensive weekend flick.I dragged my sister and brother-in-law to an IMAX 3D screening and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. Both cited low expectations as a major contributor to their delight.If you take advantage of the rental (available starting September 16), stream it on a big screen, crank up the volume and kill the lights. This isn't ideal for an airplane.What's great is the sigh of relief: Zilla delivers on several levels.The story isn't cliché or flat. It's well thought-out and nuanced. It's not perfect, but it's tough to hit the bulls-eye with mega-monsters that withstand rocket-powered artillery.The visuals are solid, especially the CGI.Now, this flick had the best trailer I've ever seen. Back when it first appeared in theaters, it was so creepy and built the anticipation. Unfortunately, the paratrooper sequence is underwhelming as a result.Thus continues the search for any redeeming quality in the general practice of trailer viewing.Sally Hawkins can be put to much better use. Although she delivers a more than proficient performance, it's not a strong role. Which is similar to the part she plays in another great movie, The Double, released a week previous. But she's outstanding in Blue Jasmine, even receiving the Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.Hopefully we see more of Sally in the future.Other than Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche, the acting's only okay.Elizabeth Olsen is pretty good.Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't bad, but he completely lacks charisma.All in all, Godzilla is great enough for what it is.I'm sure the sequel's going to give us, at the very least, a peak at King Kong.Consider this a challenge to the filmmakers: Be original and release an 'R' rated sequel.You may not make the same haul domestically (which is debatable), but it'd be a way better movie. Folks would applaud the creativity and ambition.Plus, you could ratchet up the horror.And who doesn't love a good scare?","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

They give you this rehashed footage at the start of the atop nuclear test that we see in all these movies. The movie introduces characters only to have them disappear from the story. The main human character is never made likable. And Godzilla is reduced to some overgrown dinosaur. We see his weak breath weapon have no effect on the bad creature. And the story jumps location so fast you have to believe the army has faster than light travel abilities. In a couple hours you go from Japan tho Hawaii to Las Vagas to San Francisco.

With it comes memories of nuclear destruction, giant monsters, and that godawful 1998 travesty of a movie. This is the first Godzilla film (American or otherwise) in ten years. And now, with a colossal hype train behind it, the king of the monsters is finally back. Was it worth the wait? Alright, maybe it's not REALLY worth a decade, but the new Godzilla is a damn god film nonetheless. The only major flaw is its slow start. And when I say slow, I mean very, very slow. Sure, a nuclear power plant collapses and the presence of the to-be-revealed creatures is hinted at, but just be prepared for some long stretches of dialogue before anything really picks up. But once it does, it becomes abundantly clear that Godzilla is arguably the best monster movie of the new millennium. The visual effects are spectacular, and the sound design is sufficient to shake the seats in the theater. It's an experience like nothing else.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It helps that he acts the part well as does Miss Olsen.If it had been released in the 80's you might be impressed by the effects and story, but for me it was a little bit passé. How they got funding for a sequel is a miracle?! We expect something more for our money these days and they didn't bring anything new to the story that has, lets be honest again, been done many times before (My preference being the black and white ones that they used to show late on a Friday after Roseanne), but actually there was more originality in the old Chewits adverts, that parodied Godzilla than there was in this.
They made it too long and tried to beef it up, but too much was going on and in the dark, with a very poor vocal track to really get a feel for the characters or the situation, the human element was missing. The most powerful parts of the film is a family reunion at the end and a bit with Mr Cranston right at the beginning.There's a lot that seems to get lost in translation and goes unexplained or is very convenient. I am also confused as to why Godzilla seems to take cares to avoid hurting humans where possible and fights for them to destroy the insectoids. Is there some sort of symbiotic relationship he has with our race that is unspoken?I think that with a bit more care, a trimmed story and a good edit that the film definitely could have had potential and it's a shame that it doesn't work, because they are obviously trying to reboot the genre, with a Kong vs Godzilla film due in 2021, but I won't be watching the direct sequel to this from 2019 and probably won't bother with the Versus either.I should have known it was going to be bad when I saw Bryan's terrible Just For Men job at the beginning.A lot of B listers and lower trying to make an A list film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","An adequate monster movie that feels curiously characterless - a shame considering its impressive pedigree where director and cast are concerned.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3018591/?ref_=tt_urv","shawneofthedead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48490287/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2014","In all likelihood, this brand-new incarnation of Godzilla would have been met with far fewer expectations if director Gareth Edwards had never made Monsters. Edwards' ultra-indie, incredibly well-crafted creature feature - in which he magicked up creepy monsters and special effects on his own computer - served as so impressive a calling card that he was drafted in to breathe new life into this giant monster who hails from Japan. So great was Monsters that Edwards managed to amass a stunningly credible cast as well, from Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston through to indie darlings Sally Hawkins and David Straithairn. Alas, Edwards' Godzilla falls quite far short of the mark. Ultimately, there's neither enough story nor enough monster to keep the film going for as long as it does.Ostensibly, the plot intends to focus on its human elements, and that works well enough at the beginning. We follow Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his assistant Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) into a cavern propped up by the age-worn bones of an ancient creature. So we know that something else is at work when the Japanese nuclear power plant overseen by Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) suffers a catastrophic meltdown. Joe loses his beloved wife (Juliette Binoche) in the accident, and effectively loses his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) as well.Flash-forward fifteen years, and Ford is now an explosive ordinance officer - he detonates bombs - with a wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son of his own. He's healed from the loss of his mom, or so you think, when he's forced to return to Japan to bail Joe out of prison. His father, you see, has remained obsessed for years with figuring out the real cause of the nuclear meltdown. And, as it turns out, the secret to that mystery is about to burst forth from the seas...It's evident with every frame what Edwards is trying to do: develop real, believable human stakes that can lend weight to the monstrous carnage to be wrought by Godzilla and the Mutos - giant, bug-like creatures that first emerge to lay waste upon Earth. Serizawa and Graham search for motivation and make appeals on Godzilla's behalf; Ford must reconcile himself with the loss that transformed his father and his own life; Godzilla is the solution and not the problem. So on and so forth.But the resulting movie frequently gets lost within its uneven, uninspiring script. The humans to whom we're introduced barely have any depth to speak of, the most egregious offender being Elle - she seems to exist merely to look devastated and/or scream helplessly in the tumultous streets of San Diego. Cranston does some pretty incredible work with what little he's given, but his screen-time is, unfortunately, limited. Taylor-Johnson looks good and occasionally elevates his material, but - especially in the second half of the film - is forced to lumber from action sequence to action sequence, barely registering as a fully-realised entity once the monsters have taken centre stage.Just as unfortunate is the rendering of the monsters in Godzilla: not in a visual effects sense, but as characters. The titular beast barely gets a look-in. Even when all form of monster mayhem is unleashed in the second half of the movie, he's quite literally the supporting player in his own starring vehicle - and we're not just talking about playing second fiddle to the human cast. Godzilla stalks broodily in the wake of the Mutos, who effectively sideline the monster whose very name is in the title of the film. He looks great and moves well, but it's hard to care all that much when his appearances are as relatively fleeting as they are.It's not that Godzilla is a complete mess; it isn't. It's perfectly watchable, there are some super-cool action sequences, and Edwards - as befitting his own not-so-secret past as a Godzilla junkie - laces the film with in-jokes and references that will please those well-schooled in the giant monster's lore and backstory. But that can't quite salvage the film from what it turns out to be: a competent if not particularly compelling monster movie, one which occasionally demonstrates but largely lacks the bite, energy and charisma of Edwards' debut feature film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The direction, music and acting created very little tension or atmosphere apart from the huge amount of dust and smoke that obscured the monsters in the action sequences.

The cinematography is absolutely amazing, probably the best I've ever seen. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and the rest of the cast did a great job at acting. The special effects and CGI were very realistic. The score didn't flow very well with the movie, but it was still great.A lot of people complained that this movie has a horrible plot. They are right, to some extent. The story isn't very advanced, but you can expect that from a movie that was made for the action. This brings me to another point. Many people were also disappointed that Godzilla didn't get much screen time, which is also true. I too am disappointed by that fact. I feel like he didn't get much screen time so that the plot could progress, but the plot didn't progress very well. That is why I am rating this movie 8, instead of 9 or 10.Overall, Godzilla was an entertaining movie that had great camera work, special, effects, etc. I will definitely see it again. I don't know why it is rated 7.1. Maybe hardcore Godzilla fans were expecting a better movie? Whatever it may be, I think that this movie should be rated at least 7.5. I obviously can't change that, so I can least make my opinion known.Thanks for reading!~Micah Knowles","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The original allegory for atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the 1954 ""Gojira"" is lost in this ""Godzilla"" despite the incorporation of nuclear weapons in the story. The bomb here makes superpowers of monsters. The sequel, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" (2019) seemed to appreciate this, at least, and so attempted to add an environmental message, confused as it was. This one is said to recall the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, 2005 Hurricane Katrina and 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. OK, and they said the 9/11 allusions in ""Man of Steel"" (2013) were crass and overblown. These giants leave a city-razing massacre in their wake from Japan, through Hawaii, to San Francisco and Las Vegas. ""Thousands missing"" a TV report is seen broadcasting at one point; that's the least of the PG-13 horrors. Seems to me this could be argued to be just another post-9/11 defense of American military might despite the relative inability of humans to affect this narrative. Sure, Godzilla laid waste to our city, but he saved it from the other kaiju laying waste to our city. What else to make of a Hollywood production turning 1954 fears of American bombing to a, if questioning, celebration of that cinematic embodiment of those fears.Regardless, to appreciate this series, I think I need to look beyond its simplistic, if muddled, narrative and cardboard-cutout characters. Visuals, then. These blockbusters are meant to be spectacles, after all. So, I was looking for something to distinguish this from a variation of Transformers-type titanic battles as tiny people run for their lives beyond the CGI and lack of Michael Bay cutting being less of an eye sore. The most interesting thing I saw were windows. Seriously, I think this is somewhat interesting. It's a metaphor for movies--framed images seen through a screen. The camera does a lot of switching in its framing of the monsters, between omniscient views that no character beyond god or godzillas could see, more obscure looks from human view on the ground, and shots of the monsters as seen through windows. The extensive TV coverage becomes but another window through which to view the monsters, as does the top-secret film-within-the-film. The sequel might even do more of this, while ""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017), in the tradition of the original 1933 ""King Kong,"" is more about the making rather than spectating of movies. Also worth noting is that what might be the final through-the-window shot here is through a broken car window--and on the heels of the POV shot through goggles. The monsters that are the movie have entirely escaped the thin layer of safety glass separating them from the human characters that are our surrogate spectators on screen. It really puts the spectating in the spectacle.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Besides, Toho Studios in Japan hasn't made a new Godzilla picture in something like 10 years... so what's the worst that could happen? If this new version flops at the box office, Godzilla remains dormant. If it succeeds, the possibilities are endless - perhaps even for Toho to return to their own series. So I was willing to give this the benefit of the doubt.The new GODZILLA doesn't suck as hard as the '98 remake did, but it still does nibble quite a bit. The main problem is that it takes forever for Godzilla to appear - something for like one hour into this bloated 123 minute feature. Now, I've always been a viewer who mostly prefers fleshed-out characters and intriguing story development over all-out brainless action ... but this is a Godzilla movie, damn it! I didn't check the time, but I wonder if Godzilla was seen on screen for 10 minutes total; it was like he was giving a cameo appearance in his own movie. And if you're going to attempt a dramatic first act or two with characters in an action-oriented premise, you'd better make them interesting. Unfortunately, the leads here are strictly one-dimensional. As the young lead hero, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is an expressionless cardboard cut-out. His wife (Elizabeth Olsen) does not make much deeper of an impression. The lead Japanese doctor (Ken Watanabe) barely has much to do other than stand around looking seriously constipated. (Of course, they couldn't help naming the token Japanese doctor ""Serizawa"", after a character in the original 1954 GODZILLA; why do these makers of lesser reboots always think they're going to score points by name-checking people and things from older movies?). There were some semi-interesting early sequences featuring Bryan Cranston as the young hero's dad, but even he began to wear on my nerves after awhile.Twice I seriously considered walking out of the theater. The first time was after squirming too long in waiting for Godzilla to show his face (seemed like an hour, or longer); the second time was, after finally seeing him, getting continuously c**k-teased -- more than once, when it appeared as though an enticing action moment was mercifully about to begin, but the scene abruptly cuts away to something else, as if slamming a door in the audience's faces (and that literally happened during one crucial cutaway moment of excitement!). While I think of it, isn't it quite a coincidence how the main characters always seem to be right there each time a building falls or a monster sticks its head forward? It's also a small world even amongst hundreds of scattered victims, as they still manage to find their missing loved one amidst the hysteria.Some good things: first, I think it was wise to not make this another ""origin movie""; instead, it's as if Godzilla has always existed, but has been laying low for many years. Which leads me to the second good thing: having Godzilla awaken as a helper to mankind (I've always felt that a typical scenario with a villainous Godzilla angrily smashing the city gets tired really fast after one film). Third: having two other evil monsters for Godzilla to battle with -two gigantic, robot-like, insect-beasties (one male, one female). When these three monsters are ultimately allowed to tussle together, this resembles a true Godzilla movie and the effects are quite spectacular; regrettably, by this time it's too late. It's what we came here for, but there are times in viewing cinema where a plodding movie has over-stepped its welcome and is beyond total redemption. *1/2 out of ****","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Mind you, I'm quite the monster movie fan, having watched to death even the little-seen ones such as ""Majin, Monster of Terror"" and ""War of the Gargantuas,"" but this was purely awful.It started with abject nonsense. We see nuclear explosions on the Pacific in the 1950s, aimed at vaguely monstrous shapes. Cut to the Philippines in 1999, where we see a mine that has collapsed and gives us vague hints of super-sized fossils and (scientifically inconsistent) ""radiation that just doubled."" Move along to Japan, where a nuclear plant collapses for no reason and there's some babble about echolocation and electromagnetic pulses (EMP) and seismic waveforms and what-not. (It's funny how the supposed sonograms didn't even show functions of time, but relations {to the mathematician}, being multi-valued per instant of time.) Suddenly, it's fifteen years later and we're in San Francisco. Some military jock (with a drop-dead gorgeous wife and two you-wanna-squeeze-them-to-death-adorable little boys) gets a call about his father having been arrested in Japan. It seems dad--the eccentric who hung around after the nuclear station was destroyed--likes to climb around old ruins and look for ""cover-ups"" and ""secret projects"" and such, although we are given ZERO CLUE what these cover-ups might cover or what secrets these secret projects might hold. Dad goes fishing for his collection of ZIP drives and, of course, police are Johnny-on-the-spot (in an abandoned city, where wood lice climb all over the place and feral dogs roam the streets in packs) to pick up Daddy-San and Sonny Boy. Oh, did I forget to mention, Dad is an expert in all things scientific, because (a) he lives in a what looks like Samuel T. Cogley's (of ST:TOS fame) library and (b) has books scattered here and there with impressive-to-the-layman titles on their spines such as ""Chemistry,"" ""Physics,"" and ""Echolocation."" (Funny, but I studied a great deal of both chemistry and physics, and I've yet to encounter a professional text named either of those.) Before long, Dad and son are transported under heavy guard to some secret site where some I'm-not-sure-what-it-is is being subjected to electric pulses but someone ""comes alive,"" putting out sonograms that ""look exactly like"" what was seen in the '50s and again in '99. Suddenly, after the order, ""kill it"" (excuse me, but, kill WHAT?), some goofy-looking creature that looks like it was borrowed from Cloverfield but suffered some shipping accidents en route appears, and we are confronted with blackouts and frenetic people running to and fro.After a bit more pseudoscience and psychobabble, I lost my remaining patience and stalked out of the theater.

Only Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen breathe any life into their characters, and they have little more than cameos.On the subject of cameos Godzilla is barely in the movie, and when he is you can't see him. Infuriatingly, after a very long and boring build up the camera cuts to something else when the monsters fight.The worst thing of all is that the script is unbelievably stupid, and follows the ( not very interesting) activities of the US Military and their nonsensical and absurd plans.Awful. THe 1998 version was better than this.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

(Which includes the latest Spiderman and Transformer films for way of baseline). So clichéd - seriously any cliché you could think of added; and more for sure. Massive destruction (thousands killed?) not really addressed, but don't worry - Mum, Dad, kiddies (lots of 'em) - (maybe) OK, of course. (It kinda reminds me of Independence day - in that everyone depends on 1 guy - except here is doesn't carry any weight, his abilities don't seem to carry any weight, and he doesn't seem to have any characteristics that contribute to the solution. Yeah, you know nearly everyone important will survive. But most grating is how lovable and endearing all the 'needed' characters are needed to be. Indeed how clumsily our investment in them is constructed. The hero, the dutiful family, the saccharin moments. I wish I could better put into words how bad the film is. Pass. Not the grade - but the advice.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Years later, Joe's son, Ford, a US Navy ordnance disposal officer, must go to Japan to help his estranged father who obsessively searches for the truth of the incident. In doing so, father and son discover the disaster's secret cause on the wreck's very grounds. This enables them to witness the reawakening of a terrible threat to all of Humanity, which is made all the worse with a second secret revival elsewhere. Against this cataclysm, the only hope for the world may be Godzilla, but the challenge for the King of the Monsters will be great even as Humanity struggles to understand the destructive ally they have.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I couldn't stay awake through the film. I had to watch it 4 times just to get to the end. Given the choice between the original cheesy costumed character and this one, I'll take the original every time.First off, this movie focuses more on the human aspects rather than the creatures. That's unfortunate in itself because the human story was absolutely lifeless and boring.Second, I hated the fact that once again the producers took major liberties with the appearance of Godzilla. I thought the 1998 version was bad enough where they made him look more like a lizard. This one looks like they combined the head of a turtle or something with who knows what. It just doesn't work. I can't understand why producers continue to take classic icons like this and change them completely just to suit a new generation. It isn't necessary.Third, after a long wait for the monsters, when you do finally see Godzilla and his nemesis, the majority of the action happens in pitch dark making it very difficult to see.I saw this movie on DVD and I'm glad I waited because even the expense of the DVD was more than this film is worth. Had I have seen this film at the theater and paid the cost of popcorn and all, I would have really felt ripped off.I don't recommend this film for new viewers or returning fans.

Was thinking i will have a very nice time watching it and enjoy too. But let me tell you this ain't near to any Action or Sci-fi genre as given in the title.This film is a total drama movie and a slap on Scifi-Action genre. The movie started well and early on tension builds up. But then suddenly family, romance, drama all sorts of stuff kicks in from nowhere.I was simply banging my head and questioning when will action start. Watch out for a Japanese scientist in the movie with same confused expression since the beginning of the movie. Even a child comes to know what has happened but this guy has the same confused look till the end.1 star only for couple of hard work on the animation. One more thing is that action takes place as soon as sun goes down and then you cant understand what is happening.One word of advise ""Run"", don't watch it, i don't understand that why this movie was made & how so bad it can be. Don't waste your time on this one.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The weekend re-watching old Godzilla movies on one of the Cable movie channels, I was left kinda disappointed. While this movie isn't anything like the 1998 version and does paint Godzilla as the hero like he was an many of the movies, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't enough fight scenes. At least not like the old WWE Monster smack downs of the old Godzilla movies. And I'm drawing a blank..but what happened to the last bomb?

The star of the movie should of course be Godzilla, but after one and an half hours through the movie, I've seen literally just 5 mins, AT MOST, of him. It took an hour before we were even shown Godzilla (Besides a few short clips of his backspikes, while he swims in water, yay?). This is for me the biggest mistake a monster movie can make EVER! Godzilla (1998) was stupid, badly scripted and horribly acted, sure, but AT LEAST it had way more Godzilla in it.After one and half hours, I had to stop the movie. I couldn't stand anymore exposition of bland and clichéd characters. I feel like a fool for having even seen this much. It's so pointless. What's the point of this movie?

This movie might have continued the tradition of scientist as hero, dating from It Came From Outer Space and Creature from the Black Lagoon, and continuing through Jurassic Park. This would have been a much better movie.Unfortunately these two characters were phased out early in the story, and their son turned out to be the main character. Instead of a smart scientist, he's a dumb warrior. Instead of Sam Neill and Laura Dern, we got Rocky Balboa.I blame James Cameron. Working class people are the heroes in his Terminator movies and Aliens and The Abyss and Avatar. The theme of his movie Titanic was that working class people are better in every way than upper class people.For a key sequence in Godzilla, the high altitude drop, the film makers chose as background music the same piece by Ligeti that Stanley Kurbrick used when Heywood Floyd was shown the monolith on the Moon in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Godzilla film makers seemed to say, we have no imagination of our own so we're stealing from a better film maker. If you don't agree, please point to anything at all in Godzilla that shows that the film makers had an imagination.(Was this music choice another unfortunate Cameron influence? The music in the opening salvage scene in Aliens was the same Khachaturian music that Kubrick used brilliantly when introducing the Jupiter mission spacecraft in Space Odyssey. These music choices were brilliant in Space Odyssey; not so in Godzilla or Aliens.)This movie is top-heavy with special effects. It lacks imagination and intelligence and characters we care about or even like.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A blunderous reboot that's barely better than the '98 Godzilla.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5127067/?ref_=tt_urv","5MinuteMovieGuy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52793387/?ref_=tt_urv","17 September 2019","This year marks the 60th anniversary of the original Godzilla film, when the King of the Monsters first emerged from the Pacific and terrorized Tokyo, Japan. Roughly 10 years after America dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II, Godzilla was artistically created to be a physical, living representation of the destructive force of those bombs. Even the texture of his skin is modelled after keloid scars, which were found on survivors as a result of the radiation. Godzilla's arrival and subsequent attacks were spurred by the use of nuclear weapons, and he as a character wholly embodies the consequences of nuclear warfare.60 years later, Godzilla remains a global icon, having spawned dozens of movie sequels, while introducing several other enormous monsters to battle with. Then 16 years ago, he was reimagined as he first came to America in Roland Emmerich's lackluster 1998 film Godzilla, leaving many fans severely disappointed with not only the film, but also the new rendition of the famous monster. While Godzilla is visually depicted much more accurately in Gareth Edward's new 2014 Godzilla than he was in '98, his entire presence is surprisingly different than usual. This isn't the angry, vengeful Godzilla of the past. He actually now seems almost entirely indifferent to humans. Unfortunately, as promising as this new Godzilla movie may appear to be, it falls far short of expectations, and dare I say, it isn't even much better than the 1998 Godzilla.Godzilla (2014) starts off pretty well, strengthened by the performance of Bryan Cranston, who plays Joe Brody, a nuclear power plant engineer living in Japan. Brody is present when an unknown disaster occurs at the plant, costing many innocent lives. Despite what the trailers suggest, Cranston's Brody is not the main character of the film. Nor is it fellow all-star actor Ken Watanabe. The main character is actually only seen for about 4 seconds of the film's original 2 and a half minute trailer. It's Joe Brody's son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, in a performance that is decent but far from engaging. The protagonist Ford Brody is a character that is largely uninteresting, and who just casually wants to get back to his family after the monster invasion. He fails to convey any genuine sense of urgency amidst the chaos, although the same can be said for the entire cast, with the exception of Cranston's Brody. Cranston's performance is the only one that has any emotional weight to it, but he can't carry the film alone. Meanwhile, Ken Watanabe is essentially reduced to being the quiet, ever-present voice of reason that no one wants to listen to. The film has a solid cast of actors, but they're not given enough to work with in this convoluted mess of a movie.For a movie that has so much death and destruction, the people in the film never seem all that concerned. You get no sense of global panic and hysteria. You have a 300-foot-tall monster destroying cities, with millions of people dying, and yet nobody seems all that freaked out by it. It's almost like the situation isn't treated as a serious threat, and there's a major lack of suspense altogether. There's rarely any edge-of-your-seat terror or excitement, and the lack of emotion just makes the action come off as sort of flat and dull. Not only that, the majority of the destruction that's taking place isn't even seen, with the movie instead opting to show you the aftermath. Throughout the first two-thirds of the movie, the camera continuously cuts away from the action you've been waiting for. Rather than showing you what you want to see in full-glory, the movie frequently will take you to a different location where you'll briefly see a few seconds of the catastrophe being watched by someone on television. It feels like a cheap trick to build up to some amazing climax, but it's incredibly frustrating. It's like when watching a reality TV show and then the show cuts to a commercial break before revealing the winner. Perhaps it would be more forgivable if the end was enjoyable, but even though it does give you a full display of the showdown, it's bogged down by a tiresome human story and still lacks any real emotional punch. Despite the fact that the movie tries to convey a serious tone, it's also incredibly cheesy. To the extent that the big finale that this movie has been trying so hard to build up to ends up being almost laughable. Ultimately the movie ends up just being unsatisfying, disappointing, and overly long.There are a lot of ways in which Godzilla goes wrong, despite the film's great potential. One of my issues is with the musical score, which ends up coming off like a bad punchline. Music is supposed to accentuate the action and drama of a film, yet the film feels emotionless and boring. The only time the music really stood out to me was when it was being used to heighten the suspense of the climactic battle, and essentially narrate who was winning. It was done so ineffectively that it was both kind of comical and embarrassing. I also have an issue with all of the special effects, which are being touted as absolutely amazing. They're not. However, I will say that the use of special effects in the movie is quite ambitious, but it works to the film's detriment. There's simply too much of them, and this excessive nature of the film is, I think, its biggest mistake. Godzilla (2014) is ridiculously CGI-heavy, and while their scope is admirable, I really think the quality would have been substantially improved if they didn't overdo it so much. I think a less-is-more approach would have benefitted the film in many ways. It's excessive to the point of making good things turn bad. Everything is way too over the top, causing the action to lose its impact. It's evident the filmmakers were trying so hard to make this big-budget movie as epic as possible, but this enormous scale ends up backfiring. The rampage covers two continents, multiple cities, and even traverses the length of the Pacific Ocean. I can appreciate their attempt, but the movie is trying to do too much. In other words, Godzilla (2014) bites off more than it can chew.I also have some problems with the film's treatment of the titular character, Godzilla. First of all, for a movie named after him, he sure doesn't appear much in it. He's the reason why we want to see the movie, but he's absent for the majority of the film. Even when he's around, he's largely obscured by CGI smoke and storm clouds, up until the final moments of the movie. I'm also not particularly fond of his appearance. He just doesn't quite look like Godzilla to me. It's like looking at a T-Rex head on Godzilla's body. I'm aware that Godzilla's facial appearance has changed many times over 60 years, but something just doesn't look quite right here. Additionally, I feel that Godzilla's face is actually too expressive in this new film. I wonder if this was done to cause viewers to feel more sympathetic to him, because in the film, Godzilla is actually depicted as something of a tragic hero, rather than a colossal beast. This is my biggest concern with the movie's handling of his character. Godzilla's destruction in the film is treated like it's all unintentional, and just a result of his massive size. Even though humans attack him, he's not angry about it or anything. Never mind the movie's claim that all of America's nuclear bomb tests after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were actually secretive but unsuccessful attempts to kill Godzilla. He doesn't mind. He's just a poor gentle giant that's misunderstood. Really, Hollywood? Give me a break!To say that Godzilla (2014) is almost as bad of a film as Godzilla (1998) is a statement that I don't take lightly. It's a bold and controversial thing to say, and it may seem a bit absurd considering that this film goes in the right direction, whereas the previous film was all wrong from the beginning. Yet while the new movie has all the right pieces for greatness, it extends its reach too far and attempts to do too much, while never managing to make any of it very good. In all seriousness, I was more entertained with the '98 film than I was with this one. I can hardly comprehend how a movie with a giant 300-foot-tall monster destroying cities can be so boring. Godzilla (2014) focuses so much on trying to build up to an epic conclusion that it forgets to worry about making the audience care, or even about keeping them entertained, and it just gets worse as it goes on. It repeatedly tries to raise the stakes, as well as our expectations, while attempting to delay gratification until the end. It's a risky move, and unsurprisingly, it certainly doesn't pay off. On the bright side, Godzilla (2014) is probably a pretty sweet movie if you're a 12-year-old. There's plenty of action, some cool special effects, and he's still a pretty awesome monster. However, for me, I was totally pumped up for this movie, but an hour and a half into it, I had endured enough and wanted to walk out. Godzilla (2014) disappointed me on so many levels. It's a movie without a beating heart. It's predictable, overly long, has uninspired characters and a weak story, and the action just never hits the right note. A little more emotion and a little less CGI could have a gone a long way in making this movie better. As a fan of Godzilla, I felt frustrated, detached, and perplexed with how they were able to do so much wrong when they had the groundwork for something great. You know, perhaps I'm wrong in claiming it's comparably bad as Godzilla (1998). After all, the last time I saw that movie was in the theaters when I was 12.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In terms action, visual and sound effects, it's definitely worth the price of admission. There's some great monster battle scenes and a few ""that was amazing!"" moments; make no mistake, the little kid in you will be entertained. The special effects on Godzilla himself are very good, easily the best I've seen to date (though overall the special effects are not as good as Pacific Rim, surprisingly). The depth of 3D really brings him to life on the screen, so seeing it in IMAX 3D is a must. The sound effects however, are outstanding! Some of the best I've ever heard in the theatre and the highlight of the movie for me. There were a few notable occasions where Godzilla roared and the theatre shook! It was very impressive and makes this worth a high end theatre experience. There's also a fantastic sky dive sequence that is beautifully shot with a 2001 A Space Odyssey vibe that will blow your mind (it made the trailer look fantastic), unfortunately it felt slightly out of place as the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to it.The main characters are clearly miscast and are just not ready for prime time as their love story fees hallow and forced. This wouldn't be such of a big deal, except that film spends too much time trying to make you care about them (and ultimately fails). Heisenberg, err... I mean Bryan Cranston is serviceable in his role if not very good, unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time. Ken Watanabe is so bad I have to assume it was intentionally so and was a humorous homage to cheesy scientist characters from past Gozilla movies. He also has way too many ""stares off into nothing"" moments that are really funny. The dialogue was really cheesy and forgettable but I kind of expected that; this is a Godzilla movie after all. The story is nothing more than a formality and it's just used to conveniently put the characters at the right place and time, just as another monster appearance is imminent. At the end of the movie I wasn't quite satisfied as I wish there was more of Godzilla himself and given that's the whole point of this movie, I have to say I'm slightly disappointed (unlike how I feel after Pacific Rim). Go in with low expectations and you'll have a good time. Am I expecting too much from a giant monster movie? Possibly. But this seems like the rare case where more monster and less focus on weak characters would actually have been a good thing!www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

The production team makes the mistake of modern movie making. They try to confuse the audience with a bunch of special effects that make you feel the headache of an annoying arcade or a goofy casino full of those annoying lights flashing over and over.
Pretty much everything is contrived for the sake of what little the writer and director have in mind. We never feel we're there. We only feel we're in the presence of people making a movie, and that's a poor sign.
If you can stay awake for the first two hundred years of this movie (it will seem like two hundred years), you'll finally see a monster. 
The biggest problem is we just get the same characters over and over. Hollywood thinks all men have to be married with families, or they're worthless garbage. Again and again, we are alienated by Hollywood ""superiority"" complexes.
Not pathetic, but this movie is tedious and annoying.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In contrast, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is one hell of a bore for most of its running time, with way to much of the two hours plus spent on dull drama, and the action scenes, when they happen, simply too dark to be enjoyable. This is probably the reason why this year's Kong: Skull Island was so devoid of a plot, comprising of endless action set-pieces occurring in broad daylight: the makers were trying extra hard to ensure that it came nowhere near to the abject dreariness of Edward's film.When giant radioactive lizard and mighty ape finally meet up in Godzilla vs. Kong (scheduled for 2020), I sure hope that they take extra special care to get the balance of plot and action right: I don't think I can handle another monster-sized disappointment.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However i was extremely disappointed with the film and some of the sub-par acting performances. I really think there was some deep rooted environmental-nature-god like bullshit trying to be portrayed by the movie and it just didn't work, the headline 'king of the creatures' at the end, while fans were cheering the triumphant creature (Godzilla) really put the icing on the cake. I mean come on. how lame do you want to be?. Like seriously. On a more positive note though, i thought Bryan Cranston delivered a good performance in the time he was in it, but the film died when his character died out, and may i say i thought it was way to early for his character to meet his untimely demise. I can only assume he reviewed the rest of the script and knew it would be best to call it a night when he did. Overall i think the four is generous score, but then again i have watched the film 'Mega shark vs Meca shark' so it would be pretty harsh to score lower then that.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Big G was reduced to a scared, gigantic iguana that ran around the city and got killed by a few missiles... yikes! Naturally when I heard about this one and watched the first trailers I was stunned, and my expectations were high - especially after just finishing the Breaking Bad series and expecting similar performance from Bryan Cranston ( Who, to my surprise, was not actually the main character of the movie - something that I thought after watching the trailers). Although the director himself is still quite inexperienced and I hated his latest ''Monsters'' movie, I thought he may be able to pull this off properly.However, unlike the awesome trailers, the movie doesn't really deliver the same ''feeling'', and too much of the runtime focuses on the human characters, very little on big G himself. There are several scenes where my inner fanboy took the better of me, and my heart literally started pounding in my chest ( the first full reveal of the G himself - truly stunning), and the CGI effects and design of the various beasts were commendable, however the movie is seriously lacking in most other areas. The movie is thus watchable, but ( apart from a few really stunning Godzilla scenes), unfortunately doesn't quite live up to it's name, or hype.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well, here we are, and it did. Okay, maybe I'm slightly exaggerating. The 2014 Godzilla movie had great potential in the early part of the film, by mid-way through, though, I had lost interest. I'll be honest, I didn't even watch the final 1/4 of the movie. Pros: It hearkened back to its roots by beginning in Japan. It had a very plausible story line, considering the subject matter. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche helped to give the film credibility with excellent performances. MUTO was very well designed and the true monster star of the movie, getting much more screen time than Godzilla. Cons: The storyline relocated to the United States. The performances and chemistry of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were terrible. The portrayal of a bumbling, inept U.S. military. Godzilla, he got very little screen time and the design was a bit of a let down, although, that's a personal preference since I prefer my Godzilla with a little bit of a neck.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Think District 9 with monsters instead of aliens. Fast forward four years later, thanks to the critical success of his first full length indie feature, and Edwards, who has been given the keys to the commercial kingdom, is front and centre in adapting the King of Monsters in only the second Americanized version since the abysmal yet highly popcorn-crunchingly entertaining Godzilla remake from Roland Emmerich from 1998. Entrusted with a massive $160 million dollar budget from Warner Bros. Pictures, after acquiring the rights of the iconic beast from Toho in 2010, Edwards proves that Godzilla reigns at destroying one thing, and one thing only, the promise of young filmmakers career's. Godzilla is a large beast to discuss in one review or twenty-seven for that matter (since there has been about twenty-seven film adaptations of the beast) since his birth back in 1954. For his sixtieth birthday, Godzilla has been given the royal treatment, having its largest budget to date, a strong international cast, and the biggest presence on screen thanks to a belief that bigger is better. That belief is shot down with the help of this film. With screens growing in size (IMAX, AVX, etc.), ticket prices getting a radioactive hike and the God of Monsters terrorizing cities solely based on its sheer size, something's gotta give, but never does.For the first time in the creature's existence, Godzilla is not the centre of attention. In fact, the monster itself only makes up for mere minutes of the film. Adopting a very Nolan-esque, if not J.J Abrams approach to minimizing the beast's reveal before the film's premiere and within the film, Edwards focuses less on the destruction of Godzilla, and more on the presence monsters have on a small group of people on earth. Basically, a rehashing of Edwards' Monsters, with a much bigger budget.Unfortunately for Edwards, instead of keeping his vision and artistic integrity intact, he decides to allow Hollywood, and the symbol of Godzilla himself, to consume him, into something I like to call, the symptoms of a Hollywood film. Edwards succumbs to; foggy glass shots where characters wipe their windows for a big reveal at the monster; children noticing things before adults, monsters and rain (lots of it) and my favourite, crazy guy who proves us all that he wasn't crazy. Godzilla is one big 'told ya so', when the summer blockbuster season is a large example of so many times we go into a film, hoping to be surprised, but being delivered exactly what we expected instead.Like any other huge blockbuster film recently (see: The Watchmen, X: Men First Class, The Wolverine), the film begins to explain the origins of the giant lizard, this time dating it back to radioactive testings done in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the 1940′s. Deep rooted in one of the most tragic time's in our world's history, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Wantanabe) explains how the radioactive bombs were done less as a test, and more of a means to destroy the unexplained and mysterious creature found deep in the ocean. Unknown to scientists then, but the monstrosity fed off the radiation being used, making it stronger as opposing to killing it. Since his disappearance, the God of Creatures has since been absent from the world. Until, in 1999, when engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston in his most annoying role yet) experiences the devastation of electrical shocks taking out the power at his radioactive plant, that leads to chaos and causes him to lose his wife Sandra Brody (Juliette Binoche) and many of his co-workers. Left to raise his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) alone, Ford grows up becoming a bomb specialist for the United States Army (how appropriate), distancing his father from his family due to his obsession with the mysteries of the events the day his wife was taken from him. Fifteen years later and after returning after fourteen months on tour, Ford returns to San Francisco to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and his son Sam (Carson Bolde), only to be summoned by his father for some unfinished business that might lead the end of the world as we know it.The summer movie season has recently been infamous for spewing out relentless amounts of superhero films and unexpected heroes. Godzilla is no different than any of these films, finding an unlikely hero in the process of ripping the essence of the ferocity and symbolic destructive nature that is Godzilla. One of the biggest problems of this adaptation of Godzilla lies in the dubious marketing tactics for the film. In an early Comic Con trailer, the narration of the trailer suggests the creature's odious nature and pleasure with destruction. Based on earlier interpretations of the monster, these hints of originality and authenticity of the creature are not kept or upheld with any dignity at all for the iconic cinematic figure, instead thrown on its head and butchered.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The makers of the movie must have the idea that shooting a movie in the dark makes it scarier or more intense or who knows what. As far as I am concerned shooting in the dark allows them to use cheap effects, with hokey monsters fights.

There are more Hollywood clichés in this malignant slice of cinema than in a life insurance add. The biggest mystery is not the origin and nature of these monsters, but how a project like this is pitched to a producer who ultimately decides to fund it.Ken Watanabe's and Bryan Cranston's participation must be filed under bad career move. They do an OK job but they might as well have read from a phone book - that would be more moving.Suspension of disbelief is a requirement in many movies, but the amount of brain activity this movie requires being suspended to accept it as plausible, would leave you an organ donor.Viewer discretion is advised.

I realized twenty minutes into this film that I most likely would be disappointed, and I was. The story line makes sense but because of the plodding pace of the movie I was hard pit to pay attention. The night scenes were particularly aggravating because I had a hard time following the action. I watched in HD and just could not make out what was happening. It made me feel as though the director was trying to save money on effects. By the time the film was coming to an end I was frustrated and upset that I had actually spent money on this mess. The Godzilla creature was good and his size very believable . The other creatures just didn't make the cut in their portrayal. This film is so forgettable that I am having trouble remembering it as I write. And the human characters are so forgettable as to be laughable.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Despite having giant monsters and scenes of civilization being devastated, these are just the backdrop for the human characters as they struggle to survive. Replace Godzilla with a volcano, tsunami, asteroid, or any other random catastrophic event and the movie would not change. Unacceptable. I went into this movie somewhat hopeful despite having heard the negative criticism because I love Godzilla. I was thoroughly disappointed. To give credit where credit is due: the CG effects were well done. If you have no love for giant monsters and just want to see The Day After Tomorrow or Dante's Peak again, then by all means go for it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Scorsese's statement made for some amusing news and debates. Well, since it can be fun to argue about films, I think that I will provide my opinion as well. In general, I think that Scorsese is right. The most successful films in Hollywood now, the films that make the most money, can be compared to theme park rides, but I wouldn't place the blame for this on Marvel or on superhero movies. Companies like the Walt Disney Company want to make as much money as possible. This is why they make films that are meant to appeal to as many people as possible. This is why they also screen their films in other countries, particularly in China, where there is a large capitalist market. These films can't have much violence or nudity in order to be suitable for children. They have to contain some action and some spectacle. They have to contain at least a little humor. They usually feature appealing and famous movie stars like Dwayne Johnson. Most importantly, they have to be entertaining. These films also feature propaganda from the establishment, like most other films. Because these big budget films have to have all of these and other elements, they end up being formulaic and not very memorable. They are meant to entertain, to get people into cinemas, to make as much money as possible, and nothing more. This routine has actually existed for many decades already in the West, but, because it has become wearisome in the last decade or two, even major newspapers are now printing articles about it. It's unlikely that people will see these big budget films more than once because they're not very well made now and because there isn't much substance to them. But I think that Marvel isn't to blame for this. And superhero movies in general aren't to blame for this. Formulaic big budget films have existed before Disney got into the habit of releasing several such films through its studios every year. I think that they existed even before the 1970s, when Steven Spielberg made the blockbuster Jaws (1975) and when George Lucas made the blockbuster Star Wars (1977). It's just that they used to be a lot better and more memorable. I think that there's nothing wrong with making entertaining, action-packed movies. There should be variety in cinema. Not every film has to be a drama film. Before big budget science-fiction movies, or big budget action movies, or big budget superhero movies, or even big budget animated movies became the norm in Hollywood, Hollywood studios made big budget Westerns, big budget historical epics, and big budget adventure films. Examples include King Kong (1933), Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), The Sign of the Cross (1932), Duel in the Sun (1946), Unconquered (1947), The Robe (1953), 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), The Ten Commandments (1956), Ben-Hur (1959), How the West Was Won (1962), Cleopatra (1963), or Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Since then, genres like the Western and the Historical Epic have lost their popularity. These films were also meant to entertain and to get as many people as possible into cinemas. Therefore, I think that the problem now isn't with the fact that Western studios are trying to make as many big budget blockbusters or as many superhero movies as possible but with the fact that such films are worse and more formulaic than they used to be. Disney is simply the most obvious offender in this respect because of its size and success. Not only big budget blockbusters have been getting worse in the last decade or two. Drama films, comedy films, horror films, romantic films, and all the other films have been getting worse too. The reason why people pick on Marvel is because of Marvel's popularity and success. Marvel follows the same formula, or at least a similar formula, as the other studios. What makes Marvel different is that it does this better. Films by Marvel Studios, with Kevin Feige at the head, end up being better than films by other studios. I think that this is the reason why Marvel has become successful. Marvel has even created its own cinematic universe that has mass appeal. Sure, Marvel films aren't masterpieces of filmmaking, but almost all of them are still good, entertaining films, and this is the reason why people go to see them. Frankly, I'd rather see a Marvel film than another dull Hollywood drama film or another dull Hollywood horror film. I can bring up a film like Godzilla (2014) as an example. I went to see this film at a cinema right after it was released. Back then, I was younger and I didn't know as much as I do now. I also paid attention to the opinions of film critics. Now I know that most Western critics are bought and paid for, and they praise films that they get pressured to praise. Anyway, because Godzilla got praised by many critics when it was released, I was somewhat excited to see it, although even then I was beginning to realize that almost all of the films that are being made are dull and have no replay value. Godzilla turned out to be a bad film, with characters that aren't at all interesting, with a monster that rarely appears, with a bland music score, with poor direction, and with all the other problems that are characteristic of modern films. It became a memorable viewing experience for me because this film simply bored me. I couldn't wait for it to end. But I stayed until the end of the film because I like to finish watching a film once I begin watching it. Looking back, I now realize why many (controlled) people praised this film while also criticizing and denigrating the 1998 Godzilla film, which is much better and more entertaining. The film from 1998 features criticism of the military, and the film from 2014 promotes the military. The main character, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, is a navy lieutenant. In other words, the film from 2014 features propaganda that the establishment approves of, and this is why this bad film gets lionized by the bought and paid for film critics. Anyway, I now realize that studios in the West just can't make good films anymore. Sure, they sometimes release fine or passable films. For example, I enjoyed seeing Free Birds (2013), Men in Black 3 (2012), Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010), Kick-Ass (2010), Horrible Bosses (2011), X-Men: First Class (2011), Pitch Perfect (2012), or Rise of the Guardians (2012). But such films are uncommon now, and great films are almost non-existent. This problem doesn't apply only to the movie industry in the West. It applies to all of the other industries as well. Western people simply can't make great things anymore. They make dull and bad-looking cars. They make bad music that isn't memorable or enjoyable. They write dull, simple, and boring books. They make simple and bad-looking art. They build bland buildings that sometimes contain structural problems. They make food that often isn't cooked well or food that is dull even if it's supposed to be fancy. Western fashion trends are boring and not memorable. Do I have to go on? I can of course use words like ""sucks"" or ""stinks"" when it comes to some of the things that get made in the West now, but I prefer to be polite. Anyway, this is my take on the state of cinema in the West. In the last few years, I have rarely gone to see new films in theaters. Of course, one of the big reasons why this is so is because you now have to have a vaccine pass in order to get into a cinema. But the biggest reason is because I now realize that almost all of the films that get released aren't worth my time because of their bad quality. I'm not in my late teens or early twenties anymore, and I would rather spend my time on doing something that I think is worthwhile. On a more positive note, I have finished watching the third and fourth seasons of Cobra Kai. I've already made a post in which I pointed out that I like this show, though I don't think that it's as good as some people claim. For me, it's certainly not better than The Karate Kid (1984), which is one of the best teen movies of the 1980s. I don't really like The Karate Kid Part II (1986) because I think that the new characters aren't that interesting and because the setting (Okinawa) is boring, at least in this film. The Karate Kid Part III (1989), however, is more than a guilty pleasure for me. It's a film that I really like. It's silly but entertaining. It features some good fight scenes, just like the first film. The score by Bill Conti is used to good effect. And the new villain, played well by Thomas Ian Griffith, is absurd and memorable at the same time. Anyway, while Cobra Kai is certainly nothing special when it comes to filmmaking, it continues to be entertaining. I think that the acting of some of the actors in the main cast has improved. And Thomas Ian Griffith delivered the goods yet again in his role as Terry Silver. I think that except for William Zabka, Thomas Ian Griffith is the best actor in the cast. By the way, why has a third season of The Boys not been released yet? The Boys is another show that I enjoyed watching in 2019 and in 2020. Oh well. I guess that I'll have to watch Lost in Space (2018) instead.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Trying not to spoil anything, the whole first hour of the film could have been cut out without too much impact to the overall experience.Whats more, the film is riddled by immense plot holes and laughable scenes where the humans are simply too stupid to notice the 70 story tall monsters walking right past them. I have to say the monsters in this film were incredible stealthy for their size, managing to sneak past pretty much the whole US military. It is almost worth a watch just as an example on how not to make a film.Overall, the film is riddled with plot holes, has bad action scenes, is boring and the introduction of Bryan Cranston is just a simple gimmick.

There are too many loopholes and unanswered questions...The best way to describe this is like a ""between the lines"" movie... so imagine Godzilla came out, then they brought out a special edition feature which was a movie made that shoots all the in between bits you weren't bothered about... that pretty much sums it up.After watching the movie I felt emotionally dead to the Godzilla franchise...

I absolutely loathed it. I went into the cinema with high expectations and came out with a frown. There was no character development, no real plot, except for the U.S government (more so the navy/army) attempting to stop a malevolent creature. Godzilla is portrayed as a hero in this movie, and I have to say, I greatly disliked that. I actually hated the fact that they added more creatures. I deemed it to be completely unnecessary and a pathetic attempt to change things up from the original plot. I couldn't wait until the movie would be over. It had no theme either, which is amongst the most important elements of a movie. The acting was below average, and Bryan Cranston's role in the movie was over-exaggerated in the trailers. I thought he would have been the star, but instead, Aaron Taylor - Johnson appeared as the star. It's extremely predictable, and is nothing better than a bad action movie made only for the shock in the viewer.

Elizabeth Olsen is dreadful, stiff and plain vanilla as you can get. If she can sing..stick to that. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as zero screen appeal. So lame its hard to describe the acting.Gareth Edwards the director, should be ashamed to cash his paycheck.The storyline goes: Janjira (Japan) nuclear plant is mysteriously destroyed with most hands lost including supervisor Joe Brody's colleague and wife, Sandra. Years later, Joe's son, Ford, a US Navy ordnance disposal officer, must go to Japan to help his dad who obsessively searches for the truth of the incident.In doing so, father and son discover the disaster's secret cause on the wreck's very grounds. This enables them to witness the reawakening of a threat (some monster other than Godzilla)to all of Humanity, which is made all the worse with a second secret revival elsewhere.Against this problem, the only hope for the world may be Godzilla, but the challenge for the King of the Monsters will be great even as Humanity struggles to understand the destructive ally they have.

But sadly the experience turned out to be quite weird, since the film was completely different from the expectations raised and went on a surprisingly contrasting path dealing with nuclear plants, radiations, scientific researches and heavy gadgets instead of the monster.In fact the most amusing news is that this time we don't have one but two distinctive varieties of Godzillas (3 in numbers) who fight with each other as rivals. The original monster we saw in the 1998 version plays the 'Good hearted Godzilla"" coming out as a savior killing the other two, only to return back into the sea probably for a long rest before the next sequel. Interestingly this second type here is called MUTO which means""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" looking like some giant grasshoppers with thin legs. However what hurts the most is that despite having 3 instead of 1, there is no creature to be seen in a major part of the film, especially in the initial hour talking all about the radiations and nuclear energy.Beginning well with some stunning 3D visuals and a brilliant emotional sequence between the couple in the nuclear plant (well enacted), the film goes on and on without introducing the hero (i.e. the Godzilla) for an hour or so. Plus it doesn't offer many exciting or entertaining moments later too, even in the giant fights painfully designed by the exceptional graphics team. As a result GODZILLA remains a major disappointment for most of its time with only occasional good sequences coming at intervals.In short, after AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 this is another high on technique and low on content much awaited project delivering quite less than what was being expected. It has some amazing 3D graphics but remains a non- performer on the entertainment level right till the end, unfortunately. On a lighter note, even the kids said that they wished to see GODZILLA much more than just in a small guest role.And as one of my friends said, the film can easily be summed up as, ""250 Ki Ticket Mein, Bas 35 Rupaye Ka Godzilla!""","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Admittedly it was a hell of a trailer but I remember thinking to myself there's no way the full 2 hour film can have this much intensity and excitement so it didn't seem like a true indication that it was going to be a great film. Sure enough I was right. An absolute snoozefest. The best scene in the movie made up most of the trailer and the rest was just filler.For a movie called 'Godzilla' the titular character really doesn't get a lot of screen time. This would be OK if the characters weren't such a complete bore, not to mention incredibly unlikable. Bryan Cranston was the only character that could have carried this movie from start to finish, but instead we are left with Aaron Taylor-Johnson playing a spoilt, miserable brat. I never once thought to myself ""I hope this character survives the movie"", I simply couldn't have cared less about any of them for that matter. That is never a good thing in any movie of any kind.The film relies heavily on being visually impressive. At times it is for sure. But is that enough to carry a film? No way. From what I understand 'Godzilla' movie after 'Godzilla' movie turn out to be flops and there's a very simply reason for this - the character is ultimately boring. Once you've had your first glimpse at him and maybe seen him roar once or twice there isn't a lot left to see. I see that two sequels have already been green lit. I bet right now there's a scriptwriter who's been handed the job of those thinking ""why me? It was a stretch making one movie out of this character, let alone two more"". Good luck to you sir is all I can say.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees the world under attack by ancient monsters when one comes out of hiding to set back the balance of the universe.Main Character
Lets get onto the character that the film is named after and that is Godzilla and he is awesome in the film. His look is so cool and I just love how large they made him, he is so big and the film does a great job in showing the scale of the character and just how epic he is despite the lack of screen time. Now onto the main human character, who despite the lying trailers is actually Aaron Taylor Johnson and I thought he was really bad in this film. I like him as an actor but this just wasn't a role for him and this character was so boring. He is a generic army guy and I never grew to care about him at all in the role.Supporting Characters
Now onto the character the trailer made out was the main character and that is Bryan Cranston. I love Cranston, he is an acting juggernaut and he acts rings around everybody in this film, in the first 15 minutes he delivers a tremendous performance and really makes you care about his character. It is just such a shame he isn't in the film that much and the studio lied to people to try and convince them that Walter White vs Godzilla was going to happen but it doesn't. Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn play roles in the film and I have chucked them together because they are both fine in their roles but there isn't too much depth to them and despite giving decent performances you just want a bit more. The Great Elizabeth Olsen plays Taylor Johnson's wife and I didn't really like her in the film, I just feel like she is a weak character and wastes such a great actress. I mean I also found it weird seeing Quicksilver & Scarlett Witch married and that probably affected it a bit.Story
The story has some interesting things to it, especially when it focuses on Cranston's character as he really provides the emotion for the film. You learn a bit about the origins of Godzilla and the monsters and that is done pretty well as a good introducing point for this new universe being built up. But this story just didn't get me invested in the vast amount of the characters, its hard when world ending things are happening when you don't care about the people. Also this film in particular hides Godzilla for way too long, I get the idea but we needed more Godzilla in a film called Godzilla.Script
The script has some decent dramatic dialogue and shock to hear that Cranston delivers the best of it. But this an incredibly sombre film and is incredibly heavy for a film that sees a giant lizard fighting other creatures. I'm not asking for a comedy but maybe something to lighten the mood a bit during the film.Style
The style of this film has some truly jaw droppingly amazing moment, Godzilla and the other monsters all look fantastic and are on a larger then life scale which leads to a final battle that is of epic proportions and really delivers on spectacle. The issue is and I am not sure if it is just me but I found this film to be lit very darkly, I knew cool things were happening but I couldn't see plenty of it and that infuriated me even more.Overall
Overall, I actually think this is an average film. Every time I watch this film I enjoy it less and I now realised that this isn't a particularly great film and I actually think this doesn't do Godzilla justice so maybe give it a skip.Rating - 5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We tried turning the lights off but found we were just in a dark room with lots of noise coming out of the TV.I like the Toho Godzilla films and I like Roland Emmerich's Godzilla too. I really do not like this Godzilla.First of all the monsters are all implausibly big. I get how fun is derived from giant monsters, but not only do these monsters have their heads in the clouds, the tone of the film is incredibly serious. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield a lot of the time. Seriousness and skyscraper-sized monsters don't go well together.Dialogue is poor, characterisation is tired and off the hook, poorly designed and executed monsters all round, witless, dead-serious, and with no character whatsoever, this is not a film for me.What it has done is provoke me into buying earlier Toho Godzilla films to be watched on my Region 1 player. There are some great ones to check out if you haven't already, such asGodzilla vs The Smog Monster, Son of Godzilla (BRILLIANT MONSTER EFFECTS!!!), Godzilla vs Gigan; Ebirah, Horror of the Deep; Return of Godzilla etc.I feel like they got me out of the coma Godzilla 2014 put me under.Also I would like to know why the film was met with rave reviews from critics? It has been treated as an art film that explores the non-exhaustive facets of society. Is this because the original Godzilla was about nuclear weapons and how terrible they are? So therefore this film must have some serious message to get across?It doesn't. If anything it seems to be for everything the original film was against.I'm tired of darkly-lit, implausible, thick-headed, dim-witted, CGI-ridden, factory-produced let-downs like this. Let it be forgotten about in time. Bryan Cranston has moved on so the rest of us should too.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

One way is to have a collection of CGI effects and build a story around them. The other way is to craft the story first, then build the CGI effects to fit. Godzilla belongs to the former. There are portions where you get the feeling that, yes, the computer guy is showing off his CGI here. But when the CGI comes into the real world, you get the jarring realization that the computer guy knows his bits and bytes, but has little understanding of physical laws. For example, the huge Godzilla leaves almost no wake as it travels swiftly through the water just below the surface. And the huge foot of the other monster can step on a roof without the roof tiles and rafters caving in, considering that just a portion of that foot is as high as that building. Almost as incredible was seeing the monster tender-footing around the tiny railway tracks that span the valley without so much as brushing the tracks that lie between its legs. To be fair, I slept through parts of it, something that seldom happens when I spend a small fortune watching a 3D IMAX version of a movie. Throughout my waking minutes the phrase ""What the..."" pops up over and over.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Have a look at the Godzilla poster. That'll give you an idea of what to expect. If your idea of fun is peering into a dark screen and imagining you can make out what is happening with the monster mash occurring, then you'll probably love it. I couldn't help myself from glancing at my watch.BTW there are some human characters. It's almost fraud to say the movie features Juliette Binoche. She is criminally underused and only has a brief few scenes and in most of those she wears a radiation protection suit. Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play the perfunctory happily married couple with a cute kid, who are separated by the unfolding narrative and spend much of the remainder of the movie trying to reunite, in between dodging crashing skyscrapers. In truth they had far better back stories and stronger chemistry playing the sibling super heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ken Watanabe is on hand as a token Japanese character who has a perpetual worried look on his face.In case anyone was wondering, for the umpteenth time in an SF film the Golden Gate Bridge cops a flogging again. And the odd tsunami (which has become THE go-to disaster vehicle of the 2010's) pops up to add extra havoc to the general goings on.It's pretty obvious I was unimpressed with Godzilla. But I have to admit the big guy still has his rabid following around the world, especially in the Asian markets, which helped the film make a marginal profit.All I can say, is that these audiences are very easily satisfied by a very ordinary film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong I absolutely love the design of Godzilla he looks and sounds amazing. But the focus is too much on the human characters, and not enough on it's star. This is a very talky film, and that hurts it, if i wanted to watch a film with lots of human emotions, I'd rather watch the Green Mile, this is a Godzilla film for hell sakes, not an Academy Award winner. Now the positives, it looks amazing the creature effects are phenomenal, Godzilla is fantastic when he finally appears on screen, more then halfway through the movie, it's kind of upsetting a wasted opportunity, I wanted more chaos and destruction and monsters fighting then we got, instead of listening to the boring humans. Overall I'm being a little to generous with my rating, Just a very disappointing film that should have been more, to be honest didn't really have a chance from beginning. Yes like the original, Godzilla shows up near the end of the movie, but unlike the 54' film he ends up destroying half of Tokyo leaving the city in flames, you don't get anything like that in this movie, Godzilla is like a natural disaster that unintentionally destroys rather then doing it because he wants to, which pisses me off. And he's the hero... I mean the Toho films he's never considered the hero, but more like he shows up because he super territorial, kicks ass and it just happened that it's beneficial to Japan, either way it's a below average Kaiju film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Despite, apparently, thousands dead, there is no sense of consequences. The peril is told, not felt, not really shown. Maybe that's all they could get with PG13, but in that case: make a different movie. HORRIBLE continuity and accuracy.

The scenes of mayhem are well executed but we have seen all the carnage so many times it doesn't surprise us anymore. De-sensitivity has set in and even scenes of massive waves rising and hurling towards land don't bring out any kind of excitement.

But the writing and story..The writing was alright, it could have been improved and has some inconsistencies such as being lazy at times, and not being emotionally moving or interesting really. The story was alright though it has minor flaws though most of the worldbuilding seems to make sense and the pacing was decent. The characters were poor to say the least. They felt one dimensional and they didn't feel as deep as they should have, the characters had a lot of potential but they were at the short end the stick.An enjoyable movie.

But if you like deep movies that have alot of meaning such as the Martrix then this isn't the movie to waste your time on.Though not very good or good even I hate giving movies that cost a lot of budget low ratings because I know the producers and directors put a lot of work on those.

Ruining all circuitry.Yes, someone should explain EMPs to Hollywood.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Revisiting this film after some time reveals that while it remains a fun and engaging blockbuster, it also has its pacing issues and some frustratingly dark action scenes.One of the strengths of the film is its return to Japan to explore Godzilla's origins, paying homage to the classic roots of the franchise. This, along with the backstory of the characters, adds depth and context to the monster's first appearance. The cast, featuring talents like Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen, delivers strong performances that help anchor the human element of the story.However, the movie's slow pace can be a bit of a drawback. It takes a significant amount of time before any substantial action unfolds, which might test the patience of viewers eager to see Godzilla in action. When the creatures, including Godzilla, do finally appear, many of the scenes are set in very dark environments. This obscurity makes it challenging to fully appreciate the detailed designs and the scale of the monsters, which can be frustrating.Despite these issues, the moments when Godzilla is fully visible and engaged in battle are thrilling and well-executed. The special effects and production design are top-notch, effectively bringing the massive creature and the devastation it causes to life. The film succeeds in creating a sense of awe and spectacle that is essential for a Godzilla movie.Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a fun and entertaining film that sets the stage for the subsequent entries in the franchise. While it could benefit from a faster pace and clearer action scenes, it still offers a satisfying blockbuster experience with impressive visuals and a strong cast. Fans of monster movies and the Godzilla legacy will find much to enjoy in this 2014 reboot.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
