Basically I didn't hate it and I didn't love it. It was competently made, good effects, some comedic moments and good set pieces. But it just didn't feel like something derived from a SNL skit. The joy of ghostbusters was that it was free wheeeling, that it was anarchic. That, similar to the Blues Brothers, somebody had allowed a bunch of slackers to spend millions on making a movie which to coin Bill Murray from Meatballs ""just didn't matter"". Afterlife was touching and sweet, looking back at that time with a smile and a wink. This however, was just a generic family action movie, using the brand name of the ghostbusters. It left me indifferent.","246 out of 280 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Too many Ghostbusters answered the call...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9799137/?ref_=tt_urv","andyajoflaherty","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13674288/?ref_=tt_urv","20 May 2024","Following on from the surprisingly good Ghostbusters Afterlife, Frozen Empire follows the Groobersons/Spenglers as they hunt ghosts in New York City after relocating to the original Ghostbusters' headquarters. After a particularly messy bust results in a lot of damage to the city, the now Mayor Walter Peck decides to impose some sanctions on the family - namely by not allowing Phoebe to participate, as she is just a minor. Distancing herself from the rest of the crew, she spends time with a young ghost who is trapped in purgatory, and also Ray Stanz's occult bookstore. But when Ray comes into the posession of an ancient artifact that could bring about the destruction of humanity, the Ghostbusters will need all the help they can get, past and present....After enjoying the previous film (despite its flaws), I was quite excited to see where they would go with these new characters. Taking the action back to New York was a smart move, as it nicely scratches that nostalgia itch without it going overboard (one of my main criticisms of Afterlife). The characters all work together well and are likeable, the story is, well... typical Ghostbusters... and the special effects are great.There were quite a few little tidbits here that I really liked. I liked how the original characters all had proper purpose - Ray has his knowledge and his bookstore and acts as an info resource, Venkman is a consultant who helps with any phsychic investigations, and Winston is the millionaire who funds a giant Ghostbusters research facility. It goes beyond them just having nostalgic cameos for the sake of it. And speaking of the facility, they have various different ghosts they are studying and interacting with, which is quite cool.However, the film does have issues. A lot of the time it struggles to be funny, with a lot of the gags falling flat. I know these actors can be funny, they just need to have a better script written for them. The only actor who lands his gags consistently is, unsurprisingly, Bill Murray. I know he ad-libs a lot in his films, so if he did here that may explain why, but he stands out against an otherwise largely unfunny experience.Another issue is the Phoebe/Melody sub plot, which felt hugely out of place and I wouldn't be surprised if it were included to tick a box somewhere. Why does this ghost look like a normal human when practically EVERY other ghost in this franchise is grotesque? Like a said, it feels out of place and grinds the pacing to a crawl.But by far the biggest problem, is that there are just far too many characters. At the climax of the film there are 11, yes ELEVEN Ghostbusters, and they are all fighting for screentime so bad the film completely loses its focus in the final act. In fact the final act in general felt a bit limp - they built up this main adversary who went down far too easy.All in all, this film feels more like a Ghostbusters celebration rather than a meaningful story extension, which is fine because I love this franchise and these characters, but still they seem to struggle to stand up to the sheer genius, brilliance, and perfectly executed first film. From here they need to dial it back a bit, focus on the new characters and streamline the plot. Oh, and for the love of God PLEASE get someone in who can write decent gags....","16 out of 16 found this helpful.

It's not nearly as good as Ghostbusters Afterlife but it's about what you would expect from a follow up. The new ghosts and elements added to the lore are very cool and some of the visuals are very nice. Some of the jokes are very funny and some aren't. The cast is pretty good here but nothing exceptional performance wise. The action scenes are ok but the final battle is pretty short and a little anti climactic. The original crew is just there to be there with the exception of Dan Aykroyd, who actually has quite a bit of screen time. If you're a Ghostbusters fan you'll probably have a good time with it but don't expect to be blown away.","156 out of 202 found this helpful.

I seriously wanted to love this movie. The TV spots and trailers looked awesome. This had to be the best Ghostbusters sequel yet! Nope. In fact, this might be the worst.There's a great Ghostbusters film in this movie. There really is but studio meddling hurt the film. My first time viewing it, I walked out of the film feeling like I just got out of work. Throughout most of the film I struggled to care about anything going on and I was drained. When the actual Ghostbusters show up, I perked up a little bit. However, I should be loving this. All that stuff at the library should have been beyond exciting but not even that.Then when I saw it again, I figured out the exact moment when I stopped caring and I struggled to get that same investment I had in the film up to this point. That scene is when Phoebe and Podcast and go into that diner for a ghost call and Phoebes ghost girlfriend is sitting at one of the tables. It was that moment and that moment on where my investment in the film cratered and I tried desperately to get back into the film.These two characters are nothing but a vacuum that sucks the fun and investment of the film into a netherworld that you will never get back. Their scenes mainly consist of ""Hey hey sure whatever"" and I'm left shouting ""what is the point? Move forward! Stop wasting time."" And apparently, the studio told the filmmakers they had to cut 20 minutes of this movie two weeks before it premiered. Why werent these scenes cut down?So many characters and scenes could have gotten the axe with the plethora of characters flooding this film to the point where they move the brother to Slimer duties that had no real purpose in the film. Sunny and Podcast return and add nothing. They should have eliminated them and gave the scenes from Podcast to the brother.But theres lots to like too. Dan Ackroyd is at his best here and I'm glad Winston and Murray return too. They have a couple cool new ghosts like Pukey and Possessor that were great additions and say what you want about the new villain, but at least finally the Ghostbusters face a new villain.I'm hoping for a directors cut because there is a lot to like in a movie that is dragged down by an extremely boring subplot that gives you Rings of Power vibes in a potentially great Ghostbusters film.","28 out of 35 found this helpful.

Turning McKenna Grace into some sort of boring Harry Potter character was a big mistake and the plot is full of the usual unbelievable Mary Sue tropes.It's strange to me how it seems impossible for Hollywood to turn out a decent movie recently. Constant reshashing of old stories or franchises, with the inevitable eye-rolling tropes being added to make it more pc just smacks of desperation.I could possibly understand the misguided attempts at girl-bossing every movie if it meant interesting plots, good acting, and clever writing, but fails so hard.

So much promise in the first half hour, but then more new characters, more side stories, lots of one liners, and then...a quick wrap up and credits roll. Snore.

I don't think the direction they try to take for the characters from Afterlife makes the most logical sense. There is also too many new characters alongside the ones introduced in Afterlife as well as the OG's like Ray and such. Too many characters to juggle so the ball gets dropped on all of them. Also, I know Afterlife gets some flack for references and Easter egg like fan service, sometimes called ""nostalgia bait"" I actually thought the way that film handled that stuff wasn't just empty nostalgia bait, I think there is a difference between that and fan service that isn't empty, that works in a story that is actually good. This film ironically IS an example of something that actually does have empty nostalgia bait in a story that feels like it doesn't know what it's suppose to be about. Is it the worst movie ever? No, but I think we also deserved way better. If you ask me, I think Ghostbusters: Afterlife should have been the last one. If there isn't a great script there, then let's just let the series rest.","68 out of 87 found this helpful.

However, this is the closest these have ever come to being horror and like Afterlife, it remains a lot of fun as an Amblin throwback.The biggest issue is there's just too many characters in this one. Everyone is good, even Bill Murray obviously phoning it in. Its just doesn't succeed in the attempt to balance returning characters, the originals and some new faces, resulting in Finn Wolfhard, Celeste O'Connor and Logan Kim getting left by the wayside.Out of those who do get enough, Mckenna Grace remains a great lead and her growing relationship with Paul Rudd is the heart of this one. Kumail Nanjiani is by far the best new addition and the main source of humour here. Dan Aykroyd clearly loves returning to this character and the enthusiasm he brings is infectious.Gil Kenan's direction starts off strong with a tense opening and then adds another good car chase to this franchise. His greatest strengths lie in the darker moments with the solid atmosphere and a surprising amount of suspense for a family friendly blockbuster. Also, this generally looks nice with CG and practical effects that go further than the actual budget.","59 out of 103 found this helpful.

Starring Paul Rudd, the film is essentially about a powerful ghost/god trying to destroy the world. The crew responsible for stopping this ghoul features a multitude of different characters from previous Ghostbusters movies, combined with a few new faces. This film is jam packed with different characters and plotlines. It reaches a point of oversaturation, however, where the film seems to be relying on nostalgia and throwing as many recognizable figures on the screen as it can. Still, I have to say I enjoyed the film overall. With the volume of jokes, there were many misses, but also lots of successful humor. There are a few instances where dumb jokes land because of the delivery. The cast does a solid job with comedic timing, despite some of the middling writing. The film also doesn't try to be too deep. It knows its place as a fun, goofy movie about hunting ghosts, and for the most part, stays within its lane. The action is fun, and the characters are likable.

True lightning in a bottle that was due to a number of factors, with the main ones being the chemistry between the cast, the setting, the innovative special effects, and the wonderfully wry screenplay that tied it all together.Afterlife was an okay attempt to bring the series into the modern age, however it fell into the ""soft reboot"" trap of excessive fan service and heavily rehashing the story of the first film to the detriment of its own identity in the franchise.Frozen Empire gives fans something more along the lines of what they really wanted from a long-belated sequel: new ghosts, new gadgets, lots of Dan Aykroyd and improved integration of the rest of the OG cast with some genuinely fun Murray moments.The setting is back in NYC as it should be (albeit CGI faked for the most part), which was sorely missing from the previous attempt. As a result, it feels much more like a proper Ghostbusters film this time around.However, it is messy and overstuffed with pointless/cringe characters, leaving the screenplay to desperately justify their presence to a ridiculous degree toward the end. There's questionable story logic (especially concerning why some characters from Afterlife are present in NYC), and your mileage may vary when it comes to the teen/family drama. Then, the villain is rushed and everything wraps up too quickly... not to mention the over reliance on CG... but in spite of all these gripes I was less offended overall than expected.If you're not a fan of the franchise, Frozen Empire won't win you over, but if you are, there's a lot to like here, in particular the mostly respectful treatment of the legacy characters.

Instead of inviting the audience to think and interact, they merely provide short-term entertainment through childish and tiresome imagery. They are recognized as a superficial and juvenile experience that does not truly seek the viewers' genuine attention.

If you are even a casual fan of the original movies, you will enjoy this new entry into the, hopefully, expanding Ghostbusters universe. This was the most fun I've had at the movies since Top Gun: Maverick.

I really like the 1984 original and the sequel was pretty good. The reboot in 2016 was ok but I thought the franchise was dead. Afterlife revived the franchise. It was a great mix of new characters and had enough well placed nostalgia. Frozen Empire is unfocused and relies way to much on nostalgia that just dies land as well and seems more desperate and is all over the place.The story is set in New York with the Spengler family living and ghostbusting there. The cast from Afterlife is back. The focus again is on Phoebe played by Mckenna Grace which is good because she is the best a part of the film. The problem here is that the other characters are almost there just to appear. Paul Rudd is the biggest star here but really dies nothing other than have a couple of decent funny lines. But the rest of the family is just barely there. The nostalgia feels so racked on. Yes, three of the original cast members and a coupme if supporting characters are back but it all feels forced. Where Afterlife earned it's nostalgic moments. This film has them and it feels forced.There are sone funny moments and sone good special effects and it's not bad but it just feels that they wanted to stuff the film with so much that it is a total mess....Grade: C.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

James Acaster's addition adds a delightful dynamic to the team, showcasing his comedic prowess alongside the seasoned Ghostbusters.

"6","/10","Disappointing but Still Fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9693463/?ref_=tt_urv","Monsieur_Sardo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23286208/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2024","Admittedly, I found this film more enjoyable simply because I am a die hard fan of Ghostbusters. That being said, I still think this is not a bad film to see in theaters. It just feels like it could have been much better.The Good Stuff
The film has several strong points. For one, it really makes you feel as if you are inside of the firehouse. It transports the audience from floor to floor, showing you new areas and also showing you how the firehouse is connected- which is cool if you're a GB nerd.Frozen Empire is also fairly good at creating a ""lived in"" world feel of a Ghostbusters New York. I didn't necessarily mind the brief cameos of returning characters. I know some will say they only function as nostalgia bait (which yeah- that's a bit true) , but I also think they provide the sense that the Ghostbusters have a history in this version of New York- and it oddly gave a nice sense of escapism.Also, I have to say that the old cast (especially Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson) really shine in this film. Despite the fact that they are all up there in age, they injected a life and spirit to the story that at times felt sorely lacking when they weren't there.The Plot
I found that the plot is where this film really struggles. Much of this can be attributed to the ridiculous number of characters it boasts. On top of almost all of the original characters from Afterlife returning, we have several new characters unique to this film as well as much larger roles for members of the original cast. I liked certain characters from Afterlife, but the ways they're shoe horned into the film really make you wonder why they have to be in this particular story. At the very least it would have made more sense for Winston to have created a ""Junior"" Ghostbusters summer internship ( for all of them) as opposed to the various ways these characters come to New York City.The sheer number of characters creates a lot of subplots - many of which fell quite flat for me. Despite the fact that it starts with a car chase through New York, the film feels like it's clearing its throat for the majority of its 2 hour run time rather than hitting its stride.The editing of this film ( basically all of the various subplots put together) gave me the feeling that I was watching a loose collection of scenes that were pasted together- almost as if different versions of the script were put together to make this final version. The leads to a tonally inconsistent feeling. Frozen Empire often feels like it's veering from The Real Ghostbusters cartoon to Twilight to quirky Marvel-esque kind of humor. I hate to say, but I think a lot of the jokes in Frozen Empire fell flat because of this.The Sense of RealismThough it was admittedly a story about scientists catching ghosts, the original Ghostbusters had a sense of realism to ground it just enough . You felt that they were starting this fantastical business in the real world.This film at times is more reflective of the Real Ghostbusters cartoon and Ghostbusters 2 as opposed to the original. There are certain events that happen early on in this film that detract from the more grounded tone of Afterlife and the original. I want to be perfectly clear that I am referring to the human side of events and not ghosts.Essentially, there are a number of pretty blatant plot contrivances that hurt the film. I know the audience for this will be children, but I found certain things just blatantly didn't make sense as to how they were able to happen- and made the world seem inconsistent.The Ending (NO SPOILERS just what ifs)Okay, so again, NO SPOILERS will be included in this section. The ending felt underwhelming. To be vague, certain things happen that have happened before- and I felt like the story doesn't do enough to make me see why this time it would be much worse. Plus, I personally think we should have gotten to the frozen-ness side of things much earlier on in the script. Instead we get very little of the big bad, and two contrived ( well what if we do this?) solutions that kind of feel like the writers pulled them out of their arse as opposed to their arsenal.It would have been neat to see the GB team split up into groups to traverse a frozen, paranormal New York City- teaming up together to fight the big bad at the end.Sadly that didn't happen.Final ConclusionI would really like to say more about this movie, but I want to avoid spoilers. Despite my complaining, I still enjoyed it and hope Jason Reitman is able to make one more. It would be nice if he directed a third film instead of Gil Kenan.This film's main weakness is that it felt like it could have been so much more than what was released. Even with an almost 2 hour run time, there is often too much happening and a serious lack of cohesion. I would hope that a third film could be a lot tighter and have less characters- even if that meant we don't see some of our friends from Afterlife the next time around.","18 out of 35 found this helpful.

McKenna Grace and james Acaster were standouts for me, but the others were pretty weak. It felt very safe and intentionally tame, other than the bizarre teenage romance (?) sub-plot, as if it were made for children, but at the same time a lot of the references and jokes rely on knowledge of the original movie, or on culture of the 80s and 90s Especially using the original 1980s song lyrics a part of the dialog? Why?I enjoyed the historical elements, and the linguistic mystery, and the art/sculpture, and some of the visuals were good.I wish these remakes would not be afraid of redoing the theme songs. Indiana jones had the same problem. The theme songs sound horribly dated. Last years mission impossible features a fresh take on the familiar theme song, making it feel new. Using the original 1980s track is a gamble that didn't pay off. It doesn't have the same timeless quality that some songs from the 70s and 80s have.","24 out of 32 found this helpful.

I'm a huge Ghostbusters fan, so I was very upset when I finally seen this movie. The nostalgia factor is about the only good part of this movie.List of dislikes:Continuing with the politics, we have a Pakistani who ends up being a special person in the movie. Aykroyd has an Asian teen boy assisting him at his store by recording events on video, etc. We also have this teen white guy and cute black girl with white dreadlocks who are investigating the dude with the fancy artifacts for Venkman. It's all just forced, like there is a chart somewhere that shows there must be a specific amount of each race and gender represented in any given movie these days. I'm actually surprised that Miss Spengler wasn't dating or married to a black guy, as most marriages these days are interracial, or same sex. It's annoying and it totally takes you out of the show when you see it.I think that's enough for you to see why I cannot recommend this film. I even re-watched Ghostbusters: Afterlife after this, and I didn't like it as much as I did initially. I think the reason most of us enjoyed it originally was because the 2016 version was very, very bad, and we were all just so happy to get a version that didn't ""suck"".

The build-up to his imminent arrival is pretty intense and quite a satisfying pay-off.Of the films at the very least, I'd have to argue that this is the most formidable and intimidating enemy that the boys in beige (and girls too - seeing Melnitz in uniform was so satisfying) have encountered thus far.Each of the characters already established were just as good as you could expect from the preceding films and they were built upon decently enough.. namely Phoebe, Ray Stantz and then perhaps Gary Grooberson in that order.Patton Oswalt and James Acaster were colorful and very welcoming additions to the group and made it adequately and pragmatically clear that even our favorite characters who seem to know more than most, still don't have all the answers.Certain elements may feel somewhat forced or far-fetched for some audiences. Others might first point fingers at Kumail Nanjiani or Emily Alyn Lind's characters. However, recalling (at the very least) that Frozen Empire is akin to an episode of the animated series, these seeming imperfections lie solely within the construct of the story and were easily dismissed.Both Kumail and Emily portrayed their characters and their roles within the story really quite well and admirably.On my wife's part and most of the audience, Paul and Kumail were the most entertaining and got the most laughs. There was alot going on including plenty of action and cool new gear.Not much else can be said but that I had a lot of fun and hope to see more just like it down the road.","88 out of 161 found this helpful.

I have watched the originals many times I can't remember. I watched the RGB religiously as a kid and rewatched with my kids. I've read all the comics over the years and collected numerous toys and collectibles. It's safe to say I'm a Ghostbusters fan. I enjoyed GB AL as a love letter to Spengler and hoped it would launch a new franchise. GB FE is fun and exciting has great nostalgia and Ray is truly Ray in this one. Venkman is awesome in his small role and the new equipment is brilliant. The Slimer side story is nice, but would have liked to have seen more. I was a bit disappointed by the new GBs characters as they were under used and fairly randomly placed, Winston seemed off character in parts and again was under used. Some new ghosts were really cool, would have been good to see more of them, but the Pheobe story felt really awkward and distracted from the pace of the movie. It felt like it was shoehorned in and made to be a pivotal moment. It was unnecessary and created more questions than it answered, but questions I didn't care for the answer to. The time spent on their could have been easily spent on more worthwhile scenes that seem to have been deleted since the trailers released. I hope Sony listen to feedback and continue the franchise in the same vain as the originals, fun, exciting, hilarious, quick witted and full of cool Ghosts and equipment.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

I'm in my 50's so when I new film like this or Indiana Jones or Top Gun comes out I'm super excited to relive my teenage years for 2 hours in the cinema.Unfortunately Ghostbusters Frozen Empire didn't fulfill the excitement I was looking forward to since last summer. Yeah they've got the gang back together, yeah New York is once again at threat and as you'd expect in 2024 the special effects are superb. So it's exactly what I'd ask for isn't it?Sadly for me, it's just lacklustre which is a shame as I genuinely loved Afterlife a couple of years ago. I try not to spoil it for people yet to see a film so I won't give anything away - but there's a scene with Paul Rudd singing, you'll know exactly what I mean when you watch it. It's the most cringy and forced thing I've ever seen on film. The ""bad guy"" was great but criminally under used too.Judge for yourself though, I wouldn't like to see the film flop because as much as bringing old franchises doesn't always work sometimes we get good films and I believe Ghostbusters is a franchise worth having in the future, although maybe the old gang need to hang up their proton packs.","54 out of 83 found this helpful.

The newest Ghost is emblematic of the futility inherent in trying to find a formula that repeats but renews one of our culture's most beloved comedy horror flicks.Even with original 'busters Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, this new version lacks the snarky joy of that first edition and arguably one or two subsequent attempts. Because the cast of characters is too large for its reinvention, this Ghostbusters qualifies as a hot mess of personnel left hanging and incidents sometimes shoe-horned in for what purpose is not apparent to me.I will stand out from my colleagues and like daughter Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), dorky with round glasses (think Harry Potter) and a big brain, who seems to fall in love with a sylphlike ghost (Emily Alyn Lind), whose relationship writer/director Gil Kenan and co-writer Jason Reitman lack the courage to introduce as a brand-new motif, lesbian action. Too bad because the film needs serious updating.As the recurring intergenerational good guy, Paul Rudd has little significant to do than try of integrate himself into The Spengler family and more importantly, find a place for the always outsider, Phoebe. Rudd doesn't add much more than he does as Antman. Oh, well, he's a nice guy.But then nice is this innocuous installment, a dull extension of a once promising franchise. It's time for Murray to become a ghostly presence himself lending a bit of needed snark but not committing his soul. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is a chilling reminder of the glory that was.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

The film boasts impressive special effects, bringing icy ghosts and a monstrous villain to life. The classic proton packs and traps get a workout in some fun, action-packed sequences, particularly the battle within a frozen skyscraper.While the story is a bit predictable - a forgotten artifact unleashes ghostly mayhem - it serves as a decent excuse to unleash everyone's proton packs. Bill Murray gets some grumpy one-liners, and Dan Aykroyd shines with a more involved role. The younger cast, particularly Phoebe Spengler, holds its own, adding fresh energy to the team dynamic.However, Frozen Empire struggles to recapture the comedic spark of the original. Jokes land with a thud at times, and the film relies heavily on nostalgia. The emotional core, focusing on the Spengler family legacy, feels underdeveloped.Die-hard Ghostbusters fans will likely enjoy the reunion and the return of familiar foes. Yet, Frozen Empire feels more like a fun amusement park ride than a groundbreaking sequel. It's a chilly thrill, but not quite a full-blown blizzard of entertainment.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's a great pace that keeps things moving while giving us time to marinate and get caught up with the lives of the characters. Comedy is present throughout the movie as styles blend with witty quirks, sarcastic jabs, and some situational sliming that is always a running gag in this series. Alongside those familiar styles come great references to the series, adding a fun element of egg hunting and inside information that adds to the enjoyment for nerds like me. Yet, the world-building and design of ghosts elevate the movie to theater elements with the stylized creatures that linger in New York. The main villain, in particular, has quality build in his movements, voice, and elongated features that never go overboard, but still feel like the villain from the cartoons. And the other ghosts have their unique flair that keeps to the vibes of the series. When the origin story gets added, the opening acts give those designs even more flair and further bring the ghosts (ironically) to life. And all of it with fluid animations and movement that Hollywood can bring when they commit their resources and time. Finally, the character development is good for me on some of the characters. Several stories have a relevant bite to me with performances that help bring them out in full force and sometimes convey the perfect emotion that sells those heartfelt moments to the perfect degree.DISLIKES:Imbalanced CharactersA Rushed EndingCheesy MomentsToo Much Humor?A Villain That Doesn't Live Up To The Build-UpSummary: As I feared, Frozen Empire does put a freeze on quality the further you get into the film. One aspect that suffered through much of the movie was the balance of characters in this very star-packed movie. Several have clear focus and favoritism getting much screen time, but some like Trevor and Janine get left in the dust with horrible screen time and use in a film of this caliber. These story elements were much weaker than I expected and did not feel needed in this movie given how diluted their roles were. Even the big bad guy, Garraka, was underutilized, more threatening and menacing offscreen than when he filled the stage with his imposing figure. A shame given how cool he looked and the potential of his powers. Even more so, the jokes interrupted some of the horror and story elements when silliness was needlessly extended or integrated. These moments are few, but when they appear they throw off the momentum of the moment for me and are often not that funny. And like the humor, the sentimental moments come off cheesy as well, approaching soap opera levels that again did the opposite of what I think they wanted. Finally, all of this culminates in a lackluster ending that felt rushed, simplified, and heavily edited to something incomplete. It ties things up nicely, but all the things in my Dislikes feel magnified and duller compared to Afterlife's fantastic ending. And that build-up to the last battle was wasted, as the finale felt very mundane and dead upon arrival by the time we got to fighting the ice specterThe VERDICT:
I had fun with much of Ghostbuster's latest entry. It's a very fun movie with entertaining antics, a good pace, and plenty of humor to keep things in the entertainment avenue. The actors were great and the world-building/design is stunning, making the busting adventure as life-like as they can to keep up with the modern-day graphics without sacrificing quality. In all honesty, the movie had another ride for being an awesome spectacle with a touching finish and that same heartwarming ambiance that Afterlife brought with it. Sadly, the final act seemed to trip up the movie taking the epic climax and shoving it into a rushed and weakened state that felt off compared to the movie. With imbalanced characters, a misused villain, and silly elements getting in the way of the spooky story, it felt a step back given the promise of the trailers. Still, the movie's fun elements still were enough to encourage getting out and seeing this film and hopefully at the theater as well. My scores are:Comedy/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.","14 out of 35 found this helpful.

Movie Review -Ghostbusters Frozen Empire Review: The team of Ghostbusters Afterlife reunites for the sequel, Ghostbusters Frozen Empire, adding ice and fire to it but lacking soul. Even though it is the story of soul-stealing, it still doesn't find its own soul. God knows from where the idea of recreating some of the locational scenes came, but it worked on the positive side. This sequel has a few surprises that are pleasant, but it's hurt by its overanalysing gesture. As expected, the finale comes to the rescue, which was anyway supposed to provide a visual treat. It does that part very well, though. Well, there is less freezing and less use of fire, which is an underwhelming thing to experience. On the soft side, it did manage to leave us with a slight touch of nostalgia.Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is set three years after the events of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, as the old gang is joined by a couple of new members. Sadly, Callie (Carrie Coon) benches underage but her best Spangler, Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), to appease the opponent, and the rest of the gang continues to bust ghosts. During her boredom, Phoebe befriends a girl ghost, Melody (Emily Alyn Lind), who beats her at chess. However, Phoebe isn't aware of Melody's actual plan, which is to help Garraka in exchange for her free pass to the afterlife. Phoebe is fooled, and Garraka overpowers them all and arrives in style to take over the entire world. Therefore, the veteran ghostbusters must join forces with their new recruits to save the world.The idea is generally predictable, as we have the same old methods of catching ghosts, and then someone's coming to destroy the world. Not just that, but even a practical presentation is dated too. The same car, the same Spangler, the same weapons, and the same locations too. We do have brass coming in as a new thing, but you'll see in the climax that it did not really help. ""What's the worst part about being a ghost?"" asks Phoebe, to which Melody replies, ""I'll forever be 16."" Well, that's typically girlish. But wait, the next moment is all that ghostly stuff when Phoebe asks, ""And what's the best part?"" and Melody just says, ""Doing this."" And disappears. Bang on humour, I must say. I wish they had added some more funny lines like this and intrigued us. Frozen Empire's villain is one such improvement that beats many previous films, but sadly, it appears in the last quarter of the narrative, giving us very little chance of becoming acquainted with it. The Firemaster comes with the same old theories you have seen in MCU and DCU movies for more than a decade.Frozen Empire has a big cast, but teenager Mckenna Grace walks away with the maximum screen space and best screen presence. Emily Alyn Lind, aka Melody, wasn't there for a long time but has left a solid impact-i.e., more than many leading cast members. Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon could hardly find any scenes to stand out. Finn Wolfhard attempts to catch eyeballs, but it is Kumail Nanjiani who gets the eyeballs. No director wastes Bill Murray like this. That's a terrible injustice to his persona and the character we know from the beginning of the Ghostbusters franchise. Dan Aykroyd still had that one shot left, while Ernie Hudson suited up in old jam alright.Eric Steelberg's cinematography takes you back to those frames of Ivan Reitman's 1984 blockbuster. The ending sequence is pretty similar to Reitman's evergreen flick. However, the unenthusiastic screenplay and dull dialogue fail to match the ""Who you gonna call?"" magic here. The visual effects are good in the finale episode and pretty decent otherwise. Nathan Orloff and Shane Reid cut a close to 2-hour film that lags in the middle and doesn't move forward. They could have trimmed 15 minutes here and there to make it gripping. The sound design, production value, and sets seemed okay for the time, in case you were expecting something mind-blowing. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is pretty much in the same zone as Gil Kenan's last Christmas comedy as far as entertainment for different age groups is concerned. Here he had to do a little fan service, and he did that fine. It's modern storytelling and new ideas that seemed missing. Nevertheless, Kenan doesn't bore you to death like others do. Frozen Empire is fairly entertaining in that sense, but a little lower considering the burden of reviving the franchise.RATING - 5/10*","12 out of 16 found this helpful.

And let's forget Carrie Coon, who played a character in Afterlife, but here looks so bored and being uninterested, almost like she is sleepwalking through this, and Paul Rudd, who I usually like in anything, but here he comes across as dull, everything he says is unfunny, like he's doesn't know what he's talking about.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

There was a lot of world building in this film, and a lot of stuff seemed to have been left on the cutting room floor. These are my only real gripes with the film, as everything else was delivered well. Acting was on point, the plot was a well thought out story, the effects were a perfect mix of practical and CGI, and the comedy was excellently timed. The original cast makes their presence known, but doesn't cast a long shadow over the newcomers, allowing them to shine through. All in all it is a well rounded movie that has the feel of a long episode of the original cartoon series. Please go see it, and show this franchise support.","106 out of 204 found this helpful.

"","","A few niggles, but Ghostbusting worth seeing entertainment!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9694580/?ref_=tt_urv","amesmonde","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1761695/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2024","When the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an evil force, Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to save the world.Based on Ghostbusters by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, director Gil Kenan delivers high production values, solid setups, and staging. There are great special effects, fantastic cinematography from Eric Steelberg (especially the sweeping cityscapes), and a first-class fitting score by Dario Marianelli.Kenan and Jason Reitman's screenplay injects some on-the-money gags into a spooky enough Ghostbusters story. The change of location from Summerville, Oklahoma, to New York City, teased in the last film with more of NYC and the iconic firehouse, is more than welcomed, giving it a Ghostbusters feel.While it lacks the punch, charm, and simplicity of the original two, like Afterlife it has enough going on, offering some emotion and top performances from the leads including Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, and Mckenna Grace. Patton Oswalt is a great addition. Grace is particularly notable and holds her own against beloved Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and William Atherton, who reprise their roles. Aykroyd and Hudson's Lethal Weapon banter is a highlight, and Murray effortlessly steals the show.Choppy editing and the abundance of mini-marshmallow men aside, in fact, there's a little too much muddled exposition and too many characters. Kenan and Reitman shoehorn a lot of iffy subplot and unnecessary world-building shenanigans. Also, given the plot, there was a missed opportunity to bring back more ghosts from previous installments, even if briefly. Additionally, with all the appearances from past cast members, it's a pity that Sigourney Weaver's Danna Barrett and Louis Tully (Rick Moranis dragged from retirement) or an adult Oscar didn't show up.Overall, while the storytelling may be a bit wobbly, the film shines with its great special effects, atmospheric setting, spine-chilling moments, and a plethora of one-liners. These elements set the stage for another adventure with the Spengler family and gang, which would be perfectly proton-pack welcomed. Recommend.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

I felt though this had a bigger budget and more screen time for the veteran characters, however it just lost the feel of Afterlife and the earlier films. I look at all aspects of a film and though its shot very well, has great special effects, great story and great acting from all involved, when producing a sequel, its very difficult in executing the same feel as its originating source. It may come down to many things; editing and/or studio involvement. Looking at opening weekend results being on par with Afterlife and then competing with larger blockbusters the following week, recouping the budget and turning a decent profit looks grim with potential sequels looking grim. I'm not saying it's a bad film and it definitely deserves follow up sequels. Still much better than the Remake!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Even if I watched no Ghostbusters movies in the past, I comprehended all of it. So don't let that be a barrier to purchasing a ticket! No matter what your expectations were, they were fulfilled in some way, shape or form. There was an entertaining element for everybody. Mckenna Grace and Emily popped off in their roles, I enjoyed their acting. The plot between Phoebe and the ghost Melody was intriguing and mysterious, that was the highlight of the movie in my own opinion.To start, I think it had good effects. The camerawork was exceptional, and the visual aspects of the movie could have been improved with a higher budget. There was good use of non-diegetic music AND EVEN silence in some parts to create contrast. The Robert Frost quotation at the start? Are you kidding me? That singlehandedly set the tone for the movie. The colour scheme was not so diverse, mostly blue because of ice.One negative that I have is the amount of clichés, especially near the ending. The plot could have been more unique in general. The villain could have had at least some creativity! Heck, I didn't even understand what the villain Ice ghost was saying due to the heckful amount of distortion.Overall, pretty decent and entertaining watch. Great mise-en-scene, decent characters. Plot was great excluding the villain and clichés. Buy a ticket based on your preferences.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

While some aspects are impressive, others fall short in their execution. Watching the film in an IMAX cinema without the film being specifically formatted for IMAX was also disappointing.Cinematography and Editing: The cinematography in this film is impressive, with the carefully crafted closeup and wide angle scenes; however, it lacked some more medium shots. The editing is well done, keeping a good space for the scenes and structure throughout. However, some cinematic scenes disrupt the film's flow, appearing oddly placed and feeling generic. The inclusion of stone-stop motion animation is a creative choice that brings a fresh dynamic to the film with its live camera movements.Costume and Set Design: Costume design, particularly the iconic Ghostbusters car, is creatively realized, adding depth and authenticity to the visual storytelling.Writing: The script attempts to tap into contemporary themes, reflecting the tumultuous events of the 2020s, though its effectiveness is hit or miss. It sometimes feels like the storyline is striving for relevance rather than coherence.Score and Sound Design: This inconsistency extends to the soundtrack as well, which, despite being somewhat generic, effectively supports the narrative without standing out as particularly memorable. The sound design is a clear strength, enhancing the atmospheric and dramatic elements effectively.FX: The film's special effects and CGI elements vary in quality. While some of the CGI, especially the narration, adds a charming touch to the storyline, other special effects seem underwhelming and cheap.Casting and Acting: Casting choices and character development are areas where the film stumbles significantly. The actors did a good job, but they didn't fully capture the depth needed for their roles. As a result, the emotional impact of the film feels a bit shallow and more like a spoof. The second act of the film drags, leading to a lackluster viewing experience in parts.Overall, ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" is a mixed bag of innovative ideas and missed opportunities. While the film excels in certain technical aspects like cinematography and sound design, it struggles with uneven special FX and writing, inconsistent thematic execution, and shallow character development. The film entertains at some points but it doesn't go beyond the limitations of its genre. As a result, it's a fun experience, but not one that will stick with you for long.","13 out of 18 found this helpful.

There are a lot of nods to the original movies which is fun. It's great to see so many cast members back for this outing. The story is weak and with so many returning characters from the original and the 2021 offering, there is little chance for any to shine. The focus in the most part is on Pheobe Spengler as she deals with being too young to be a Ghostbuster, which is a shame as Pheobe can at times be an unlikeable character.It was fun having Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd back providing some comedic relief and Ernie Hudson rounding out the original gang. Kumail Nanjiani Got the most laughs as Nadeem in a film lacking in comedic moments. The baby Stay Puft's are back but sadly they don't get enough screen time.Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is good but it had potential to be better than that especially with the setting switching back to New York City. I don't think there's too much more scope for more Ghostbusters with 3 movies in less than 10 years if you include the Paul Feig 2016 reboot, unless Sigourney Weaver can be coaxed to return...","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

This sequel is pretty much in the same vein. But i enjoyed it a bit more because the original cast were in it more, and the big bad was someone new this time.There is alot going on in the movie, as they really want to make more of these. So there are alot of characters coming and going. It really felt like they were throwing everything at you hoping something would stick. But this wasn't bad as it made for a movie that wasn't boring. Out of the newcomers Kumail Nanjiani gets the laughs, and there were plenty of gags in the movie overall. Though not all of the jokes worked.Overall its a fun movie that largely plays it safe, and doesn't take any chances. An example of this is at the end when it feels like Bill Murray was going to say something huge that got cut to keep someone happy. The other thing some will find missing was that emotional gamble the last one had. So its not brilliant or anything. But a decent family watch.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Directed and co-written by Gil Kenan (""Monster House"", ""City of Ember"", ""A Boy Called Christmas""), it falls short of its predecessor in a mediocre follow-up that proves the series has now run its course.Two years after the events of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"", Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon) and Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd) decide to move their family from Oklahoma to New York City. Setting up home in the old Ghostbusters' firehouse, the Spenglers work alongside the original team members Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), and Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) in an underground research lab that holds all of their captured ghosts in specially modified enclosures. One day, local resident Nadeem (Kumail Janjiani) discovers an ancient artefact that unleashes an evil supernatural energy capable of trapping the entire world in a permanent ice age. With the fate of the living now in turmoil, both the new and old Ghostbusters must set aside any generational differences to save the Earth from becoming frozen solid.After decades of patiently waiting, fans of the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise were finally treated to a third film in the series with ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"". This legacy sequel, which served as a belated continuation of the original two films, managed to find ways to appeal to the current generation while simultaneously paying respects to the older fans who made the series popular in the first place. Though not without its faults, fans such as myself found the film to be a satisfactory follow-up that left us with a good feeling after watching, which is exactly what I had hoped for leading up to its release. If it were up to me, I would have chosen to end the series here on a high note but considering its success at the box office, it was inevitable that Sony Pictures would produce more films somewhere along the pipeline. In the year of the franchise's 40th anniversary, we have ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"", a sequel to a legacy sequel that fails to milk any fresh or exciting ideas out of this beloved series.Admittedly, the film does begin on a promising note, which I initially assumed was setting the mood for the rest of the story. In a fun opening scene, we watch as the Spengler family chase a large dragon ghost throughout the streets of Manhattan in the Ecto-1. As the spectre weaves its way through the various buildings, the Spenglers hastily try to catch it using an array of devices, including a drone with a ghost trap fitted to the top. Upon successfully bringing the creature's rampage to an end, the Spenglers are reprimanded for the collateral damage they caused in the process, later receiving a lengthy scolding from a certain environmental agent. From this point forward, the film takes a decidedly dour tone, with a general lack of excitement beyond the odd nostalgic references to the older movies. Each of the original two films had a nice blend of humour and horror that helped them become memorable staples of 80s pop culture. With this entry, however, I failed to remember even one remotely amusing part of the film once the end credits started rolling.This brings us to one of the film's biggest problems; the poor attempts at humour. Whether it's a case of weak direction, a subpar script, or a combination of both, every one of the film's comedic moments fell flat. For example, in one scene Gary tries to motivate Callie during a time where she is depressed and feels unable to continue working. He does this by quoting the lyrics to the ""Ghostbusters"" theme song, a tune anyone with even a passing knowledge of the series has heard at some point. What could have been an affectionate homage to the franchise's iconic theme becomes an awkward moment that drags on longer than it should. All the potential was there for this scene to be funny, but something felt off about the overall delivery from both Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon. The film is littered with misfired comedy just like this, which certainly puts a hamper on its already downbeat tone. In other words, what should have been cringe comedy is instead simply cringe on its own.Another problem with the film is its uninteresting story. As mentioned above, the film focuses around an ancient artefact with the ability to bring about an apocalyptic series of events. On paper, this sounds like a perfectly fine plot for a ""Ghostbusters"" film, but the execution is handled very poorly. For instance, the backstory regarding the artefact is told to the audience in a rather clunky, forced manner; by having a random character played by Patton Oswalt explain it through lengthy exposition accompanied by artistic visuals reflective of that era. Even with all that information provided, we never really feel like this is a genuine threat throughout the whole film. There's no sinister build-up, no sense of real danger, and no reason for the characters to be worried about the long term consequences of them failing their mission. As a result, I found it near impossible to become fully invested in the story this time around.However, perhaps the film's most notable undoing is in the mishandling of its characters old and new. There are simply too many character subplots intertwining at the same time that the whole film becomes cluttered. If you are going to have a film with such a large cast of characters, you better find an appropriate way to use them within the story. Unfortunately, the film fails at that in every way possible, as we are instead subjected to irrelevant plot elements that go nowhere and characters whose presence is only there for fanservice purposes only.Like in its predecessor, the film's protagonist is Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), the bespectacled young girl who follows in her grandfather's footsteps using her intellect to help capture ghosts. Yet in this film, Phoebe hardly changes all that much throughout the story, save for her desire to be taken more seriously due to her being labelled as too young to be a Ghostbuster. Her interactions with others are nothing more than surface level complaints about her age, meaning that we never really feel sorry for her on a deeper level. I assume Phoebe's character was supposed to have a more detailed arc but it was likely abandoned in favour of focusing on less important creative aspects like nostalgic fanservice.The three original ""Ghostbusters"" actors; Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson, also return for another outing as their respective characters. Unfortunately, the trio seem quite unenthusiastic to be here and each look as though they are phoning in their performances. I cannot go into too much detail about their roles in the film without giving away spoilers but I felt underwhelmed by each of their contributions to the story. Still, I will admit that it is nice to see them put on their old Ghostbusters uniforms at least one more time for us, especially after four decades since their debut. There's no denying these three are only doing this film for the paycheque, so hopefully they got their money's worth out of their participation.From the perspective of a longtime fan, ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" is a sad reminder that some IPs are doomed to be milked for all they are worth by their distribution companies. Had the story ended at ""Afterlife"", I would have been satisfied to call the film series a trilogy, but its success has now opened the door to more byproducts of corporate greed like this one. According to some research, there are more films planned for release in the future, which has me concerned as I believe there is little else in the way of ""Ghostbusters"" lore to draw inspiration from. In my humble opinion, Sony should have quit while they were ahead, but so long as ""Ghostbusters"" remains a profitable name, things will continue in this direction for a long time.I rate it 5/10.","85 out of 155 found this helpful.

I would love to live in that universe, but this universe is pretty good. I really love how they are developing these movies. Not just the kid's physical growth but growth in the story. It makes no sense that the Ghostbusters would be stuck in 1984 and they are not. Especially Winsten Zedmore. This movie and the last really seemed to want to make up for the fact that they kind of dismissed his popularity in the first set of movies to making him the pinpoint to why the Ghostbusters are back in these films.It was a huge ensemble cast. It was actually cool that so many people were in the movie even though most of them had no importance in the movie, with ofcourse the exception of Bill Muray who felt like they needed to squeeze a man in the film that did not want to be there but I'm sure the paycheck was huge just to say they have all the living Ghostbusters to make this movie cannon. On the other hand, real surprising how Kumail Nanjiani's role actually met something and worked well with a story with a lot of layers to explain the huge cast.Overall, I enjoyed myself.

I loved it and would watch it again, maybe even in the theater again even though I have my own home theater. They had a ton of potential and a ton of great ideas with the story. Unfortunately, it gets bogged down in too much of everything over the course of the film. Too many characters, too many forced funny moments, too many storylines. It had all the potential to be a 9/10 or 10/10. LOTS of fan service .. again maybe too much. Without giving away much, all of the OG GBs had more screen time here than in Afterlife. In would say they didn't best with Bill Murray. It felt like Bill Murray. The thing about the original GB was that it was funny all by itself in its own seriousness. They didn't have to force any comedy. It was just there. Afterlife and Frozen Empire (along with a lot of other movies these days) don't allow the comedy to be organic. It's in the script and it's forced.Had they trimmed the storylines a bit, this could have easily been 9/10 or 10/10. They tried to be too many things to too many people. It falls into the Hollywood trap of remaking or rebooting a great 80s movie and forgetting or missing why that movie was great in the first place. I firmly believe that Less is More makes for a much better movie. Smaller budgets, smaller stories, smaller effects (less CGI). Some of the most successful Hollywood movies had to focus their energy because they had a tiny budget by comparison. A blockbuster doesn't need a huge budget.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

In saying that though, I'm not really the target audience and probably expect too much.

It was interesting. Dan Akyroyd's presence was pleasant and Bill Murray too although he doesn't have as much screentime. It adds a lot of stuff to the Ghostbusters cannon and although the climax definitely got me excited, I felt like the last 20 minutes were disproportionately *more* engaging, endearing and just generally good than the rest of the film.

The villian isn't revealed or even discussed until an hour later. Nothing happened. The whole film was the end 15 minutes. That's it.Characters aren't likeable. The only saving parts were the mini Michelin men, slimer and seeing the originals for a small amount in the film.Such a disappointment as I've waited months for this film and went on the opening for my birthday evening and first time out from the kids! So it was upsetting to see a film that was great end like this. I believe all the amazing reviews are from people who are die hard fans who will never talk bad about anything to do with the franchise. It didn't make sense with the female ghostbusters too and their franchise of ghostbusters as OG characters were in that too but it's like their films were never made. Avoid the dissapointment.

However, as a fan who holds the entire series in high regard, from the original to the all-female cast film, I was left feeling underwhelmed.The movie attempted to juggle multiple storylines and characters, resulting in an overly complicated plot that felt like a slow burn without a clear or satisfying payoff. In contrast, Ghostbusters: Afterlife had managed to strike a successful balance between honoring the original films and introducing fresh, engaging elements that captivated fans.I was hopeful this installment would continue to breathe new life into the franchise, it is with a heavy heart that I say I was left disappointed by this movie. I can only hope that any future additions to the series will learn from the missteps of this film and restore the brilliance that once made Ghostbusters a cultural phenomenon.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

How could you have such a good cast, great history of a movie, and have such a weak story, script, and terrible directing??We know that when we expect too much from a movie, it can be a let-down. When I saw who was in this, I did have high hopes, but at no point in this movie was I ever ""wowed"".Where to start. The movie starts off without any real set-up, and it was almost like everyone assumed you'd love it from the second you saw the ""Ecto1"" (Ghostbuster ambulance).. but there really was no set-up or slightest bit of development between the last movie (Afterlife) and this one. (By the way, ""Afterlife"" was much better).For me, this is the second worst behind ""Ghostbusters Answer the Call"" (with Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Kate McKinnon).The big problem with this movie is the storyline just stinks! Tired, old, unsurprising. The directing was poor at best, and a ton of dumb inconsistencies (like people standing around in T-shirts outside in freezing weather.. but not cold???)Where Rick Moranis was great in the first movie as the funny bystander to all the ghostly happenings, Kumail Nanjiani was lame in his role in this movie as ""Nadeem"".The worst part is that Paul Rudd, Dan Aykroyd, and Bill Murray were nothing short of campy and hammy playing their roles. I WANTED to love these guys re-living these characters, but couldn't have been less interested in them due to the poor character writing and development on this script.No movie.. no matter what it's ""predecessor"" movie or history can ever be good if the script stinks and the direction is terrible.. and this definitely had both.Booooo! (both a ghost pun and what I thought of the movie!) I'd give ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" a 4 out of 10. Watch it at home for free, but not worth a $9 movie ticket and $20 worth of movie snack!!","72 out of 135 found this helpful.

This time, new and old Ghostbusters team up to battle an ancient demon that wants to freeze Manhattan. The special effects are mind-blowing, especially when they're chasing the icy ghosts. Also, this movie is really funny and features cool new ghostbusting gadgets and special appearances by some of the original cast members.The film is set in New York City where Phoebe Spenglar (Mckenna Grace) and her family have moved, and they are busting ghosts in the original firehouse. Ray Stantz (Dan Ackroyd) runs an occult book and antique shop. When Ray buys a strange, ancient orb that contains a dangerous and ancient spirit, the two stories collide and the old and new Ghostbusters team up to save the city.There are a ton of great things in this movie. The CGI ghosts and scenes of frozen New York City are amazing and very creative. The story is really fun because of many unexpected twists, new ghostly friends and lots of comedy. One of my favorite things about this film is that many of the original characters make appearances like when Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) tests out some new ghost-catching gadgets from his secret lab.The film's message is that it's important to work together to overcome challenges and that family can give us strength and the ability to be brave. Viewers should know it has scary moments, and that there is some light swearing.I give Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

Ghostbusters Frozen Empire is not a bad movie but it is also nowhere near good as the last one, sure there are some crazy photon blasters, monsters and ghost running through NYC, some cool visuals and good performances but mostly it looks dull and boring.. Original cast is still present but they didn't add anything to this movie, Bill Murray was only for 3-4 minutes and he did absolutely nothing, it looks like makers forgot how to utilize each of the cast member in a effective way something which last movie did very well.. Story was dull, villain was boring CGI monster, there are no stakes this time and it all looks parody instead of fun and entertaining.. Now I think 2016 female led reboot was overlay hated because that movie is much better than this.. Hopefully next time they'll do something good to make this franchise great again or just end it..

Everything feels nice and familiar, but this is the least fun movie in the franchise. There is one joke- and that is given away in the trailer.

They put in the effort in this one, that's for sure, however it's all over the place and messy, and it could probably use a better cut. A notable example is the intro sequence which sets the tone before every single Ghostbusters movie, but this time it simply doesn't pack enough punch. Also, there were several character and story progressions between scenes that felt weird or rushed.The story is okay, but don't expect anything special. Once again, it feels a bit like a reboot with a lot of - often very unnecessary - fan service and well known plot points, however there's also a new angle they took that I liked. The main villain is not as creative as the ones in the old movies, and the tension leading up to the final battle is uneven. It's still quite enjoyable though, some scenes were pretty exciting and there were some great jokes as well, so it's certainly very far from being offensively bad, as some people make it out to be.I liked most of the actors with two main exceptions. The mother character is extremely bland, I don't even remember her character's name, let alone her real name. I'm not a huge fan of Grace McKenna either, she creeps me out for some reason, but that's on me, I don't hold it against the movie. On a positive note, Kumail Nanjiani and Paul Rudd are both perfect for their roles. Dan Aykroyd seems to be having fun too, and although there's a very enjoyable scene with Bill Murray, you can just feel how much he hates Ghostbusters now.I can't really blame Bill Murray though. I love the old movies, but they were a lightning in a bottle, and their success can never be repeated. It's impossible. Every single attempt has been inferior so far. I clearly remember how terrible the 2016 reboot was, and as for the previous one, I just don't remember anything. This one is more memorable, but probably only because of the familiar plot points and places.Overall it's an okay movie, it kept me engaged unlike a lot of stuff coming out these days, but it's certainly not groundbreaking, and if we really want to be honest to ourselves, nobody really needed this movie. Sure, Sony wants to milk the franchise and make some kind of universe out of it, but they're going to have a tough job in my opinion.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I feel like the legacy characters could have been given a few more victories. Perhaps having the main villain send tons of ghosts to attack and having the old cast fight them holding the flank while the new cast take on the big bad would have worked. It needed a bit of a better balance. Another thing they could have maybe done would have been something along the lines of a strong mentorship role with the old teaching the new some. That might have worked. However overall I did enjoy the film and the effects were good. It evoked some nostalgia and maybe at times leaned into a little hard. It could have done more work on some of the new characters in making them likable and one of the new characters makes a rather poor decision that feels a bit..Dumb? It really lowered my opinion of that character as it didn't feel like they should make that decision given the chemistry I felt between them and the character they make the dumb decision for wasn't strong enough for it to be a convincing decision in my mind.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's also rather silly at times with the main character Phoebe (McKenna Grace) basically getting angry for various reasons and thereby allowing the big bad to come back. The more is more about a brooding teenager throwing tantrums and not listening to her parents then it is about the Ghostbusters.The casting is the best part with the beautiful McKenna Grace playing the leading lady Phoebe, Paul Rudd as Mr Grooberson, Emily Alyn Lind as ghost girl Melody among the returning faces of the OG ghostbusters Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and supporting cast members Finn Wolfhard, Carrie Coon, Patton Oswalt and a surprisingly enjoyable performance by Kumail Nanjiani. Brilliant performances from the whole cast, especially the OG ghostbusters.The VFX and SFX is where the movie really shines, with some amazing special effects and visuals along with a good soundtrack and the ghostbusters theme song.Overall a solid 6/10 from me. Storyline was by far the weakest part of the movie with a solid cast and great visuals and sound effects.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even though the storyline is a bit off a mess.It actually starts off pretty good with a nice introduction of what the movie will be about. But they lose their eye on the bigger picture and are focusing too much on the side stories that aren't that interesting.It's a movie made for each generation with a lovely cast and great CGI. I was pretty entertained, and if you've loved the previous ones, you'll be having that fun as well!Hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did or even moreee!! :)))","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

I am a huge fan of the franchise and could not wait to see this once it came out. I am happy to say that this movie delivers exactly what you want as the fourth installment of the franchise. The movie was written and directed by Gil Kenan who wrote Ghostbusters: Afterlife and we get to see some familiar faces from both the original 2 movies, and Afterlife as well. We are also joined by Ghostbusters newcomers Patton Oswalt and Kumail Nanjiani.One thing that I really enjoyed about the movie was the story. Similar to the 3 before it, Frozen Empire dives into folklore and creates a very interesting and intriguing backstory for the main villain. We even got to learn a little more about ghostbusting history and were introduced to a different kind of ghostbuster. The way this screenplay was written makes it a fantastic summer film. It mixes a nice blend of silly and serious and does a great job of paying homage to the original 2 films. This leads me to the one critique that I have about the movie: they went a little too hard on the nostalgia factor of the film. I, however, did not feel that they went so hard that it took away from the story, like what happened to Jurassic World: Dominion.Overall, I rate this movie as a 7/10. It is a strong sequel and 4th installment to a beloved franchise. If you are looking for a fun summer movie with some laughs and ghosts getting busted, I recommend checking this one out!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I like this but found it quite noisy in terms of cramming in content, lots of characters means not a lot of screen time for favourites (or my favourites). The humour wasn't quite on the same wavelength as the first three and don't feel the jokes landed the same. I think it's clear to see there is a change of direction with the incorporation of the real ghostbusters style ghosts and feel. In summary it is fun and playful and it's nice to see the return to NYC as it serves as a character throughout the first two, it'll be interesting to see where they go with it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Everything looked good and all, it just seemed a bit bland.'Afterlife' had the perfect amount of nostalgia mixed in with their story and new characters. 'Frozen Empire' tries to continue that nostalgia formula with their established new characters, but it just comes across a little flat. The build up to the villain is long but then his reign of terror is very short lived.The main thing to consider is that this film does no injustices to the franchise. It's all very much within the same vein and stays true to it's name.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Nothing really interesting about him, and looks like he can be taken down with a simple flamethrower.Gozer was a truly ominous threat, with its influence seemingly spread into the very fabric of the world, making it almost looking like Satan himself. There's so much you can do with that, but with a boring flash-in-the-pan villain of the week like Garraka, this felt more like an episode than a movie.And then, the worst part: far too many truly irritating characters/actors. The previously nerdy-adorable McKenna Grace is just so nerve-grating to watch here. The teen angst theme is so overdone it's not even funny. And speaking of ""not funny"", the uber-unfunny Kumail Nanjiani is more insufferable than ever - why he keeps getting cast is beyond me.The only standout performers here are Logan Kim & Dan Aykroyd. They've got legit chemistry and I'd love to see a mini-series with the 2 of them solving supernatural mysteries.The parents were there doing their thing, and the other 2 kids might as well not be there at all. They're just irrelevant at this stage.All in all, I wouldn't be surprised if any planned sequels get cancelled.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Bill Murray phoned it in but a Ghostbusters movie none the less.If anything, it felt like an overlong episode of a Ghostbusters TV show and really could have been a bit shorter.But; it was definitely Ghostbusters, and when that theme tune kicks in at the end I had to admit that regardless of whether it was nostalgia or not - I quite enjoyed it!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I watch Ghostbusters 1&2 every Halloween. The original is a classic and part 2 I feel is a basic carbon copy of the first one but it still has some very funny moments and I feel is worth a watch along with its predecessor.I never saw the 2016 reboot only because it wasn't considered canon to the first two movies but Afterlife from three years ago was in fact considered the direct sequel to part 2 and I actually enjoyed it, not as much as the original but even a little better than part 2 from 1989.Of course every movie in this franchise has managed to gross over $100 million domestically, the 2016 version and Afterlife did so now we have Frozen Empire and seeing the poor reviews I was hesitant as Afterlife was a very good sequel from only a few years back.I am recommending the movie but only barely. It had enough laughs and dazzling visual effects in it for me to give it a pass and I'm sure like it's predecessors it will be a huge hit but I have to emphasize I am only barely recommending it.For starters the script is all over the place with far too many new characters and the subplots with them get a little hard to follow because there is just so much going on all at one time.Of course this is a Dan Aykroyd movie and as a writer he is all over the place with ideas that don't make sense. Look at his only directorial effort from 1991 Nothing but Trouble as a good example of this.Of course Ghostbusters worked because he had Harold Ramis to help him co-script it but Ramis having died ten years ago is sadly no longer available to help.But despite Ramis passing away I still feel they they had good writers to revive the Ghostbusters franchise with Afterlife and it worked.Here it's almost as if Dan Aykroyd wrote this particular movie all on his own because so much of it is all over the map.Although Aykroyd is clearly having the most fun among the original cast along with McKenna Grace and Paul Rudd whereas Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Carrie Coon and William Atherton all appear much more lethargic this time around kind of giving us the hint that along with us as the audience they may be getting tired of this franchise.The movie has lots of problems but I laughed enough and was dazzled by the effects enough to give it a marginal recommendation, but it's not a huge ringing endorsement.It's pretty much what to expect from the Ghostbusters franchise at this point with a few laughs nostalgia appreciation and some nice special effects.Unless Rick Moranis comes back as Louis Tully I think we need to give the Ghostbusters a break and let them hang up their proton packs for good.I know Aykroyd has said he wants to do a couple more movies with the original and new cast but only Moranis return to the franchise for me if he decides to come back would really be worthy of another installment.Otherwise this movie only has a little bit more to add from what we saw in Afterlife and although there are some good things I think this franchise is certainly getting tired and the story and most of the performances are proof that it's likely time for the cast and filmmakers to move on to other things.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Everything in this movie feels forced, almost as if everyone involved is trying to one-up the Jurassic World franchise with how bad of a movie can be made and still draw sheep to the theater solely based on nostalgia and easy-to-market subject matter (ghosts, dinosaurs, etc.). Even with my expectations being very low coming into this movie, it never ceases to amaze me how terrible a lot of these high budget films continue to be, and then to see generally favorable reviews after the fact.

The storyline follows the new generation of Ghostbusters now based in New York's iconic fire station from the original film. Now retired from ghost busting, Ray operates a spiritual pawn shop where people bring possessed items. When an ancient artifact unleashes a monster that controls fear itself, the Ghostbusters spring into action to stop it.Directed by Gil Kenan (Monster House), the film stars Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Carrie Coon (Gone Girl), Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things), Bill Murray (Caddyshack), Dan Aykroyd (Caddyshack 2), Patton Oswalt (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty), Mckenna Grace (The Handmaid's Tale), Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), and Ernie Hudson (The Crow).Despite entering with low expectations, due to its quick release after ""Afterlife,"" I found the film to be of similar quality. There are enjoyable nods to the original, including a heartwarming Ivan Reitman reference with the ""Cannibal Girls"" VHS movie flash. Murray, Aykroyd, and Hudson are better utilized here than in ""Afterlife."" However, the villain feels underutilized, and the fire god reference falls flat. While the storyline sets up well and Slimer's appearance is spot on, the ending feels rushed.In conclusion, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire may be the weakest of the four legitimate Ghostbusters movies. I rated Afterlife a 6.5/10, and this one earns a 6/10. It's worth seeing for fans of the series but falls into the realm of average overall.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This bought the franchise home, and gave the original actors a subtle way to be involved in the future.Patton was unnecessary as Ray could have been the font of knowledge, Winston is set up to be the money behind the ongoing business which is great. The introduction of James Acaster made me smile with a bit of English pride and would welcome more of his input.If this is indeed a second act of a trilogy, you can forgive the exposition, the next movie could be supported by the new cast with very minor nods to the original members of the team.Some editing choices were a little choppy, but I have seen worse. Attention to detail on the sets was incredible and made the film gel well with the originals.An explanation of why people accept the presence of ghosts would have also been a good addition.Overall I enjoyed it, not the best film out there, not as good as afterlife, but I do hope they do more and lean into the scary and occult aspects a bit more.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

For you yutes, that was 40-years-ago.Never thought I'd ever say this, but 2016's Ghostbusters, the sadly unfunny reboot was WAY better than this p o s. And this didn't start off on the right foot as 5-minutes into this travesty, I already hated it.I understand Hollywood's really trying desperately to hold onto nostalgia and legacy characters as long as they're not ghosts themselves. I just wish, like Nicole Kidman's awful AMC intro, they'd fade this chapter into the past. In fact, they've already done did this with Ghostbusters: Afterlife and introduced a slew of new/boring characters to take over the helm.Nope, they're not done yet. Every bit of this movie is ""Awww, remember when we did this (scene, music cue, bit) way better? Well, here it is again.""In this wildly dull chapter, the Ghostbustin' family is back in NYC and the same movie takes place that you saw in 1984. Only, this time with horrible and unlikeable characters who bring nothing new to the table. Also, no apologizes, I really, really hated that mother character. Just had to get that out.This movie is uneven, badly written, edited by someone blind and is obviously missing major scenes as things just...happen. The only praise I could possibly come up with is for the criminally underused Kumail Nanjiani who always makes me, at least, chuckle. With the likes of Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Patton Oswalt and Paul Rudd - all proven funny people, Nanjiani was the only one with an ounce of humor, or hope, here.I seriously don't care of there's a part 6. I am done with this franchise. This should've died with Ghostbusters II in 1989 and even that was a few steps too far.***Final Thoughts: Not much of a ranking, since only one is great, but here goes:1. Ghostbusters (1984)
2. Ghostbusters II (1989)
3. Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021)
4. Ghostbusters (2016)
5. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024)","38 out of 82 found this helpful.

I don't think it's more than that. It's here to entertain us and we were entertained by I don't think I'll be going for a rewatch.It's a film of set pieces and atmosphere really. The story makes no sense and the characters are wafer-thin; in fact, from the need to keep all the characters from the new cast and present all the surviving Ghostbusters from the old cast, for the fans, the film is too crowded, almost no one has very much to do. There's a vestigial attempt to give the film some heart by putting a family drama into it, but it's quite perfunctory, the film doesn't care about it and neither do we. Paul Rudd, normally a reliable film presence, might as well not have been in it.A shout out for a couple of excellent comic performances, from James Acaster and Kumail Nanjiani. It's not too much to say Kumail Nanjiani saves the movie, you look forward to his bits.A big boo for the barely-there contribution of Bill Murray. He has to be in it because of the huge impact of his original performance, but he's either forgotten what it takes to do a Bill Murray performance and is copying his own slacker vibe without really understanding it any more, or he simply couldn't be bothered. His turn in Afterlife was a waste of space too.Yet I'm giving the film a 7, my standard for an OK movie, because it zips along nicely, it fills the time with spectacle, the design aesthetic is good, most of the performances are likeable for what little they have to do, it's always fun to see Dan Ackroyd's eyes light up at the thought of supernatural phenomena, and they gave Ernie Hudson a few lines this time.A last thought - there doesn't seem to be much about ghosts; the monsters they trap are more like pokemon in their pokeballs, each with their own fighting characteristics. It's a wonder they don't set them on each other for giggles.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie I got was fun, and made me laugh, but it had allot of structural and editing problems which hindered the experience. As a result I'd probably give it a C and say you wouldn't amiss to go watch it, but don't go in expecting an all timer. It is definitely a sequel and not as good as the origional. Firstly, what did it do right? The cast interactions are very good, and the movie is filled with allot of charm. I could watch Dan Akroyd just being himself for 2 hours, and that's basically what he does. For anyone who doesn't know, Aykroyd is obsessed with the Supernatural in real life, and Ghostbusters is really his baby. There are scenes that feel like they're just taken out of Dan Akroyd interviews. I also enjoyed the rest of the cast, and you can tell this is fun and there's real chemistry. That's enough for me to watch a movie. The movie struggles though with using what it has. The film is packed to the gills with characters and plot lines. They trample over each other and as a result the climax feels very rushed and out of left field. The story just doesn't have any room to breathe and I feel like there was allot of film left on the cutting room floor. Allot of characters and thought lines seemed to have been left dangling or shoved in with little thought. Perhaps there's a director's cut one day that fixes this, but in this current format, the movie just feels jumbled and rushed.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I didn't feel it was terrible (that 2016 disaster), but it wasn't the best (that's reserved for the 1984 original). It made me laugh and kept my attention throughout the film.The film brings back characters from Afterlife and introduces a few new characters to the story. In true Hollywood fashion, they bring back the original crew from the 1984 classic, plus legends William Atherton and John Rothman. I like the way Dan Aykroyd's & Ernie Hudson's characters were used in the film, it was nicely done (no spoilers).Special effect are light years better than was we had back in the early 1980s. The movie is loaded with them, but I did not find it horribly distracting.""Off Menu"" podcast Dream Restaurant genie and comedian, James Acaster, is cast as a R&D member of the Ghostbusters team. My jaw dropped. A wonderful comedian, but I was expecting some good humorous quotes from him; it was really limited. How do you allow that to happen? Talk about wasted opportunities. It was great to see him on the big screen.The cast was really good, plenty of very good talent, the writing could have been better given what was being used. Sort of like driving a Ferrari only on 30mph city streets with potholes instead of a track. It didn't have that nice balance of comedy, story and action that made the original a pure classic. Some of the characters just seemed fade in and out of the story throughout the film. Humor was dialed back, compared to previous films. I think they focused more on special effects rather than the writing sometimes. This sort of reminded me of that last Indiana Jones film, but at least this was better. There was room for improvement and there is that element that says 'please end it here' for some reason.It isn't much of a spoiler, but there is a small video segment in the ending credits that is short and to the point. After that it is just credits, nothing special at the very very very end.The film is fun and wonderful for people of all ages. There is some rude language used sometimes, no different than the 1984 original. Younger ones will still enjoy the film though, they will need to see the 1984 version for some of the other gags, if they have not been introduced yet and they should. I'm an older 50-something kid and still find these films entertaining, I just want to see the series going in a better direction.

Also, my kids loved it.For me, any of the good call backs they missed from the previous film (Afterlife), were used in this film. Was half expecting an adult Oscar to turn up, as someone that's previously had ghostly encounters, given the size of the cast...which causes issues with dividing screen time between the new and the old.The film seems to lose a bit of momentum at points, largely (I think) due to developing of the Garraka story line and possibly due to waiting for character story arcs to sync.Stranger Things has had an influence, and there's James Acaster with an almost like Q type character. There are some cool new additions, which help push the narrative alongPlenty of things to smile about through pure nostalgia.Rolling out Egon's blueprints was a nice touch and some interesting knowledge about the containment system is shared, which I'd not thought about before.Once it gets going, it's good. I think it is still better than Paul Feig's version and apparently it's supposed to be like a ""Real Ghostbusters"" film, but I've forgotten more than I knew about that series.For me, any film that we can all go and see and enjoy is worth it👍(Those mini stay pufts help confirm the target audience though in my mind)
(oh, and the perennial self-affirmation about how cool everything is - a bit too much for me!)","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Most of the original stars are back including co-creator Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson (""Winston""), Annie Potts (""Janine Melnitz"") and of course Bill Murray (""Peter Venkman"").Bill gets to deliver some of the most memorable & funny quotes, but his performance felt more dialled in and picking up a paycheque than his other normal low energy persona roles.While Aykroyd is smiling all the way to the bank with his cheesy rebirth of ""Ray Stantz"".However it's missing one of its biggest OG's.Making it the first film in the Ghostbusters franchise original canon without Sigourney Weaver's character ""Dana Barrett"".Unfortunately William Atherton is back as Mayor Walter Peck.Giving us ""Walters"" another bad wrap...thanks for nothing Hollywood you've done it again to everyone bearing my Christian name.Whilst watching this latest instalment in the franchise I was wondering the age old Beatles question.Who will be the last original Ghostbuster standing when the dust settles?I know my mind goes to dark places in the dark of Limelight Cinemas.Even some of the OG ghosts make a reprised appearance including: Slimer and the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man.""Frozen Empire"" introduces some new ghouls including a tacky red lazer dot (like something you'd see on a guns scope) darting around and animating normally inanimate objects and some others I'm sure moviegoers would have liked to see escape their containment's in a disused ""Aquarium"" filmed in the UK.The soundtrack is very light on with only a handful of songs and doesn't even include the Banarama track ""Cruel Summer"" featured in the trailer.Plus the whole ""scared to death"" thing we were sold by the trailer doesn't even have any bearing on the finale fight scene with this movies tall, dark and horny villain who was an ancient, malevolence that was unleashed from an antiquity for a handful of dollars.They do poke fun at Ray Parker Jnrs original hit song ""Ghostbusters"" in one scene with Paul Rudd which is one the few comic reliefs in an otherwise unfunny movie.Kumail Nanjiani's ""Nadeem"" turns out to be a pivotal character, but even he can't save this movie.Every film in this decade to conform to the norm features a same sex relationship and this cartoon like depiction of ""Ghostbusters"" is no exception.This time around it's Emily Alyn Lind's ""Melody"" and the wonderfully talented McKenna Grace ""Phoebe Spengler"" hinting at a same sex relationship between 16 year old & 15 year old characters respectively.They have great chemistry on screen.Finn Wolfhard plays ""Phoebes"" brother ""Trevor"" again after his turn in ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" and in this movie he's out to prove he's an 18 year old adult, whereas in reality the ""Stranger Things"" star is now a 22 year old man.I wonder just how long he can keep playing the goofy, awkward teenager card.You know it's aimed at a teen, tween, primary school audience when normally foul mouthed comedian Patton Oswalt as ""Dr. Hubert Wartzki"" doesn't drop the F bomb, instead he says ""fudge""!FFS!In fact, ""Frozen Empire"" feels very Disney'd down to the lowest common denominator just in time for the Easter school holidays.Where it works particularly well are the visual FX, but the story doesn't really get all up in your face until almost an hour has passed.The slow set up lets this film down enormously.Plus there are too many things left unexplained, leaving the audience wondering WTAF?For starters suddenly new Proton Backpacks appear in a high tech truck before battle time.Who remembers the old ones that looked like vacuum cleaners strapped on?I remember when this franchise launched I was working on Sydney Radio at 2 DAY FM and the first ever pop up shop was a ""Ghostbusters"" store loaded with cool merch for this brand new film.Fast forward 40 years and here we are putting trainer wheels on these films to appease the younger crowds, at the risk of losing barnacles like myself who've been clinging to this sinking ship for a lifetime.I've been coming back to this well since 1984 when Bob Hawke was Australia's Prime Minister and Reaganomics ruled in the US and dog nabbit I'll keep coming back 'cos I'm obviously a sucker for punishment.","6 out of 24 found this helpful.

I mean, talk about useless characters.I totally buy the chemistry among the family members. There is no problem for me there. Another good thing was the film was not drowned in nostalgia and it gives sufficient time to our new characters to grow.However, I think they should have written off Bill Murray's character. I mean, enough already! It was not funny! It does not add anything to the story!There is one more thing I found boring watching the film, but I do not want to spoil it for everybody, so I will not mention it as it is an important plot point.Also, James Acaster is good in the film. I did not know he was in the film. And Kumail Nanjiani actually steals the show a bit. He was actually funny in the film, which was a surprise because of ""Eternals""... Remember that film?

However, the sequel, the female reboot version, and the previous installment ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" I didn't care for. With this new one, the problems I have with the previous one are still here.Throughout, the production, costumes, and the special effects are pretty good as the colorful effects were well-executed. Admittledy, including some really interesting camerawork moments. The direction from Gil Kenan, while at times a bit messy, was solid on approaching some of the tone. Seeing Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Annie Potts again was fun as they still have great chemistry, charm, and dialogue dynamics between one another. Unfortunately, the new characters, bland humor, and weak narrative didn't do it for me.The characters of the original cast members are still likable and entertaining to observe but none of the new characters were interesting nor likable really. The performances from them were solid but the new characters didn't have much charm and didn't really care for them. Kumail Nanjiani's performance was kind of annoying and Paul Rudd is just being Paul Rudd, again. The dialogue is pretty rough and some of the soundtrack choices are pretty annoying. The creature and ghost designs are solid as they have some decent designs and colors, although mixed with some noticeable poor CGI. The narrative really feels like a rehash of some of the ideas from the previous movies but just with different monsters and scenes.I found myself feeling a bit bored at times. Overall, I can see Ghostbusters fans loving this but I rather stick with the first one.","48 out of 109 found this helpful.

The film received a not too well-received sequel in 1989 and a reboot in 2016, which was also received with mixed feelings. This reboot was not followed up, while the end was left open and the hint of that was the return of Zuul. Until we were allowed to see Ghostbusters Afterlife in theaters in 2021, the long-awaited sequel to the original Ghostbusters film that features Egon Spengler's daughter and granddaughter. The film was very successful and a sequel could not really be missed. Under the pseudonym Ghostbusters: Hells Kitchen, this project started and later it was renamed Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. The entire cast returns only this time the direction is in the hands of Gil Kenan, who also helped write Ghostbusters Afterlife. The trailer makes you expect a lot, despite the film being received lukewarm from many sides.I don't understand anything about all that nagging on the movie, because Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has become a really nice movie. However, the film is different from the predecessor Afterlife and that works fine. Perhaps the film leans just a little too much on the past, but on the other hand it does work. For example, the link is made to Ghostbusters 2 in the film, but even more to the first part from 1984. For example, the ghost from the library comes back, the lion image for the library comes to life and the little marshmallow man returns. This time we are not dealing with Zuul or Gozer, but Ray gets his hands on a spherical object, which soon turns out that he has an evil spirit on board that has the other spirits under control. When the ghost storage in the barracks begins to fill up, Winston Zeddemore's Spenglers are told that there is an improved and larger storage elsewhere. This to the great dismay of Mayor Walter Peck, who in Ghostbusters (1984) naturally let all ghosts escape from the storage due to his hatred for the Ghostbusters.The effects in the film are also more than fine. I visited the 2D version of the film myself, but especially the last half hour of the film will look fantastic in 3D. This is the part where all of New York is frozen and the Ghostbusters have to save the world again from the clutches of an old evil spirit. Maybe the film is somewhat predictable here and there and the formula of the mix of young and old works a little stiff. Still, this is absolutely not in the way of the fun in the film, because the film is a small two hour popcorn entertainment from the top shelf, with the fun of the cast splashing off the screen. As mentioned before, the fans of the old movie(s) are served at their bells and there is nothing wrong with that at all. Can you say that that already happened in the previous film, but in this film it also works fine and that has everything to do with the setting in New York. The ancient icy enemy may be an enemy who is scarer than what we have seen so far in Ghostbusters- movies, so beware off with too young viewers, the film could be just a little too intense for that.Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has become a good sequel to 2021 Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Fans of the original films are served at their service and perhaps the only small point of criticism is that the film may lean just a little too much on nostalgia. Yet it doesn't bother and maybe the interaction between the old and the new cast is just a bit on the stiff side, but it's fair to say that it doesn't bother a meter. Because the creators have kept the film under two hours, the pace is very high in the film and it is precisely because of this that the film has become a wonderful roller coaster ride and the film really should not have lasted any longer. As already mentioned, the end enemy is perhaps the scariest we've seen so far in a Ghostbusters movie, so be a bit careful with too young viewers. For the rest, I wave away the destructive criticisms of some sour plums, because Frozen Empire is a bin of fun that is absolutely worth checking out. And there is an aftercredit below the credits, but you don't have to stay there after that because after that the film is really over.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Unfortunately some characters have limited screen time, and Bill Murray gives a very phoned in performance that is pointless and unnecessary. Frozen Empire is a decent follow up to ""Afterlife"" but doesn't hit as deep or as fun as its previous outing. Fans may want a little more by the end but overall should be satisfied withPositives:

While I still think that the critics have an agenda in beating up on this one (they also underrated Afterlife and I think it goes back to what happened with the 2016 film), I would admit that it was a little bit overstuffed and narratively a bit messy. Certain characters (especially Carrie Coon and Finn Wolfhart, but also Paul Rudd a little bit) felt marginalised as a result.However it definitely had nice elements and some great moments (couple of enjoyably creepy moments too) and I'd recommend it as good solid family entertainment. My 8 year old daughter loved it. It's more action packed and funnier than Afterlife, but doesn't have the same heart.If there are going to be more Ghostbusters films, I'd prefer them to be more focused with the plot, less cartoony and have more of the Amblin vibe of Afterlife. The original Ghostbusters was mostly a comedy, which worked brilliantly because of that particular blend of cast and writers. Kenan and Reitman work better though when the tone is more coming-of-age with a few laughs, rather than knockabout action comedy as this one was.Worth a watch overall, but it's probably only the third best GB film, behind the original and Afterlife.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

While it may not reach the heights of its predecessors, it still offers plenty of thrills and laughs for fans of both Ghostbusters and Frozen.The film excels in its visual effects, bringing the icy world of Arendelle seamlessly into the supernatural realm of ghosts and ghouls. The blend of CGI and practical effects is impressive, creating some truly breathtaking and eerie moments that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats.The cast also delivers strong performances, with the chemistry between the Ghostbusters team and the characters from Frozen driving much of the film's humor and heart. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel reprise their roles as Anna and Elsa with gusto, while the Ghostbusters team, led by a charmingly bumbling Paul Rudd, injects the film with plenty of laughs and personality.Where Ghostbusters Frozen Empire falls short, however, is in its plot. While the concept of merging these two worlds is undeniably intriguing, the execution feels a bit muddled at times, with the story struggling to find a cohesive balance between the two franchises. Some plot points feel rushed or underdeveloped, leaving the audience wanting more.Overall, Ghostbusters Frozen Empire is a fun and entertaining ride that will delight fans of both franchises. While it may not be a perfect film, its strong visuals, charismatic performances, and unique premise make it a worthwhile watch for anyone looking for a supernatural adventure with a frosty twist.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Personally, while I had a lot of fun with this one and enjoyed it quite thoroughly, it never quite reached the heights that Afterlife somehow managed to. It's not quite as cohesive, strong, or emotional of a film. That being said, it does feel a lot closer in tone to the original films and has a lot of creativity in its visuals, storytelling, and gadgetry to overcome its crowded cast and occasional obvious wink to the original classic. It did play it a little safe at times and took a while to get going, while also having an anticlimactic 3rd act, but this franchise has seen much worse. It's solid B+ movie fun! It has a great cast, fun moments, and some unique ghosts! While it may not be on the level of Afterlife, and I had a few nitpicks, it manages to capture the style of the original films really well and feels just like the kind of family flicks we used to get in the 80s and 90s! It's got issues, especially in the end, but Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is such an unapologetic love letter to the DNA of the franchise and its potential that I didn't care.

The film adaptation is like a small story with a small theme. The direction made well in the movie
Especially in the movie that includes all the old team members to support the family who are in the crisis situation that actually happens in every movie that is a little bit cringe but ok.The animation part is very well done.Acting is good because all people are doing very well only the story is small.The family thing is paul is trying to keep the kids and wife together in the worst situation. Trying to understand the kids part how they face problems if they are not considered as adults.All the good actors are done well the movie is quite good and one time watchable.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An Enjoyable Addition to the Franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9694835/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2024","The Ghostbusters franchise is one that I got into much later in my life, but I do think the original film is great. I never liked any other rendition or sequel though until Ghostbusters: Afterlife in 2021. I found that film to just be a wonderful adventure that just happened to take place in continuity with the first two films. Well, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire takes those characters, makes a direct sequel to that story, but also makes it feel like the original by taking place in many of the same locations. While this is filled with too much nostalgia, I still had a good time watching it because I like this new cast. If you liked the last one, here's why I recommend this.The film begins with a flashback to the 1800s where we are shown an ancient orb that froze people to death. Cut to the modern day when Nadeem (Kumail Nanjiani) chooses to sell this orb (that has been passed down to him) to Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and he buys it immediately. As a new team of investigators keeps these ghostly objects under experimentation, this orb eventually unleashes numerous ghosts, with the main one from the 1800s (Garraka) controlling everything. The premise is very similar to the original film, especially in the final act. We are even shown the same ghosts and locations numerous times, which feels tedious and forced. Still, I went for the cast and I was not disappointed.Gary (Paul Rudd), Callie (Carrie Coon), Trevor (Finn Wolfhard), and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) all return here and their family dynamic is still just as solid as it was before. I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Gary and Phoebe, as he slowly becomes the father figure in her life, and yes, of course, the original cast is fun as well. Dan Aykroyd is one of the main side characters here which felt nice and Ernie Hudson actually has more to do than I was expecting. I will warn those who want to see Bill Murray though, that he probably has about ten minutes of screen time. He does have one moment in particular that had me cracking up and that's all I needed from that. I have to admit though, even if this may be unpopular among most viewers of this film, that I think Kumail Nanjiani is my favourite part of the film.Some viewers will find his character annoying, but his character is the backbone of this story and where he begins as opposed to where he ends up by the end, had me laughing throughout. I loved that he was having a blast with this wacky character. What I didn't notice though, surprisingly, is that Gil Kenan took over as director from Jason Reitman. It seemed that the same level of care was put into the emotional and sweet moments, which fell right in line with the last film. He and Jason wrote the screenplay together though, so that's probably why.Look, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will annoy people who are tired of nostalgia in their films, but I was able to look past that and have a good time regardless. I liked seeing the original cast having some fun and I would gladly watch one more film with this new cast. Do a couple of jokes fall flat? Yes. Does it feel like it's overstuffed with characters? Yes. Did I have a good time though? Absolutely. I pretty much got exactly what I expected from this one and I'm not mad about that.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie, along with its iconic theme, holds a permanent place in my memories.When Ghostbusters was revived most recently, it was a thrill to see how the new characters were introduced and how the original cast seamlessly integrated into the storyline. It was simply a delight to watch.In this installment, the Ghostbusters find themselves back at their headquarters facing a much stronger and slightly scarier ghost. However, while the introduction of the evil entity was done well, it could have been given more screen time, and the story felt somewhat dragged out. Throughout the movie, I found myself in a state of confusion, unsure whether I was truly enjoying it or not and this feeling persisted until the very end.Nevertheless, it's worth watching for its classic title alone.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

That aside the rest of the film is great, lots of fun, a few Easter eggs but not enough to make newcomers feel out of the loop.

The adult characters are caricatures of stupidity, failing to engage even the youngest viewers. While the special effects are ok, they can't salvage a script that treats its audience with condescension.

I can't say I went in with high expectations, and yet I am deeply dissapointed that a Reitman was behind this movie. Oh, and don't get me started on the finale, where some of the most silly and contrived solutions against the big baddie are thrown in without any build up or believeability.

The female lead,Carrie Coon, maybe the worst actress I have seen in years. Saying her looks AND performance was flat is, frankly, a compliment.She added nothing to the film. Nothing.McKenna Grace, playing Phoebe, carried the film, and did it well. Her interactions with the female ghost, Melody, were probably the highlight of the film, from an acting point-of-view.The special Effects were, to put it mildly, SPECIAL. Really excellent work.One thing I would like to point out as that this film was truly international. Parts were shot in Hollywood, parts in New York City, and parts of the film were done in Georgia, and parts in Reading, England (an outer suburb of London).You gotta stay around for the small but hilarious comic bit that runs after some of the credits have run.

A nicely written script that didn't have the current Hollywood tropes, which respected the original and delivered a fun romp. It added new ideas, relocated to small town middle America, and was generally fun.Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire follows the same group, now relocated back to New York.The thing about Ghostbusters is: you shouldn't think about it too hard. Why do ghosts manifest as round green, slimy eating machines? Why are they allowed to run around with massively dangerous proton packs? Why aren't other companies getting in on the act?So criticising this film that it doesn't make sense for (for example) a group, including a 15 year old, to be zooming around New York streets, breaking a million laws, causing untold property damage and potential death and injury. Pointing at one thing and saying ""that would never happen"" in this franchise is a bit silly.A valid criticism is that the film has too many characters. Some of the characters from Afterlife (Lucky, Podcast) have nothing to do. A couple of new characters are introduced. The old team, with the exception of Dan Ackroyd, are sort of just there.It's a Ghostbusters movie. It was fun. It won't be a classic.

But when the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an evil force, Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.This actually felt like a Ghostbusters movies. There was quite a good amount of ghostbusting going on, which you would think is a good thing however it felt like it was a bit too much of a Ghostbusters movie. It felt like one of the original 1980's Ghostbusters without any modern concepts that would make the film a bit deeper and more relatable to the newer generations.Now the new ghosts and elements added to the film were quite interesting and the visuals were very decent. Additionally, it had some good jokes and comedic scenes here and there. The addition of the old Ghostbusters from the original movies was pretty cool and felt like a tribute to the fans of the franchise.Although I am personally not a big fan of the original Ghostbusters, I still kind of enjoyed this one and I think the fans of the original movie would definitely like this.Score: 6/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I love the idea of a group of oddball scientists hunting and trapping spooks, but in my opinion none of the movies have done the premise justice (yes, even the original).Frozen Empire, the latest (and hopefully last) in the franchise, takes the fun basic set-up and over-complicates it to the point that it will confuse younger viewers (the kids in the cinema where I saw the film were clearly not entertained given how much they were talking), while all of the teen drama will bore the adults. The script is muddled, unexciting and in desperate need of some decent comedy (instead of lame quips about sex dungeons and hookers).For me, the best thing about the whole Ghostbusters series is Ray Parker Jr.'s theme song; sadly, you will have to sit through the entirety of this sorry sequel in order to hear it.3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for James Acaster (he annoys me) and the stupid mini-Stay Puft characters that are only there so that they can be marketed as toys.","20 out of 42 found this helpful.

I . . . Didn't dislike it . . . I guess, but neither did I love all of it. Let's explore.Now established as the Ghostbusters in New York, the Spengler family and Gary (Paul Rudd) are thrown into a battle against an ancient evil, when Nadeem (Kumail Nanjiani) sells a mysterious orb to Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) unaware that it is a prison for a spectral power. When it is opened, the malevolent spirit plans to raise an army, by freezing New York and releasing the ghosts from the fire stations containment unit.I guess my problems were that this feels like a greatest hits remix, rather than a new film. The beats are the same, Nadeem's unwitting power legacy mirrors Lewis Tully in the original, the containment until is again turned off firing a stream of ghosts out as it was in the first one. William Atherton is a government official that wants to shut them down again. The ghost in the library comes back, Slimer comes back, the stay puft marshmallow men come back. Two of the characters from the last film, Celeste O Connor's lucky and Logan Kim's Podcast are crudely crowbarred back into the film and serve no purpose other than to just be there. The most sacrilegiously feeling aspect though is that it doesn't really need the original cast to be in it, in fact, the more time we spend with them, the less time we got to spend with the more interesting dynamic, which is the new cast trying to make their blended family work in a new high-pressure setting. Winston funding them sort of makes sense and Ray was a nice way for them to find out about the orb and the evil, but Bill Murray and Anne Potts are just two more character, in a really busy movie, who stand around in scenes serving little purpose.But, there are some aspects of the film, away from the relentless nostalgia, I quite enjoyed. McKenna Grace is still great and, though he too is sidelined by a character heavy story, Finn Wolfhard is good too. I liked James Acaster and the ghost lab. The visual effects are quite good and occasionally there's a funny line or two. I like the central family, even if the dynamics are strange, are Gary and Callie in a romantic relationship? The film talks about him being a surrogate father, but not about them being a couple. If there is to be another Ghostbusters film, and it seems like there might be, then I'd really rather the film focused on them, rather than the legacy characters again.It's fine, I guess, is by bottom line but with a little less nostalgia it could have been even better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have followed many a fanpge, listened to podcasts and i have been overly hyped for this movie.Yesterday i saw the prepremiere at my local cinema, and about half way through the movie i got a sinking feeling. I simply did not connect with this film. Here is why: IT IS A MESS! The cast- which ffeatures both original cast, new generation and many all new characters - stumble on eachother for the spotlight. So much so that you fail to be invested in any of them. Seems like theyve failed to establish who the audience should consider main characters. Instead we get a mixture of fan service, weak comedic relief and a family drama that noone really believes.I am by no means a gatekeeping fan. I want to like this movie more than anything, but i am extremely disappointed and worried about the franchise if this is what the studio could come up with as a follow up to the wonderful ""Afterlife"" that seemed to restore Ghostbusters to its former glory. All though this is done with way more respect for Ghostbusters canon than ""Answer The Call"" i will probably not be rewatching this movie any time soon. No matter how big of a supporter i might be, this was simply a huge disappointment.","20 out of 43 found this helpful.

Something as sacred as the Ghostbusters now feels like any other run-of-the-mill franchise, squeezing out money to the bitter end. Fortunately, that doesn't mean that every output is automatically a creative disaster. Tastes differ, as you could tell from the first reviews of the film. I wouldn't have actually needed the 4th part, I'm blowing my own horn about the fact that there have only been this number so far, but I also felt the big BUT during the viewing. The creative minds did a lot of things right after all. A good script, one with content and interesting ideas, not just full-time ruckus. It was the same in the originals, even if some people seem to have forgotten this under the influence of ""modern viewing habits"" or others don't know any different. Finally we're back in the Big Apple, we get the old headquarters, a few new old faces, a few passable new ones, less Stranger Things pandering, more genuine ghost hunter nostalgia, less Paul Rudd, still too much, and yet the small hope that this was the last sequel for now, simply because of the renewed certainty that it won't work without the original heroes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The team once again navigate a dangerous new threat linked with an ancient prophecy promising to bring about the end of days.The best parts come from the tense sequences present throughout, with an ever increasing threat lurking beneath the mysterious orb encasing it. The change of scenery back to New York and the HQ was a great choice, making it look more consistent with the first 2 movies and linking them better with 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife'. The aesthetic and soundtrack make it feel like a Ghostbusters movie, but it's shortcomings detract from it fully realising itself.Some funny jokes sprinkled in as you would hope for a Ghostbusters movie, but unfortunately it's unable to attain the tone of the first movie. The cast is way too big, with too many moving parts to keep in a less than 2 hour runtime. There isn't really a main character, and many characters I briefly forgot whilst others seemed to have their b-plots cut short. Pheobe had something interesting going but I believe didn't pay off all that well, Gary had maybe the second most intriguing arc yet had it resolved very suddenly, and Ray serves as the most interesting perspective yet isn't given the time required to flesh out his story in the best way possible. References are not a bad thing, but the ones here either came off as unnecessary or simply an afterthought.The villain had the benefit as well as the loss of being an original idea and not just Gozer (or Vigo, for that matter) again. He's built up throughout the movie very well, but his arrival seemingly happens only 2 minutes before his anticlimactic departure.Ghostbusters could be going in the right direction, but needs to learn to be a bit more minimalistic in future (if there is one).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, from the very first scenes, my expectations were harshly confronted with the reality of a sequel that struggles to capture the essence of its predecessor. My viewing of 'Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire' proved to be a disappointing experience, far from the brilliance and magic of the original 1984 film. Despite technically correct execution, the film is unfortunately burdened by a narrative littered with inconsistencies and a glaring lack of tension and captivating plot twists. While the talent of the actors is undeniable, their performances are overshadowed by an overloaded screenplay filled with superficial secondary characters, thereby diluting the expected emotional impact. Ultimately, this sequel sorely lacks the authenticity and soul that propelled its predecessor to fame, leaving both nostalgic fans and newcomers wanting.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

There are far too many characters in this film, many of which have been needlessly shoehorned into the story. It's overstuffed with unnecessary dialogue, subplots, characters and scenes which go on for far too long. It's not funny either. All of the jokes fall flat.

Laughs and scares are the two things you expect from a Ghostbusters film but this film doesn't provide any.Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan may be talented directors, but they're the wrong people to be writing these films.With a heavy heart, I rate this film 3 out of 10.I feel a lot of fans are in denial about just how bad this film is.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

Unfortunately this film is a wasted opportunity that feels rather drab and unorganised.Firstly there is a big issue of too many characters being crammed in. A mix of original characters, those introduced in Afterlife, and brand new characters, all mix and combine in really uncoordinated ways. Nobody gets enough development to feel particularly engaging or fun. Mckenna Grace's Phoebe probably emerged as the lead character, but in a remarkably limp story line.Speaking of the story, again this feels really poorly put together. Without wanting to tread into spoiler territory, I will just say that the main villain of the film has nowhere near enough screentime and the film feels like it's over just as it's getting started. For large portions of the film it feels like nothing is particularly happening and it is all leading towards something that is over far too quickly.I think a lot of the issues with this film are because it was resting on its laurels a bit. It continually makes references to the original films to try to curry favour with fans, but these cheap attempts don't cover up the fact that the story is mediocre and the characters are all two dimensional.There's maybe a bit of fun to be had here if you load up on popcorn and want to switch your brain off for a bit, but it's such a shame that this film wasn't better as it had real potential.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Usually, the director and producers will show a cut to 'test audiences' to get their opinions so that they can still make changes before it's released to the rest of us. Based on the reaction from the people sitting around me in the theater last night, these film people never did that. No one laughed, cheered, awed, or had any other reaction besides silence.The film starts off great with possibly one of the best opening scenes in movie history, which introduces us to 'the freeze'. Then the film quickly goes downhill from there to end with one of the worst movie finales in movie history, when they defeat 'the freeze'. I cannot pinpoint the reason for the demise, but the storyline is a huge culprit. It just never added up and seemed to be haphazardly put together as if the screenwriter was pressured to write the sequel to Afterlife in a short amount of time without any rewrites or reviews. Also, the movie moved into cheesy 80s family show sitcom territory way more than necessary if it was even necessary to begin with.While the majority of the special effects were amazing, that horned creature you see in the movie poster and who is 'the' creature that brings terror to Manhattan, is not. What this was supposed to be looks wise is anyone's guess. Someone must have had their kid draw a draft of this and thought it was cute but scary enough for a 4 year old that it would be great for the movie. Wrong.The cast is exceptional, both returning and new actors, and it is very hard to have nothing but love for the new actors (I personally cannot get enough of Paul Rudd and Kumail Nanjiani) while really craving to see more of the original ones (Ray, Peter, Winston and especially Janine).However, the character of 'ghost Melody' was not well thought out at all, who for someone that is supposed to be between 200-75 years old speaks and acts like someone from 2024. Then we had her ambiguous relationship with Phoebe that made it worse and that did not add anything to the plot.A very important thing to note about this film, as well as the rest of the Ghostbuster franchise, is that they do not resort to cheap cultural appropriation storylines which have become an even larger trend than before in books, shows and movies. Yes, their mythical gods and goddesses always wanting to release the undead is pathetically repetitive and tiresome, but at least it's original to Ghostbusters and not stealing from the world's ancient mythologies.I will conclude by stating that at the end of the day, this might just be the best movie playing right now in the theaters (and might be for a long time based on the other trailors we saw for movies coming soon) so if you and your family want to have a theater night then go for it. You will definitely be entertained, but just don't have high expectations.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So, after finally catching Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, I can't help but feel a bit conflicted.After reinvigorating the franchise with 2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the studio is back for more, but it's like they're struggling to recapture lightning in a bottle. Despite the three-year wait, the final product falls short of its potential.The film feels more like an extended episode of The Real Ghostbusters, with a ""ghost of the week"" storyline. It's not necessarily terrible, but it definitely lacks the grandeur of its predecessors.Unfortunately, the heavy focus on family dynamics detracts from the overall fun. It's overstuffed with characters and plot threads, leaving some, like Finn Wolfhard's character, feeling sidelined.While the kids' storylines fail to engage, Kumail Nanjiani shines as the skeptic with a dry wit, reminiscent of Venkman. Patton Oswalt's cameo is enjoyable, evoking strong feelings of Ray.Thankfully, legacy cast members like Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson are used more organically this time, providing a nice sense of continuity.Yet, the film suffers from overzealous editing, leaving out scenes from the trailers and rushing towards its conclusion. It's clear there's a disjointedness to the final product.Ultimately, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire could have benefited from a tighter focus and better integration of its ensemble cast. While it has its moments, it falls short of being the slam dunk fans were hoping for. One wonders why they didn't make a film with Rudd, Coon, Nanjiani, and Oswalt as new Ghostbusters and leave the kids at the firehouse. There's a good team there desperately waiting to spring into action.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10.0

The chemistry between old and new is undeniable, with plenty of laughs and proton pack-fueled action. However, the film stumbles a bit under the weight of its own comedic barrage and a growing resemblance to the superhero genre.The plot, centered on an ancient artifact unleashing a frosty villain, is classic Ghostbusters fare. Where the movie shines is in the interactions. Seeing the seasoned Ghostbusters trade barbs with the wide-eyed newcomers is pure entertainment. Phoebe, the granddaughter from ""Afterlife,"" continues to impress with her tech-savvy ingenuity, while Winston brings his signature dry wit.Unfortunately, the humor can feel excessive at times leaving you yearning for a few more genuine spooky moments.Visually, ""Frozen Empire"" leans heavily into the comic book movie aesthetic. The spectral villain is impressive, but the over-reliance on CGI action sequences feels a touch impersonal compared to the practical effects charm of the originals. A dash less digital spectacle and a touch more hands-on ghostbusting would have been a welcome nod to the franchise's roots.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

First off let me just start by typing: I really didn't like Afterlife. I mean, AL started out OK, kinda liked the set up of the family moving in to an old house and finding some GB equipment in the basement. But it quickly devolved into a schmaltzy nostalgia baiting mess very quickly. As the third act started I found my cringe muscles working overtime and it didn't stop until the uber-cringe inducing final scene.So that being said, were they able to move past the constant fan-baiting and progress these characters in a meaningful way that would have them stand out in their own right? Nope.At the beginning, when the family are chasing a ghost while driving Ecto-1, Egons garand-daughter exclaims ""I have a ghost to bust!"". Paul Rudd then tries to Bookmark the comment by saying ""Ok, that was cool!"" In a bid to try and tell the audience how they should think about that cheesy line. It's clear from the get go that these people do not respect the audience's intelligence or time. Cool things aren't ""cool"" because you said so. Insulting.Such a shame, the actual spooky opening scene was mildly intriguing. I especially liked the image of the frozen hand stuck to the revolving grammophone handle. But that's where the praise begins and ends.What happens next is a bunch of scenes that barely tie together to make even a thirty minute tv episode interesting.Sadly the way films are made now are more ""tell don't show"" because they know half the audience are watching tik tok and have the attention span of a gnat. So obvious lines have fo be put in just in case someone was looking at their phone instead of the movie screen.Yeah, but honestly just let this franchise be a thing of its time. It clearly doesn't work in the modern world and thats ok.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has to be funny. It has to be a bit off the wall. It should exist in a fantastical universe where its o.k for the unbelievable to be acceptable. People who watch this movie and take its contents too seriously require a swift boot in the chuckies. It should be slightly scary and it should have a clever supernatural plot line. All the good GB movies have had these elements and Frozen Empire does the formula well. The reason the 3rd movie failed was because it had no connection with the original cast. The inclusion of Aykroyd, Murray and the rest of the old school members only makes it all the more enjoyable. The newer busters are also fun and add to the world. The Firemaster character is really great and had me laughing a few times. The plot is well thought out and it never gets too complex. One thing I loved is that although the movie was a smorgasbord of ethnicities there was nothing racial about any if the storylines. It was just a given thing the people were people and they co existed without a need to be overly woke and focus on a modern identity or sensibility. A real breath of fresh air as so many releases are trying to hard to address the 2020's need to appear inclusive thay it has ruined certain presentations. A solid 7.5.

It really is. It's just not quite great, like it should be. Maybe it's the beat or two too many of comedy from Kumail Nanjiani (seriously, that one comic beat with him on the pole? Erase it. It took me RIGHT out of the movie), maybe it's the way they've jumped straight to the End Of The World stakes, maybe it's something I can't quite put my finger on, but this just felt like a noticeable step down from Afterlife. Hell, maybe it's just me and my dislike for Bill Murray being treated like the heart of this franchise rather than Dan Aykroyd. I don't know. I just know that, although I did enjoy it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did Afterlife.That being said, I like that Paul Rudd reined in his Paul Ruddness a little, I enjoyed Finn Wolfhard's work here, Carrie Coon was also great, and of course Dan Aykroyd - the REAL beating heart of Ghostbusters - was fantastic...but McKenna Grace was easily the star here. I've not seen very much of her work other than when I first encountered her in The Haunting of Hill House, but it's even more clear here that if she chooses to continue to pursue acting, she's got a GREAT future ahead of her in the industry. What an incredible talent she is.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unless you just want some more,
I think you better call Ghostbusters.""That pretty much sums up how I feel about the new film, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Leaning heavily on the nostalgia factor, it's sweetened for those that who sang ""busting makes me feel good"" with the 1984's OGs. But please, I'm calling on ALL the Ghostbusters, past and present, to put the final specter into the wall-mounted Ecto-Containment System, Storage Facility and Protection Grid, hang up your proton packs and call it a day. I really, really don't want some more.I mean, come on, when even Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd) and Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon) feel comfortable mocking their own theme song, it's time to stop crossing the streams.Mckenna Grace definitely carries the bulk of the busting load in Frozen Empire. She sparkles, she's sullen, she's relatable. Her Phoebe Spengler feels she's all grown up, having previously saved the world from a spectral takeover. Yet Gary, Callie and brother Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) still see her as a kid. Which, naturally, 2024's target audience of young teens will relate to.In trouble every time she turns around, even ending up in jail, simply because she loves busting ghosts with the adults. Phoebe is also definitely lonely, living in a firehouse, seeing herself as weird and nerdy. She ventures out into the adult world, sneaking around, poking a toe in a fiery relationship that is certainly doomed from the start. A relationship that might just end her life.Kumail Nanjiani's cast as the out-of-work, living in his dead Grandmother's apartment and selling her collectibles Nadeem Razmaadi. He tries and partially succeeds in harnessing the sexual innuendos that made the scenes between Signorney Weaver's Zuul The Gatekeeper and Rick Moranis' Clortho The Keymaster so hysterically memorable in 1984. Razmaadi learns he is a Firemaster, which is sort of like an Airbender, but with the ability to control great balls of fire.However, this firestarter doesn't have a foil to play against, unless you consider the Icebringer, an evil, horned spirit who has been freed from his ancient metallic jail and is intent on settling a permanent chill on all the citizens of NYC... and beyond the Brooklyn Bridge. But seducing the enemy is NOT where the writers went this time.Patience and Fortitude even make an appearance in Frozen Empire. The Public Library's beloved big marble cats are enlivened, and are once again spitting and snarling their outrage toward lowly humans. Naturally, cats gonna cat. And you can't have a Ghostbusters without the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man and Slimer, who are definitely running amok among the weird science.Yes, the OG are back, some in body, some in spirit. The love for all the characters is nuzzled along by co-writer Jason Reitman, son of OG Ivan Reitman, who previously directed Ghostbusters: Afterlife, with Gil Kenan, who is also the director of Frozen Empire. But please, it's been 30 years. Let the dead stay dead.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When we do actually focus on things mystic, the story revolves around a brass sphere that is covered with ancient hieroglyphics. This comes into the possession of 'Stantz"" (Dan Aykroyd) who takes it to the team for further investigation. Needless to say, that causes quite a bit of mayhem whilst, meantime, the mayor (William Atherton) is after the ""Ghostbusters"" for causing expensive havoc every time they trap a ghost. That contretemps will question the very existence of their firehouse operation and of their ongoing mission to boldy go... Anyway, as the plot lurches along we get the odd opportunity to see some proton packs in action; the old car gets put through it's paces and the original ""Bibendum"" ghosts get an outing or two, too, as a sort of bellwether for impending doom. That impending doom is all delivered, frostily, too little and too late to rescue this entirely derivative two hours from the cinema doldrums. The original cast - Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Aykroyd really need to stop appearing to legitimise these sequels - they are not patch on the original and really do smell, strongly, of flogging the dead horse. I would recommend a cinema viewing, though - at least that makes the most of the visuals. This will look distinctly mediocre on the television.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ghostbusters: Afterlife had managed to connect the original characters with the new ones in a very cohesive manner. After it was completed it felt like there were so many more stories that could be told with the new characters that were introduced. That was what I was expecting this film to do. Instead of exploring these characters in further detail and their relationships the writers decided simply to introduce more characters , many of whom were not particularly necessary to advancing the story.While the movie isn't horrendous it is simply not memorable at all. If you watch this movie and ask yourself the details of it and which function each character played a week later I wouldn't be surprised if the details are bit blurry.Overall , for me, this movie was a missed opportunity.

Here, the Spengler family reunion tour kicks off, merging the classic proton-pack-wielding OGs with their modern-day counterparts, who've been busy in a top-secret lab brewing up the next level of ghostbusting tech. Because, of course, after saving the world numerous times, the natural next step is to dabble in the mad sciences.The plot thaws when an ancient artifact, probably not covered by homeowner's insurance, unleashes an evil force threatening to turn our summer blockbusters into a winter wonderland. Ghostbusters new and old slap on their snow boots and set out to save the world from becoming the set of a Christmas special gone wrong.The blending of franchise elements is like watching your favorite band get back together, only to realize half of them have been replaced by their kids. It's heartwarming, yet you can't shake off the feeling that something's amiss-like when the movie dives headfirst into family bonding and a teenage drama that makes you wonder if you've accidentally stumbled into a CW series.Despite these frostbites, ""Frozen Empire"" delivers some genuinely cool (pun intended) scenes that justify forking over the price of admission. The visual spectacle is a fun, if not particularly deep, ride-kind of like a haunted house attraction at a theme park, but with more snow.Comparing it to ""Afterlife,"" this installment does feel like a slight step up-like going from a regular cola to one with a hint of cherry. Still, for someone like me, who prefers their Ghostbusters with more ""busting"" and less ""family-friendly bonding,"" the movie leans too heavy on the latter. It's a bit too Hallmark Channel meets Sci-Fi Network for my taste.But let's not forget the abundance of nostalgia that acts like comfort food for the soul. Seeing the original Ghostbusters gear up is like being wrapped in a warm blanket, made entirely of your childhood memories. It's a delightful yet dangerous game of nostalgia roulette, where every reference either hits the jackpot or lands you in eye-roll territory.In summary, ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" is the cinematic equivalent of a fun, slightly overpriced theme park ride. It's not the kind of movie you'd write home about, but you'll talk about it at work the next day. It's a visual treat that skates on the thin ice of substance, perfect for a popcorn-fueled escape from reality. Just don't expect a profound cinematic revelation-unless your revelation is realizing just how many teenagers you can fit into a single ghostbusting adventure.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Neither our new ghostbusters or our old ones get the attention they should.

She is never called on her selfishness either, actually she is rewarded for it at times. She was a joy in the first movie yes, but i also thought the first one was maybe too Phoebe focused. Well that's definitely double downed here, on top of the ridiculously oversized cast, Phoebe dominates so much of the movie that it's impossible for anyone else to shine. Ghostbusters was always a team movie but Phoebe dominates so much of these new movies, it asks the question is this really, ""Ghostbusters"" anymore or is it ""Ghostbuster""?For instance i thought Finn Wolfhard done a great job making Trevors character interesting in part one but was never given enough time or attention. He actually gets even less to do in this movie, to a point where his character is utterly pointless. This unfortunately could be said about alot of the characters here. Which begs the question if there was maybe less of them, the ones that remained may of had more time to shine.

A lot of movies from anywhere from 5 to 15 years ago until now have felt like the latter. The storyline of the franchise was fine where it was. There were no loose ends, and the characters were no longer in turmoil. Out of the blue another villain comes along for the sequel, and it happens again.Ghostbusters: Afterlife was not one of these. It was a charming movie and I loved all the little details, and I was wrapped up in the plot. I would not have to be dragged behind a horse to be convinced to watch it again.Frozen Empire was different. It still had charm and character, but it felt more reliant on the nostalgia of the series to keep the audience watching. In a vacuum, it's not that great of a movie. The plot isn't all too exciting, there are minor inconsistencies here and there, and it felt too formulaic and forced. The problems seem to come out of the blue, I mean, ghosts aren't normal, but past movies did a better job of explaining the threat. I probably will forget about this movie in five years and maybe won't watch it again for at least a decade. It's not a movie I enjoy so much that I still have fun the second time around. And this probably won't be the last of the franchise either, the last one was made only three years ago, and for a good movie that can be no time at all. They should take their time and put everything together right, which I know won't be what the studio wants because the original actors will be retiring soon and they probably want another movie with them in it.Now, I am certainly biased because of the upsetting trend I have seen where franchises start putting less effort into writing great stories and putting more effort into ""stunning"" visual effects. Now, with technology where it's at, we can visualize anything, it's not that big of a deal anymore. You can't hide behind a cool CGI show anymore. I don't know, it's just not hitting all the bases for me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It just takes ages before its antagonist actually gets out and about, and it kind of just feels like it's spinning its wheels for a long time before that. Plus, it doesn't really give any of its many characters anything to do. It clearly isn't sure who's actually its protagonist, but it doesn't feel like a proper ensemble piece either (not a cohesive one, at least). McKenna Grace's Phoebe Spengler is probably the closest thing the flick has to a main character, but her storyline is so rushed and haphazard (and annoyingly queerbaited; just let her kiss her ghost girlfriend, for god's sake) that it doesn't feel satisfying overall. Having said all that, the film is a fair bit of fluffy fun during its second act, and there aren't any real weak links within the extensive cast (Bill Murray does the bare minimum of the bare minimum, though). The third act sadly devolves into the ghostbusters simply standing next to each other and blasting the baddie with their proton packs, but prior to that there are some suitably spooky sequences (including a surprisingly atmospheric opening) and there are also a handful of genuinely rather amusing moments (although it isn't massively funny on the whole). Ultimately, this is a forgettable but fairly diverting franchise extension that may mostly just dangle IP in front of its audience like a set of keys, but has a beaming and seemingly honest smile on its face while it does. It often feels like it's little more than scene after scene of nonsense jargon about ghost particles and stuff, but it has several enjoyable sequences and typically keeps you engaged. It is too long, though.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was inevitable that a sequel would be explored.And...it's too bad that, instead of expanding on this, the filmmakers decided to just try to make the same film again.GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE finds the new heroes from AFTERLIFE (Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard and McKenna Grace) resettled into the old Ghostbuster's Fire Department Headquarters in New York City and are aided by the remaining ""classic"" Ghostbusters - Dan Akroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and (in a too brief appearance), Bill Murray.They are joined by newcomers Patton Oswalt (who is playing...well...a character quite like...Patton Oswalt), Emily Alyn Lind (as a ghost with a past...and a future...) and Kumail Nanjiani (who brings a bit of a lift to this outing in the ""Rick Moranis"" role) as well as good ol' William Ahterton as ""bad guy"" (from the first Ghostbuster film) Walter Peck.Writer/Director Gil Kenan (taking over the Director duty in this film from Ivan Reitman) hits all the right beats and this Ghostbusters is a ""fine"" entry in the universe - it just doesn't bring anything new and exciting to the party - and that's it's biggest flaw.This film is ""Fine"", but nothing ""Special"" or ""Nothing New"".And the same goes for the special effects and plotting of this film. They are all perfectly ""fine"", but nothing new.A perfectly agreeable way to spend a few hours - you'll be entertained by this entry in the Ghostbuster Universe - you just won't be strutting out of the theater at the end singing ""Who Ya' Gonna Call...""Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Afterlife. I thought it was a refreshing new installment that had some good casting choices within the Spengler family. The story was, for the most part well developed -- I only had few small grievances in that regard, and where it lacked it made up for by tugging on me emotionally. It was entertaining and I saw it many times!!The sequel Frozen Empire, bombed for me. The story was so poorly written that by time the ""villain"" comes in, it's for only a few minutes and was completely underwhelming.I think there were a total of 13 characters competing for screetime throughout the film. It was too much.Those 2 friends the Spengler kids made friends with in Afterlife (the Podcast kid and the girl) somehow ended up in New York for the summer. Why? How?? You expect me to believe one of them duped their parents by not being at space camp and that the other one somehow got an internship for Winston???? ... Seriously ...lol? They are neither well-developed characters, nor likeable...I unfortunately think that Ivan's passing perhaps had a negative impact in the direction this film turned out. I can't in good faith trust Jason Reitman or Gil Kenan with any future installments.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

They took a lot of risks with this film, not all of them worked, but i respect that they tried something new. While it was fun to see the old and new ghostbusters team up, I think that there were way too many characters in the film which resulted in a lot of characters not having any development and becoming a background character of sorts. I also feel like the main villain (I've already forgotten his name) was defeated so easily, like he was being built up throughout the film as this super powerful being and he only ended up having like 15 minutes of screen time before he was defeated. But even with its flaws this movie was it was still so fun.

Ghostbusters is the first film I really remember watching when I was 4 years old. I had a bunch of The Real Ghostbusters toys as a kid; I even got the ghost in a can Wimpy Meal in '89 for GB2 (UK), and I've been a fan ever since. One of my favourite embarrassing childhood memories to tell is of getting a Ghostbusters suit for Christmas when I was 5 and running out onto the landing in the dark in the nude and catching my thingy in the zip for the first time. And let me tell you, I adored Frozen Empire! Afterlife eventually grew on me, but Frozen Empire was an absolute blast! It was spookier and way funnier than Afterlife, delivering everything I hoped for in the first place. Everyone has their own opinions, but as a fan for almost 40 years, I can't understand how anyone who loves Ghostbusters could trash this movie like I've been seeing. It was a fast-paced, enjoyable time at the movies! Golden years indeed.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

Mckenna Grace was the best part of Ghostbusters: Afterlife. She was able to channel Egon Spengler created by Harold Ramis. Mekenna did such an outstanding job I really enjoyed Afterlife but sadly for some reason they reduced her contribution in Frozen Empire to just another one of the many characters in the film. She still does a great job but she should have been the star in the film and was simply relegated to supporting character.Don't get me wrong, if you are a Ghostbusters fan this isn't the worst film by a long shot and I did enjoy them bringing back all of the old cast but it felt like they spent too much time on the nostalgia aspects of the film and almost nothing on the back story of the villain and the film comes off just slightly better than flat.There really is no leading character and much of the comedy falls flat. Even Bill Murry couldn't save the film as it's not really about anyone or anything. It was hard for me to connect to any of the characters since it was all over the place trying to hook you with the original cast and it just wasn't done as well as it was in the previous film where you get to connect with Harold's character in a touching way that did justice to his character.See it but set your expectation low and you should have some fun. Hopefully McKenna will be back as the main focus in the next film should they decide to make another. And NOT every film has to have a happy ending. Give us a cliff hanger setting up the next one. :)Keep on busting.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And... Argh... It is oke but also a bit boring. The positive is that the old cast is still gold. The moment Bill Muray is in view the whole energy and chemistry of the movie goes upward. That guy.. he cant do must wrong and still gives you a bright smile. The legend.The 'firemaster' is prettt decent aswell with some good, average and bad jokes. You accept him as an extra for the ride.The rest of the old cast is decent.Now... All the other 'new' actors.. they just cant transfer the energy, chemistry or the ghostbusters vibe towards me. The dialoge is stiff, the acting a little bid 'try to hard' and without a real soul or meaning. Maybe I am a bit nostalic, and they changed their audience target to a younger public? I am afraid if the old cast stops, this whole triology is gonna fall apart if they decide to make another. But i am afraid it wont come to anotherone if I watched the turn up.What else; GCI didnt make this movie any better. The script had some big malfunctions. The scene of a young girl, all alone, playing chest in a public park, at night, out of nowhere.. I mean come on. How can any professional scriptmaker or director come up with such a unrealistic scène!? The blue ghost? Waste of time.All by all.. if your really nostalic.. just watch the first movie again at home. Maybe a better evening. If your bored; with a discount you can go.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There was more character development in my friends clash of clans game than there was in the actual movie, as he tragically lost his match showing more emotion than most of the people in this movie and their reactions to the actual ghosts.

None of the characters really seem that likeable either, there is almost zero heart. Having the family live in the firehouse I think is an enormous mistake and will hamper any potential sequels also - please, no more. It just doesn't work. The mother is neither a convincing Ghostbuster, nor a convincing mother for example. The brother isn't necessary either. McKenna Grace and Paul Rudd are the only Ghostbuster additions I think that should have been kept into this film. Add in Aykroyd and Hudson and you have 4. That's enough!But no, everyone can be a Ghostbuster, right? That is sort of what the movie appears to say. Very much forgetting its simple ""let's start an exterminator business, work at it, fail and fail some more and then succeed"" roots and ""who you gonna call?"" from the first film. Now all you need is a proton pack and be an adult.Should have limited the number of Ghostbusters and simplified the ideas in this. Reveal the bad guy much sooner and arrive at the threat to New York much earlier also.The movie somehow does go over many of the same tropes of the original film but with much less humour.The only new interesting aspects: the bad guy and the threat to New York. Pretty decent actually. The rest of the movie just goes over familiar ground in a very messy way.Should have left the ""franchise"" with Afterlife I'm sorry to say. It had a lot of heart and some magic at least. This one will leave you cold like its title.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

Well, it's that time again to pick up the phone, GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE is here. Let's get into it. Sequel to AFTERLIFE, the Spengler family has moved back to the Big Apple, back in the firehouse that started it all. The old cast once again joins the new cast to stop a new enemy that threatens to bring the world into a new ice age. I enjoy these movies, but they never reach the heights of what I think they could. AFTERLIFE was the closest to get there. FROZEN EMPIRE feels like nostalgia bait with too many characters that are inconsequential to the story. The mom has nothing to do, the son barely gets anything. A couple characters make an appearance simply because they were in the last one. They crammed a lot of stories in here, most of them I actually cared about. The problem was they didn't have time to really explore them or dig deeper. For example, there's one involving the daughter and a ghost she meets in the park. I love this because they touch on the fact that not all ghosts are bad, and what actually happens to them after they get busted. I'm happy Paul Rudd is in this, he just makes everything better. His role in this one was good because he's trying to walk the fine line of being a potential father figure, while still being fun. Some of the new characters were very fun, like Patton Oswalt and Kumail Nanjiani. Overall, there are too many stories and characters, but I still had a fun time. If they make another one, I'd like them to focus on the new Spengler family dynamic, and not rely on nostalgia of the old.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, this was so full of stale clichés, non-connecting characters and pointless meandering that it became a torture to bear until the end. In the absence of a good story, director Kenan evidently tried to fill the 90+ minutes with plastic sentimentality which does not work.

It's not just a cynical cash-grab of the 40-year old hit movie.As expected, you get a mix of ecto-plasmic proton blasts, nerdy paranormal techno-speak and '80s nostalgia - but 'G:FE' also displays unexpected heart and grit.The first half of the film focuses on the Spengler family, who've moved into the famous Manhattan firehouse to carry on the family business of trapping spooks. When New York once again faces an existential threat from the paranormal, we are re-introduced to the O. G. Team: Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) and Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd). Ernie Hudson is back in an expanded role both in pecking order and screen time - he's now a financier and in charge of a ghost-busting research group.Is the new Ghostbusters a must-see movie event? Not exactly, but it's solid. The movie trades on the good will of fans of the original but doesn't take it for granted.The newer cast members who carry the ball most of the film are likeable and the visit with the O. G. Crew was a pleasant-enough blast from the past.Now to answer some burning questions about 'Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire':
1. Does it have the iconic theme song by Ray Parker Jr.? Yes
2. First appearance by Bill Murray? About the midway point
3. Is the 2016 ""Female Ghostbusters"" film referenced at all? No.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There was a guy in the theater where I saw this laughing loudly at things that weren't funny. Maybe he's the target audienc?Bill Murray does nothing but smirk. It was funny in 1984. It's not funny anymore. Other original actors are treading water with a very poor script. While it's marginally fun to see these folks again, the narrative is so plodding and unfunny, you lose whatever nostalgic juju you might have for the material.This is so bad that the powers that be should really consider letting this go before any shred of dignity has disapated.There are many specific elements I could comment on, but I don't want to create spoilers, even though there is incongruity in aging, a disastrous cosmic relationship, and paltry few laughs - except for the guy in the theater who was having a 1984 time travel experience.","13 out of 30 found this helpful.

While this entry had its strengths, it also struggled with balancing homage to the original films and introducing new elements, resulting in a film that was good but not exceptional.The plot follows the Ghostbusters relocating to New York City and occupying the iconic Firehouse, only to face a new threat unleashed by an ancient artifact, intent on plunging the world into an Ice Age. The movie paid homage to its predecessors, but at times, it felt overstuffed with various plot elements, aiming to please everyone but missing the mark of greatness.The ensemble cast was impressive, featuring familiar faces and new additions, with everyone delivering solid performances. The special effects were top-notch, capturing the essence of the franchise, and the New York City setting added to the nostalgic feel of the film. However, the original cast felt underutilized, and the focus on the younger characters, particularly Podcast, provided the film's highlights.Unfortunately, some aspects of the plot felt forced, particularly the character of Phoebe, whose decisions triggered the events of the film. Her subplot, including a romantic angle with a ghost, felt out of place and detracted from the overall experience. Additionally, the portrayal of the main antagonist, while visually striking, suffered from limited screen time.Despite these shortcomings, ""Ghostbuster Frozen Empire"" introduced intriguing new ghostbusting technology and showcased some cool ideas. While it may not have reached its full potential, it still offered an entertaining experience for fans of the franchise.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I had definitely been missing out on something here.I have to say that Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman brought the franchise back on track, because ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" was actually every bit as enjoyable as the 1984 ""Ghostbusters"" and the 1989 ""Ghostbusters II"" movies. So thumbs up for accomplishing that; it was quite a feat. I was genuinely and wholeheartedly entertained throughout the course of the 115 minutes that ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" ran for.The acting performances in the movie are good. And while Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard and Mckenna Grace certainly carried the movie well, it was the likes of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson that gave the movie its charm and grace, especially since it catered so well to us that grew up with ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Ghostbusters II"". Just a shame that Harold Ramis wasn't around for this, and the movie would also have benefitted from having Sigourney Weaver on the cast list once again. And it certainly was also nice to see the likes of Annie Potts and William Atherton returning to reprise their characters. And the movie also brought in Patton Oswalt in a nice role, just a shame that he wasn't given more on-screen time.Visually then ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" is great. I really enjoyed the CGI special effects in the movie, because it looked spectacular, and they really worked in a lot of nice details. The CGI effects really brought the ghosts to life on the screen in a memorable manner.If you enjoy the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise, then you most certainly do not want to miss out on watching director Gil Kenan's 2024 movie ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"".My rating of ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This latest (and hopefully last) sequel has lost much of it's former glory AND fun...The bad: humor is quite personal, I only can share my exeperience and I didnt laugh once. Not even a smirk or a smile! (And I laughed my head off with the original, just saying...)More bad: yes, we do get to see a bit of the old Ghostbusters crew, but the original Ghostbusters crew are more in a supporting role now and Bill Murray's role was so small that I wondered why he even joined this sequel in the first place.What we do get to see a lot of are a bunch of unknown young actors who cannot replace the excuberance and wit of Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd in their younger years.BEWARE all you original Ghostbuster fans, this movie will be disappointing if your expectations are high. I would never dare recommend it to any of the fans of the original. You have been warned!!!To all the other youngsters out there who have never seen the original Ghostbusters, my first advice would be to NOT watch this latest sequel, but instead watch the brilliant and hilariously funny original Ghostbusters from 1984!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Watch it if you want; I am not going to stop you. Or don't; it's also kind of a waste of time. I should say that the film is an improvement over Afterlife in many ways; it's slightly funnier, a bit more well structured, and uses its ideas a little better. The damnation by faint praise is intentional; slightly more than the bare minimum is still not a good thing.It's okay. It's okay as okay comes. Afterlife was ""almost not okay,"" and now this one is ""okay.""It's very disappointing to see a horror comedy that barely makes you laugh and never makes you scared. And don't give me some crap about how I'm not a kid anymore and pg13 this or you're older now that: go watch The House With the Clock in Its Walls. It's not a perfect or great movie. But it is more than good enough; it's funny, it's scary, and it is for kids. And I still remember it years after watching it, which definitely won't the be the case for Frozen Empire years from now.What is very disappointing about all of this is that Ghostbusters 2 shouldn't be a hard film to write. The first one is about, to distill the film greatly, entrepreneurs creating a new kind of business. Basically, they're the first exterminators in town. The next Ghostbusters movie obviously should have been about that business becoming bigger somehow, someway- there a billion directions you could take it. But Hollywood always does the dumb thing where the Ghostbusters start back from square one, and fight a new, overhyped villain. Can't we get beyond this and finally see a world where Ghostbusters are commonplace someway somehow? Frozen Empire wants to show you a bunch of stuff you have already seen but with a new snow cone flavored villain. Cool, call me back when you have a story.Essentially, every Ghostbusters sequel makes the same exact mistake: Going too big with the ghosts and too small with the Ghostbusters. We don't need or want another new big bad who wants to end the world, but better this time. We want to see the natural expansion of the business created in the first film. Or just something funny and scary.This is as fun as treading water. Scratch that, it's as fun as treading water while you slowly watch the head of the Ghostbusters franchise, once again, disappear below the water line. Call me next time, I'll write you an outline that's better than this entire film in twenty minutes or less.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He fit for the summer school teacher.. but I just don't buy him as the lead Ghostbuster. And the mom didn't really seem to want to be a Ghostbuster. The story just didn't really make sense or feel justified and even the underlying premise felt forced. I just can't stand when things in the story just don't make sense. It's frustrating. It doesn't have to be perfect.. but at least try! Characters did stuff that just didn't make sense for what has happening in the story. There were still some fun moments, but just didn't work for me.

I want to enjoy any film I spend my time watching, especially stuff related to that which I love, I'm just so tired of the attitude that mere association to greatness is enough.The original cast members are wasted too.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't even remember if I've ever yawn on a cinema before, but this time I did, constantly :SI was constantly thinking if the ""action"" would ever pick up again in this movie and towards the end, it had something slightly better than all the rest of the movie but pretty pretty mediocre. Not much to raise my rating above 2 (with them being lucky for that)Such a wasted opportunity... I would say that you can safely pass this movie on a cinema and save that for anything else, any other movie or whatever else you prefer.

Could have nailed so much nostalgia and created an extremely impressive script had it not been for a sidetracked plot.The film focused a lot on the B-plot of female Harry Potter (Phoebe) and her ghastly crush (Melody), instead of elaborating on the main plot or development of Nadeem (you know, a crucial character in the film).For a Ghostbusters film, it was critical to focus on the story of the main 4 Ghostbuster's and their family relationship, but mostly expand more on the lore of the poltergeists or Nadeem and his role. It ended up being less of ""Frozen Empire"" and more of ""Ghostbusters: Phoebe's Reinstatement"".Score and Visuals were good. I particularly enjoyed the visual design of the poltergeists, especially the primarily featured one.Overall, the film had potential to be a 8.5 or 9/10, but ended up being bland mostly due to a secondary plot which took precedence over the story, leaving everything in the main plot to be resolved with convince and not good writing.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Transitioning Ghostbusters from Oklahoma to New York with a new cast felt abrupt. The inclusion of a mom, a teacher, and two teenagers as Ghostbusters seemed jarring; there was a missed opportunity for character development through a time skip. Among the cast, the strongest performances came from Dan Aykroyd, Patton Oswalt, and Bill Murray. However, the film deviated from its plot with excessive exposition scenes, leading to dull moments. The villain's delayed reveal and limited screen time left the climax feeling anticlimactic. The writing felt lackluster, the comedy fell flat, and the portrayal of Igon's daughter as an annoyance was disappointing.

The jokes are on point, Ecto-1 and the Firehouse have enough screentime and the old guard doesn't miss out either and lands a few decent lines. Nevertheless, the nice family story about the Spenglers is continued, which shows the problems of adolescent teenagers without making it too dramatic. In any case, there's plenty of fun to be had and I think the LGBTQ community will also get their money's worth from Phoebe's storyline without it being too over the top.The movie has more action and comedy and a little less family stuff than its predecessor and I think it's a solid start for a new and younger Ghostbusters team and a nice revival of the franchise.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

But Frozen Empire turns into another disappointment.Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has all the bad tropes that haunt almost every single legacy sequel. A new character who has great power but doesn't know of its existence until just now, and within minutes, they master it, check. A character who from the movie before was actually intelligent is then now making horrible decisions, check. Old beloved franchise favorites who are there for the nostalgia bait and nothing more, check. Then, of a course, a new evil villain who promises to bring about the world's destruction but is defeated almost immediately, check.This film does absolutely nothing new and is nowhere near as endearing, as fun, or as funny as past Ghostbusters films or its far superior predecessor Ghostbusters: Afterlife.The writing is boring, the story is dumb, the jokes are horrible, the acting is good, and the cast they do their best but with this material, there's really not much that can be done. The cinematography and cgi are good enough it's not terrible, and it's not great.There are just so many issues with this film, subplots that are ridiculous and not necessary. Then, the culmination of this mess is just a joke. This new villain who has been built up to be a new menacing force only to be defeated within minutes of his arrival.Finally, this film tries so hard to convince us of its grand scope, but in reality, the scale here is extremely small. Then everything ends in the Ghostbusters firehouse? This new villain seeks to destroy the world and has already unleashed a ton of new ghosts, but he just has to make a stop at the firehouse first? He's already proven the Ghostbusters couldn't touch him, so why bother with them just destroy the world as planned.There are so many other things I could bash on, but I feel that would spoil certain aspects of the film.Anyway, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is a very unfortunate disappointment. Especially for me as a new Ghostbusters fan. It's sad to see such a fun franchise be brought down to this.This disappointing year continues. If Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes disappoints, then I may just die.IMDb: 3/10

Annie Potts looks the same as she did decades ago, and is still a spitfire. Murray is funny and one of the few bright spots in the movie. Akyroyd needed someone to be his funny man so he could be the straight one, but was okay. Ernie Hudson is excellent as always. My one laugh was when William Atherton came on the scene - smart choice! Finn Wolfhard has a few good lines and brings some believability to the movie. Kumail Nanjiani overacts, but it's meant to be ridiculous so it works. I don't know why the writers didn't use someone as funny as Paul Rudd to deliver comedic lines. Instead, he's wimpy and uncharacteristically underutilized. The main actress (McKenna Grace) might be good at her craft, but she's written as an angry EMO teen - wholly unlikeable throughout the entire movie. Cringeworthy scenes that I just wanted to be over. Carrie Coon, a really good actress, is completely wasted here with few lines and none of them good. Celeste O'Connor is the token black girl with inappropriate sexual comments and first-year student acting.CGI for the ghosts - mostly well done except, regrettably, the MAIN ghost. He looks like a nightmarish Tim Burton character; more demon than ghost.The plot is horribly slow and people in the theater were playing games on their phones during the last half of the movie. There are too long diatribes that had no apparent purpose and little actual action. Where's the humor? I laughed 1 time and smiled fewer than a half dozen times. What did the movie want to be? It certainly wasn't a comedy.Overall, it could have been good, but relied far too heavily on the special effects at the expense of the writing. The three stars are for those actors who did the best they could with a dog of a script.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Her mother is always on her back, but it's okay for her to stay out at night in Manhattan and play chess. Phoebe from Afterlife was quirky and fun; every appearance of Phoebe from GFE after five minutes is just cringeworthy. Makes Podcast tolerable.Nadeem: I'm not sure why he is there. Can't be for comic relief because about 90% of his jokes are hit-and-miss. Just because he's camp doesn't make him funny.Goraka: Mr Freeze sounded awkward in the first place but they made him scary enough. Just wish we would have seen more of him. Oh wait, we needed more screen time for the Phoebe-Melody thing.Melody: Ghostbusters meets Ghost, and not in a good way.The original crew: Winston and Ray are ok, but I thought Venkman was brought in for no apparent reason than, well, be there.All in all, a physically painful experience, although I was sitting in a brand new cinema, with comfortable seats and a well-behaved audience.

This for me caused the film to have two major problems, one being that most of the screen time is dominated by 2/3 characters whilst the others sit in the background. Secondly the villain doesn't seem powerful enough to be a fitting opponent to both teams of ghostbusters. I'll go into each a bit more later on but for now let's talk about the franchise as whole. Personally it's not a franchise I have any real love for but I appreciate a lot of people do, this seems odd to me as from what I can gather the general consensus is that only the first film is universally loved. Despite the mixed reception the rest of the films seem to get they all seem to do fairly well at the box office and I'll be honest I'm not sure why that is. Is it because the likes of Bill Murray and co are still such a box office pull even for younger audiences or is it simply a franchise people have nostalgia for?I can't decide but being that it seems inevitable that there will be more films following Frozen Empire where will this franchise go?It either stays as it is a cluttered mess that has mixed reviews or takes the chance and goes it alone without the original team but what affect would that have on the box office numbers? It's a conundrum indeed.As I briefly mentioned before, the first issue I had with the film was its underuse of certain characters. To give specifics would be going into spoiler territory but the story itself centres mainly around one of the new team and one of the original team members. The rest of the characters are just there because hey they've been ghostbusters in the past so that means they have to appear in every follow up film right?I dread to think how much they payed Bill Murray to appear in this.Despite the already large number of characters the film decides to add two new characters the enjoyable if surprising inclusion of comedian James Acaster as a ghost technician. As well as the introduction of Kumail NanJiani who has a much larger role to play than James and is essentially the films comic relief character. I found Kumail's character to be largely annoying but his character seemed to be going down well with younger audience members at least in my showing anyway.The second major issue is the films villain. It does a half decent job of building up the villain and their capabilities to cause havoc but when it came down to it I was massively underwhelmed. In fact overall the film was lacking in general ghostbusting action, the opening sequence is about the best action sequence throughout the runtime. I have to feel this again is largely down to their being too many hero characters. No matter how seemingly big, bad or scary the villain could have been it would have been hard for them not to be outnumber by just the sheer amount of 'good' characters.I feel like I've dogged on this film but I just feel the franchise as a whole is overhyped. It's not an out and out bad film and I think it's one than younger audiences in particular will have a good time with. For me however it was just a bit meh and I wouldn't watch it again.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I don't go to movies to see myself, I go to them to lose myself in fantasy.Anyway, normally I would give a mediocre by likeable movie like this a 7, but the kids dragged that number down.Stop casting movies by commitee or by demographics. Start casting them like you're trying to create a perfect work of art.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

They tried to hard to make it like the first, adding their own touch to it, but it just didn't work. The pacing wasn't building or didn't have the suspense, and the action was pretty basic. It was so annoying how they had to put a joke in almost every scene, and that so called ""humor"" they tried to do failed. The visuals was a letdown, especially that over the time Ghostbusters did a good upgrade, not mentioning ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" that I think was one of the best ones, also from the visual side. But no, unfortunately, this was not my cup of tea. A disappointing sequel, and I think they should stop.

Familiar characters move this along at a steady pace, with a few favourite ghosts thrown in for good measure (you would have seen them in the trailer, so no surprises there). Nothing shines in this movie, but nothing sucks about it either.

This movie captures the charm of the originals and while continuing to develop a new cast to carry on the torch.The villain is simple yet menacing. The effects are nice, but in that distinctive ghost busters style. The comedy is on point yet recognizably similar to that school boy nerd humor that made the original so relatable. You can tell that this movie was made first and foremost to be a ghost busters movie and not a preachy ghost busters knock off. The icing on the cake is that by avoiding the preachy nonsense that modern Hollywood is building into it's films nowadays, we were able to get a movie that does diversity right without sacrificing what made the original films great.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

It turned out pretty damn fine and Jason Reitman just did the whole trick with family ties for the movie series and for himself, personally and revived the cult trilogy for another magic touch, making it all special, for the perfect comeback.But greedy Hollywood remains at it is and one magical touch didn't make it, so the lemon needed to be sneezed till it will be dry in a movie that presses all buttons together, to see what will come up better for several audiences. It has a mix that leans heavily on cameos from the original trilogy, turns to a new audience, talks about family, estrange kids and what not.On this type of movie, you get a lot, but actually getting nothing. It starts fresh with a chase in New York and then starts spreading for several directions, like it trying to fish its audience with several story and theme directions. Ghosts? You got to be kidding me. Genre? Let's try a few and see what works.Hollywood is at its peak of trying to reboot, restart of re-invent past success - this movie is a good example of how it is done - backwards. Like start wars revival with a great tribute in the first movie, that was a fan service, with a lot of respect for the past and then...well you know the rest of it. No one wants to touch this thing for another decade.This movie and possible series of movies is and are redundant. Last act is so predictable, first act is so boring and the middle is just...well...a big nothing. Characters pops and goes, Finn Wolfhard is like a decoration and won't miss a sole, if wasn't there. The Oldtimers are coming to punch in and youngsters are not convincing or interesting.Gil Kenan was promoted into the director this time and switched roles with Reitman. Probably for a good reason, from Reitman's side. The story is poorly told, there are too many characters with little bonding time and the whole thing looks taped from fragments of ideas.The ghosts of the past are performing, for a small portion of time, on this movie, but they demonstrate that sometimes we need to lock them deep in the closet and don't let them get out, even for the price of a small success. Cult movies from that kind of type are very hard to reconstruct - better luck on the next time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He appeared too mature to convincingly portray an 18-year-old boy, and his comedic performance fell short. His acting was lackluster.

They just relied on an old lighter and a tiny matchstick.Ghostbusters generally speaking is more fun rather than scares. I've never been a huge Ghostbusters fan; I watched them a lot as a kid but didn't really connect with them. It's strange because I really enjoyed Scooby-Doo.The film lacks the excitement to keep you on the edge of your seat. Even the opening car chase didn't seem as fast or intense. I appreciate that the story's somewhat self-contained, so you don't necessarily need to have seen the previous one, but it still helps. The first act mainly focuses on the characters' everyday lives, but it didn't grab my attention.It's not particularly gripping. The scene where they attempted to extract the ghost from the ball was when it started to interest me, but then it lost my interest again. One positive aspect is that it doesn't feel as long as it actually is, nearly 2 hours.I didn't like that a couple scenes were cut short to maintain a PG-13 rating, like when Phoebe was clearly about to curse. This movie really really felt like it was targeted towards kids. While some family movies are fine, this one felt like a lot had to be toned down to make it suitable for families.The premise is alright, but the movie lacked that spark or magic to make it truly good. It's just a bit underwhelming. I did like the villain, the God ghost; it was quite ominous and scary. Another example of the rating hurting the movie was that the god-ghost could've easily killed the family. He was so powerful and terrifying, literally a god. You know in horror movies when the character you're rooting for is meant to run and you're shouting at the tv for him to run, but he's just moving slowly or stood still, in fear... that's how I felt about the god ghost, like c'mon let's get it moving, let's get it moving bro.They should've destroyed his horns afterwards as well. Some scenes felt unnecessarily prolonged, artificially building suspense. It gave me the same feeling as when a presenter tries too hard to make something exciting by delaying announcing the winner, and overdoing it.The family dynamic subplot wasn't convincingly executed. Despite the plot's scale, the movie doesn't feel epic, nor as fun. It's rather forgettable. I've seen some people say 'don't trust the critics, boo hoo,' but honestly, the movie just isn't great man. It's not terrible, just very forgettable.The credit scene wasn't that great; it was meant to be funny, I think. But almost everyone had already left, either during the movie or as soon as the credits rolled, even parents with their kids. I stayed because I'm currently waiting to watch another movie while writing this review rn. It surprised me because when I tried to think of the movie's redeeming qualities other than the ancient-phantom-god, I thought maybe kids would enjoy it more. I guess not. It feels like something that should've been on Nickelodeon rather than in theaters.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Ghostbusters always has been a film for the youth but some cracking films!So ignore any negative reviews you read, get to the cinema and watch it for yourself, you won't be let down unless you're expecting something which isn't ghostbusters.There are some great scenes, good effects and the storyline is good too. Some funny moments throughout so enjoy the film for what it is and definitely one with GB Afterlife to get the kids into the franchise too. Overall very happy with the final film.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

The trailer for Frozen Empire was a pretty good trailer and I was excited. Almost immediately I could tell something was off with pacing and tone. I didn't realize it until the end but this film isn't directed by Reitman's son Jason and it shows. Frozen Empire reminded me of a cross between the 2016 reboot and Afterlife. It's way more kid friendly. The first two thirds are kind of boring. The last act is convoluted and pretty basic. A lack luster finale. I was very disappointed by this entry after being pretty excited by the trailer. This film is a missed opportunity and I can't see the franchise moving forward in it's current state.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Lots of new characters added meant no one had anything to do. They was very little chemistry between any of them. Very little humour meant the film flatlined after 15 minutes. A plot point that could have lead to a fantastic twist was wasted. Then we have a big bad at the climax that was such a let down. Getting back to the overload of new characters, it spoiled any chance of development of the family dynamics that worked in Afterlife. It's hard to say which of them had the worse story arc so I'm not going to try.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's a little fast and character heavy, so they don't have time to deep dive into everything, but it definitely sets up a future for the ghostbusters franchise, which is ultimately what we super fans all want.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

Made 40 years ago, the original 'Ghostbusters' still looks amazing today. Considering how far CGI developed, and made on a budget of $100 million (!!!!), I'm sorry to say 'Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire' looks awful!! I guess most of the budget went towards paying the actors. What happened to Hollywood?Speaking of actors, there are way too many characters in this movie! I mean hell, there were so many that I found it hard keeping track of all of them. There simply was not enough room in one movie for all of these characters. There's plenty of nostalgia here with the return of Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray, Annie Potts all reprising their original roles. And even Slimer is back! Unfortunately all of them looked out of place in this movie and in my opinion was added simply to pay homage to the original film.'Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire' is a prime example of lazy film making. Some movies look amazing with CGI, but this film truly looks horrible. There are also hardly any practical effects here; everything is CGI. It looks as if the film was shot in a studio with everything being added in post-production. The acting didn't look convincing, the characters were bland and so annoying cracking their silly one-liners, and the premise was...what was it about again...? Enough said!The film is about an orb containing an ancient evil that lands in the possession of the ghostbusters. The orb belonged to Nadeem Razmaadi, whose family owns various artifacts. This character was so obviously based on the Louis Tully character from the original 'Ghostbusters', portrayed by Rick Moranis. Unfortunately, the Nadeem character was not as effective and this shameless copy/paste character was another example of lazy film making/lazy script writing.And then there's 15-year old Phoebe who is banished from being a ghostbuster because she is a minor. She befriends a ghost and this was were they attempted emotional depth, but alas, there was no room for emotion in an often slapstick-filled fantasy comedy.The lion statues coming to life are back, the library ghost is back, oh and look, they're trying to make minions out of mini marshmallow men! Ugh, enough already! By now you've probably already gathered I did not like this movie. In fact, the ONLY film in the 'Ghostbusters' franchise I enjoyed was the original. I also found 'Frozen Empire' utterly forgettable.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

They should of went through the frozen city in 2 separate teams Ghostbusting - 1 Brown Team - 1 Red Team - and then the Final Climactic Battle.If I take away the 4DX Amplification of Everything, Flashing Lightning, Seats Moving, Smoke, Wind, Rain. This Film is a 4/10 or Lower.Positives -👍1. The Dialogue is Really Good and Witty throughout almost all of the Film.👍2. The Chemistry between most of the Characters was Good to Watch.🤷3.

Aside from some hardware upgrades (like remote-controlled and drone-assisted traps) there's nothing new, just 2 hours of generic Ghostbusters content, a token bad guy and even the same concerns regarding overcrowding in the Containment Unit are rehashed. There are a few decent gags and some nostalgia from the first film but no central message - no triumph over adversity, no hero's journey, no character redemption, nothing. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire could have easily been 20mins shorter for the benefit of younger audiences and serves only to illustrate how combining a good cast with entertaining source material and an ample production budget can still result in a - excuse the pun - lifeless film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But Hollywood does like a long run up and it had to have been the previous year?What we got from the trailer was the world being attacked by some kind of ice ghost which could turn cities into an icicle, but not much else was on offer.Obviously hopes were high based on the previous movie, but much like Ghostbusters 2, this was a bit of a disappointment.The story concerns some kind of super ghost which has been trapped inside a metallic orb, which somehow lands in the lap of the Ghostbusters. Stuff happens and it gets out. No spoilers here.So why isn't this as good as the previous film? Well for one the new Ghostbusters are the entire blended family. Which doesn't seem to fit with the lore, even if it does give Hollywood some licence to discuss blended family ""issues"". But seriously, this is a Ghostbusters movie so it just doesn't fit. Also Paul Rudd and the mother also being involved doesn't seem to work either, same can be said for the old receptionist. It seems they didn't learn the lesson from the female version they are still trying to shoehorn women into the Ghostbusters overalls. In short there are simply too many Ghostbusters in this movie for there to be enough story and character time for you to care about any of them. We don't need 10 Ghostbusters but that is obviously the DEI box ticking influence.And that is the root of the problem. The narrative doesn't feel cohesive and as others pointed out, feels like a bunch of unrelated set pieces with some fan service added. For instance we see the mini stay pufts a number of times which simply seem free to roam unhindered. Probably because some panel discovered people like them and they can sell them as merch. But like Slimer they add zero to the story.A major disappointment was that if you seen the trailer you have seen the biggest set piece of the movie, in its entirety. While it does have some charm it doesn't have the emotional engagement or even emotional punch of the first. If there is a third some serious thinking has to be done in order to focus on narrowing down the story to the kids and to forget the adult family dynamic drama and DEI inserts. This is supposed to be a kid movie that is good enough for adults to sit through. I am not sure either demographic would be satisfied at having to do so.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Then there are the ok sequels, Hangover 2 is ok but the first one was the better one, Ghostbusters 1 is superior to 2, two was ok but it lacked that initial punch of the first one and Frozen Empire is the same. It has some good bits, some not so good bits and a few pacing issues. Good bits Ray and the gang are in it some funny jokes, the bad bits too much teenage drama and hints of ghost busting without really seeing it (dunno if this is budget related) not enough Bill Murray. Pacing at times was ... teenager drama driven and dragged down the pace.

Great family movie with a little adult humor. 10 out of 10 recommend. It's a total thrill ride!!!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Great funny movies. As to the current version, it just seems as if it just an attempt for a cash grab. It was nice to see many from the original cast revising their rolls but it just seems like they were going thru the motions, especially Bill Murray. I truly hope the screen play was written AI as at least I could explain how unfunny this movie is. The writers need to learn how to be funny and are not just putting out such non-original crap. I truly hope that the producers will finally let go of this franchise and spend their time looking for good original scripts.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Its not a fun film to watch, and I didnt enjoy it at all, particularly when you've just paid a substantial sum to watch it with popcorn. If this was on netflix, I wouldnt even have it playing in the background while moving the lawn. Its actually depressing. And I simply cant understand why they continue to undermine films with the wants and expectations of the alphabet people.Overall, the storyline is decent, however ruined by the excessive cast, the attempt to make the girl the main character while having most of the original cast in the film.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I understand they have a job to do but do not take their word for it. #Ghostbusters #FrozenEmpire is a lot of fun and worth seeing on the big screen, IMO!As a huge fan, I cannot tell you how long I have been waiting for THIS exact type of movie. Continuing the story with only a passing reference to the past and/or building upon what is already there. A new story, even if based on elements from the long running cartoon series, The Real Ghostbusters.This movie WAS the cartoon come to life. I have ONE real complaint... it wasn't nearly long enough of a movie. I feel there are some story points missing. 1 hour and 55 mins goes VERY very fast. All of a sudden you're in the 3rd act.The movie isn't perfect, and it doesn't have to be.The movie is, of course, not better than the original. NONE of the movies are. They are all good sequels, and this one is no exception.The visuals were the best mix of practical and CGI since... #GhostbustersAfterlife. On a personal note this movie had more of Ecto-1 in it than ANY movie previous, which delights me to no end.Several cast members can be considered to have stolen the show, with a fun surprise at the end, but if I break that down, it will give to much away.So do yourself a favor. If you're into sci-fi/fantasy or specifically Ghostbusters, go see Frozen Empire today!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

A few good moments were provided by Bill Murray... which might count to 4-5 minutes of screen time? There were so many subplots, besides the end of the world (always, these days), it was truly hard to get into any of it.

Everything is supposed to be fan service but comes off more like a really badly acted and horribly scripted Scooby Do episode. The computer graphics is awful, the sound design abysmal, and the acting is average at best.I suppose the humor is somewhat okay, I even laughed once. And except for the negatives already mentioned the rest is okay, or at least competent.The worst of the movie though is the characters. The main ""new"" ghostbuster team are all really bad characters and generally badly written. The actors are not very good either, but I cannot blame them too much, it is the writing and the characters themselves which are really bad.I think this is somewhat better than the two previous attempts of rejuvenating this franchise, but that is not saying much. I think if you are 12y and have never seen Ghostbusters before and have a very limited grasp of what a good movie is then you might enjoy this, but for the rest of humanity this is a really bad movie.I give this a generous 3/10 because this is not completely awful and for a laugh or two.

Rusted on fans of the original will enjoy their stroll down memory lane, others not so. There are occasional quips, but the story is flat save for the relationship developing between the younger Spengler and a chess playing ghost. However, the decision to dilute this to a point where not even a kiss is shared counters the important role this character plays in the plot. Otherwise, the plot is paper thin: A new ghost is in town, and the gang defeat it. The suspense on whether they will succeed is non-existent.

Whenever we watch modern movies she has a tendency to still find them entertaining while I complain that things just aren't as good as what they were in the old days. This was certainly the case with Ghostbusters Afterlife which she enjoyed, and has watched multiple times, while i didn't really care for it that much despite a quite good third act.I honestly thought it was going to be the same scenario with Ghostbusters Frozen Empire but it wasn't. We actually agreed on this one! Agreed that we both almost fell asleep!I will always have a tear in my eye watching the original guys suit up whatever the quality of the film. We even get Janine Melnitz in uniform, something I've wanted to see since Ghostbusters 2. The only problem is she's given nothing to do.The original Ghostbusters films were never what you'd call action packed bit there was lots of great gags and investigating and likeable performances that kept you enthralled all the way through them. Even Ghostbusters 2 which ,as an 11 year old kid walking out of the cinema, I knew in my heart wasn't as good as the first film but was still hugely entertaining.Frozen Empire has none of that. The new characters are all devoid of anything resembling a personalty, Pheobe is still OK but the film unfortunately has to think of things for her dull brother to do. Cutting his bits out would've really helped with the pacing.Too many characters and not a lot going on. The villain is barely in it which is a shame as when things eventually get going it starts to look promising but it's all over pretty quickly by that point.I know the original guys are getting old but I still believe that they could carry an entire film by themselves. We laughed at a couple gags and that was thanks to Bill Murray and Dan Akyroyd.I know people say ""Haters gonna hate"" but I'm no hater when it comes to Ghostbusters, I'm a lifelong fan, but at this point I may have to bail out of this particular franchise with a very heavy heart.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I only went to see this in theaters because I had a free ticket; otherwise, I would have waited to stream it. While the new cast that started with ""Afterlife"" (Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, and Mckenna Grace) try their best with the material they are given, the movie just simply isn't interesting enough to have much bandwidth.Despite being relatively short at around 110 minutes, the film's pacing is erratic and messy. The first half to two thirds of the movie are quite dull, with relatively little of significant consequence to the plot going on. Yet the film gets to the climactic action very abruptly--and, since it happens so late in the film, fleetingly too. It feels tedious before that climax comes and the film starts feeling rushed, which is a very unusual situation for a big-budget movie to have. The duller first two acts are diluted by some rather uninteresting sub-plots, including one about Mckenna Grace's character befriending a young female ghost. The supporting characters aren't too memorable either, including Kumail Nanjiani's character (which is unfortunate, because he is a talented actor.) The comic relief isn't particularly funny, the action isn't particularly thrilling, and the film just feels rather ""been there, done that."" Even the appearances of original Ghostbusters doesn't feel too special, since they already came back in ""Afterlife."" While sporadic moments of the film can be entertaining, there is little else to recommend here, and there's no real reason from a storytelling perspective that this movie exists other than ""well, it's another Ghostbusters movie."" 4/10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The storyline felt very slow and when it finally began to be exciting, it was cut short and the movie ended.The movie honestly failed to make me feel connected to the newer characters. The cast wasn't too bad but actors like Finn Wolfhard, who are only known for one big role, are often not a great choice for another franchise movie, because they're always kind of ""that one character"" (There are many famous exceptions like Margot Robbie or Christian Bale, who can do great performances while not being known for one role). I think a rather unknown actor would've been a better choice, but maybe they just needed to target a certain fan base.Also, the entire storyline between Melody and Fibi kind of felt like it was only there to have the plot make sense.I think the movie is definitely a fun time, especially if you're a fan of the original, but it's mostly built on nostalgia and not too great.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So I gave this a chance only to discover that even, the 2016 'reboot' was way better than this steaming pile of c***p.The makers of this movie need to realise a movie needs a script. This one for sure didn't have one. All characters were off, jokes (what jokes?) were lame. Basically the whole thing is just a lazy moneygrab. Lazy writing, lazy creature design... both boring as hell.The old main characters are just there for the sake of being there but it's also no fun. The evil character is super boring as well and gets 3 minutes of screentime. It would have been better to leave the franchise alone.

but they felt heavily underutilized and rushed in a way that you don't even bother to try and resonate with them or have a care.There's also some really weird misdirection in this movie too that made me facepalm or say ""Is this really necessary?"" like ughh,

"5","/10","Even Nostalgia has an expiration date...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9726798/?ref_=tt_urv","Coventry","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2020269/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2024","You didn't have to summon the ghost of Nostradamus to be able and predict that the successful ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" would quickly lead to another sequel, and maybe even a completely new series. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed that 2021 comeback film, but it was basically everything that Hollywood loves the most: big financial profit through minimal creative effort. Everybody wanted to see the new generation of ghostbusters team up with the original members. Everybody loves nostalgia; - including me.But the second ""legacy sequel"" - apparently that's what they call this type of films - already painfully makes clear that even nostalgia has an expiration date. ""Frozen Empire"" simply isn't very good. The plot blindly follows the structure of all the previous films, and popular gimmicks/fixed values are dragged in purely for nostalgia, but they aren't adding any value (like the Slimer-creature, the little marshmallow-men, and even Bill Murray himself).Like in the old days, Ghostbusters proves that people - and inhabitants of New York in particular - are ungrateful hypocrites suffering from continuous memory loss. Despite having saved the city three times already, the Ghostbusters are only blamed for reckless behavior and receive lawsuits for destroying half of the city whenever they go out to bust a ghost or creature. The familiar looking mayor even wants to shut them down permanently. Meanwhile, a new and almighty evil creature manifests itself through an ancient artifact and patiently awaits the right time to turn NY into the titular frozen empire. Its name is Garraka, and this malignant ice deity is by far the biggest reason to seek out the new ""Ghostbusters"" movie, as it's imposing and genuinely uncanny.It certainly isn't a punishment to watch this new entry in the 40-year-old franchise. Paul Rudd is always fun to watch, the sub plot about two melancholic teen girls - one alive and one dead - is endearing, Kumail Nanjiani has a few funny lines, and it was nice to see Dan Aykroyd in a significant role again. In the end and rationally analyzed, though, it's an unmemorable Sci-Fi/action flick of which you realize you wouldn't bother to go to the cinema for if it hadn't the ""Ghostbusters"" label on it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

To me, this movie is a heartfelt ode to the franchise's enduring legacy, made all the more special by the return of the original Ghostbusters actors in their iconic uniforms. As a long-time fan, seeing Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson don their proton packs once again brought an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and joy.Their presence on screen not only rekindled cherished memories from my youth but also served as a powerful reminder of the timeless magic that made the original films so beloved.Watching them effortlessly slip back into their roles with the same wit, charm, and comradery was an absolute delight. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of the Ghostbusters universe and a treat for fans old and new to witness these legendary actors back in action, capturing the essence of what made the franchise so special in the first place.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It wasn't about Gozer. It was about 3 guys starting a ridiculous business. There was the science guy, the spiritualist / occultist / historian, and the opportunist / con man Venkman. Nobody believed in them, but we as the audience knew they were right.Frozen Empire wisely does away with the depressed tone of the previous movie but still fails to get the most important thing right: motivation. Why are they in New York? Why are they hunting ghosts? It was barely explained in the last movie, and it's even less plausible here. None of them except Phoebe Spengler seem to want to hunt ghosts.Beyond that, the movie suffers from character overload. They have the 6 new characters, the 3 surviving original Ghostbusters, Janine Melnitz, the Pakistani guy, the tech guy employed by Winston...Most of the new adult characters are good. Nadeem Razmaadi is highly enjoyable in his scenes, and Dan Aykroyd is always enjoyable. He's still got his heart in it, and it shows, whereas Bill Murray is in the film for about 30 seconds...which isn't much more than most Characters. Finn Wolfhard is more or less forgotten halfway through the movie and then shows up again at the end. He has no character arc. Same for his girlfriend from the last movie and the Asian podcaster kid. Both feel tacked on.Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon's characters barely have anything to do and feel lost in the plot, because they don't have the intelligence to understand any of the Ghost tech.This is a central flaw of the film. In the original, the central characters knew what they were doing. Here, only the kids seem to understand the technology, but it never works. The ""genius kid"" trope is annoying. Kids in sci fi comedies work best if they employ creative thinking or common sense, much like Marty McFly in Back to the Future. Imagine that film of Marty was the genuis and Doc Brown was the bumbling idiot along for the ride. It wouldn't have worked.Ideally the new Ghostbusters movies would have gone like this:The old Ghostbusters try to build a new team to carry on their legacy - turning it into another business comedy, by showing the pitfalls and frustrations of passing on the torch. They could have been taken advantage of by young people not believing them and just trying to make money or frustrated by Gen Z's lack of work ethic. Or clashed with other eccentric characters who may have the smarts but not the discipline - or who have the motivation, but not the smarts. This could have led to interesting character dynamics in the style of the original.The most interesting aspect of Frozen Empire is Phoebe's lesbian ghost romance. Their story arc was actually interesting, and I wanted to see where it would go.The whole firecasting subplot was another misfire. The original wisely had science beat the occult. They didn't need a magical dagger or other macguffin to beat Gozer. Science beat superstition. Here, they introduce a character with magical powers, throwing that theme out of the window.At least the movie is briskly paced and barely gives you time to think about how stupid it is. Some of the skits are charming, and there are enough jokes to keep you entertained over its runtime. There are also no obnoxious identity politics or lectures.As a generic fantasy movie, it's fine. As a sequel to one of the greatest comedy films of all time, it falls flat. But it's leagues better than Afterlife.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The rest of this movie focuses too much on the teen angst angle of things such as a pointless relationship between the daughter and a ghost which to me seemed bordering on the gay aspect of things that didn't fit in with this movie at all too many different subplots and unnecessary characters.

As soon as I saw the normal looking ghost in Frozen Empire, I got a chill going down my spine, not in a good way. It was dread, the feeling was dread.The jokes were stale, the action was boring, they used Winston as a token rather than a character (His importance was always undervalued, this movie drove it home in a way that felt a little off).Oh and then that part where Phoebe helps Melody, was anyone else reminded of The Real Ghostbusters?(That show is probably the only tie-in that actually tried to honor the original). In fact most of Frozen Empire plays out like bad episodes from the cartoon.Hollywood needs to stop forcing agendas on the audience and just let us enjoy a movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Story line is really basic and it feels like I am watching a steady pulse on the screen right through the movie. Not a flatline, but the pulse is just laboured.

Having seen the film I can safely say my fears were alleviated, I had an absolute blast watching it. Without delving into any spoilers, the film was an incredibly written love letter to the franchise taken directly out of the cartoon from the '80's. All of the plot points were well seeded, the villain is incredibly menacing, it has enough identity to separate it from the other films, and the characters were interesting to explore. The humour was also a highlight. While it sometimes felt a little SNL-esc, the use of worldbuilding within the humour was fun to see and it didn't fail to get a laugh out of me. If I were to point to any issues, I would say the pacing was a little slow with a large emphasis on lore. As a massive nerd my attention was fixated on the screen, however I can understand how it might get boring for some people. That, and the villain was, in the last few scenes, a little underwhelming. I would have liked to see some more chaos shots to an '80's song akin to the originals to show the impact of the villain. He was well built up but sadly fell a little flat towards the end. Overall I would give it a 9/10, excellent watch and a worthy continuation of the franchise.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have never seen any of these trolls, hardly a point to be made. Nonetheless, a troll subjectifies and transcends (again this Austrian philosophy!) the objects of desire, the frail mist of a broken vessel. Did they actually drive the car, one wonders?

However, original Ghostbuster Ray Stantz (Dan Ackroyd) may hold the key to regaining everyone's affection for them, when a mysterious orb in his possession unleashes the spirit of Gorocca, an ancient God with the power to plunge the city into a deep freeze.Following 2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife, writer/director Gil Kenan brings the franchise back to the big screen, forty years after the iconic original film was released, and determined to keep the series rolling. With the current stars and the original actors meeting at a crossroads, it's a weird reflection of how far the series has come, and where it may be stuck. With all the original stars crammed in together with the new performers, it's an overstuffed egg resulting in too many characters to keep up with, and clearly still too clingy to its original source material.As a big screen, visual spectacle, it's still an impressive, immersive experience, the kind of thing 3D was created for, and on this front could provide a fun day out for all the family. The special effects, then, make it a sort of fun ride. But of course, they can't compensate for a weak, flat plot, and unfunny, forced humour, that the original managed so effortlessly. While original stars Ackroyd and Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore, who's now an entrepreneur, seem to embrace the whole thing as wildly as they can, strangely its original rivals Murray and Atherton who seem more reluctant, with Atherton's arsey, bureaucratic Peck now more awkwardly inserted into scenes, while Murray shows up for roughly half an hour towards the end. This uneven distribution of faith in the project between the stars is one of the many disconcerting things about the whole thing.If you're in an especially undemanding mood, it does provide a decent, flashy fun ride, but there's very little beneath the surface beyond a commercial interest in keeping the franchise going, and letting the quality take a backslide. **","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not really engaging and I only laughed twice (near the end of the movie). Not sure why Bill Murray is even in this movie - if he made more than a few thousand dollars for his appearance, he was overpaid.

The way certain problems are remedied have no real or logical explanations, even in the context of a movie that demands that you suspend disbelief.I thought Ghostbusters 2 was bad, but this one is far worse.

Still has that fun humor which is entertaining. The action sequences are entertaining. The visual effects are also good. The cast did a great job. Mckenna Grace more on the spotlight as she is growing up and conflicted with being part of the team and growing up and finding herself. The original cast are also back and a lot of fun.The new faces may have trouble finding the spotlight in this film with one character being important that can help stop the main evil entity villain with his firepower. And a ghost that becomes friends with Mckenna Graces character. The script kept those minor characters thin.The film is better paced. Fun humor. More action.

Then, the characters pile up, action draws to a close and we're doled out a frankly dumb and patronising parenting sub-plot, within not much of a plot. Whatever happened to escapism in cinema? Paul Rudd is supremely irritating as the kooky everyman, Carrie Coon uncharismatic and an ensemble of work-in-progress teen actors are each vying for attention like they're in a school play. Each dialed-in witticism sinks without trace. Dan Ackroyd is probably the most compelling force in the movie, but you can't rely on one seasoned actor to do the heavy lifting. The 2016 reboot had far more swagger and intelligence than this.Finale was meh and effects-wise, seemed like the budget had been exhausted by the ridiculously extended payroll.Nope.

A film that tried to breathe new life into the film series for old fans of the film series, but also for new fans of this generation. This new film is directed, written and produced in part by Gil Kenan, director of City of Ember and the 2015 Poltergeist remake.The Spengler family has moved to the New York firehouse where the original Ghostbusters team had their secret research lab.The discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an evil force that deceives New York and the rest of the world with a new ice age. To prevent this, the new Ghostbusters must team up with the old members of the original team.The director and writer of the previous Ghostbusters film Jason Reitman has stepped down as co-writer and producer for this sequel. Jason remains the son of Ivan Reitman, who was the mastermind behind the original Ghostbusters film series.By filling this new film with the old and new characters and in addition to some references from the old films, they have made this film a bit too full. This can sometimes make the film seem a bit messy or long-winded. Most of the characters in this film also have their own storyline, but because of all these different storylines it sometimes remains difficult or uninteresting to follow them all exactly.The best moments in this new film are when it comes to Mckenna Grace and Dan Aykroyd's characters, as they really do more research into the threat of the ice demon. The other characters are more concerned with their own things, but these are more separated from the real story of the film until the end. As a result, it takes a while before the real threat of the ice demon really begins.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It captured the essence of what made those films memorable-ingenious narrative twists, endearing characters, and a palpable sense of adventure. This movie managed to recapture the old-school charm and whimsy of its predecessors, making it a nostalgic ride for enthusiasts and a delightful discovery for new fans.However, its sequel, ""Frozen Empire,"" starkly contrasts the original's warmth and authenticity. This follow-up feels like a contrived product of corporate strategy rather than a genuine continuation of the storyline that viewers had come to love. The script appears lazily crafted, filled with clichés and devoid of the earnestness that usually helps characters resonate with the audience. What was once a cast of charming and relatable figures has transformed into a group of characters that are, at best, irritating and, at worst, thoroughly unlikable.The delightful sense of fun, exploration, and mystery that ""Afterlife"" brought to the screen has been wholly abandoned in ""Frozen Empire."" Instead, the sequel has pivoted towards integrating typical teen angst and a cruder form of humor that feels misplaced and forced. Such elements do not just undermine the intelligence and emotional depth of the narrative but also alienate viewers who appreciated the more wholesome and engaging tone of the first film.""Frozen Empire"" also suffers from a severe disconnect with its audience, largely due to its shift in thematic focus. Where the original film celebrated discovery and the joy of overcoming the unknown, the sequel mires itself in superficial conflicts and predictable drama, leaving little room for the genuine development seen in ""Afterlife."" This not only makes the sequel less compelling but also strips it of the opportunity to build upon the original's legacy in a meaningful way.Moreover, the sequel's attempt to modernize the humor with lowbrow jokes and slapstick scenarios falls flat, contrasting sharply with the clever and often subtle humor that peppered its predecessor. This shift not only feels like a betrayal of the original's spirit but also serves as a barrier for families who expected to share a similarly enjoyable experience with the sequel. Parents hoping to relive the magic of the first movie with their children are likely to find the tone and content of ""Frozen Empire"" inappropriate and disappointing.It's clear that ""Frozen Empire"" was intended to capitalize on the success of ""Afterlife"" without capturing its heart. This approach not only undermines the potential for a genuinely engaging sequel but also demonstrates a lack of respect for the fans and the quality they expect. The charm and engagement that drew audiences to ""Afterlife"" were replaced with a hollow shell of a sequel, lacking substance and failing to deliver a memorable cinematic experience.While ""Afterlife"" was a testament to the enduring appeal of 1980s cinema, lovingly crafted to evoke nostalgia and bring joy to both old and new fans, ""Frozen Empire"" emerges as a stark misstep. It is a sequel that forgets the essence of its origin, choosing instead to tread a path lined with uninspired writing and misplaced priorities. The charm, excitement, and emotional connection that defined the original are conspicuously absent, replaced by a forgettable foray into the overexploited realms of teen drama and misplaced comedy. For fans of the original, ""Frozen Empire"" is a disappointing departure from everything that made ""Afterlife"" a beloved revival of 80s cinematic magic.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Worse, it's the first time a 'Busters film has fallen into outright bad territory. After the classic 1984 original 1989's sequel was considered a disappointment (although it raked it in at the box office) but still had the charisma of its predecessors iconic cast. The female led reboot in 2016 was fun action comedy but didn't stand up the legendary original. In 2021 they started again with Afterlife, pitching Ghostbusters as Stranger Things in order to move things to a small town and test the water without having to bust the bank. Frozen Empire is a direct sequel to that film (and by extension the first two) but feels like little more than a corporate exercise in mud flinging to see what sticks.We start off with a ghost chase through New York, where Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon), her kids Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) and Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd) now live in the iconic firehouse as a family of Ghostbusters. This is a pretty good way of fusing the old and the new and would have been a solid base to build the story from but unfortunately things get messy quickly with a constant assault of characters both old and new. These include but are not limited to; the return of Ghostbuster hating bureaucrat Walter Peck from the original movie, Ray Stantz, Lucky and Podcast from the previous film, Emily Alyn Linda as a possibly friendly ghost, James Acaster as a scientist, Kamail Nanjiani as the mcguffin introducer, OG receptionist Janine and Winston Zedmore as the Nick Fury of the extended Ghostbusters universe the studio desperately want to happen. With so many characters most of them are left with little to do. Nanjiani and Acaster do well with what time they have while pretty much none of the legacy cast feel like they need to be there apart from maybe Winston. As far as one goes, Phoebe Spengler is the main character. This is the sensible choice but while Mckenna Grace puts in a good performance the character spends most of the film whining and moping. Smart teenager who needs to learn to trust and appreciate the people around them is a classic story arc but when Phoebe's response to making a mistake that probably comes with a pretty high body count is to wallow in self pity she is pretty hard to get behind.The lack of focus carries over to the story. The plot involves a mysterious brass ball that contains your standard unimaginable evil but nobody seems too perturbed by it and it's happily left on the back burner while the army of characters carry out their various side quests, such as Trevor trying to catch Slimer (remember him!), Walter Peck (remember him!) still trying to shut the Ghostbusters down thirty years later and Ray encountering the library ghost from the first movie (remember her!) that they apparently never bothered going back to deal with. Maybe they're content to leave well enough alone because they know it contains a particularly lame and stupid looking villain, even in a series not know for great antagonists.It would be uncharitable to say the film is a total right off. The cast are game and mostly do well with what they are given, stuff is constantly happening so even the most impatient kids will struggle to be outright bored and it may tickle the nostalgia bone for some people. Overall though, Frozen Empire aims to simultaneously recreate past glories and usher in a new era but throws too much at both to succeed in either.5 ""I understand if you hate me""'s out of 10 potential apocalypses started.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Such a big budget film, why not show the audience a few citizens attempting to fight ghosts and failing miserably? This was set in the city of NY where millions live, and the ending was only set in the fire house, with the main characters, and that was it. The beach scene when the ice starts to burst from the ground was definitively not enough. I need it to be more chaotic and diverse.

Never did. I went to watch this cause Afterlife was actually my favourite Ghostbusters movie so far + the trailer looked solid, so I was hoping to start liking this movies after all... Turns out it was a bad idea.The whole plot of this movie is pretty much as mediocre as it gets. There are many nostalgia baits, relations between characters are terribly undeveloped. At the start it seems like Trevor might have his own arc, something about the way his mother and stepfather don't treat him like an adult, take him seriously or recognize his abmitions, but it quickly gets turned into joke and dropped. Phoebe's arc is extremely basic and all the problems retaled to her get solved too easily. Paul Rudd's character is super cliche and predictable. All the characters from the original movie have no character development, they're here for nostalgia only.And now, we finally get to the biggest problem of this movie, at least in my opinion. I don't think it's about the plot, cause this could have been entertaining enough blockbuster even without many changes in story and characters, but for that it would have to at least have good jokes. And it doesn't. This is one of the most unfunny movies I have seen in a while... How the hell do you do that, when you have Paul Rudd in the cast?! But it's not that much about delivery in this case, these jokes are just terribly written and every character is trying too hard to be funny when they're not. That's the script problem, not the cast problem.So... Predictable, unfunny and undeveloped, as in the title. Many people will probably say it's ok, it's solid, it's entertaining enough, but fortunately my expectations for the cinema are not that low for a long time now.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There's always space to go down and down and down to the bottom with these neverending franchises nowadays, isn't it?In comparison to Afterlife Frozen empire at least had an original (kind of) idea and a brand new ghost to install fear and I have to admit, at times (like two or three) the movie gave me chills of terror and I reminisced of the good old days when Ghostbusters was branded as horror comedy. For that feeling I'm grateful to this new installment. Unfortunately all the rest felt out of place.How many more times do Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson have to come back to their roles when all they do on screen is try and hide their boredom, especially Murray who just seems to show up on set for a day or two to shoot his scenes and get the paycheck - he doesn't even move a muscle to portray Venkman and it's just sickening to see such performances which are in abundance here. Why even bother?Paul Rudd obviously had the time of his life in the movie but his character is rather dull, uninspired and looks a lot like his character from the Ant man movies - I know he's a good actor, I just don't know why he doesn't show it here. The rest of the cast is just as bad, I can't even single anybody out because of how unbelievably boring they all are and those dialogues - good golly, who wrote them? There are so many 'likes' in between words one would think they were all improvised. Just add some scientific mumbo jumbo and here you go, you have a script to seven more Ghostbusters movies.I remembered who I liked best - Patton Oswalt, his character was truly original and although is purely expository to the story he gave the most memorable performance, way better than the main cast did.The ghost itself is extremely superficial, ordinary and doesn't do much in the narrative - I can't believe I'm saying this but I miss Vigo from Ghostbusters II who was at least motivated to be a villain throughout the movie and this one (I can't even remember the name) is only there for like fifteen minutes of the whole movie - all the rest is just some family drama blown out of proportions by a teenager who no one supposedly understands, a wannabe father who is as infantile as the said teenager and the bunch of retired old heroes who are present only to serve the movie's title being Ghostbusters. There's literally nothing in this movie that Ghostbusters is all about.Afterlife tried to reboot the franchise by bringing new characters as if to pass the torch from the old ones but Frozen empire does it all over again, only with even less enthusiasm and I can see the writers of the future sequels hopelessly trying to come up with an original idea but failing and doing the same movie over and over again, oh and adding Ray Parker Jr.'s theme song in the end of course - I just don't see myself watching those anymore.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

After a good, fun ten minutes setting up the premise and reintroducing us to the family, the film veers way off course with an hour and a half of absolute bilge before the final showdown.Like many others, I was trying not to let my mind wander halfway through, trying to put into words how and why it was so excruciatingly dull to watch. We were getting characters, scenes, story, exposition, development... but it just all amounted to NOTHING. There was no fun, spectacle or energy whatsoever. By the time it remembered it was a Ghostbusters film we were 20 mins from the end, with zero time for purposeful build up or development and we're hit with a brief, messy finale that made little sense.The acting and dislogue is wishy-washy, the action is practically non-existent, the structure is messy, the story and character development is as see-through as a ghost fart, but worst of all, those callbacks to earlier films. I was hoping they would move on and create a fresh new pallette to compliment the franchise, but no. Again. Like Afterlife (perhaps even worse than Afterlife) there's a tired, desperate sense that we all want to see 'fan favourites' every two minutes. It almost suggests ""there's nothing of any substance here, so how about that ghost you loved from the first film"". You just can't create something fresh and new, and interesting, when you're so preoccupied by retreading old ground. Yes, we all have the same fondness for the other movies. That's why we go back and watch them. What on earth is the point in wasting an opportunity for further creativity by rehashing what we've already seen a hundred times... especially when it's all out of context as merely 'nods' and detached from having any point whatsoever. Even those stupid marshmallow men. It was done, it was fun. The only emotion they instill now is ""oh it's those things again... and again... and again"". They serve no purpose anymore other than barring the way for something more interesting. Ditto that for every callback, including the old cast who lack any real purpose or character, or energy, mostly standing around with a figurative foam finger pointing at them screaming LOOK!! IT'S THE OLD GUYS!! They were like traffic cones on a road trip.I have this memory growing up of Christmas lunch with all my extended family. We HAD to eat the 'big meal' but all I wanted, as a 6 year old, was to play with my gifts. Parents would say 'you can play after lunch' and I'd sit, fidgeting and restless, while the adults talked and talked through course after course. Starter, main, dessert, coffee. It was excruciatingly slow and dull. I knew the fun was an arm's length away, but I just had to patiently sit through 2 hours of long, boring chat before I could go have fun. Welcome to Ghostbuster: Frozen Empire.A wasted opportunity, a waste of talent, a waste of time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The original cast is too old and the new cast isn't really capable, certainly not with the material they are given to work with. The writing isn't strong enough and there is an obvious issue with finding the right vein of comedy at this point.I quite enjoyed the small measures of goodness on offer here, I'm glad that I went to the cinema to watch but I'm not able to see a further way for this franchise to go.Indeed it's stuck in the wrong time: forty years ago this was fertile ground for a comedy treatment type ghost film: paranormal investigation as an ""occupational"" was possibly at its most credible and comedy horrors were popular with audiences in the 80's. Why not a comedy ghost film? Four decades later and not only is this franchise old but so is the cultural hinterland that spawned it.I recommend to fans of the 80's Ghostbusters and to fans of McKenna Grace most of all because her character is the undoubted lynchpin of this effort at repossession of a Ghostbusters series. Paul Rudd and Dan Aykroyd get a bit of focus for their characters, but hardly any comedy.I fully commend the first twenty minutes; frankly that contains really quite good dark comedy material with a bit of action, and hokus pocus, and grisly flashes. After that it's rather meagre measures.The acting is passable but the cast don't have much going for them with this writing, the direction is ok in the action sequences but quite basic in character scenes. The production design is mainly a plus with some nice props and sets. The effects are fine with a nice mix of good practical and CGI components. The sound design isn't much in either the effects or the score, which is a terrible shame for a 'Ghostbusters' film: even the basic sound recording and mixing isn't particularly clear!I remember wondering what all the runtime had really amounted to at the end as the credits rolled. I think that a film that either focuses on its new demi god antagonist or on the teenage angsts of the youngest Ghostbusters might have made itself more useful with this runtime. As it stands, some threads for the younger characters are left undeveloped and others are too neatly and tidily wrapped up by the end. Much the same can be said of the main menace character and plot.As for the veterans, there isn't much to say because there isn't much to consider.I rate at 4.5/10 because that first twenty minutes or so was good, and the small doses of merit can't be ignored but this film and this franchise might need to be laid to rest.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The inclusion of unnecessary and inappropriate elements like ""nipple art"" and sex dungeon comments is baffling for a PG-13 film. These choices detract from what could have been an exciting addition to the franchise. The actors give commendable performances, but the script's misguided attempts at edginess overshadow their efforts. Ultimately, the film squanders its potential, leaving fans craving the classic Ghostbusters charm rather than the awkward and misplaced adult humor. If you're watching with your kids just beware.

Will anyone want to watch this abysmal effort in a few decades time? I doubt many would want to watch it again at any time, as it lacks everything that made the original a classic.The new young cast are simply awful and all of their acting seems to be completely over the top for no good reason. None of their characters are interesting or in any way engaging and they sadly set the tone for the whole movie, which is equally unengaging.The appearance of some of the original cast is good to see, but they can't rescue the damage done by the new generation. Add in Paul Rudd who seems to play the exact same character, no matter the movie he's in, and you have a rather flat, at times irritating and ultimately disappointing movie, with no pay off in return for the 2 hours you endured it for.The effects are impressive as one would expect, but when that's the only positive you can find in a movie, it demonstrates just how poor it is.I think they should put the franchise to bed, rather than continue with this new cast, as I can't see them being able to create anything worthwhile if they continue on this path.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even tho I think the film was very entertaining, I thought it dragged a bit and they played it a bit too safe. So much so, the ending could have very well played in the middle and the end be more gruesome and extended.The film focused too much on the family dynamics instead of busting ghost. That should have been the focus from begining to end w more and inventive ghosts. Not sure if my expectations were set too high but what can't be denied is that it was a fun and entertaining watch. However, I do feel like something was missing I just can't quiet put my finger on it. I may need a 2nd viewing.

While I really enjoyed Ghostbusters 2 I do see where it's a paint by numbers sequel. I think Frozen Empire took the bold approach by telling a brand new story, using a completely different formula.

Phoebe Spengler is my favourite Ghostbuster and also my favourite depiction of a autistic person, a perfect Grand Daughter to Egon Spengler.Callie Spengler is hot, especially in the jumpsuit.Janine is still hot, especially in the jumpsuit.So, they're setting up a Ghostbusters Cinematic Universe...that probably wont happen!Ray and Winston still have great chemestry after 40 years.It's been 40 years...fuuuuuuuuck!Lars is great.The old ghost effects are so much better than the new effect, a prime example being using the Librarian footage from the first move.I want to see it again!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I had always dreamed of seeing a third one. But as more time passed it seemed like a pipe dream, and then we got the ridiculous reboot which to this day I cannot finish. Then Afterlife came out, which I must say gave me chills all over. My favorite character was always Egon Spangler, and the whole of Afterlife was centered around his character which thrilled and chilled me. So, with great anticipation, my wife Lorie and I went to see Frozen Empire, while it didn't have the same emotional impact I felt during After Life, it felt like a ghostbuster film, full of Ecto-1 racing the streets, a big monster, and of course slimmer.I really enjoyed seeing the remaining members of the cast brought back. Even though Murray seemed a little tired and didn't have a lot to do it was fun having him a part of the family reunion. I guess for me the standout was how much Ray, who was played by the original movie creator, and co-writer Dan Aykroyd had to do with the movie. I won't give anything away suffice it to say it brought home that these guys are too old to be running around New York Chasing ghosts, on occasions it got him (Ray) into trouble when he found that old zeal again if only for a brief time. There has been a lot of negative talk about the movie but that usually comes from people wanting to recreate the first one, but time moves on, and the actors are retirement age, and no one can be these great actors. If they were going to keep the franchise alive it's good to see them do it, at least while the originals are still able to be involved. It's a movie worth seeing in theaters and my advice would be when you go don't go expecting to see an 80s movie, but you can expect some feeling that this is a ghostbuster movie complete with some of the 80s still there, i.e. Music and flashbacks. Overall, it should be a fun ride for the ones who ""were there"" and the ones just catching the ghost craze.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd's Gary Grooberson is as charming as he was in the first film, as he tries to understand his new role in the Spengler family. Mckenna Grace's Phoebe Spengler is the heir to Egon Spengler's legacy, fighting to prove her worth as a Spengler and as a Ghostbuster. The film ultimately portrays a family trying to live up to the Ghostbuster name, and a teenager who feels entitled to it.The first film showed Phoebe Spengler that she was destined to be a Ghostbuster. This 4th film (in the Ghostbuster cinematic canon) shows Phoebe letting that destiny blind her to the love and care of her family, ultimately leading her to put her trust in a stranger who offers her validation. We'll leave it at that.Most importantly, Frozen Empire offers a new ""evil"" for the new Ghostbusters to face, while simultaneously utilizing the legacy characters in a loving way, that shows respect to the original two films. While the movie is not perfect, it truly is the next step in the legacy. As long as new and old fans are open to a new era of Ghostbusters, the future looks bright for Phoebe Spengler.Sidenote - I will say Finn Wolfhard's character was under utitlized which is a shame because he's actually a pretty good character. Hope he gets more to do in the next film.Overall, a solid new chapter. Look forward to the next one!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie is more like Ghostbusters 4 or Ghostbusters 5, with the women of the previous film not being included in the cast. The previous Ghostbusters: Afterlife film was set in small town Oklahoma, not the big city where the story is set. The family of Callie (Carrie Coon), her partner Gary (Paul Rudd), and her kids Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) move to New York and start up in the ghostbusting business, driving the iconic car and headquartered at the legendary former firehouse. The older generation remains, with Winston (Ernie Hudson), Ray (Dan Aykroyd), Janine (Annie Potts), and Dr Venkman (Bill Murray), who appears to be thinking about something else. The movie has some laughs and an attempt at a queer romance, but lacks real signs of life. The film Ghostbusters begins with a roguish character named Nadeem (Kumail Nanjiani) selling Ray an ancient orb from his late grandmother, which is the only thing stopping humanity from being subjected to the tyrannical rule of the ice-powered phantom. The film features good gags about the Spin Doctors and Mary Todd Lincoln, with Grace playing a sympathetic ghostbuster. New character turns include standup comedian James Acaster in a boffin role and Patton Oswalt in a feisty scholar of the netherworld called Dr Wartzki. Nanjiani brings the most important comedy, bringing the correct spark of humour and subversion. The younger contingent is too wide-eyed and innocent, while the senior class of 1984 is too detached. The time has come for Hollywood to let the Ghostbusters franchise join Jurassic World and Aquaman and think of something new. ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" is a 40-year franchise that features four main characters from the original 1984 blockbuster, six from the 2021 Oklahoma-set spinoff, ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife,"" and introduces three new occultists, ghosts, poltergeists, horned phantoms, and miniature marshmallow men. The film asks its fan base if it's ready to release Bill Murray's parapsychologist, Peter Venkman, from haunting the series when his soul isn't in it. ""Afterlife"" introduces Callie, the estranged daughter of Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler, and her teenage children, Phoebe and Trevor. After the death of their family, the family fended off Gozer's killer, with the help of a high school physics teacher, Gary, two friends, Lucky and Podcast, and the first generation of Ghostbusters, Ray Stantz, Winston Zeddemore, Dr. Venkman, and the sassy secretary, Janine. The film is overstuffed and erratically funny, aiming to entertain fans and explore the world of ghostbusters. ""Frozen Empire"" is a film that follows the Oklahomies, who move to Manhattan to harpoon wild ghosts from the Ectomobile. The posse meets an ancient languages expert, a paranormal engineer, and an in-over-his-head huckster who inherits a cryptogram with a dangerous plan to unleash a fatal attack of the shivers. The film is an eclectic and enjoyable mix of nonsense, with each scene getting laughs. Characters vanish at key moments and then reappear unexpectedly covered in goo, and the subplots are so gauzy and intangible that it's difficult to determine if they're real. Grace, as Dr. Spengler's geeky granddaughter, plays Grace, who is quirky and cerebral with an intriguing tickle of goth. She could have handled the entire story arc in a kiddie comedy spin on the ""Conjuring"" franchise, with Phoebe exploring her own attraction to the Great Beyond. The film seems spooked to stray from its touchstones, such as particle streams, the New York Public Library, Slimer and Murray rattling their chains, but reworks them in ways that make us chuckle. For example, tiny maggoty versions of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man torture each other with cigarette lighters, or Paul Rudd recites the Ghostbusters theme song with sincerity, as if he were convincing his therapist that busting does make him feel good.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

They do break it up with comedy moments though.The old guard have been retained again but this is very much about the Spenglers taking up the reigns after the events of Afterlife. I think they've made to get the balance right and I think there is room for more bustin with a new audience that doesn't alienate older fans. Unlike Disney's handling of Star Wars!Overall, a great popcorn flick as its meant to be.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Very strong story and some new faces along with the cast from the last film. Was not rushed out, as you get on these sequel films, so it's not really film that feel pressured to be seen, but worth the trip, as it is very glorious on the big screen.I do write that you do need to see the last film, but, this does hold up on it's own, it has a new twist on the supernatural experience that weaves it's way into the plot very cleverly and if the performances were not rock solid, it would fall on it's face. Many more effects this time around, but again, they drive the film along the right path, not showy at all. With Dune part two still out, we get another great part two film here, showing what cinema can do, with great writing and directing on show.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Saw it a second time today and liked it even more.The theater today was packed, especially with kids. People were laughing and having a good time and there was lots of clapping and singing at the end.Seems some people didn't like all the fan service and the Gozer storyline in Afterlife. Feel this one gives us something pretty new overall but apparently it doesn't have enough nostalgia and fan service for those same people. It also has too many characters and sub plots for anyone to follow according to a bunch of Facebook reviewers. Yet again those same people say the script is dumbed down for today's audience.I thought Afterlife was a great bridge from the past to the future. Frozen Empire gives us a new start to what else may come. There may be a couple things I could nitpick but nothing big. My only real issue with it it's that it leaves me wanting more.Frozen Empire is number 3 for me right now. But could knock Afterlife down a spot as I feel Frozen Empire is moreover fun rewatch.I'd love a live action series with the new crew. Though I know that won't happen.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I won't include any spoilers, I will say that the inclusion of some beloved characters and the plot of the film was really well constructed. Seeing it in the cinemas is a must. Old school fans may nitpick certain details of the film. But if this is the direction that Ghostbusters is going, I for one can't wait to see what happens next. Looking forward to watching this one again.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Nostalgia makes things better . I thought this one was better than Afterlife and so did my family . Everyone I was with enjoyed it and that is definitely a feat. Funny , off beat and scary it was a great movie. I liked that it had a lot of references to the original movie and brought back som of the original actors too. It seemed like it was a little short and could have been a little more developed in places I thought it was good that it made Ghostbusters relatable to a younger generation. I was happy I could bring the whole family to see and enjoy. I am planning to see it again at the movies .","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This fifth Ghostbusters film is a good movie, but everyone hates it: instead, I liked it, so much. In this film I experienced many emotions: there are sad and moving moments, others have amused me a lot, others really excited me. This film focuses a lot on fan service: it tries to refer to many links with previous films and does it very well. Other highlights of the film are the special effects, fabulous and perfect, the music, always beautiful and original, and the characters, excellent, my absolute favorite is Venkman, I love it. I also liked the direction, good, but especially the photography, beautiful. The actors were also good, especially Paul Rudd and Bill Murray. The plot is good and simple and I think it was the best choice, sometimes you don't need the most beautiful plot in the world, but just be logical and sensible. The film is also well written. The antagonist of the film, Garraka, I loved it, menacing and gloomy. The film entertained me the right, in my opinion the duration could be disposed of enough. The setting is beautiful and also the costumes, which give crazy vibes. The ending of the film made me shiver, very emotional. Few movies can give me the same emotions that the Ghostbusters soundtrack can give me. The post-credit scene is nice but I would have expected something less fun and more threatening and incisive. I can't wait to see when the next movie comes out..
Rating: 8.2/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's great to have the Ghostbusters back in New York City. Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon still have good chemistry as a couple. McKenna Grace is still awesome and smart as Phoebe. Finn Wolfhard is still awesome as Trevor. It's even great to have Dan, Bill, Ernie and Annie back for this installment in the franchise. Harold Ramis will always be in our hearts. William is back as Walter Peck. It's still true as always, Peck still has no d***. We're even glad to see the mini Stay Puff Marshmallow Men. The best part of all was seeing Slimer again. The film focused on the Spengler family but it usually cuts to the original cast interacting with the others.We know that the first two original films from the 1980's had the goofiness and comedic charm but it also had some of the scary moments. This film had some serious parts just like in Afterlife but both of them still have the comedy and scary parts. Also, this film had a dark tone with the new ghostly villain. This villain is way dark and scary than Gozer and Vigo. The special effects were amazing. I liked the story and plot of this film. We all know that there's always a post apocalyptic moment of the evil ghosts taking over the human/mortal world. There are fans who still like the concept of evil ghosts taking over the world during the apocalypse. It's great to see some of the nostalgia from the 1980's like the original firehouse and the containment unit. Fans who grew up watching the entire franchise showed their kids the first two original films. Probably there are newer generations watching the first two films and catching up with Afterlife and this installment. There is still a whole franchise of merchandising like t-shirts, toys and even video games. Fans definitely want to wear the uniform and proton pack. In every comic con, there are a lot of fans wearing those kind of stuff for Ghostbusters. This franchise definitely dominated the world for fans. The fans want to see more of this franchise because in Afterlife the production passed the torch to a new generation of Ghostbusters. Jason Reitman is probably storming up new ideas of another installment.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The ancient demon Garraka has been unwittingly released from his trap and is hell-bent with frozen revenge.This is once again a fun movie with a full cast that any Ghostbusters fan will enjoy. It is good to see Annie Potts in a uniform to help the team. It is even a good surprise to see William Atherton as the mayor. Many scenes make homage to the first film, even Slimer returns for a few slimes. The only one still missing is Rick Moranis.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is allowed you know- a fun, solid movie, the latest instalment of a beloved continuing story, clearly in good, genuinely caring hands once more; honestly don't see what the critic's problem is with escapist enjoyment? They continually hammer nostalgia like it's some kind of entertainment that's beneath them- its part 4 in a multi-film series, the characters in the previous chapters of this on going story still (largely) exist, why wouldn't they make appearances in their own story? They still inhabit it- it is their world after all! If you like Ghostbusters & you want respite from the grimness of the world, & want to be entertained in a simpler universe where good & bad are easily defined, where there's always hope, & good wins out no matter how dark things may seem, then why not make up your own mind? Why not go see something that purely just wants to let you have a good, fun time & enjoy yourself?

Will definitely watch again.It was funny and light hearted scary. I'm a huge fan. It falls in line with the first 2 ghostbusters movies. It doesn't have the emotional tear jerker storyline of the last one. Like every ghostbusters film before this one, an absolutely masterpiece and very cool to see it on the big screen.

If you are on the fence, just go see it.I wasn't sure what to expect with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, but I was pleasantly surprised! The movie had a really well-written script. It was funny and had seriousness at the same time, which is exactly what I look for in a Ghostbusters movie. What I enjoyed most was seeing the new cast, especially McKenna Grace, really coming into their own. The new crew had this great chemistry together, and it felt like they'd grown so much since the last movie. It was also cool to see the original Ghostbusters working alongside them and not stealing the whole show. It truly was a passing of the torch this time. They saw the new crew was ready and that they can enjoy their ""Golden Years"" from the side and not have to be the front lines anymore. The movie did a great job of balancing nostalgia with fresh new ideas. The new ghosts were creepy and creative, and the gadgets the Ghostbusters used were awesome. Overall, I had a blast watching Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't understand the hate for it. It's absolutely hilarious. The jokes land Paul Rudd and Kumil Nanijani stole the show. It's darker for ghostbusters. It's not quite as good as Afterlife but it is still a thrill ride. I saw in Dolby at AMC and the sound and seats shaking make it much better for entertainment. Everyone was fantastic in the show. My only complaint about the movie is I'm tired of this fire and ice theme. It's been the theme for a lot of movies lately and we need a new theme. I also wish the fight scene was a bit longer. The runtime was 1hr and 55 minutes. Ghostbusters: Afterlife was 2 hrs and 5 minutes. If Frozen Empire was 2 hrs and 10 minutes it would be the perfect length. I recommend this movie. Especially for those who grew up on the originals.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, it turned out to be my second favorite Ghostbusters movie, after the first. Everyone I went with felt the same, as well.I liked Ghostbusters Afterlife, but less so after another couple viewings. This one is a huge improvement. It does have quite a few new characters, and sometimes seems to struggle a bit with how to incorporate all its returning characters and the new characters, but at the end for me it pulls it off really well.Also, this film has the most scares and elements of horror (for a Ghostbusters film)of any of the Ghostbusters movies. This Ghostbusters movie treats the supernatural unknown more seriously and menacingly then any of the other Ghostbusters movies.It also incorporates Dan Aykroyd's original fascination (and his father and grandfather before him) with the supernatural and its allure, which was how Ghostbusters came into existence in the first place. At the same time, it embraces the weirdness of the Ghostbusters world, especially, as the filmmakers that intended, touching on elements from the Ghostbusters cartoons, which I grew up on.Very cool movie! Hope it's successful enough for another one to come!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

A lot has changed in 40 years, and in my opinion I thought there was a perfect blend of tradition and new. I thought the carrying forward of Dr. Spengler's legacy was well done and appropriate. They play on a lot of nostalgia without overdoing it, and using modern technology to keep it fresh and up to date. There's ample humor, but I would easily call this the scariest of the series. Paul Rudd has a moment (we all know the one if we've seen it) that is incredibly cheesy. But I couldn't bring myself to not laugh. They've left it open enough for a new generation of Busters to take over from the legends themselves, and I was very happy with Dan Aykroyd's larger role. I was glad to see Winston and Venkman make their return as well, along with Jeanine. It would have been nice to have the WHOLE gang back together with Louis and Dana, but maybe in the future.All in all a solid continuation of one of my childhood favorites.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I disagree with the critics who say theres too many characters, i thought every character braught something to the film. The og ghostbusters was superb also, however would of liked a little more screentime from bill murray and annie potts. Loved how they included little moments of music from the 1st film, the marshmallow and slimer scenes are hilarious, there was a few scenes that slowed the film down and i didnt like the sewer dragon chase as i didnt like the dialogue, it was like they was trying a bit too hard to be funny but it didnt work for me hence why i havent give this a 9 rating, overall tho great funny family film with lots of nostalga, highly reccomended, however as good as this movie is the first 2 from the 80s still lead the franchise for me, but thoroughly enjoyed this movie.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Unlike some people,I actually like this better than Afterlife!! I don't dislike the Spengler family,but Afterlife felt like a really long boring episode of Stranger Things with GB elements. This feels like a real Ghostbusters movie to me,and it's got an entirely brand new villain. It has cheesy elements that reminded me of Answer the Call though. The Indian guy is sort of annoying and felt unnecessary though. Replace him with Dana Barrett or Louis Tully or even Holtzmann coming through to lend a hand on the ghostbusting,and this movie would be perfect. Heck even any of the characters from Filmation Ghostbusters would have been better than that guy. I did like Podcast in this movie more too. Wished it went a little bit longer and Venkman should have had more dialogue,but I felt goosebumps when he and Walter Peck were on the same screen together. Atherton looking a bit like Vincent Price in his old age. Funny there were vape shop reference too as I was vaping the whole time while watching in the theater lol. Slimer was awesum,and also time to bring back Ecto Cooler. If you downvote on this you're just a herp derpin ahole square and I don't care cuz I'm definitely gonna watch this again 2 more times!

This film excels in weaving together the familiar and the novel, introducing a cadre of new characters who are as endearing as they are determined. Their dynamic interactions and personal growth are the heart of this story, providing both laughter and depth to the spectral adventure.The visuals are a standout, with the winter setting of New York providing a picturesque yet haunting backdrop for the action. The special effects team has outdone themselves, creating ghostly phenomena that are as beautiful as they are terrifying, making ""Frozen Empire"" a feast for the eyes.The narrative does a commendable job of balancing reverence for the past with its own distinct identity. It cleverly nods to the franchise's roots through Easter eggs and cameo appearances that will thrill fans, while also introducing a compelling new villain and storyline that explores themes of legacy and camaraderie in fresh and engaging ways.However, the film is not without its faults. At times, the plot feels overcrowded, attempting to juggle too many storylines and character arcs, which can detract from the main narrative thrust. Additionally, while the humor is generally well-pitched, some jokes miss the mark, feeling either forced or out of step with the scene's tone.Nonetheless, ""Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire"" stands as a laudable addition to the Ghostbusters universe. It successfully captures the essence of what made the original films so beloved, while also daring to venture into new territories. The result is a movie that feels both familiar and innovative, offering a comforting nostalgia trip and an exciting new adventure.In sum, ""Frozen Empire"" is a must-watch for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. It proves that there's still plenty of life (and afterlife) left in the Ghostbusters saga, and that sometimes, to find warmth, one must brave the cold.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is not to say that Afterlife wasn't good. I liked it. But Frozen Empire has so much more going for it.First of all, the Spangler family now live in New York City, in the old firehouse. They are driving (careening) around town taking care of ghosts, just like the original team from 40 years ago. The movie continues the cameos that appeared in Afterlife. I smiled so big when they show the ghosts in the library, like the original film.One of the other improvements was the reduction in Trevor's appearances. He's not quite as stupid as the first movie, but I think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with him, and basically cut him out of most of the film.Having a random ""old god that predates known written language"" works perfectly in the Ghostbusters world. Go watch the 1984 version again and tell me that it wasn't ridiculous then too. But it's done with so much humor that you can't help but fall under its spell.Regarding the humor, the movie is chock full of it. Afterlife had some, but Frozen Empire brings back the fun and charm of the original movie. Silly puns, dad jokes and some hamming it up worked so well that I want to see this again.One problem I had, though, was the tiny Stay Puff Marshmallow Men. We already have the horrible Minions franchise. We don't need more of that crap. They're never funny; trust me. I truly believe they're only in the movie to try and ride the coattails of the inexplicable continuing popularity of the heroes of the People of Walmart.Go see it. Afterlife is needed to explain the Spangler family, and Paul Rudd, but the movie stands on its own. It's fun.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I know a lot of people didn't like this one, and I honestly don't get it.The cast (Old, Nostalgic, and New), were all great in there roles. Paul Rudd is still a National Treasure, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson were amazing, and they were able to get the serious and silly moments down great.The build up for the main villain was great. A great build up with the opening, the constant teases, and many more. They really make him feel like he'll end the world in a snap like that. He honestly make the other two villains feel like pawns. The visuals were also great (especially the main villain).It surprisingly has a pretty good emotional anchor to put it together, and I really enjoy the arcs Phoebe goes through. That one ghost also gives me some questions that I do hope gets explored.Honestly, the best I can say this one is that it felt like an episode of the old cartoon and if so, and amazing one. It's great at feeling like another adventure with these characters, while giving you enough to care what's going on.However, there are two complaints. One, I thought that the whole ""Fire-master angle"", where they straight up have fire bending, is really dumb. I can generally believe in the things they throw me, but the whole fire bending angle they had with this one character was dumb (still liked the character itself).Two, I feel like it just ended way too soon. Once we got Garaka out, the film shifted into maximum overdrive. However, when you think it's reaching the height of the battle, it's just over. I felt like they should've had a bit more time to give us with the main villain, especially with how great his build up was.But overall, I really enjoyed the film. It had fun characters, good drama, decent jokes, and good build up and stakes, but kind of just ended after a bit. I can't wait to see more of the Spengler Family soon honestly.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I think the last ghostbuster was way better than this one but the very first ghostbuster is definitely the goat of ghostbusters. Lacking in plot, but spiced with enjoyable humour and performances, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire supplies a slightly bland yet satisfying sequel to a slowly dying franchise.

Ghostbusters 2016, which felt like a bastardization. Afterlife, felt like a giant nostalgia boner.While I appreciate the fact they wanted to honor Harold Ramis, I don't think he would appreciate a movie that was made just to recreate the original movie with new characters.And I felt that resonated in this movie. It's clear that it was well thought out this time, planned, and looked at all of the franchise at a whole, and asked the question, ""How can we move forward in this franchise"".Putting it back in NYC for me, gave me a different kind of nostalgia boner than afterlife. But let me just compare afterlife with another piece of media that some might know - parasite eve. I felt they made the same mistake as that game. They took a story outside of it's environment, and it felt odd for doing so. Whenever a media goes from 'city' to suddenly 'dessert', it's a hard and dis-jarring contrast in environment, which usually ruins it. (Also - turtles in time)Anyways, I think, while starting to feel like a generic Marvel movie, this movie did very well at evolving. It brought ghost busters to the modern era, and made it very relatable to today's standards. I definitely can't hate this movie. But it does loose points and charm for being kind of a generic action movie.Now, unpopular opinion, but I think overall this movie did amazing in telling a intellectually stimulating story. While far-fetched, I was extremely surprised at the pseudo science and metaphysics delivered. It established clear rules about how things worked, and what the theory behind it was (Dan Aykroyd was this your doing?) lol.But speaking of the guy - damn. His role as a guide and tutor in this movie, rivaled the role of Rocky in the Creed series of movies. He even goes as far as to make personal jabs at himself and how the public perceived him for some of the things he believed. But hey, who else can bring the right amount of explanation to all of this, that the movie needed.It honestly felt like the true continuation the movies needed, and I hope to see more from the franchise, as this movie lays the foundation for newer movies to come.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

These last two GB movies have been fantastic. I definitely want to see more Ghostbusting from the Spenglers and their extended family. These last two entries captured the spirit of the 1984 Ghostbusters perfectly. The critic consensus says something about uneven tones. The modern critics generic go to in my opinion, lazy critique. Contemporary critics don't always get it right, just go read the Blade Runner reviews in 1981 as an example. They are entitled to their opinion just like anyone else. And no one is wrong for liking or disliking a movie. But if they didn't like the tone here, that means they didn't like the tone of the Original GB, either. The tone here, was right on. There are some messy things in the plot but it's so much fun, those are easily overlooked. Just like in 1984, a lot of laughs and a few scares. Keep it going Jason and Gil. Keep on trucking.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

You have to modernise the franchise for it to survive and I think they have done a great job of doing that while looking after us older fans who just loved the originals and the whole package so much. Yes, I see how doing so will lose some older fans who don't buy into the the aspects put there for the younger quirkier Stranger Things type followers, it probably won't appeal to a sourdough eating audience who have low tolerance for cheese and nostalgia either but I think it will make hopefully the majority of the masses happy and true lovers of the franchise leaving the cinema feeling young again and grateful that they are back and it didn't suck at all. Not sure how many more movies there will be as to me, it was clear that you simply can not replace the older original cast when it comes to serious Ghostbusting.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Spengler family reunites with the original Ghostbusters at the iconic New York City firehouse, Hook & Ladder 8, where the Ghostbuster organization's journey first began. The writers included some old 1984 ghosts in this film as well. I was impressed by how the film crew and editors skillfully included Harold Ramis in the Afterlife (2021) film. The passing of Harold in 2014 left all his fans deeply saddened. Now that we know Dr. Egon Spengler's family has inherited his super-natural-scientific talents, it is game on for the next generation of Ghostbusters. The cameo characters of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and William Atherton were brilliant. Seeing those characters again in the movie script was extremely satisfying and resonated with me as a member of the Generation X fans. I'm not finding Finn Wolfhard's portrayal of Trevor Spengler convincing in this iteration of Ghostbusters. It's as if his personality took a complete 180 compared to the script of the Afterlife film. In my opinion, Finn portrayed the character with more depth in the Afterlife (2021) edition of Ghostbusters. It could be attributed to his involvement in script writing, but the portrayal of the 18-year-old brother in the Spengler family didn't resonate with me. McKenna Grace, Paul Rudd, and Carrie Coon nailed their parts in the Spengler family business.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Then they come here and give a bad rating and comments like... It was boring or it was predictable or the writing was bad or I didn't like the actors or the original actors are just dialing it in. I enjoyed this movie and it was everything I expected. Suspend disbelief, chill out and enjoy. It's supposed to be funny and silly nonsense.In my humble opinion, it was great to see Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and the other original actors back. I think the new actors are a great addition and fit right in. If you wanna be all serious and expect perfection go watch a classic.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Great cast, great story, great acting, great effects, and great comedy. However, I personally think the main story was written wrong. You spend 80% of the movie building up this awesome epic plot and then when the final protagonist actually comes, it's only there for about 20 min and then boom that's the end. Again, very well done, very well written, and I love all the little unspoken story plot devices, but overall, a bit disappointing. I loved the series and this movie and it's one that I might even watch it again. Hopefully the continue the series and the next one is even better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not much Screen Time for main ghost? If I recall Gozar only got under 10 minutes in the original. Both good movies.2. Not much storyline closure. I sorta agree, but this wasn't as big an issue for me. I felt like the movie went all over the place following 3 or 4 areas rather than having it be all about the maun characters. Well I don't have much love yet for the new crew so it didn't bother me as much, but it would have been nice to see Dan mentor them more to do a better transition to them in the future.I really enjoyed it, and had alot of fun seeing the shots toward the old movies, and its awesome to see the old gang still involved. Overall its still my 4th fav of the series, but its a great series so i won't complain. I do hope to see more, and I'd love to see the main cast get more time and keep the focus on the main storyline more.I'd give it a 7 if i felt people weren't just complaining for the sake of it. Its an above average movie, but not perfect.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved the movie and the throwback references to the first two films and the appearances by the originals. My daughter loved Phoebe (which is awesome for her to see a strong and smart girl as the lead) and of course Slimer and mini Stay-Pufts.Awesome nostalgia and bonding moment for me and I can't wait to have Ghostbuster family costumes for Halloween.

I hope that in the future they structure this universe so well so that they can create something like the Godzilla monsterverse or the Marvel cinematic universe. The young actors are promising and putting them together with the older generation makes the film even more fantastic.

That being said, it's fun, heartwarming and is pretty much non stop from the get go, if anything I'd critique the runtime, a little longer movie would have allowed them to flesh out a few parts here and there, because at times it does feel as though the pacing is slightly too fast. I'm not an huge fan of having kids as ghostbusters, however they do a decent job, I'm just old and miss the OG busters.

Bustling with unforced energy from start to finish it's stands alone as a solid fantasy film even whilst standing within that hefty Ghostbusters shadow. The cast is great, with the Spengler family continuing to make these new films their own along with the surprising yet excellent addition of James Acaster as a new ""Q"" styled member of the team. Dan Akroyd beautifully ties in the nostalgia while helping to hand over the baton. With nods to the original(s) handled very well. Expect a few laughs along the way in what is an excellent story.

Plenty of humor, excitement, thrills, chills, action and spooky eerie ghosts for the Ghostbusters to catch, including the evil ghostly god Garraka. He was probably the biggest bad the Ghostbusters had ever faced and just as big and bad as Gozer the Gozerian. Also, McKenna Grace delivers another fantastic performance as Phoebe Spengler in this movie. Also, there is betrayal in this movie, but I shouldn't give out any spoilers for this part of the movie.

A Fantastic Superior Sequel.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9700642/?ref_=tt_urv","lukem-52760","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur90278387/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2024","First off I'm a Ghostbusters fan, I'm one of the originals from that era as i was born in 1984 (when Ghostbusters First came out) & the first movie i ever saw at the Cinema was Ghostbusters 2 in 1989 when i was 5 years old & that Cinema experience stayed with me all my life. I have major history with Ghostbusters, i also grew up watching the Real Ghostbusters animated series & then the excellent underrated Extreme Ghostbusters in the 90's. I had Ghostbusters 1&2 on video & growing up & watched them constantly i also had all the Real Ghostbusters toys. I'm a real proper Ghostbusters fan who literally grew up with the Ghostbusters.Silly unpopular opinion is i absolutely loved the female lead 2016 Ghostbusters.I saw the ladies Ghostbusters at the cinema with my wife & daughter & we loved it. The 2016 movie is a fantastic 8/10 in my opinion & that Ghostbusters I'm proud to say is my daughters Ghostbusters, a Ghostbusters for them & it was GREAT. The ladies were fantastic together & so funny. The gadgets & new proton packs were better than the originals in my opinion. Also the 2016 Ghostbusters remains the actually funniest of the whole franchise!!! Also the old 1970's Times Square big battle final action sequence is probably the best Ghostbusters action scene of the franchise. There's so much great stuff in the ladies version & the only reason it was hated was because of Misogynistic idiots. But hey i felt the 2016 Ghostbusters fingerprints on Frozen Empire like Ganine Melnitz small hand proton blaster is practically the same as used in the Ladies version!!!Another unpopular opinion from me is i couldn't stand GHOSTBUSTERS: AFTERLIFE!!! I had huge problems with it as it was like an indie film mixed with a kids Nickelodeon version of Ghostbusters. Also the awful Afterlife ruined the main characters. The fact the Ghostbusters fell apart because Egon (Harold Ramis) believed a new supernatural Apocalypse with Gozer returning was NOT believed by his buddies & other Ghostbusters is ridiculous!!! The fact that Egon stole Ghostbusters equipment & done a runner to live in a small desolate town is ridiculous. Why would the Ghostbusters, that have Been through Gozer & Vigo & the River of slime & Mr. Staypuft Marshmallow man & everything else would suddenly not believe in Egon Spengler is insulting to the characters & the fans. Also Afterlife ignored the fact Ghostbusters 2 even happened? Thankfully the Awesome FROZEN EMPIRE fixed most of these problems.Anyway Afterlife was garbage in my opinion.Ghostbusters: FROZEN EMPIRE was a real blast of creativity with the franchise, we had strong Nostalgia & our old team that are like old friends by now were given bigger roles, especially Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz (my all-time favorite Ghostbuster) he was a the heart of this superior sequel. I pretended that Afterlife didn't exist & this movie was simply the old Ghostbusters that have recruited a new younger team like the 90's Extreme Ghostbusters. Afterlife doesn't exist.We're back in New York City where the Ghostbusters should be for FROZEN EMPIRE. This is a big fun popcorn blockbuster & for that it's on point.Major shout out for letting us know that GHOSTBUSTERS 2 (my fave) did happen & is definitely Cannon (the awful Afterlife ignored it) by a news report at the beginning of this superior sequel that shows the Statue of Liberty walking!!! I had a huge smile. Still there's stuff that's not great like how they never seem to really give us character depth, we never know if the old gang have families or have wives or husbands or kids???? Do they all live near each other? Do they meet up regularly? No real insight at all with our beloved characters but to be honest even the old films never dug into the characters at all.Paul Rudd was awesome & really is a perfect choice to be a new GHOSTBUSTER.The kids/teens were really great & are very gifted actors & very likeable.In fact the whole cast was great in their roles. It was nice seeing Walter Peck back again, this time as the Mayor of New York & still with a bone-to-pick with the Ghostbusters. Thank you William Atherton for returning for his iconic character, a good sport.There's new faces that are all fun & likable in parts. The humour is actually funny but it's not over silly & the spooky factor is done in the style of Ghostbusters 1&2.We have a new demonic spirit that is Unleashed from an ancient artifact that ends up in Ray's supernatural store. The creature is eventually Unleashed & New York City is frozen over & evil spirit are on the rampage. I loved the creepy look of Garakka the Ice Demon that has a nice backstory & mythology. I felt this Ghostbusters dug into rich old mythology & ancient cursed & possessed artifacts. Ghostbusters could go the Conjuring universe way if it wanted with each cursed artifact getting a spooky movie about it. The drath chill created by the evil Garraka is done fantastically with super special fx that turns a hot & sweaty New York summer into a new ice age. This new villain is fantastically scary & taken seriously. I got vibes of the Real Ghostbusters cartoon which was obviously an inspiration for this movie. Also a nice use of the original '84 music score scattered throughout the movie, a nice Nostalgic touch.I loved how the movie went into proper horror territory towards the end that made film actually feel threatening.There's amazing special effects throughout & lots of awesome ghosts & new fun technology & traps.Ernie Hudson is great in a bigger role (finally) as Winston Zeddemore.I was nice seeing Annie Potts as Ganine Melnitz back in action & as a Ghostbuster, i love her character.It was actually Bill Murray as Venkman that had the smallest part but was nice when he's there. The old team are great on screen.There's some very nice little touching moments sprinkled throughout like when Ray & Winston are talking about how old they are & how these are their golden years.Also nice little cameos from classic ghosts like the Library Ghost & Slimer, both done beautifully. So glad Dan Aykroyd had a main part back as Ray Stantz, he's older as they all are but still has that big excited heart for all things supernatural.There's a nice sweet warm touch of Nostalgia sprinkled throughout the movie that makes you smile.FROZEN EMPIRE has heart & Nostalgia for us old school fans who grew up loving these movies & characters.Ghostbusters were a huge part of our childhoods.Gil Kenan was a great choice of director & I'm a fsn of his excellent animated horror fantasy comedy MONSTER HOUSE, it's a Halloween staple in my house. Also he did a decent & fun remake of POLTERGEIST, the guy is great at family friendly scares.All in all i had a blast watching this new Ghostbusters movie, fun & full of heart.FOR IVAN (Just beautiful)

I say weave because there's a lot going on. Many characters all with their own character arcs are cleverly edited together in a story that is blended into the drive of the film, which is its characters. While you could just make it full of ghost action, we get treated to some interesting character dilemmas with some smart comedy sprinkled throughout.Nostalgia. Memberberries. Fan service. While not negative for a lot (most) people, many others view these things as detriments to a movie. To me, they are a part of a franchise's identity, as long as they aren't used to fill empty space. Frozen Empire never got stagnated by nostalgia, nor did anything ever outlast itself. Funny lines came quick and were never dwelled upon. Action that could've padded the run time was cut short in favor of story. It handled its complex plot, but simple story very well by focusing on its characters and their situations rather than unnecessary action to fill the run time. Yes, there's a lot of characters, and some have little screen time, but they were all utilized exactly how they should have been, even if they all didn't contribute as much as the main characters. It's these side characters to help expand the layers of subplots that come together in the end.My fear for the movie was how it would handle the fact that there's several kids who are taking part in action and science of ghost busting. It needed to be addressed, and the movie did this head on. Everything that played out made sense in the real world. I was astonished that the filmmakers didn't gloss over the idea that some kids would be involved in saving the city from a horned demon ghost. In the end, not only will families enjoy the fun nature of the movie, it passes on a technical level as a bonus that turns it from something that could've been okay, to a surprise film that I had a lot of fun with.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Very fun, good comedy, a lot darker than previous ghostbusters movies, has some fun action sequences and just overall was very enjoyable, gets better as you go along, so fun to have the original ghostbusters in it as wellCons -
Not enough screen time for Podcast and not enough time to fully have fun with James Acaster9/10, Fairly fun movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

When movie trailers outright lie to the audience about what they can expect from the movie. Take Ghostbusters Frozen Empire for example. If you were to watch the trailers for this film, you would assume the whole film would feature the city of New York being frozen over, especially given the title. However, upon actually watching the film, it becomes all too clear that part doesn't happen until the last 30 minutes. I get it: you want to focus on showcasing the fun parts. But, couldn't you find a way to do it without deceiving your viewers? Now, all this is more of a criticism of the marketing than the movie itself which, all things considered, is a lot of fun. I thought going in that the story would be really predictable, but none of the plot points went in the directions I expected and there were some genuinely good twists. The humor was on point as usual, with plenty of good lines, amusing gags, and some cool cameos. There do seem to be a few scenes missing, as characters sometimes appear in places without explanation, but that only happens a couple of times.I didn't really care for the family drama surrounding Phoebe and her mom. It wasn't terrible, it was just every annoying cliche you'd expect, which really doesn't fly in this series. With that said, they're both still really likeable, and some of the best scenes involve Phoebe and a teen ghost she befriends. The conversations they have are both funny and at times thought provoking. Paul Rudd, the brother, and the geeky friend are enjoyable as always. There's a new protagonist who's a little bland, but gets some decent laughs. The new villain is really intimidating in his brief screentime. The OG Ghostbusters get a lot more screentime, except Venkman, but he still makes the most of his brief appearance. Even Walter Peck returns and I won't lie, as much as I detest this guy, it was actually kind of nice to see him again.The effects are thankfully consistently good. I don't remember how well they stack up against Afterlife, but they certainly look a lot better than the reboot. The scenes where the city gets frozen over look cool (no pun intended) and lead to some genuinely scary moments. The new gadgets presented look great and are showcased well. The action scenes are a ton of fun as always. And hearing the Ghostbusters theme in Dolby Digital was beyond awesome.Overall, Ghostbusters Frozen Empire isn't as good as the OG film, and I don't remember if it's better than Afterlife. But, it's better than Ghostbusters 2 and especially the reboot. And, as my first Ghostbusters film in theaters (I wasn't born yet when the first two came out and I didn't see the reboot or Afterlife), it's a nice bit of nostalgia.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And now I'm encouraged to literally watch every ghostbusters movie to exist. I think this shows that sequels may be bad at times but if they turn out good they can bring new people into their community. Also I might be being a bit biased because I like McKenna Grace- but just ignore that. I don't know if I have any place to actually recommend this movie since I'm not an original fan but please give it a chance. Loved it!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was fun to watch. Parts slowed flow but made up for it. Wanted more ghostbusting. Loved the equipment/gear/ universe building. Winston was awesome. Ray was as well. Of course Dr. Venkman too. Loved the honoring of the fans!Phoebe did great as a character. Her interaction with the one ghost was awkward at times but tricked me on where it was going.Loved the possessor. Slimmer was great to see. I hope they do another to improve. I have mixed feeling's about it but want to love it. It's worth watching again and buying physical copy. And I want them to have another chance on another one. I of course want more with original cast as well.A lot of characters. But I wanted it to work. I like all the characters.That's my opinion at least.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Out of the many reviews Ive read, it's really just trying to figure out things that have gone wrong with Frozen Empire. And I can agree that there were goofs in the movie, but they weren't so bad! The special effects look great, and there are comedic moments, but not many lines people will be saying years from now. D*ckless returns for another insult, which I liked. The only thing that I didnt like was that there was less of Venkman (Bill Murray). We need more Venkman-One-Liners!Overall, the movie is good, filled with laughs and clear references to the Ghostbusters franchise. Im a huge Ghostbusters fan, and I loved that they got the old crew and old ghosts back.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The original Ghostbusters ain't one of my favorite movies of all time. I do like it but im not super huge into it like some other peoples who think its one of the best comedies of all time. Its probably because as a kid, Gozer scared the crap out of me with the red eyes so i didn't watched it again til a long while. I just remembered loving the Stay Puff guy at the end.Anyway, so overall i don't have the same nostalgia some peoples may have for this franchise. When Afterlife came out, i enjoyed it, but i do recall thinking it took a bit its time. Obviously introducing new characters and being set so many years after, its to be expected, but if i could sum it up, i liked it but that was it. Saw it once.Now finally getting to this one, the best way i would describe it is a perfect by the book familly movie. You can bring your kids, you should enjoy it as an adult. Its not perfect, its not a movie ill watch super often, but i enjoyed my time watching it in the theatre. The actors all do a fine job, the character of Pheobie especially being the center stage. Paul Rudd is charming as always.Of course if you start nitpicking on it, you will surely find plenty of issues. I don't think its the right way to approach it. I enjoyed they tried to do something new this time, and the OG cast have more screentime. Yes Murray is once again more on the cameo side, but the rest had decent screentime and presence.For this one i would give a 7.7 out of 10 so im definately bumping it to 8.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.
