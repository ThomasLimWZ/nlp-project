"8","/10","Good movie. Good fun. Tom Hardy is in all the scenes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4413785/?ref_=tt_urv","ThomDerd","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73053202/?ref_=tt_urv","22 October 2018","Venom is about the symbiotic relationship of man and alien, with the latter being the gross one. Funny at times, with a lovely performance from Tom Hardy -if you are a fan of mr Hardy, this is going to be entertaining for you.
First half goes very well in terms of setting the story and the venom universe, second part is more about action and there it has a few flaws but it is still fun and interesting to watch.
It is a cool view on the ""almost anti-hero"" venom/eddie character that kept my attention.
I had a good time watching this in the theaters and i ll definitely have a second view when it comes out in bray or dvd.
So, all in all its def not the best action film of all times or even of 2018...but dont have too high expectations and you will definitely like it.

I liked it! It was funny and it paid great homage to the Todd McFarlane bombastic Venom era of the late 90's. It truly baffles me that Sony would not take enough risks to release the film with an R rating. I wonder how much of this film was left on the cutting floor!?! Tom Hardy's performance is also on point and...just go see it.","2,160 out of 2,871 found this helpful.

There are certain elements of it that I think are creative, but by far it is definitely one of the lesser Marvel films. The only thing I disagree with Martin Scorsese about is that ""Marvel movies are like theme park rides"" because there are ones like Endgame, Thor Ragnarok (my personal favourite Marvel movie), Civil War, The Avengers, Infinity War and many others that have a far deeper meaning and much more than just entertainment. Overall, Venom is one of those okay movies that doesn't deserve hate, the scenes where the Venom inside Tom Hardy's character is talking to him are pretty hilarious.73%","93 out of 121 found this helpful.

The film has a very Marvel story, it's not the first time I've seen a story like this one but with just different characters and different settings. Though the story of not knowing whether Venom is good or evil is an interesting aspect not really seen before.But I still found it quite enjoyable. There is no fantastic cinematography techniques or anything like that. But Venom played by Tom Hardy manages to deliver an amazing acting performance in comparison to other Marvel movies.I recommend Venom for superhero film fans to watch it's an interesting story with a little bit of a twist.","11 out of 13 found this helpful.

Of course this stretches the boundaries of PG-13, because it is quite violent. But it will never be enough from what I heard from people who know the comics.So if that is something that is dear to your heart, again I get it. If you are just here to enjoy a comic book movie, there is quite a lot to enjoy. Tom Hardy really cherishes in his mania. Enjoy the Mayhem even if there was a sort of better ""inside voice"" movie last year called ""Upgrade"". So yes, if you only watch one of those make it Upgrade.

'Venom' also had talented people in the cast, Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams have both done great work in their careers, it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting anti-heroes in the superhero universe.Watched 'Venom' with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness, as always, to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion. Was aware that it was not well liked by the critics, but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked? Have to agree with those that were left disappointed, while also not finding 'Venom' to be that bad. Am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion.'Venom' does have good things. It is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between Eddie and Venom, which had fun and tension. It is when Venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest, after too long struggling to invest in the first act. The darker elements of the film are actually quite well done, having a dark grit and creepiness. It looks reasonably good, well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere.The music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action, especially the car chase sequence. Some of the effects are terrific. Tom Hardy is intensely charismatic, with Eddie/Venom being interesting and well contrasted characters, far more believable than Topher Grace in 'Spiderman 3'.However, the rest of the cast don't fare so greatly. Michelle Williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a development-free plot-device role. Riz Ahmed is far too anaemic for the one-dimensional villain that's both cartoonish and insipid. Of the characters, only Eddie and Venom engage and intrigue, the rest are flat. While some of the effects are terrific, others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax.It is the script and story where 'Venom' fails most. The script is really clunky, especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced (Venom's disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny) and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing. The less too about the soapy and cliché-ridden scenes featuring Hardy and Williams the better, they are bland and don't serve much point, and the Life Institute scenes should have had more clarity. Unfortunately, these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and ""taking too long to get going"". The story is tonally disjointed, too many tones that are very variable on their own and don't gel together, and very clunky. This is not a case of the film not trying, to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely. For a story intended to be dark and violent, this seemed rather tame and held back.Summing up, a disappointment but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox","199 out of 317 found this helpful.

You would think the producers would have hired better writers instead of pathetically paying for almost every review on here 9 and above being fake (pretty much only film reviewed). I may have given this film a 7 or 8 out of 10, but only gets a 6 for the fake reviews. For me it could have been much better and deserving of the 9's and 10's had the writing been tighter.

It's watered down. It's generic. It's trying to give the impression it's following Deadpool down the R-Rated super hero route, but it didn't have the guts to go the whole way, or even take a step really.Tom Hardy is an OK Eddie Brock, but I still find him a bit hit and miss as an actor, and that comes through even from scene to scene here. Sometimes he just mumbles his way through with no effort and I genuinely wondered if he was channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, while other times he actually seemed to be trying, especially with the physical aspects. There's no connection or chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams. I guess she was just hoping for some Marvel money and didn't realise this was a Sony picture. And the rest of the cast are incredibly average and forgettable. Especially Jenny Slate, who will always be stuck as Mona-Lisa from Parks & Rec.There's years of comic book lore and stories to draw on for Venom, but they ignore much of it... For example, why does Venom look like Spider-man? We know why from the comics, but in the movie it makes no mention of this, so we're left with questions and a very one dimensional character as a result.Of all the stories that could have been told about a symbiotic alien, and all the interesting directions they could have taken the story, they decide to go with what boils down to a boring buddy movie.","227 out of 392 found this helpful.

Easily one of the most popular Spider-man characters, he made his big screen debut in 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which not only failed to impress audiences, but proved to be a great disservice to Venom. Luckily, Sony makes up for this grave mistake with this new film. Plot: Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a journalist digging into the dirty secrets of the shady corporation, the Life Foundation, where he becomes an unwilling host to an alien Symbiote brought to Earth by a rocket ship. As the unlikely pair of man and ravenous parasite endeavors to find a compromise, they must become one as Venom to both survive and prevent more symbiotes from making Earth their new home. Right off the bat, they got Venom right; the internal struggle, the design, and the twisted sense of humor. Hardy gives a well-acted performance as both Eddie and the Symbiote, the two halves bouncing back and forth in a terrific fashion. They alone sell this flick. The supporting cast holds up too with Michelle Williams as Anne Weying doing a good job playing the love interest with a believable relationship. The nods to previous media are also welcome with the mid-credit scene making me geek out. One word best describes the action: savage. The movie works around its PG-13 rating with some satisfyingly kickass fight scenes that get away with nasty-looking deaths (would've preferred rated R, but it works nonetheless). ""Venom"" starts a little slow, getting you into the cast and story organically, but once the titular anti-hero comes out to play, things become seriously fun. An issue that didn't really ruin it for me was that the climax has Venom battling a similarly colored villain (Riot) in a night setting, which made it tricky to see what was going on at times (a differently colored nemesis would've fixed this). The music fits the film as well, having a cool edgy, pseudo-horror vibe to it. All in all, ""Venom"" is a killer good time. Future films are already planned, so I look forward to seeing the toothy alien freak in action once more.","9 out of 12 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy is great as always, that guy really can act. Can't think of anyone else who would be a better choice for the role but him.
Introduction was really long, but I was not bored for a second. When Venom comes in his true form - the party starts! Wish few action scenes were less like Michael Bay's style (hardly see anything) but the inner child in me was really happy for Venom's maniacal kicking and punching around. Venom's character is really well made visually - his walking, jumping and smashing are just like in the comic books - thumbs up for that!Hope they will release R rated version on BluRay so we can see more of Venom's craziness.

Despite the debacle with different studios and without having Spider-Man, I personally rooted Venom to succeed. However, the jarring tonal shift, occasional clumsy dialogues and heavy reliance on CGI are eerie reminisces of less sophisticated super hero movie from early 2000. It's disappointing because there are some good set pieces here and Tom Hardy tries his damn hardest.On a quick glance Venom can be an action thriller, the tone fits perfectly almost in Daredevil crime drama fashion. It almost reaches such darker place but doesn't dare to take the final step, instead it instantly switches to humor. While this new more cynical Venom is not entirely bad, he is such a good character to establish a more intense atmosphere. It does hurt the nuance, toning down on the menacing aura.Whatever element works on Venom can be credited to Tom Hardy. He displays the reluctant anti-hero so dysfunctionally well. His gesture, slight twitch and banter with the alien invader are a blast. Pacing and script can be problematic, but Tom Hardy just goes all in with sheer tenacity. When it goes to Venom, CGI is inevitable. It's rather unconvincing at times and a more physical choreography would do more wonder than the black suit. I want to see this as standalone movie, but in the end Venom does need Spider-Man. He could've been a stronger faster version of Spidey and with Tom Hardy as anti hero, that would've made such an interesting clash. Also, if it wants to go for sci-fi thriller route, there's already a recent movie with same premise, Upgrade, which sadly did everything better.It's not devoid of entertainment, sometimes the humor hits sweet spot, but if you're here for the sentiment of the Venom namesake, this is not the Homecoming you want. It might not be even the Andrew Garfield kind.","107 out of 222 found this helpful.

When I heard Hardy was to play Brock, I was concerned.
When I saw the trailer, I lost all interest.But truth be told, it wasn't as bad as feared but it certainly isn't everything it should have been.With a heavily modified version of Venoms origin story this R rated movie separate from the Marvel Universe is a watchable but ultimately uninspired affair.When I first heard about the film it was said to not only be R-Rated but delving into the realms of horror. Truth be told the end product is not horror, it's comedy. The idea of Venom being a comedy is insane, yet is the only reason I rated the film as highly as I have.It's actually quite funny and instead of the badass in the comics Eddie Brock is a loveable loser type that Hardy played considerably well.A major cgi-fest this 100 million costing Hollywood effort is saved by the humour it simply shouldn't have even had.The story is generic, it really has nothing very original to offer but a fair few laughs make it more watchable than by all rights it should have been.Venom is better than I expected.
Hardy is better than I expected.
But it's certainly not the Venom movie we wanted nor deserve.The Good:Some great action sequencesQuite funny, oddlyThe Bad:Tom HardyAnother ""Tweaked"" origin storySome of the sfx are actually quite badThings I Learnt From This Movie:I don't remember Eddie Brock being a comedy characterTom Hardy isn't entirely uselessJenny Slate > Michelle Williams","27 out of 49 found this helpful.

It's just such a missed opportunity. This could have been a good movie if they had just put some effort into it.Look, I have nothing against mindless action movies, but there's absolutely nothing impressive about this one. The plot, the jokes, the characters, the action scenes...they're all terribly flat and generic. Everything about this movie is painfully mediocre except for a few brief moments of high-priced CGI, and even that ends up being mostly underwhelming because the scenes containing it range from bland to awful.Even if you turn your brain off entirely and are hugely obsessed with the character of Venom, even being generous, this is AT BEST an utterly average movie, deserving of nothing more than a 6 or 7. Personally I'd rate it at around a 5 because even if you ignore everything but the action scenes, it's still an entirely forgettable experience that I'll never watch again. In the end though, I'm giving it a 1 just to balance out the absolutely insane number of people giving this generic cash-in movie a 10. If any of you are actually real people and not just paid shills, your level of self-delusion is embarrassing.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Thank god they didn't pull and amazing Spider-Man 2 and tried to set up a wider universe. Yes there is space too but I believe this film can stand as a stand alone movie.The opening to the point of Eddies first contact to me was really poor in the acting department and the story seemed very messy here however as soon as that symbiote hits it's full steam ahead! Tom hardy has always been an actor that I can really rely on in movies and after seeing legend, (an excellent film which I highly recommend) I had no doubt about his ability to form the two identities of Eddie and venom.The romance sub plot surprised me and I thought it was handled in a way rarely seen in superhero movies so well done on that. A big point of content was the jokes. Yes the ""turd in the wind"" line is a bit cringy but I think a huge amount of the jokes do hit home. For people who have seen the film a certain joke regarding an elevator that was short and sweet and had me genuinely laughing at it. Time to talk about venom himself! CGI on him is how I wanted venom to look in a live action version, that slimy, toothy, grinning look that looks like something straight from the comics.This film will definitely not be for those that aren't really into comics and I think this film may hit a special place in some fans hearts like me. At the end of the day I say go see the movie and see if you feel the same way. Something that I found really helped me was I went in not thinking of the MCU at large and Spider-Man at all and only when I was 1 hour in did I think ""I haven't thought about Spider-Man once!""To me venom is a surprisingly good film with some great action, visuals and comedy that occasionally stumbles, especially the clunky opening 30 minutes","531 out of 885 found this helpful.

Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is an ace TV street reporter who manages to lose his job pursuing a demented inventor, Dr. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), while managing to become the host for an ugly but sometimes comical slimy alien parasite or ""symbiote.""Although film Venom is replete with the usual superhero tropes like the slow-to-get-it love interest, Anne (Michelle Williams), the demented scientist, the threat to the world, and toothy monsters, it has a levity Deadpool could admire, but to a much lesser extent. Not a small number of light moments come from the dialogue between Eddie and his occupying alien Venom, who decides he likes Eddie and the planet so he won't be the one to destroy it. There are others like him to do it.As in so many of these horror, sci fi thrillers, the amount of violence from explosions and body tossing is too much. Director Ruben Fleischer could have minimized the scenes and substituted more of the ironic dialogue that makes this a watchable adventure. Scott Rosenberg and the other writers are up to the task.Hardy's winning characterization of a rough-around-the-edges hero who has to stop evil is punctuated with naivete, innocence, and a sense of justice and humor. With no Spiderman to distract him, Venom can form a friendship with his parasite that, as they shamble away together, may remind some of the super classic, Casablanca. Hardy is no Bogey, but his Brock is quirky and eccentric enough for me to hope for a sequel, even with Spiderman to distract.","21 out of 40 found this helpful.

This is a dark buddy comedy and you should know that going in.There's bad CGI, a forgettable villain and an anticlimactic final act. These are all true. However, if you want a funny, character driven origin story, this will be for you.Hardy gives one of my favourite of his performances; you can tell he had so much fun playing the role and his two characters (Brock and Venom) bounce off each other so well.Think of a very ""aware of itself"" Venom story with clear influences from both Deadpool and your favourite buddy cop movie, with a dark twist, and that's what you're getting.

The action sequence are great especially the final battle but the human subplot drags it down a bit. Like maybe another swing at the script would have done good but oh well it's serviceable.

The director really took on something more than he couldnt handle..As for the CGI wow it was really really bad... it was like a 10 year old doing it... where on other marvel studio movies the CGI looks really impressive It felt like Venom CGI was rushed and done by amateursI left the movie feeling quite disappointed and thinking had Marvel Studios had the rights on Venom they could have made this a really good movie.The critics have got this Spot OnFinal thought - Don't waste ur time and money on this movie and if there is to be a Venom 2 I really hope Marvel Studios make it!","57 out of 105 found this helpful.

Story - Boring and average. Certain parts of the movie were entertaining of the least. But most of the time you get emotionless dialogues that kill the vibe. Then on top of that the action scenes that if you blink you miss it parts. Way too much jumping around during the fighting. Looked like a bad CGI blur. Characters - Everyone in this movie was eh. Tom Hardy seemed to do the best job where everyone else was just an emotionless person with a Kristen Stewart face. Its like the movie cancels the good and bad out. Some moments it was cool and made you laugh. Then other parts were boring and wanting it to hurry up and move along. Besides Tom Hardy's character, everyone else you don't remember. And in my opinion, didn't like anyone.Venom - I did not know Venom's backstory much besides that I thought he was a villain and caused havoc. In this movie he was an anti-hero where you feel sorry for and wanted him to win. I was hoping after feeling sorry for the character Eddie Brock that he would turn into a killing machine and just destroy everyone. But no, he still has a heart that only kills the very bad, and that is a maybe. He was a villain in my mind but for all I know he could join the Avengers. I don't care that he is changing into an anti-hero but I was expecting to watch a man become a villain. Not the same ole stuff. Average - This movie is just average. I feel like I liked parts and other parts I didn't. At this point with all these superhero movies I was hoping for a different turn with a villain movie. But it ended up being just another superhero movie. You seen it once you seen them all. This movie deserves to be rated a 5 or 6 just for how plain it is. I decided to be nice and give it a 6. Judge for yourself but lot of people talking about how awesome this movie is. It is not. A slow build up backstory that has its moments but nowhere as good.All in all the movie could be a skip and you could wait for it to rent. I wouldn't rush this movie and just wait to rent it when you can. I just wished Venom was more villainous. It was suppose to be a different form of superhero movie and what we got was the same thing in a world of superhero movies. Skip theaters and rent it is my call.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I came into this film with no expectations and whilst it certainly isn't perfect, it is a million miles from the mess the critics made it out to be.The negatives first. I felt Venom's change of heart towards humanity was kinda rushed and thought his character suffered as a result. Also the rating thing possibly effected it as i thought there would be more action scenes.Whats left of those however are the undoubted highlights. One in particular with some police was my favourite scene in the film. There's good chemistry between eddie and Venom and i dug Hardy's performance.So in short, goof, not great but enjoyable and will watch again!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The pacing was terrible with most of the action scenes being not only already in the trailers but over before you can actually enjoy them.
The dialog was bland boring and downright embarrassing. The back and forth between Eddie and venom was like a neanderthal talking to a 10 year old.
While other marvel movies have propelled the genera forward this took it back to the early 2000's. Then theirs the villain, who was one of the least intimidating villains I have ever seen with so little screen time you don't get to even care about him as a character or his motivations. 
I absolutely wouldn't recommend this snootiness of a movie unless you have insomnia personally I hated this movie but and if this is the future of the Sony's Venom verse then it's already doomed.","159 out of 318 found this helpful.

"","","A Strong Contender For The Worst Film Of 2018","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4483795/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2018","A strong contender for the worst film of the year, Venom is an amalgamation of terrible direction, piss-poor writing & fidgety performances that crashes n burns Sony's hopes of launching its very own shared universe on a positive & promising note, for there isn't one thing redeemable in this incoherent & inconsistent mess.The story follows Eddie Brock, an investigative reporter who while enquiring into a major corporation's malpractice comes into contact with an alien symbiote that was brought to Earth by their probe. As the two species achieve full symbiosis, he is imbued with superhuman strength & a violent alter-ego that calls itself Venom.Directed by Ruben Fleischer, the film fails to pave the necessary groundwork and it doesn't get any better after the first act either. The whole thing feels hurried & chaotic, unsure of what it wants to be, as the plot becomes more ridiculous with every passing moment. Fleischer's direction is lazy and the writing is even worse.All its attempts at humour fall flat, the dialogues are cringeworthy and whatever action it has in store has no sense of excitement whatsoever since the characters are so poorly sketched that we are never invested in them. Not a single person in this story exhibits an interesting arc and the eponymous anti-hero is a total joke.Coming to the performances, Tom Hardy is monstrously bad as both Eddie Brock & Venom. He is way too fidgety as if high on drugs, long before becoming a host to the alien symbiote, and his act is as stupid as it is laughable. Michelle Williams & Riz Ahmed happily dent their acting careers for a healthy paycheck. Also, for a $100 million budget film, the VFX looks absurdly dated & cartoonish.On an overall scale, Venom is a lethargic, listless & lifeless blockbuster that easily goes down as one of the worst examples of its kind. Failing to provide a sense of intrigue at any given time, it's one idiotic segment stacked on top of another for a total of 112 minutes and just when you think the film has got nowhere to go but up, it surprises you. A dud in all aspects of filmmaking, Venom is no less than an absolute eyesore.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

This movie demands to be R-Rated...or not, this is just unnecessary movie. I mean nobody wants it. People want Venom in the MCU with Spidey, not Sony making their own universe.Tom Hardy and the connection with Venom, is the best thing about the movie. There is some action, the story is blunt and there is nothing really special other than action scenes and some humor at the end.I really hope the second one to be a lot better than this. For sure, there're some people, which are not so invested into the comicbook world and will like it as a separated property.One of the credit scenes is good, but it was predictable and I don't know what the future of this universe will be.At the end my score it's still high...","34 out of 83 found this helpful.

Venom is so light and predictable. 100% remaking of Spider-Man's origin plot. No surprise at all.
Hardy is so bright on his dark appearance. It is not in MCU yet, is it? Keep off the fun, what they should have done. I remember first look of Venom shows Hardy was in agony scene. But last night Brock was totally fine, cute and healthy. Brock is not desperate enough to have no choice but accepting cooperation with the alien symbiote. I don't know if producer has few parts cut down, because I lost the moment of thrill I have been thinking about this Venom since its first trailer.
Everything is mediocre here.
I believe Venom's CGI should have been better than Spider-Man's.
I believe Brock should have been darker.
I believe Drake's hitmen should have been meaner and more sophisticated.
I believe director should have brought totally new stuffs. I see Hardy as the way he is, he acts, walks, talks. And Riz Ahmed, start knowing him as he stars many good films. Same as Hardy. He doesn't improvise enough to be a villain. Exactly same gesture and look as his other movies. Why not learning from Irfan Khan. We can see he is totally altering for each of his role.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

How are Venom fans not disappointed by this film? It doesn't do justice toward the character because it's bodged down with some of the most lazy writing I have ever seen . I usually disagree with the critics toward Superhero movies but this time I have to side with them. My friends and I made fun of this piece of crap during and after the movie. This film also would've benefited a tiny bit with an R rating but a complete rewrite of the film would have helped it the most. The editing was really choppy and the first 15 minutes are embarrassing. It's one of the worst superhero films I've ever watched. I wasn't even expecting much and I was disappointed. I really regret seeing this in theaters because the more money this makes the more Sony is going to put out garbage content like this. Heck I saw this on a matinee and I feel cheated. I could have bought a $5 blu-ray and watched something good with my friends. I could have rented a movie for $3 and bought off brand soda. But I made a bad decision by going to this film and handing the man on the counter $5. I'm never gonna see my money again because Venom consumed it and my stupid brain let it happen.","114 out of 227 found this helpful.

If you're getting tired of the Marvel formula then Venom is going to be a breath of fresh symbiotic air. Venom occupies it's own universe, it's dark, gritty and more grown up compared to its counterparts. The existence of Eddie's personal life feels real, his struggles are far more relatable than any other character portrayed in a comic book movie so far. He is an everyday guy who screws up and because of that his need to redeem himself gets him attached to a symbiote. After that hes just trying to stay alive until the very end when the truth of his circumstance means he is the only one who can prevent humanities destruction. The movie didnt lead up to this, it wasnt even known what was to come until the last 20 minutes of the movie.This is a marriage of two separate movies and it's done very well. You remove Venom and the movie feels like it could stand on it's own with a few key changes. The Venom portion hits all the notes required for a superhero movie. You actually care about Eddy and it's not because they give some sappy back story about loss or self reflection. You care because you can actually relate with what happens to him and how you may have reacted in the same scenario. He wasnt rich, a god or born with powers, didnt live with super advanced technology or volunteer for an experiment. Hes just a guy with a 9-5 in a regular relationship and living in the same world where shake downs and homelessness exist.The critics wanted a different movie then what they got. They wanted a basic Marvel super hero movie without realizing one of the better super hero movies as of late (Logan) didnt follow that formula either.Venom is the movie that stands on its own by creating a story with elements suited to the character, not checkboxes like others. Its entertaining and feels like it could have lasted longer. I'd rather feel left wanting then feeling like the movie is now requiring me to continue watching it because it's been dragged out too long.I'd rather watch another Venom movie then any other marvel universe sequel at this point.","373 out of 678 found this helpful.

Buddy comedy. This was NOT venom. This film is so difficult to give a fair rating. On the one hand, it stood very well on its own two feet. It was funny, well-paced, and had some really good-looking action scenes. On the other hand, it is being marketed as a VENOM movie. Venom is not some goody parasite that is willing to take orders from his host. 
 Most films benefit from tail coating on a brand name character, but this film was severely hindered by it. If you call this movie ""Symbiosis"" and market it as non-marvel, it is an 8/10 solid film for the whole family. I would much prefer a Venom title to be rated R, dark, gritty, and not holding back the punches. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and believe others should see it, but please do not go in with the mindset that you are about to see the Venom you know and love on the big screen.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is one of the rare occasions where I can say the CGI being so impressive was one of the best parts of Venom. Venom looks awesome as a creature, the way they chose to animate his look and his movement was impressive. The movie is also shot pretty well, they shoot in a lot of dingy locations before Eddie (Tom Hardy) interacts with Venom to help ground the movie, and I thought the action was handled pretty well. I wish that we had got the R-rated version to really see the potential of what Venom could do as a villain, but I liked the majority of the action scenes regardless.We get to spend a decent portion of the movie with Eddie before we get introduced to Venom and while the overall plot isn't completely fresh, I didn't think it was as bad or as routine as the critics did. They aren't breaking new ground in the genre with Eddie's story from laughing stock to redemptive hero, but it gets the job done. We get some unique banter from Eddie and Venom that had me laughing at different times in the movie. It was also a little hit or miss (which is true for all the dialogue in the script), but I chuckled like everyone else in the theatre did. Did Venom have a few plot holes? Yes, it did but the movie doesn't linger on them and with Tom Hardy's crazy performance, I was able to go along for the ride Venom's cast features actors and actresses that I wouldn't have pictured being interested in this movie. Tom Hardy is a great actor and I think casting him was a good decision. He brings something to this role and he does as much as he possibly can with this material. My only note is that Eddie as a character seems to act like he's a little younger than Hardy, so he may be a little old for the part. But otherwise, he was one of the best parts of the movie. I really like Riz Ahmed too, he's transitioning to bigger and bigger projects and I've yet to see him in anything where he wasn't a standout (check out The Reluctant Fundamentalist and The Night Of). I think he's miscast here; the character calls for him to be a little more sinister and animated yet he's oddly reserved. He had his moments, he gives a speech to a test subject about the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac that was well delivered but they needed another actor. Michelle Williams rarely appears in blockbuster movies, she does her job capably, but she gets the short end of the stick. Her character is a little generic and aside from one scene, there isn't much for her to do here. I will also credit Jenny Slate who did a solid job in her scenes.The most pronounced criticism that the critics have lobbied against this movie that I can agree with is that the scene transitions in Venom are oddly sloppy. When I say that, I'm not referring to character decisions or to tonal swings (both have their off moments going into the final turn, especially with Eddie/Anne romance) I mean the movie just doesn't flow from scene to scene. There could be pieces missing that fill in the blanks (Tom Hardy's comments about the movie seem to indicate as much) but a good movie compares to an orchestral music piece. Despite so many elements being brought together, there's harmony. Venom lacks that consistency, you'll be wondering how characters arrived in certain places or how time is passing in an uneven way. I usually believe its poor editing, but I thought the fight scenes were cut together surprisingly well. I don't know whether to point the finger at the editor, the studio or the director but they could have done a better job, especially with such a big project.I don't want to make excuses for Venom but the last not I'll make was the movie was fun the whole way through. I never got the impression that the movie was taking itself very seriously (the interplay between Eddie and Venom was a little tongue-in-cheek) and that helped me get on board. Despite this not being a landmark for superhero movies, not every movie in the genre needs to be Infinity War and with the different vibe Venom goes for, there's enough here to keep you happy for the whole picture.Despite the negative word of mouth surrounding Venom leading up to the release, I was rooting for this movie. Walking out of the theatre, I thought of another film Ruben Fleischer directed called Gangster Squad. Similar to Venom, that movie had a lot going for it but tripped up in a couple of key areas (the worst being the horribly hammy dialogue). The character design, the CGI, the action and even the central performance are all good to great here, and I liked the fact that we're getting more anti-heroes instead of boy scout superheroes. But Venom also stumbles over corny dialogue, some miscast actors and actresses and a lack of polish that the top end superhero movies have. I would really like to see a sequel to this, maybe they'd be able to iron out more of the kinks on the second try and go for a little more edge. Venom is a mixed bag, but I think the good outweighs the bad easily and the critics were too harsh on this. I'd give Venom a 7.5/10 but I can't quite go to 8 on it so I must round down. If you're interested, go check it out but if you're not sold, waiting for it to be on your preferred streaming service isn't a bad idea.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can see where some people found it to be stupid entertainment and silly fun, but that's not exactly the way I like movies. There are always exceptions, but with a cast like Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Woody Harrelson (sort of), I expect a lot more. The script for this film is by far one of the worst things put to film over the last few years. I flat out laughed out loud at how bad some of these lines were. And by no means did I think most of this humor was intentional. If you watch any of the trailers for the film, they are pitching a serious & dark take on the Venom character, so don't give me the whole ""it's supposed to bad"" take. That's just not true. You can forget ever seeing Spider-Man show up in these movies, at least if Sony/Marvel wants me to take him seriously at all. There's no sense in going through and ripping apart each and every part of this film, just know that I disliked the entire thing. Nope, I take that back, I hated it.1.7/10","137 out of 277 found this helpful.

Tonight, a new contestant enters the park, not so much a hero as an antihero, this creature has pulled in a noble fanbase and inspired a number of other characters in the process. If you've got the hints you know what I'm reviewing, so let's get started as Robbie K reviews: Movie: Venom (2018)Director:
 Ruben Fleischer
Writers:
 Scott Rosenberg (screenplay by), Jeff Pinkner(screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Marcella Bragio 
LIKES: The Dark Aspect: You'll see a lot of jabs at this movie, but this installment at least gave us a taste of the darker side of the titular character. The movie dips into how not everything is gold in the realm of superpowers, as well as how grey everything can really be in the complex world of humans vs. the unknown. It also allowed for some more intense action scenes to come into play, including some finishes the fanbase has been looking forward to for some time. The Action... sort of: There are moments in Venom that feel well at home with MCU level style of battling. Venom has at least two winning sequences for me that have explosions, choreographed take downs of extras, and some sweet utilization of CGI to bring out Venom's fluid, whip like movements to bare. It's not the most dynamic, but it is miles above his first appearance back in Spiderman 3. Sound Editing: Probably not what most are looking for, I enjoyed the sound effects brought by the movie team. You've got the alien slithering, the roiling growls of the hungry beast, plenty of speaker shattering booms, and enough effects to wrap together to make for the action scenes. Tom Hardy: The star of the show and perhaps the best casting call for this movie, Hardy is certainly the leading component of his film. His ability to play an awkward, down on his luck, vigilante reporter is quite spot on, as well as the uncanny ability to play a crazy person as well. It came off naturally, held good chemistry with the rest of the crew, and certainly was entertaining to watch him interact with a digital, altered voice of Venom. I've said it before, but Hardy's ability to play any type of role continues to be present in his acting. Comedy: Like most Marvel movies, Venom is loaded with comedy to get you laughing and ironically may be the biggest aspect of the movie. Both intentionally and unintentionally, the movie had me laughing, primarily at the banter between Venom and Eddie Brock through much of the movie. The insults are on point, the delivery of the lines, and even Venom's questionable morals are all entertaining for this reviewer and probably the biggest point one should go in wanting to see. The End Credits Teaser: Not fully relevant to Venom, the post credit scene is worth the wait and hints at a huge potential for the next Sony-Marvel production coming in December. A little teaser to see if you want to take a trip into that. DISLIKES: The CGI: Still better than anything I could do, Venom didn't quite have the same definition and attention to detail that its Disney infused brothers do. The graphic are a bit messy, for although fluid, looks like living spaghetti trying to take form in many ways. Perhaps an homage to the early 2000s graphic style, Venom needed some upgrading to match the graphic expectations that the movie fans most likely desire. The Story: Hinting and promising so much in the trailer, Venom's story department does hit the dark aspect that this antihero demands. Yet, it still took shortcuts for this film, skipping over a lot of build-up, character development, and even just plot development to get to the goods and comedy I guess. Other characters are very one-dimensional and shallow, relationships are very fickle and seem to switch faster than a light switch, and in many cases crosses into cheesy proportions that didn't work for me. Grandiose displays may be something that younger audiences like,, but the story element still needs some tweaking to get to the Disney level. The Other Symbiotes: I get this was the start of the franchise, but the advertisements really hammered into us the potential to see other creatures more than Venom take some screen time. Sadly, they skimped on these as well, forcing to barely touch on these creatures before moving on to another poor plot point. Even the main antagonist in this film didn't get much time worth warranting, once more digging at the weaker storytelling of this studio. Even Venom took some time getting himself on screen, a sad use of merchandising rights when it could have been so much better. The Anticlimactic Action: Venom does have some nice action scenes as mentioned before, but the problem is that they are often short lived or very carbon copy. The chase scene showed promise, and the first-time combat had its moments, but they utilized their tricks a little too quickly. The ending promised a potential to have a real, epic clash of the Symbiotic titans going, but again Sony cut the corners and left me wanting more to show off their powers. Venom was very underpowered in this film, and they did little to utilize the keys handed to them. The props for the mid-credit scene: Actor choice for the surprise guest at the film is 50:50 to me, but the props to make him come to life... not very good for me. Should a Venom 2 make it to the big screen, I'm hoping their wardrobe department makes some better efforts to get the next antagonist in. The VERDICT: Go in expecting a comedy and you will love this movie and have the most fun. However, in regards to the full picture part of the film, it still has more to develop before it meets expectations set by Disney. Hardy and some mediocre action scenes can bring some entertainment, but it doesn't quite hit the home run outside of that. It's a bit cheesy at times, a little overboard in terms of the comedy, and doesn't quite deliver on the action, other symbiotes or even the story. Yet, it has enough special effects kicks to warrant a theater visit, but only if you can handle the limitations mentioned. My scores are: Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0","20 out of 48 found this helpful.

It just constantly skirts the line between being pretty decent and just downright boring. This - combined with its overall weak, poorly paced narrative and its general technical choppiness (including noticeably 'jumpy' editing and several scenes that are strangely blurry, to the point that it seems like the focus-puller might've been asleep) - means that the overall experience isn't all that good. The film certainly lands with a whimper rather than a roar. It actually takes ages for Brock to become the eponymous big boy and, when he does, the dynamic between him and his newfound companion never comes close to being fully formed or even consistent. This means that we can't really relate to - or care for - either of them and that their motivations don't really make all that much sense. Their relationship is supposed to be the driving force of the story, yet it doesn't naturally evolve and never comes close to being compelling. To make matters worse, the whole thing culminates in an awful, CG mess of a finale that's literally difficult to watch, much less comprehend. It inexplicably goes back on several core conceits simply to have our symbiotic lead emerge as a more 'traditional' hero, despite the piece being billed as a decidedly 'villainous' affair. The feature is pretty tame in general, to be honest. It all just comes across as more of poor man's 'Upgrade (2018)' than anything else. Don't even get me started on the absolute joke of an end-credits scene. 4/10.","101 out of 202 found this helpful.

Since it's a movie about an alien (""symbiote"") turning Eddie Brock (Hardy) into a superhero/antihero, you should suspend disbelief and expectations at the start. The symbiote is brought to Earth by Drake (Ahmed), a Branson/Musk-type who wants to colonize space. He's obviously evil.Anne (Williams) is Eddie's ex and has some scenes, as does Skirth (Slate), who's experimenting on the symbiotes. We finally get to see Venom about 50min in, after quite a bit of unnecessary build-up, and all hell essentially breaks loose. There's a pretty good car chase - we're obviously in San Francisco so the cars can get plenty of air - and some solid action/fight scenes.While it's all quite daft, and some of the scenes have the camera moving way too fast, overall it's Hardy, his charisma, and how he interacts with Venom that make it enjoyable and not totally stupid. The CGI's quite good and it's fun to see some of his powers. There's a few jokes - but definitely don't expect another 'Deadpool'.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

I do prefer the origin including Spider-Man, but I believe they were able to pull it off without him. I would be lying if I didn't want Spider-Man to come into the picture at some point down the road, and hopefully within the MCU.This was definitely an improvement and much better casting than the previous live action Venom in 'Spider-Man 3'. Yes, it would have been better had it been rated R. Venom is just better as a no mercy anti-hero with gory finishes. The CGI looked good I thought and was entertaining as a whole.All around a fairly decent action movie. Nothing too critical about it, but also nothing extraordinary.

But I guess everyone's down with that these days? So I won't preach too hard about it, after all Méliès and his effects kicked it all off and so maybe we're back to the beginning of film, with all it's awkwardness and inappropriateness too.The movie was appealing to me from the poster and the trailer. A normal guy can become Venom, Venom don't take none of the brown stuff, he's gonna kick you ass right out of your face. So yeah a two hour holiday from the tediousness of the social contract.The film actually comes off as a bit of a buddy movie, inseparable parasite and host journalist Eddie Brock spends most of the movie bonding with comic effect. A main failure is that we're meant to believe that macho figurehead and multi-millionaire heartthrob Tom Hardy is playing a ""loser"". As usual with comic book stuff, you end up feeling that the resulting vigilantism is being given a bit more support than it probably should be getting (the effects of vigilantism are usually heartbreakingly stupid and tragic). The villain (I imagine Elon Musk probably didn't see the funny side with this one) and the antihero both basically have the same general activity, they do whatever the hell they want. But you have to get in bed with the devil to defeat the evil people, right? What popularised the ""work with your darkness"" nonsense, Dexter back in 2006? Or Jack Bauer back just after 911?So I enjoyed it, but probably ""needed a shower"" too. And like a chump I'll probably be back for a second serving of ""eyes, lungs"", and ""pancreas"", when they show the sequel.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not great, just good. Those expectations fell not too far into the movie, before Venom even showed up. The jokes were falling flat, everyone was getting frustrated with Eddie (Tom Hardy) being quite irritating, and nothing much entertaining was happening on-screen. We were all waiting for Venom to actually appear.It wasn't all doom and gloom though. Once Venom finally shows up, it gets a bit better. For example, when Eddie and Venom are actually bantering and telling each other off, it can be entertaining in parts and showed some potential with Venom's character. Definitely the closest anyone got to laughing in my fully packed cinema. That's another problem with the movie, though. It's quite hard to tell what's supposed to be funny and what isn't sometimes. It really is all over the place. I don't know who thought toning it down to PG-13 violence was a great idea. It was disappointing they cut so much content out of the movie.Most of the performances were average. The CGI was not that great. Felt a bit dated and Venom didn't look that convincing for the most part. The soundtrack was passable, I suppose. Nothing really memorable. Most of the movie was mediocre/passable. As I said before, the highlights are when both Eddie and Venom are the focus together, but when it turns to the other characters it becomes a bit dull again. The action sequences range from mediocre to passable, but nothing really stands out as memorable and stuff you haven't already seen loads of times before in superhero movies. You can predict most of the plot and the twist and turns from a mile away. The villain was generic and not all that exciting. I'd suggest sitting through the post-credits sequence though. Overall I don't feel Venom was completely unwatchable, but could have been alot better. Adding Spider-Man to the mix would have probably elevated it quite a bit alone. Overall the negatives/blandness of Venom prevent it from being a good movie. I'm still unsure if I'd like to see a sequel to it in the near future.5/10","143 out of 298 found this helpful.

More power to ya! Me? I turned Black Panther off not even ten minutes in. So why I chose to watch Venom, the commercially successful and critically panned 2018 film starring Tom Hardy as the titular anti-hero/pro-villain(?) might seem odd on the surface, sure. But my approach was threefold: (1) Venom/Spiderman were my favorite characters during my brief childhood fascination with actual comic books, (2) I think Hardy is a nutty genius actor and I would watch him in anything, and (3) the fact that this was *so* harshly panned (29% RT score!!) and not technically in the MCU (lol) completely piqued my interest for some reason. This movie is by no means a masterpiece obviously, but my appreciation of it is not ironic. It's not so bad it's good. It's just good good because it's a dumb fun movie. Period. You can pile on the asinine plot or over-the-top acting or maybe you had issue with the FX and character design. I don't watch enough of this genre to comment in a compare/contrast way. I just enjoyed it. And I find it extremely odd and mildly troubling that just enjoying films in this genre is apparently not enough.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Plot.The plot of this movie is not complicated at all for any viewer. It's simple and has a fast pace but for a movie like this and of this genre, it works. Quite an original plot!2.) The runtime.The runtime if this movie is just 1 hour 52 minutes and it is quite short for a Marvel movie which makes it more watchable. Usually a Marvel movie has a minimum of maybe 2 hrs - 2hrs 15mins. Sometimes even 2 and a half hours. It is defenitely not too lomg fof this type of movie.3.) The cast.The cast of this movie is quite interesting in my opinion. Some of these actors are not as well-known as the main actor of this movie Tom Hardy a.k.a Eddie Brock/Venom.4.) Action.The action sequences in this movie are extremely more original than any other movie released in the past 5-7 years. The car chase scene of Eddie on his motorcycle is an absolute blast to watch and enjoy! The final scene will be very nice ti enjoy too.5.) The CGI.The final reason that makes ""Venom"" a great movie is the amount of CGI used to make the character. There is a huge amount of CGI used on him but that issue is overcome by the fact that the main character is VENOM. You can't make Venom without using a lot of CGI.My overall thoughts on this movie is that it is a great movie to watch with the family and friends . If you are a person who loves an action-packed Marvel movie lover than this is the right movie for you.Thanks!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

So what there is no Carnage in a Venom movie.
So what there is no A list actor other than Tom Hardy in the Venom movie.
So what it lacks the Marvel family fun touch.
So what if critics have shot it down so far.Tom Hardy's Venom does not touch the highs of say Black Panther or Iron Man when it comes to comic book origin stories, but it sure is fun, a lot more fun than most DC movies, a little less than Marvel flicks. After long last here is a comic book film that behaves like what it is, and not try to change the world. 
Dr. Carlton Drake - ""Look around at the world. What do you see? A planet on the brink of collapse. Human beings are disposable. But man and symbiote combined, this is a new race, a new species... a higher lifeform""Sure enough. Venom starts off as science fiction. New species found that requires a suitable host, and one that is sought after by an evil genius. Enter investigative reporter Eddie Brock who is found to be the suitable host for the above symbiotic species and voila, we have Venom. Brock has teething problems (no pun intended) to start with, but once they bond, the movie shifts several gears at one go, and at the end, you are left asking for more. Most of the movie, Brock-Venom is not a superhero, but bent on self preservation. Towards the end Venom realizes he is also a loser like Brock, and then accepts the earth saving duties. Venom - ""We will eat both of your arms, and then both of your legs, and then we will eat your face right off your head. You will be this armless, legless, faceless thing, won't you, going down the street like a turd in the wind!"" Venom is an action horror comedy, and had it got the R rating that it should have gone for, it might just have been THE R rated movie of the year. Hardy has gone on record to say that the 40 minutes edited out of the final cut were his favorite parts, you know, the unhinged stuff that you want to see in a Venom movie.Director Ruben Fleischer does a good job of maintaining an even tempo throughout the movie, and i liked the fact that for once, a movie is just about the central character. But clearly the star is Tom Hardy, who removes the bane (again no pun intended) of Eddie Brock 2007. Eddie Brock is Spiderman 3 was an idiot, Eddie Brock in 2018 Venom is a hopeless romantic hero who manages to make a protector out of a symbiote who has a thing for biting off people's heads. Hardy plays Brock as witty, and charming, and as Venom, he is menacing.Venom - ""Eyes! Lungs! Pancreas! So many snacks, so little time!"" 
Now give us the Spiderman- Venom crossover we deserve, along with Carnage for added fun.Ah, Venom was fun, but cannot help wonder how much more fun it would have been if not for the ratings.....7/10","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

This is not a good movie. Just as far as how well it is made it isn't good. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock is one of the most unrealistic characters ever created. He supposed to be this accomplished guy at the beginning of the movie but he never comes off as that. He comes off more as a complete idiot and a total douchebag. And there are some lines in this movie that was just really stupid and there is also a lot of unintentional hilarious moments from the entire cast that makes no sense.And yet this movie for some reason works for me. With all of its stupid and crude humor it comes off as a great little B movie. It cheesy and campy and feels like it comes right out of the Blade era of movies with things like Fantastic or and Daredevil. The bond between the symbiote and Eddie is amazing and there dynamic together just really works well.The CGI in this movie is ok at best and awful at worst. The final battle in the movie feels really poorly put together like someone rushed there After Effects work and turned it in really fast.The bond between Eddie and his girlfriend also kinda sorta worked for me. Mostly cause I think she is in love with symbiote and I think from the point when she finds Eddie with it onward the movie works perfectly.Overall while Venom isn't good it is at least fun so if you want to watch a fun movie with your friends then this is it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because this knowledge is not needed, nor (quite frankly) is it wanted as the filmmakers of Venom made a film that centers on the titular anti-hero with no real regard to his place in the Marvel Universe.And this works well...enough. True, the plot, dialogue, situations, special effects and gadgets of this film are middle-of-the-road at best, but with the two folks at the center of this film, I started to forgive this film it's many flaws and enjoyed two Oscar-caliber Actors having a good ol' time in a Supehero movie.Venom, of course, tells the story of...Eddie Brock..who becomes - through a merging of his body with an Alien symbiotic creature (don't worry about it, just roll with it) - becomes the titular VENOM. A being that wants to eat live creatures (most notably human heads) while the good part of Eddie tries to keep him in check and help him fight bad guys.In lesser performance hands, this character could become silly and stupid, but in the more than capable performance by the great Tom Hardy (Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES), Eddie Brock/Venom is an intriguing figure to watch on-screen. His simultaneous ability to look unnerved and hunger for live flesh while looking for a nice cool bath caused me to smirk on more than one occasion and I ended up rooting for him throughout the film.Matching him is the great Michelle Williams (she of the 4 Oscar nominations, most recently in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA) as Eddie Brock's ex-Fiance Anne Weying. Like Hardy, Williams is elevating mediocre material to something better than the mediocrity it was destined to be. The chemistry between Williams and Hardy is evident in their bi-play with each other and I couldn't help but think ""get these two into an Oscar-caliber film together and watch the sparks - and the awards - fly.""Unfortunately, Riz Ahmed as bad guy Carlton Drake is not able to rise above the material and when he is playing opposite Hardy and/or Williams, he pales in comparison and I began to realize just how weak the script by the trio of Jeff Pinkner, Scott Rosenberg and Kelly Marcel is. Clearly, two of them were brought in to re-write the original (I have no idea who did what) but none of them were able to elevate the proceedings.Nor could Director Ruben Fleischer (ZOMBIELAND) elevate things. His Direction is pedestrian at best. There is nothing really interesting going on and when the going got tough he just started to rely on the quick cut/edits that is so ""en vogue"" these days - and it grew tiresome.But when I started to grow weary of the events on the screen, Hardy and Williams would show up and I began to forgive things again, even thinking during the credits scene (where they introduce the Villain for VENOM 2), I want to see Hardy and Williams play against (name deleted so as not to spoil) as the new Villain - that might be cool!So, I'm ""in"" for Venom. It was ""good enough"" and I will come back for the next installment - and based on the Box Office of the opening weekend, there WILL BE a next installment.Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

When a symbiote bonds with Eddie, he transforms into the deadly symbiote known as, Venom. Eddie will have to channel the powers of the symbiote, to save his life. Venom is an awesome film. Director Ruben Fleischer has done complete justice to the character of Venom after his disappointing portrayal in Spider-Man 3(2007). Still, we definitely miss that connection to Spider-Man because, Venom & Spider-Man are always connected in the comics. The action set pieces are fantastic. The critics can't whine about CGI fight scenes because, what more can you expect from a CGI character. Still, I wish they would have shown us some of the more nasty things that Venom did in the movie. An R rating would have helped but, I can understand why they decided to make the movie PG-13. They needed to make way for Spider-Man in possible sequels(fingers crossed). Tom Hardy is the star of the show as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy perfects the relationship between Eddie & Venom. Eddie being the vulnerable host & Venom being the caged animal that can be let loose at any time. There are a number of hysterical set pieces involving interactions between Eddie & Venom. Tom Hardy also perfects Venom's classic deep & gruff voice. Michelle Williams is brilliant as Anne Weying. It's nice to see Williams star in a comic book movie. Riz Ahmed is spectacular as Carlton Drake/Riot. Scott Haze is impressive as Security Chief Roland Treece. Reid Scott is great as Dr. Dan Lewis. Jenny Slate is amazing as Dr. Dora Skirth. The supporting cast is impressive. Venom is a must watch for Venom & Tom Hardy fans. Ignore the critics & go for it with moderate expectations.","26 out of 41 found this helpful.

I had very low expectations and actually enjoyed it a lot! I liked the overall concept and philosophy of the movie, as I understood it. In one scene, Eddy Brock was listening to an Eckhart Tolle audio book... meditation was also mentioned at one point. This primed me to interpret what was later happening in a quasi-Buddhist manner, as follows: the Symbiote is a metaphor for a toxic ideology, a memeplex that uses human brains as vehicles to live and replicate. Hence, the metaphor of eating human heads. The idea that your thoughts are your identity, and the ability to tell them apart. Hence, Eddy Brock not accepting Venom as his inner voice, and instead using the pronoun ""we"". Also, different ideologies suit different people, therefore the Symbiote was not compatible with all organisms, but only some. In the movie, the subjects most compatible with the alien were people susceptible to ideology - be it philosophical, religious, or political. In the other organisms, the Symbiote could not survive for long. The alien uses the human body and its mental abilities, as well, to reach its selfish ends, meanwhile making the body dependent, and exhausting its resources. This is what memeplexes do, too. An ideology in the brain of an intelligent and powerful person would make it grow faster, because he will propagate it in a more convincing way. I liked the special effects and the creature designs. The fight between Venom and Riot was fascinating to watch. Even for a PG-13 rated movie, there was plenty of violence and it was well-presented.Acting wise, Venom wasn't bad. Tom Hardy pulled off a likable anti-hero, with his human side very similar to Adam Sandler's characters. Riz Ahmed could have been more charismatic as an evil scientist, but he did the job well-enough. Michelle Williams was very good as the female protagonist, and her character had interesting perks and strengths that made her stand out. Scott Haze was a bit boring as the main thug, I'd prefer that he was a bit more brutal and rough.What I didn't like about this movie were the countless plot holes that even a willing imagination could not fill. They were a bit distracting and pulled me out of the movie experience, but the directing was good enough to pull me back in. I can't wait for the Director's Cut version where I hope to see some of the 40 minutes that had been cut from the theatrical release. Tom Hardy shared in an interview that his favorite scenes from the movie were removed from the final cut, so we have yet to see what they will deliver.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Venom is a film that is a victim of itself and that having an incredibly large potential, it is satisfied being average movie directly aimed at immediate entertainment. Well, the truth is that it fulfills its function, it is entertaining and the film is easily digested, however, to people who love the character as it is my case and that although I did not expect much from this film, i hoped that they would take better advantage of the elements that were available for his performance, such as his stellar signing; ""Tom Hardy"", who is a great actor, but who nevertheless in this film feels too wasted in all the possible levels.
His script is at least deplorable and tells you a story that feels compelling and you never manage to believe it or feel that sense of urgency about something unexpected can happen. EVERYTHING on this movie is linear and does not give you any surprises.
Undoubtedly, the best of the whole movie is VENOM itself, which shines with its own light, both in design and in its own personality. Maybe it's what saves this movie from a possible collapse.
In conclusion, Venom is not a bad movie, it all depends on what mentality you see it. If you want to enjoy an hour and a half of pure entertainment, you will find it. But if in turn, you were looking for something more in it than that, you will be very disappointed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Comedy is clearly enjoyable but too present in the movie, which in general could have probably focused a little more on the ""dark"" side of both Eddie and Venom.
Didn't like the female character Michelle, who i found kind of empty, but i get it is not a key factor to the movie.
Could have liked the villain character, not badly acted but really too forced: we all got that he had a God complex, repetition and making it obvious wasn't needed.Tom Hardy kept high standards for a movie which had a lot of potential (the whole mix between good/evil was really intriguing), that i found not fully expressed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy is one of the best actors on the planet, and while a Marvel comic film is arguably a misuse of his talent, he is nonetheless superb in creating yet another unique character and in a surprisingly humorous role.'Venom' bears all the hallmarks of a great Marvel film-great action, great baddies, great humour-yet quite an unexpected story. The film is well paced, with excellent editing, especially considering what must have been a challenging effects job. We often take vfx for granted, but this was a monumental job, and admirably realised.There are a couple elements that could have been improved. Could have had more character development at the start and the relationship needed more attention. The song at the end is abysmal.

The critics rating for this movie is also the lowest rating that I've seen in a while, with the metascore being as low as 35. However, I came across the trailer when I went to the cinema and decided that the trailer seems cool and ended up watching the movie. And I'm not disappointed with the movie.The movie is quite different from my expectations. The trailers made it seems like the movie will be an action thriller anti-hero origin type of movie. Yet, this was not the case. The movie is a lot more humorous, and the dynamics between Eddie Brock and Venom is way friendlier than the trailers made it seems to be. I cannot judge the accuracy as I haven't read the comics, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed the dynamics between those two characters. I also feel like Tom Hardy had done a brilliant job on portraying Eddie Brock. His version of Eddie is very lovable and realistic, and I love every bit of banter that he has with Venom.The movie also has some amazing action sequences. It's nothing that would keep you at the edge of your seat, but it is definitely enjoyable. The humour is also good. Although it does have a tendency of ruining the overall thrilling vibe sometimes. But I'm not complaining as I definitely found myself laughing plenty of time in the cinema.However, I understand why plenty of movie critics hates this movie. Most of the people who came to the movie probably expect to see an action thriller movie, and the intro could be too long and boring for those kinds of movies. The overall writing is also quite weak at some points and I can spot some plot holes throughout the movie. The plot itself is quite cliched and unoriginal, but I guess that it is a common thing for superhero movies. The CGI is generally fine, but there are some scenes where the CGI seems cheap and downright disappointing. Especially considering the huge budget that is used for the movie. But I guess that the biggest reason why most movie critics hate this movie is the villain.I found the movie to be enjoyable overall, but even I should admit that the villain is quite disappointing. Villain characters are supposed to be threatening and believable. However, Riot is none of that and I consider him to be a forgettable character. Although to be fair, the only characters that I genuinely enjoy are Venom, Dan and Eddie himself. The rest of the characters are mediocre at best. There is another thing that disappointed me about the movie. The movie originally supposed to have an R rating, but Sony decided to cut a lot of the scenes and turns it into a PG-13 movie, and I hate it. I felt like they had butchered down the movie for the worse and that a lot of the scenes could've been improved if they don't have the limitations that apply to PG-13 movies. You can't butcher down an R-rated movie and turns it to a PG-13 movie without messing it up. I would love to see the original R-rated version on Bluray or something similar.Overall, I found the movie to be enjoyable and funny regardless of its many flaws. After all, you won't see some of the flaws unless you try to analyze the movie or read deeply into the plot. This movie is great if you want an enjoyable action-humour movie to watch with your friends and family. But don't expect a deep and dark action-thriller movie because this movie is anything but that.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is one well choreographed motorcycle scene though, and that's the reason for the three stars I gave it.

It wasn't great and I'll tell you why. There were a lot of missed opportunities when Venom appeared. It could've been a lot more brutal in its action sequences and there could have been better interactions between Eddie and Venom. Don't let this discourage you from watching it though. Its worth a ticket. Don't listen to the critics; they're a bit over-the-top with the hate. The beginning 30-40 minutes felt pretty boring to say the least. Sure, i was waiting for Venom but thats not why its boring. It felt the need to shove in random interactions to show us Eddie's human side. I wont discuss ""like what"" due to spoilers. It got to the point where I, along with audience, were just ""ok we get it"". Although, when Venom did finally come to light, the movie started to pick itself up again.I'm giving this movie a very fair 7/10 due to the opportunities that never came to be.

Not helped that the Marvel character has to be painted as an anti-hero of a sorts and not a villain.Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a committed investigative reporter in San Francisco. He has a nice apartment, an ace lawyer girlfriend (Michelle Williams.)Eddie loses it all when he has to interview an Elon Musk type businessman Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) whose spacecraft crashed. Eddie asks uncomfortable questions regarding his pharmaceutical business and gets fired.Drake has found an organism from space. Drake is conducting unethical experiments with homeless people. The organism achieves symbiosis with Eddie when he breaks into the laboratory and this gives him extraordinary powers and a desire to eat human heads.Eddie and Venom combine, but Eddie is slowly being killed by the symbiote and Venom wants to destroy the planet. Venom has a change of heart and then another more powerful symbiote is unleashed.The film is slow to get going. Hardy looks miscast but gamely tries hard with what he has. Riz is saddled as a onenote villain. Williams is just the bland girlfriend.The film fits uneasily in the Spiderman universe as it is presented as a darker film but totally it is all over the place. With so many script writers, I think this film shows all the signs of post production executive interference.","26 out of 50 found this helpful.

The film was not even half as bad as the critics said. VENOM is the electrifying action movie you need to see in theaters. I saw it today in 4DX 3D and found it highly entertaining. There are a lot of white knuckle action scenes enhanced further by a solid CGI work. An exhilarating vehicular chase sequence had me excited to the core and so did all the other action sequences. Tom Hardy's performance is impressive. His interactions with Venom are heart winning. VENOM is ultimately fast paced. I didn't realize when time flew by. This film has made me like Venom a lot. I liked him in SPIDER-MAN 3 also (which was a great movie in my opinion) but he wasn't portrayed as a hero in that one. In this one, Venom will definitely not be hated. There is also a good amount of comedy and horror present in the film although primarily this is an action movie with a science fiction setting.VENOM definitely reminded me of the dark atmosphere built by Sam Raimi in his Spider-Man movies. That's another reason why I wanted to watch it. It's a highly entertaining action entertainer which needs to be seen and enjoyed as a whole. Since this is anyways an origin story, don't expect it to be overstuffed. Just book your tickets, grab some eatables, bring along a friend or be alone, and watch this film on the biggest screen possible, in 3D. Plus, there are some interesting surprises towards the end, so feel free to stay instead of just walking away. P.S. - I have not read any Venom comics till date.","105 out of 197 found this helpful.

It has had a success that the critics hate to see as they wish for another movie that I will review tonight had the same success and it is also a movie that is making a lot of heads turn as it has replaced so many fan favorites and even critic favorite super hero movies.
A movie about Venom, admittedly one of the lesser known villain/anti heroes of marvel's Spiderman stories has made a splash so big it has singlehandedly put an end to the California drought, it has made the Sahara bloom and sprout forests, it has made the ocean's level rise higher.
It is fair to say no one expected for this movie to make this big of a noise but it did, probably had to do with a really good premiere window, its biggest competition was a remake of a remake of a remake of a movie about a young amateur singer meeting an older established star, falling in love and reaching stardom, not exactly a blockbuster movie.So Venom had it pretty relaxed and now that it is all said and done the question is how good it was really was and in my opinion it was pretty good.
The movie is kind of short and might even feel rushed but it doesn't hang on unnecessary stuff, it decides what it wants to be and pursues that, it is violent but not graphic, it is funny but not comedic, it is action but not break neck. it finds a middle ground and nests in that spot and makes little babies that might sing even better than itself did when it first came to us.
The acting is your typical Hollywood super hero movie, there is no difference really in acting between this and any of the other recent marvel movies, it is chill, nonchalant, doesn't take it too seriously or hard, just wants to have fun and be done with it.
But the way the characters are built Tom Hardy ends up doing a pretty good job specially with the help of the Venom as a character, Venom is a lot of fun to listen to, he is pretty funny and absurd.
The camera work is fluid in general and easy to follow however the movie contains a lot of dark scenes and it can get hard to follow specially when you have Venom on screen a character that is covered in black too.
All in all I liked the movie and think a 6.5 to 7 is a pretty fair score for it","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But my son really wanted to see it, so we went and, wow, I ended up really enjoying it!Yes, there is some awkward dialogue and the villain is underwhelming, however, I liked the other elements so much that those issues really didn't bother me.First off, Eddie Brock is super likable and relatable. Tom Hardy, who I've never been a fan of, knocked it out of the park with his performance of this character. I really felt for Eddie and was drawn into his plight. Though some have complained the beginning of the movie is too slow, Eddie Brock kept my interest the whole time.Secondly, everything about Venom is super cool. The struggle between Eddie and Venom and their argumentative banter made for both some delightful conflict and laugh-out-loud comedy. Yes, there were a few lines that were duds and made me roll my eyes, but overall I thought it was fantastic.Finally, the mix of action, horror, and comedy was done almost perfectly, in my opinion. This was a concern of mine, based on the reviews, but the flim makers pulled it off well.All in all, we left the theater excited and thrilled and can't wait to see Venom on the big screen again. Kudos to Sony and BOOOO to the critics!","136 out of 262 found this helpful.

Imagine putting such good effort into all the seperate bits of a film, script, score, special effects, casting etc and someone giving you 1 out of 10!! - honestly!!Rant over! - ok, what's it like?
Well it's entertaining enough if you like this sort of movie ( and I do!! ) but you just get the feeling that it's good but not quite there in several areas. As others have said, the casting could've been better ( apart from Tom ) and I just felt the jokey tone was overdone in parts - the bike chase was almost slapstick.
I would have liked it if it had been R rated and more adult.
It's obvious a lot of time & thought went into the special effects but sometimes it looks just too digital.Also wondered why the bad guy had to ask who had gained entry into his labs - didn't he have security cameras?!!So there you go - after the film I felt I had had a good time and it was an ok movie and wasn't disappointed I had chosen to watch it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Maybe it's because of the popularity of the character, or maybe even the fact that some casual audiences may (incorrectly) believe it is part of the MCU. I didn't think it looked very good and was not planning to see it in theaters originally, and only went to see it because of an online ticketing coupon which made it free. That said, I went in optimistic, as there have been some films this year that looked unappealing yet I ended up finding them enjoyable (e.g. ""The Spy Who Dumped Me."") But despite my optimistic sentiment, ""Venom"" was not just bad, it was really bad.I like Tom Hardy as an actor, but his acting is incredibly weak here. He is not really given much of a range to work with, which isn't necessarily his fault, but his portrayal of Eddie Brock is wholly unconvincing. The film's ""origin story"" tropes are rather tired, but that's nothing compared to the film's atrocious script. The script for this film is one of the worst in recent memory, with unbelievably cheesy dialogue or very cliché dialogue (e.g. Brock saying ""what is wrong with me?"" after feeling sick, etc.) coming at the viewer in almost every scene. Additionally, the film's tonal mishaps give the film a major identity crisis. ""Venom"" can't decide whether it wants to be an action-comedy a la traditional Marvel movies or a sci-fi horror flick a la ""Alien."" The problem is that the movie struggles with both tones. The attempts at humor in the movie feel incredibly forced and unfunny. Despite some creepy images of body horror and one or two jump scares, the movie is not particularly scary either. As a result, the movie just feels like a mishmash that was thrown together. The only remotely decent thing about it is an engaging car chase scene about halfway through. Definitely not recommended. 2/10","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

Eddie Brock's/venom's Symbiote story is a very intriguing one that doesn't necessarily need Spiderman to succeed and I think this will prove a lot of people wrong and stupid for doubting it. Also the critics...don't even get me started on how terrible and pretentious these loony critics are where they dismantle every film that does not fit their liberal PC propaganda. The fact that there are so many sheep that will blindly follow these mindless cretins and let them dictate whether not they enjoy or see a movie R just sad human beings without any free thinking ability .

His employees were also nuts, acting like children, not taking all the possibilities into account and behaving carelessly.The Brock infiltration into the evil human experimentation facility was dumb as well. Where were all the security cameras, all the passcodes, bioscan (for eyes, fingerprints, and such) devices, tracking what people come in at any time in the day, etc. What the hell - we should be seeing a maximum security facility because a leak from the facility can be devastating to the entire company, if the media finds out... And what we see in the movie is children's kindergarten security type :)So in general, this movie lacked confident direction and GOOOORE. Venom snacks a guy's head off and WHERE IN THE WORLD is at least a single drop of blood? What is this madness? The movie felt so clinically clean I was disgusted when watching the ""supposedly-bloody"" corpse-eating scenes... PG-13 is a terrible decision.Sadly, PG-13 ruined the movie for me...

Spiderman 3 is all I knew about Venom. Man did turn out to be something awesome than I ever thought.By the way I usually dislike superhero movies whether its from Marvel or DC but, this I really liked.I get where the critics are coming from. The character idea had way more potential and could have been better if the screen writers had more patience and develop a better screen lines. But I was left happy and in awe. Granted a big part of why liked the movie was because I had no idea how awesome the idea of Venom was (since I never read the comics).Also, the action scenes weren't anything special or jaw dropping. We're in 2018/19 so we got desensitized to most of the action scenes and its hard to top it off. It takes real creativity to think of good action scenes and moves. But then again I didn't enter expecting action moves as Mission Impossible or a Jackie Chan movie.Personally I'd say 7or8/10 but I also understand why an old comic fan would give it a 6/10 or less.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Overall I thought the origin story of the ""parasite"" was well developed, a slow process but provided good tension building. I personally am I big fan of Tom Hardy (Eddie), especially his role in Mad Max, yet I thought in this movie his acting skills weren't used effectively, most particularly in the solo scenes interacting as a journalist and with the female lead. However, every scene with Eddie and Venom was pure gold. They bounced comedy off of each other perfectly, with many great comedic and fight moments, as well as a good development of their relationship throughout the movie. However, the vast amount of plot holes regarding the antagonist and the final fight scene made me leave the cinema confused, yet also eager to see the next film. Ultimately it was a good movie which I would recommend for someone to watch once released for the public on DVD and digital download.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For those movie-goers who believe there is no need for another comic book movie, you now have People's Exhibit A. This is the 5th Marvel film of 2018 (yep, that's a new one every other month!), and it's the first one proving challenging to say much of anything that is positive or complimentary. The packed house at the screening had very few reactions during the movie, and seemed deflated afterwards.It should be noted that this is not a Superhero movie, but rather a film based on the Marvel Comic characters and stories of Todd McFarlane and David Michelinie. Four writers are credited with the screenplay, and it seems they either needed more or fewer. Director Ruben Fleisher (ZOMBIELAND, 2009) apparently worked with what he was given, hoping the stellar cast or the CGI could salvage the project. The always terrific Tom Hardy (Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) stars as Eddie Brock, a renowned investigative reporter popular for breaking stories of corruption and fraud. Unfortunately, he has a significant lapse in ethics - an unusually forthright comment from Hollywood on today's media. This lapse costs Brock his job, his girlfriend (4 time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams), and any semblance of normalcy. While investigating the unimaginable human-alien experiments of megalomaniac Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), Brock takes on the powers of the symbiote (Venom) and spends the rest of the movie either trying to control these powers, sitting back and letting the powers take over, or exchanging frat boy dialogue with the possessive being who picked up all nuances of the English language pretty darn quickly.Venom was last seen in the lackluster SPIDER-MAN 3 and was played by Topher Grace. This time out, Venom is the focus and Spidey is nowhere to be found or mentioned ... at least not until post credits (a terrific animated sequence). The CGI is at times very impressive - reminiscent of something John Carpenter might have ordered. Two sides of the Transamerica Pyramid provide a nice visual, however, the effects are not at all consistent. Far too often ... especially the battle between Venom and Riot ...it's just plain messy (like letting a group of toddlers play with black and gray slime). The film's saving grace could have been the interactions between Mr. Hardy and Ms. Williams, both stellar actors, but the dialogue and situations are so ridiculous that even those scenes don't click. The moments that draw laughter from the audience may or may not have been by design, but there are far too many 'forced comedic moments' that just fall flat. Composer Ludwig Goransson (CREED, BLACK PANTHER) delivers some nice moments with the score, but the Eminem song over the closing credits sounds amateurish. The film is very loud, and not so much lacking direction as it is burdened with too many directions and misfires. A comic book movie's first priority is to be fun, and this one just isn't much of that. Surprisingly, the film is rated PG-13 rather than R, so the excessive violence (and there is plenty) never actually spills a drop of blood. Perhaps the goal was to make a Marvel movie so uninspiring that BLACK PANTHER's Oscar chances would be enhanced. Otherwise, there's no excuse.","44 out of 95 found this helpful.

I find myself gravitating to better, more original movies, or at least something if it has to be so predictable that is of superior excecution. None of it is to be seen in Venom. It all comes across as: Not again the same boring storyline!Luckily there where some better action movies this year that made up for it with real action such as MI.

While it starts off slow at first, it quickly cranks up the action when Venom latches on to Eddie. Tom Hardy did a great job with the role of Eddie Brock as he brings the right amount of emotion throughout the film. The story is alright, though it does have its problems. A subplot with the Riot symbiote tends to drag on and gets confusing at some points. Another problem with the film is the action. While the action was great, I really felt like it didn't truly showed how Venom acts and I really think the film should of gotten an R rating. In the end, Venom is an very enjoyable and satisfying movie even with its few flaws. I would highly recommend this movie to people who are fans of the anti-hero or are just fans of superheroes in general. Also, if you do go see the movie, make sure you sit through the end credits if you want see a very satisfying mid credit scene ;)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I walked away thinking what a fabulous job had been done to bring good mixture of action and comedy. I really enjoyed this film and am unsure why people would have rated it down. I've heard some say the acting was sub-par, that is not something I noticed to be honest. I don't go to these types of movies expecting Oscar worthy performances, but to be entertained for an hour or so. This film achieved that easily and surpassed expectations. I even had a few laughs thrown in for good measure.
If you are on the fence about whether to see this film, I would recommend you go see it - you're not likely to regret it. Also, I'm 80% there is going to be an epic sequel sometime in the not too distant future!
-Update; I went to see the film again for a second time...still hit the spot! Great soundtrack and there's a short clip about an upcoming animation film featuring some characters from the Spider-verse. It is literally buried right at the end of the credits (would have missed it unless I had to been told wait for it, so I'm paying it forward).","75 out of 140 found this helpful.

So it was only when given the chance to watch it that I got around to it. Can't exactly claim that ""Venom"" was high on my movies to watch.First of all, well aside from it being a superhero movie, then I wasn't particularly enthralled with it being Tom Hardy having the lead role. Not much of a fan of his, to be honest. But I will say that he carried the movie quite nicely, despite having very little to work with in terms of a thoroughly-crafted script. Yeah, the storyline was fairly simplistic, and the script was almost so light-weight that it was non-existing.The special effects and CGI in the movie were adequate. They weren't the kind that have you going ""wow, that's spectacular and impressive"". So for a movie made in 2018 it felt that they cut back on the effects budget in a way.Now, I was having a bit of a hard time whether to take the movie as a serious movie, or if it was meant to be a comedy. Venom was all over the place, in terms of it being a comedy movie or a serious movie, and even had elements that bordered on horror on it. But it was sort of hard to take some of the things that Venom said seriously.I wasn't impressed by ""Venom"". And to be honest, then it would have taken very little to impress me, because I am not a fan of superhero movies and tend to avoid them. I am sure that there is a fanbase for ""Venom"" out there, but for us that aren't attuned to the superhero genre, then ""Venom"" had very little to offer in terms of entertainment, aside from being a generic action movie.","22 out of 44 found this helpful.

But I was also surprised at how much I liked the Venom/Eddie relationship. It was funny!! It would have been even better if Venom's sense of himself as a ""loser"" (Trebek voice) on his own planet/compared to Riot was more developed. The symbiote fight looked cool! That said, I liked this more than the previous (and also a bad) Venom movie, Spider-man (2007).
As for the actors, Tom Hardy is always great and always delivers but with terrible execution of this film, it was all wasted. I also like Riz Ahmed but he didn't totally fit here. That's not all on him tho... past Eddie/Venom the script really falls off. Michelle Williams is pretty good but can't save her character either. Same with Jenny Slate. The credits scene is extremely on the nose but I like the setup. That wig.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This Venom, symbiote thing could be used so well but all of the writers just used stereotypic, cliche lines and scenes instead.
That plot twist probably made many wievers happy including me, but how and why did that happen, was a lazy work. This is one of the exemples of sloppy job that writers made. There is even a lot more...

It sort of manages to be a passable buddy movie but only just, and probably due to a bonkers Tom Hardy who is clearly having the time of his life.
There's so much in the idea to have unlimited potential, and yet it's a hole-ridden, lily-white superhero film with only marginally more actual Venom than Raimi's Spider-Man 3, and all the beats of a run of a mill early superhero film.

However, I had high hopes for it because of the inclusion of Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, and Jenny Slate; all of which I am fond of. Unfortunately the cast of actors could not prevent this movie from being a bland, sloggish film that will most likely be a low point in all of their careers. One of my bigger problems with this story is that they failed to pin down what the tone of the movie was supposed to be. There were elements of romance, action, horror, and comedy strewn throughout and none of it was done particularly well. The comedy was exceptionally poor, being that actual jokes were replaced with someone just saying a curse word. I have a few gripes about Venom that I won't talk at length about including: poor CGI that culminated with a dark, hard to see fight, flat chemistry between the performers, a typical ""do bad things to do good things"" villain, below average editing, and poor story structure. But the worst element of the movie in my opinion is Eddie's character development. Eddie starts off being a certain way and never has to reconcile anything with his personality or change himself to become a better person. In the beginning he's idealistic and wants to help people, followed by a brief moment of not wanting to help people, and then being followed again by wanting to help people. He never has to face adversity and find out what he really stands for. He never has a moment where he has to reevaluate the consequences of his actions (albeit a quick scene in which he apologizes to Williams' character about something from the past). And lastly, he never has to make any sacrifices to protect what he loves or be a hero to the people. Some things I did like about Venom: Eddie and Venom's dynamic was enjoyable, an exciting opening scene, and an excellent score by the always talented Ludwig Goransson. Overall, Venom is a bland movie with some entertaining elements. It feels like it belongs in the mid 2000's rather than 2018. There isn't enough good film making and story in Venom to make it shine, but still manages to be marginally entertaining as an action blockbuster.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

Here, in this movie, the violence has been softened, so what is left to the screenplay are some ""Marvel kind jokes"".Somehow, one or another are good, but they're not enough to fullfil the plot. Having a Venom without the Spider-Man It's a bad idea, but It can be sustainable, unfortunately It's not the case here.Even having good acting scenes with Hardy and Michelle, the storytelling is too goofy and childish, the sensation is that you're watching a comedy movie.The action is cool and the photography is okay.

Venom is one of my favorite comic book characters of all time. I'm a big fan of him and felt that they had a misstep with what they did in Spider-Man 3. Tom Hardy is also an actor I like so having him take over there piqued my interest. I did miss this in the theater though and it took me awhile to finally see it.We follow Eddie Brock (Hardy) who is an investigative journalist. He is dating Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) who is a lawyer who's firm works for Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). He runs the LIFE foundation. They started out doing good things with curing cancer, but since then there have been some horrible things happening that are swept under the rug. One of these is a space mission that crashed when returning. We see an alien lifeform escape and take over the body of an EMT in Malaysia get taken over by it.Eddie goes after Drake and loses everything, including his fiancée. This causes him to spiral. Things take a turn though when a doctor who works for Drake cannot take the guilt any longer. Her name is Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate). She sneaks Eddie in and he sees a homeless woman he knows, Maria (Melora Walters). She is being kept in containment. Eddie frees her and there is something hiding within. This parasite takes him over and goes by the name of Venom. Together they must stop Drake and this other symbiote known as Riot.Now I'll admit, I've read the origins of Venom and this is a bit different. I've not read all the iterations of this character though so this could be one of the others. Growing up, I did have one of the comics about the planet of symbiotes and one of my favorite Sega Genesis games was 'Maximum Carnage'. This character being one of my favorite villains. We get to know an interesting backstory for the alien known as Venom that I cannot confirm or deny is just made here. Regardless, I can work with it since Hardy is closer to the Eddie Brock that I'm familiar with and how well he plays this character is great. It comes off as schizophrenia and I love it.What also helps here is the cast around him. Williams is an amazing actress and I was surprised to see her here. Ahmed plays a good villain. Again, not sure if he is made up for the movie or is in the comics or not. Other than that, I liked Reid Scott as Dr. Dan Lewis. It is interesting to see Slate in the role she has here. Walters and Michelle Lee are also good. I did also like the cameo at the end of Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady. It makes me excited for the sequel.This is a well-made film. I was hoping this would lean more into horror with how complicated as an anti-hero that Venom is. That's not to say this isn't brutal. I like the implications of what these symbiotes must do to survive and the effects it has on the hosts. This Venom looks more like the comic versions which is great. I'd say this is one of the better Sony made superhero films along with the most recent Spider-Man. Having Marvel working in co-production helps. There is a lot of CGI effects, but it looks good. I'll give credit there. This isn't great, but it is a solid start for me.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The symbiote loves the earth and helps Eddie in quelling the evil that will invade the earth.After seeing the unsatisfactory Venom in Sam Raimi's Spiderman movie, I think this version of Venom is pretty good. Appearing as a solo film, in terms of the storyline, this film has a fast tempo so that venom character development is felt to be lacking. Eddie's journey to join Venom didn't have a good enough impression. The fast tense of the film also gives the film suspense so that it looks boring. Venom has a story plot that is less biting and less dense. Building characters that don't perform satisfactorily from both Eddie Brock and Venom. The introduction of the symbiote is less explored to become a foreign entity. It doesn't have a good motivational picture from Riot or Drake who suddenly become an antagonist that needs to be fought. The final fight action with Riot is not memorable and too fast. Riot and Drake's character development is also too fast that we don't get sympathy for what he's doing. Overall, you'll feel that this 2-hour movie will feel fast and flat. Even so, this movie is still good in terms of action.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

For a layman like myself though, comics look overly hyperbolized and specifically crafted to entertain the simple tastes of a younger reader.Well, in this case Venom is a prime example of a comic book movie. The subtlety is nonexistent, everything is flashy and everyone a screaming archetype - of a reckless rebel, a girl next door with a sensitive soul, an unscrupulous tycoon, a scientist who suddenly grew a conscience, and of a dozen other typical comic story residents. Even the slapstick action, cheesy dialogs and horrendous overacting, so different from the ""serious"" mainstream Marvel movies, are absolutely natural for the American manga twins.So, in a sense, Venom is a very authentic example of a film made by the canons of the comic books. And it's also an example of why those canons don't work for anything destined for a screen and not paper. Because, unless you're trying to make a Looney Tunes ripoff, you need a more evenly paced approach, and even in the B-movies these days audience expects to see at least some substance. And no, generic CGI of intertwined colored phlegm and mature actresses running around in mini skirts are not the substance I mean.Come think of it, the after-credits toon puts everything into place. Venom would be just perfect... if only it was drawn and not filmed. Unfortunately, the likes of Stan Lee are too few these days, and they had to make due with what Hollywood could spare. What a shame.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I love Tom Hardy, although I have no connection with the character of Venom I do find him very cool (yes I am not an expert), and it was going to be about an anti-villain, so what could go wrong? I remember when this movie just came out, there was such a large gap between audiences who loved it and audiences who were just bashing it out of hatred. I myself did not see this in a theater so I waited untill I could watch it at home. I went into this movie with very low expectations because it just got so much hate. Now I have seen the movie...and I kind of have to disagree with the haters on this one.I found this to be a very fun, entertaining sci-fi action movie. Okay positives first. The thing I liked the most without a doubt is the interaction between Tom Hardy and Venom, this was really fun and entertaining to watch. The jokes were all mostly good and I found myself quite invested in their relationship. This also brings me to my next positive that I honestly never saw coming: they spend a lot of time on the characterization of Tom Hardy, and it felt great. This isn't a movie where everything has to happen so fast that we don't care about our characters, no they really give him a lot of time before all of the stuff goes down and I really like that. The action is okay, it's not special, it's just good. The special effects are well done, although sometimes very cartoonish but I kind of expected that.Now the negatives. This isn't a perfect movie by far. My first complaint is pretty much the opening scene and the final scene. They are really rushed and especially the opening is not that inviting. The pacing luckily does improve fast and stays good for the large majority of the movie. The villain is pretty weak, actually very weak. The performance wasn't all that great but also the character felt like one big blob of cliché, it was something I had already seen dozens of times. Now the PG-13 rating is there and it does not feel right for the most part. This definitely should have been a rated-R movie, but because it's Sony and they looooove money that wasn't an option I guess. Of course it also sets up a sequel, which is something I am seriously getting tired of but in the end I'm just accepting it...Guys, this actually is a very fun and entertaining movie. Yes, the violence isn't as violent as you would like and the villain is very weak, but in the end I could see through all of that and just enjoy a fun relation between Venom and Tom Hardy.I give it a solid 7.2/10!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Venom appeared on the big screen one, in Spider-Man 3. It was bad. He was too small, too scrawny, they messed up his voice, and he had too little screen time. Venom is one of the most popular comic book villains of all time, and he's certainly a good choice for his own movie. Giving him his own movie made up for Spider-Man 3, although it's not really the best movie. It's not terrible, but it's not great. It follows a similar story to Eddie Brock's in Spider-Man 3. He's a reporter who gets fired after he crosses the line, struggles to get by, and finds the symbiote.Tom Hardy plays both Eddie Brock and Venom, and he's never bad in a role. He plays both parts very well, and there's an interesting relationship between the two. It's similar to the relationship between Gollum and Smeagol in Lord of the Rings, where they inhabit the same body but are still two distinct personalities with differing beliefs and objectives. The symbiote is somewhat like the One Ring in that regard. The dialogue between the two is also occasionally hilarious. Venom himself also looked great. He looked almost exactly like he did in the comics, with the gooey skin that looks almost liquid. After the disappointment of Spider-Man 3, even though that was over 10 years ago, it was fantastic to see Venom go on a rampage like we'd expect him to. All of the action scenes were great, especially the final battle. And for as much as this is a Venom movie, it's an Eddie Brock movie. While it take a while for the symbiote to show up, Tom Hardy nails the role of Eddie Brock.There are, however, some downsides. The writing is just bad. The ""turd in the wind"" line became a meme for a reason. Aside from that, I don't like the idea of Venom becoming a good guy of sorts, having to stop Riot from bringing more symbiotes to Earth. Venom is one of the most iconic supervillains in comic history and having him play this hero role minutes after eating people on the street was out of place and out of nowhere. Even the movie's tagline was ""the world has enough superheroes."" It also makes Spidey's absence all the more noticeable, although this movie didn't need him. The story it decided to tell probably did. The rest of the characters really aren't anything to report on. You've got the ex-girlfriend, her new boyfriend, the secretly evil genius, and the doctor who knows something's up with him. Pretty standard stuff. Venom is a pretty mixed bag. It's not super serious stuff, and it's not really meant to be. It's a fun popcorn movie. If you like superhero movies, you'll probably enjoy it.By the way, the post-credits scene is awful. They try to set up Carnage as the next villain, which is a lateral move, but Woody Harrelson puts on this ugly wig to play him. He looks like Sideshow Bob. If that's what's going to happen in the sequel, they'd better at least change the way he looks without the symbiote. He just can't go through the movie like that.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film was produced and distributed by Sony with little to no input by Marvel Studios and saw it on opening weekend.After a space probe containing symbiotic lifeforms crashes in Malaysia, one escapes while the others are intact. The corporation belonging to the probe is now being investigated by journalist Eddie Brock (Hardy) who botches an interview with the corporation's CEO (Ahmed). Trouble ensues, leading Eddie getting one of the symbiotes inside him named Venom.The acting and story are somewhat subpar with the film. Tom Hardy leads with a questionable accent but is mostly made up with Eddie and Venom's relationship. The CGI is nothing spectacular but perfectly captures what it sets out to do. That and the film sometimes changes tones to a comedy which worked for me but was still jarring.Venom has done well at the box office, setting records for October and whatnot and has received divisive reception. I can't speak for either side of the critics or fanboys since I found the film good but not great. It was not overall boring and there is plenty of fun to be had with it.Overall, I give Venom a 6/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Firstly venom looks great in this one.. the design is mostly on point and the cgi looked fine, nothing extraordinary but i was expecting it to look a lot worse and i'm kind of of impressed that i liked it that much. Sure the big white spider symbol is missing (such as every connection with spiderman) but it didn't exactly distracted me from enjoying the rest of the representation. But i have to give major props to Tom Hardy because he is truly talented and he proves it once more with venom, far from his best work but he can do no wrong. Loved the way venom and Eddie interacted and that it had some pretty funny elements not all of them landed but at least half of them were good.
As for the tone of the film it's a little messy going from being funny to a wannabe horror movie with mystery. The trailers were not even close of what we got. I expected more darker moments and tone overall.
One of my biggest complaints i have with this is that i needed to see venom sooner and more, i get that it's an origins film and they need to establish on Eddie's character but the whole story wasn't that interesting to begin with so the film before venom showed up felt that it was dragging and when we finally have venom it's only for short periods of time but can't deny that they're still effective and enjoyble moments.
The villain Carlton Drake on the other hand was a total let down and it could have been so much more. I knew it from thw trailers that he was going to be the one-dimensional character that is very bad for absolute no reason and when he finally has the symbiote attached to him it's cool but it felt extremely rushed with moments that were obviously missing.
Michelle Williams plays the girlfriend.. yes she is that character and nothing more.. she does nothing to the whole movie. We can totally erase her and would have no impact on the story. It's a sheme because she is really a great actress. Plus I can't imagine her being with a guy like Tom Hardy.
Overall Venom is far from the greatest super-hero (in this case anti-hero) film but if you avoid and don't think about all the problems it's a basic origins story with many entertaining moments and miles better from the one we got from Topher Grace in Spiderman 3.

Both performances are very energetic and fun to watch develop.+There are quite a few good action sequences, lots of funny banter, and a couple of interesting ideas here and there. The flow of the movie is also fast, so you won't get bored.-The film is also sadly very generic - bad guys doing bad things, love story focus, and plot holes all around. Oh, and it's very dark at places probably to hide bad CGI. So if you want something a little bit more thought out or different, this movie is probably not for you.Technical - 7/10

Let me answer that real quick: NO!Buuuuuut... I read the critics and went in with very low expectations. Judging by the critics I thought this was going to be bad. Like Fantastic Four or Spider-Man 3 level of bad. But I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. It's by far not as bad as critics make it out to be. Yeah it could have been about 20 minutes longer to make the overall story more complete and maybe it could have had a little more action and maybe even better choreographed action sequences. The villain could have been more engaging and so on but let me say this.. this movie is being judged based on a marvel cinematic universe which is 20+ movies deep with more background and complete superhero development and story. This movie cannot compete on that level. This is a introduction movie. Nothing less, nothing more. So hopefully they'll get the second part right and get right to the point.

I already thought the movie looked awful and the writing from the trailers was atrocious, but surely it couldn't of been worse than all the other terrible movies I've seen this year, right? Venom is a mess. It is only able to be enjoyed ironically. It feels INCREDIBLY dated. If this movie came out 10 years ago like it should have then I could probably excuse it, but it decided to come out in 2018. The writing is atrocious and it has one of the most inconsistent tones ever. Is it meant to be a horror/thriller? Or is it meant to be a comedy? Having comedy and darkness spread throughout your movie is fine but with Venom it just feels like they had no idea what tone to give it. Eddie Brock is also a massive moron in this movie and I'm just so disappointed with the fact that there will never be a good movie to use Venom well. Spider-Man 3 was utter garbage and used Venom poorly, and now this movie, with it's ONE GOAL of trying to make Venom work in a movie, fails on every level. Please don't see this if you want a thrilling and serious movie. This isn't that. This is a top notch comedy act done by Tom Hardy's terrible casting for this role.","98 out of 247 found this helpful.

The action, the humor, the plot, everything fell right into place and gave way to a very entertaining movie. If I have to mention any cons, it'd be the change of heart that Venom has toward the end that's not sufficiently explained. Can't tell what it is without spoilers, though, so I'm gonna leave it at that. Oh and CGI fights suck, but I liked the incorporation of the actors to the scene here!

Deadpool brake the ice. Venom is a darker figure, but has a PG-13 tag to attract a wider audience. The movie (unfortunately) has very little touch points with the comics and I think there will be a lot of objections here. Also since this is the origin story, I miss more minutes to tell the story a little bit better, and I read that they cut off some 30 minutes of film and sometimes you can feel it. Hardy is therefore excellent, dominating as Brock / Venom faces, wicked, even fun when it's needed. There was no support from other actors, but I blame scenario that is not good and it has illogicality.
The film is not superb, it is not a top, but I think it has served purpose, fun action, depending on earnings, will provide one or two sequels. Critics are a little overdone, definitely worth a look at the movie even if you're a hardcore fan of Venom (like me), watch without prejudice.

At various times, it tries its hand at horror, slapstick comedy, self-aware comedy, romance and drama. That's an ambitious combination that would make any movie difficult to take seriously, let alone one with a wisecracking alien blob monster.The chilling opening scene shows a private space exploration mission return to Earth with samples of alien symbiotes. Shockingly, something goes wrong, one sample escapes and jumps between human hosts, searching for the best fit. It's a chilling sequence that sets the tone for a much darker story than what actually follows. In a jarringly clunky transition, the story jumps to Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy doing his idea of a New York accent) and his fiancé, Anne (Michelle Williams) living happily in San Francisco. Hardy goes all in on playing the anxious, twitchy guy who is great at his job but is also kind of a loser and has the most peculiar gait. He walks the way someone would walk if you told them, ""hey, walk in the weirdest way possible, like in a way that no one would ever actually walk."" It's completely transfixing. Eddie's awkward walk aligns with his natural tendency to create awkward situations. He is a successful reporter who is known for pushing boundaries, so it's only too obvious what he will do when interviewing shady billionaire, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), for what is supposed to be a puff piece. In another less-than-stellar transition, the timeline fast-forwards six months and shows Eddie's life in shambles. This might have been affecting if any of this felt earned, but certain essential scenes are absent and were likely trimmed in editing to put the final runtime under two hours. Choices like these give the entire film a rushed, erratic feel of something that had ideas but didn't know how to piece them together into a fluid story arc.Meanwhile, all this has happened and still Venom has yet to make an appearance. The movie spends too much time on nonessential plot points and takes too long to reach the most compelling and entertaining parts. In other words, the movie is called Venom, so put Venom in the movie. When Venom finally shows up, the movie finally has life. Sort of. Venom and Eddie exchange banter that occasionally delivers winning punchlines, a few of which caused outbursts of laughter throughout the theater. That's great. The problem is the dozens of other jokes that were met with crickets or confusion. This might be due to Venom's abrupt language advancements. He quickly evolves from monosyllabic commands of ""food!"" to offering insightful romantic advice. It's another case of unearned plot and character development. But the worst parts of the movie are the incomprehensible and nearly unwatchable action sequences that didn't follow any discernable rules of continuity or visual logic. I didn't know where to look and half the time I didn't even know what I was looking at. That's the downside of fight scenes that rely too heavily on CGI. The climactic fight scene involves a bizarre swirling tornado of Venom and another blob monster that is meant to resemble a warrior-like battle, but the comically wide-open mouths and tongue swinging turns the display into something that looks more like a sloppy teenage make out session.It's a dumb scene in a dumb movie that never quite figures itself out. Marvel has made many great movies over the past 10 years. Venom is not one of them.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

And as we know the idea was done in Spiderman 3 (2007). I'm weary of movies where someone says: 'You look like **it' (Tom Hardy like every other male lead that's accused in a movie of looking 'like **it' is a handsome man); 'You look like **it' is a lazy attempt at grit (and possibly humour) but audiences aren't paying to see real life; we go to movies like Venom for big budget, comic book thrills and Venom delivers but a line like 'You look like **it', is indicative of mediocrity; compare it to Christopher Reeve's Superman movies i.e. They had real substance and drama; it's a fair comparison because at one point in Superman 3 (1983) the man of steel turn's selfish 'n bad (negatively effected by Kryptonite) so the idea that Superman has a dark side is explored, as it is in the first Christopher Reeve Superman (1978) where he kind of acts selfishly by breaking Kryptonian law: 'It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history' to save Louis Lane's life. Venom's about alter ego; a heroes dark side; conflict between being goody-goody and being bad (but good and heroic). Point is: it was done better in Superman. Venom's repetitive; the same things keep happening; characters get infected with the Venom symbiote; it happens to the ambulance driver in Malaysia in the beginning of the film, it happens to a little girl, it happens to the test subjects that baddie (Riz Ahmed) cruelly experiments on, it happens the protagonists girlfriend (Michelle Williams) who uses her venomous powers (or who's used by the venom symbiote) to save hero/anti-hero Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); it happens to the chief baddie himself who's symbiote ends up fighting with Tom Hardy's symbiote. Not enough variety! Venom's obviously reminiscent of Spiderman 3 (2007) but also the first Tobey Maguire Spiderman (2002) which toward the end had a fight on a bridge above water at night (as does Venom); other movies Venom's reminiscent of: Fantastic 4, The Hidden (1987) and Fallen (1998) and Iron Man. Venom's a loud, fast-paced ride.

There was a time that they wouldn't have released Venom. An obscure character except to the Spider-Man and Marvel fans, not truly a good guy, relies heavily on CGI to make him like the comic--not likely a movie they would've released in years past. But now Marvel has built such a good brand, much like Apple, Google, Nike, etc., they can boldly release nearly any character with a certain amount of confidence.Venom had a bit of a weak storyline to it but it was good once they got into the meat and potatoes. It was a bit contrived in order to get Venom merged with Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) but they did a good job making the audience forget how we'd gotten to the action. Venom has staying power like most Marvel movies.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

But it's definitely very enjoyable!Tom Hardy was fantastic acting as always. Venom was badass, the action scenes were great and dynamic, shot very well too. The film takes a while to get into, but around half way it starts progressing really nicely. Humour here and there and a generally likeable cast! Obviously the film isn't perfect but critics have it wrong this time. The plot has a few weaknesses, the villian is kind of uncharismatic and it's a bit slow at times but otherwise a great entertaining watch, and definitely a far better big screen representation of Venom compared to Spiderman 3!","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

I thought, it'd be a great, gritty anti-hero movie.After BvS and Suicide Squad I tempered my expectations, I expected nothing. Maybe I was in the closet, when it came to my expectations.It's an extremely generic action movie, it seems cool for a few minutes, has an Alien type of vibe when it starts, but as it rolls along nothing really unfolds much and maybe it doesn't really need to, because Eddie having the symbiote would be interesting enough. But the movie doesn't do anything with it. The ""edgy confrontational"" reporter from ""Nu-Yooock"" is what you get, which I guess was to be expected, judging by the trailers. And it just goes on as this sort of cartoonish buddy-cop flick.There is no interesting duality to the Eddie Brock/Venom character, it's not even that violent. It often feels like a boy and his dog flick, the symbiote spites Eddie in very generic comedic ways, helps fix his relationships, even starts to like other characters. There's nothing NOT banal or generic about Eddie, the villain and his plans, the symbiotes and ""their plan"". You can't even spoil this movie. You've seen it. Trust me.You saw the symbiote talking in the trailer and comparing how that was shown in the Spider-man:TAS, it just dawns on you how not subtle it is. It adds another layer of lame, the opposite of ""show, don't tell"". Couple of elements of blatant expositions here and there as well.If it were anymore toothless, thoughtless and generic, you'd probably have Eddie showing Venom a hip-hop song and then maybe at the end teach it to get jiggy or whatever.The SFX were cool. Venom looked cool, which is probably the solitary idea behind this project.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

As a horror movie, it failed because there was poor tension, creepiness and no gore despite the potential. As a comedy it failed because it was not really funny for me even though some Venom fans laughed at his every line (why?). The action parts were too busy, chaotic and hard to follow, especially when Venom was involved. Tom Hardy really tried hard and emoted a lot, sometimes too much, but ended up looking goofy and dumb too often. The events of the plot felt rushed, and sometimes downright stupid. In fact, repeatedly, the behaviour of the characters didn't seem believable. Overall, this movie irritated me and reminded me of bad, older superhero movies (even though Venom is no superhero, I know). I watched this at an advance screening in a full theatre, and there was no applause at the end.Rating: 3 out of 10 (poor)P.S. For Marvel fans, there's no real connection to the rest of the universe, so you can easily skip it or wait for home viewing.","55 out of 136 found this helpful.

This is your basic superhero with CGI and explosions action movie with a hero vs villain storyline with a love interest on the side. 
The tone of the movie is however best suited for a teenage audience due to some of the violence and language used, its not a PG movie but certainly not as extreme as Deadpool. 
What this isn't however is a massively funded blockbuster such as Infinity Wars, its more on the level of Spiderman or the AntMan movies. Which is not a bad thing, this is a nice 90 min movie, no two or three hour snoozefest which spends too much time on backstory...
Tom Hardy is well versed in playing crazy characters as anyone who has seen Bronson can attest. Unlike his role in the Batman movies his acting skills aren't being blunted by a mask so in this role we get to see him go full on Tom Hardy. And it works. 
The action scenes are also good and the CGI doesn't look bad either. I have no idea what some critics expect but it could be that after Infinity that people are simply spoiled and now expect that to be the current standard for all superhero movies from now on. It simply cant be.
So who exactly doesn't like the movie? Professional critics, comic fans who maybe have a different idea in their mind how the character should be and Lady Ga Ga fans out to promote her movie at the expense of others? For everyone else just after some action, humour and excitement this is worth your time and money. Looking forward to any sequels as long as they keep Tom Hardy.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Even things that are relevant to the plot meander along in a way that simply left me confused, not in the ""slowly unraveling mystery"" kind of way but the ""alright, get to it already"" kind of way. Then when it finally does Get To It, I find the action hard to enjoy because by that time I'm bored out of my mind thinking ""Jeez, FINALLY."" I find Venom's character very likeable and Eddie's character to be deeply developed and realistic , but every other character in the movie serve as shallow, stereotypical plot devices that are hardly explored.On the plus side, it has a good soundtrack.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Eddie Brock is a Bay Area investigative journalist whose life is falling apart after he tries to take on a major bio-engineering corporation.

Intriguing at first, but gradually goes downhill with poor plotting, thin characters, silly dialogue, and cartoony special effects that add no excitement to the proceedings. A well-cast Hardy bounces all over the place with his manic energy, but co-star Williams is given little to do, and director Fleischer never finds the right tone for the narrative. **","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Firstly is because the lack of special effects and action scenes. The story is boring, yet can be guessed so easily. Then there are many plots jumped without any explanation, so that only Marvel big fans could understand the main story. Besides, the main story about the combination of alien and human, explored with gimmick stories. Well, this is fun at first, but at then end we just spend so much time without any feedback of the whole point, not surprising, yet entertaining. The Venom character played by Tom Hardy is very good, but other actors had ordinary acting, just like a typically flick action. I have been waiting Venom so long, but when I watched it, I feel dissappointed. I hope there will be new Venom with new film makers crew.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"6","/10","FLAWED, but still FUN:)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4380092/?ref_=tt_urv","bodhi-13262","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66111593/?ref_=tt_urv","6 October 2018","Ever since his live-action debut in 2007's 'Spider-Man 3', fans have been eagerly waiting for the character of Eddie Brock/Venom to be redeemed. Now that the infamous anti-hero has his own self-titled film, does it deliver and surpass its predecessor? 1. Though this is a SPOILER-FREE review, it should be mentioned that Spider-Man/Peter Parker is in no way involved in the story/overall plot. The film makes no mention or subtly implies any connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Tom Holland's version of the titular wall-crawler. The plot of 'VENOM' begins with the obtainment of extraterrestrial 'Symbiotes' by the shady 'LIFE' foundation and its CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Just like the comics, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is an investigative and cocky reporter with a nose for controversial stories, hence leading to his run-in with the LIFE foundation and the 'Venom' symbiote. The film has a relatively strong start and I was impressed by how much I was enjoying the build-up. Although you may have to wait approximately 45mins to see Venom's full appearance, everything leading up to that is still quite enjoyable.2. Considering how much of Venom's origin is derived from Spider-Man himself, the film actually found a way to have the character stand on his own two feet in a believable way. Despite there being some surprisingly funny moments, the overall script was in need of a ""punch-up"" re-write. It seems more effort was spent on the dialogue and banter between Eddie and Venom rather than the rest of characters. Riz Ahmend ends up being yet another generic ""mustache-twirling"" villain with an agenda that is never made clear and Michelle Williams (Anne Weying) serves very little to no real purpose other than being Eddie's former love interest that he still pines over, On the other hand, Jenny Slate (Dr. Skirth) does a better job with the material she has despite having minor screen-time. So not a terrible script, but nothing worth mentioning either. 3. Once we finally see Venom on screen, he looks fantastic. The CGI was cool and the design of the character appears like it was lifted directly from the comic-book pages. Tom Hardy also voices Venom and it is quite hilarious the way both he and Eddie have their back and forth. The biggest issue would not only be character motivations but the overall climax. As seen in the recent trailers, there are multiple symbiotes with varying agendas. This aspect is never fully explored and the film rushes past this to get to the action, which (unfortunately) falters during the climax. For one thing, the editing in this movie is completely choppy, especially during the symbiote fight at the end. The camera is too close to the characters fighting that its hard to tell who's who sometimes. Every action sequence prior was done so well that the climax ultimately was a huge let-down.'Venom' in no way deserves the harsh critiques from both IMDB nor Rotten Tomatoes, because it is truly better than what its being portrayed as. The film has flaws but (in some ways) the good outweighs the bad. Lower your expectations, leave your baggage at the door, give the film a chance, stick around for the fantastic post-credit scene and I guarantee you'll have an enjoyable time for the very least.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

One the one hand the script was sloppy, the plot predictable, and the film took a long time explaining itself.... poorly. A few of the performances felt somewhat 'phoned in', and the film's tone was all over the place. It did make me laugh though, and some of the conflict between Brock and his alien parasite was brilliant - Hardy did a great job of acting the dual role. There were genuine moments of brilliance in the film, but then there were also many ameteur moments too. The final battle could have been better - as it is its a bit of a confusing CGI mess of tentacles and slime where it's hard to see what's happening. Overall I wouldn't say the film is bad as such - if you leave your brain at the door it is fairly entertaining. Hopefully they employ some better script-writers for the inevitable sequel...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"2","/10","A tedious, boring comic book film that wastes so much fantastic source material.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4384046/?ref_=tt_urv","rustonreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur78526769/?ref_=tt_urv","7 October 2018","I distinctly remember seeing Venom for the first time in the 90's animated Spider-Man series. I still own the VHS of The Venom Saga, which was the 3 part storyline that introduced the black suit and Venom to the show. Venom quickly became my favourite comic book villain. I wore out the VHS (I still own it for pure nostalgia) and sought out further Venom stories to devour. First appearing at the very end of The Amazing Spider-Man #299 (with #300 being his first full story), Venom immediately became a fan favourite and has since featured in countless classic storylines that have cemented his iconic status in comic book history. Sam Raimi's troublesome (yet over-hated) Spider-Man 3 introduced the first live action Venom to the big screen, with mixed results to say the least. Following the announcement of a stand alone Venom film (without Spider-Man and separate from the MCU), the general response from fans was confusion. Spider-Man plays a crucial role in Venom's origin, so his exclusion from the film felt like a critical step in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, Spider-Man's absence from the film is the very least of its problems. Journalist Eddie Brock (Hardy) has hit rock bottom. Following his investigation into the secret experimental trials taking place within the shady Life Foundation, he swiftly loses both his job as well as his relationship with district attorney Anne Weying (Williams). However, Brock soon finds himself ""bonding"" with an alien symbiote from another world, forging an odd alliance with the alien parasite to become the malevolent beast Venom. Together they must put aside their differences to stop Carlton Drake (Ahmed), the charming yet psychopathic leader of the Life Foundation, who believes he can use the symbiotes to upgrade mankind into a superior species. Venom is a disaster. Nothing in the film works. The script is badly paced with scenes that feel completely rushed and lazily constructed, and the storyline feels painfully underdeveloped. It all feels very first draft, and all sense of character development is sorely lacking. Hardy struggles to convey a solid Eddie Brock and gives a strange and sometimes goofy performance that does the character no justice whatsoever, and Ahmed's Carlton Drake feels disappointingly one dimensional. The motivations behind his villain plans are never made clear, resulting in one of the least interesting comic book villains in some time. A fundamental lack of chemistry between Hardy and Williams weakens the film. I never bought into their relationship and felt as though it added very little, if nothing at all, to the overall storyline. Although Venom himself looks fantastic on screen, it takes too long for him to finally make an appearance. Weirdly, the film introduces a strange ""buddy comedy"" element to Brock's relationship with the symbiote, resulting in some pretty awkward forced humour that feels as though it was injected into the film for the sheer sake of it. Unfortunately, the action sequences are also dull and uninspiring, and even the final battle feels criminally anticlimactic.The bottom line with Venom is that it's boring. It doesn't try to tell a good story, nor is it interested in making a faithful adaptation. Audiences who aren't familiar with Venom or his classic comic book storylines may enjoy the film as dumb popcorn entertainment. For those invested in Venom as a character, don't bother. Venom is a tedious viewing experience that makes me wonder just how they could have got it so catastrophically wrong.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Previously seen in Spiderman, Venom now has his (or should I say its) own film and franchise, yes franchise because you can guarantee there will be other Venom films but will it be a franchise any good or a franchise too far? As usual I will try not to give any spoilers away but this will be very difficult to do, so get ready, hold onto your seats because............Lazy writing, the only way I can describe it is to use another recent film which suffered from the same thing and it spoiled the film, yes it's Batman vs Superman.In that film you had the 2 heroes who for some unknown reason didn't get on. Now we all know that Superman could have crushed Batman and not even broken out in a sweat, not to mention the reason why they both suddenly become friends, because their mom's had the same first name! Venom suffers from this same lazy writing, why Venom decides too stay and fight.......... Oh come on, credit us audiences with some intelligence please! In essence the film is good, not great, special effects are excellent as usual and Tom Hardy is brilliant as the bumbling confused anti hero but the big fight is way too short, the story seems to drag out the film which would have been better at 90 mins not 120, so just too long. The voice of Venom is instantly recognisable as optimus prime which I personally found strange to get my head around. Enjoyable watch, suffering from lazy writing and the big fight way too easy.

Reading the reviews for this movie are the final proof I need;10 out of 10 reviews with over the top title lines like; ""Best movie ever"" or ""A masterpiece"". Hundreds and hundreds of them in which the reviewer writes a single paragraph, or even less at times, that does nothing more than tout how great the movie is and that you should ignore the critics and go see it. Something stinks here folks.And this movie convinces me because it got a whole lot of those 10/10 reviews and it is absolutely terrible. I mean, just awful. And yes, I know that here are a lot of brain dead drones out there who think any superhero movie is the equivalent of classic literature and gush over all of them, however awful they are. But not enough of them to account for so many 10's for such a bad movie.Why was it bad? Where do I start;Tom Hardy's character came across as a learning impaired teenager with a room temperature IQ. He talked liked a dolt, his actions throughout the movie made no sense, unless he was in fact at dolt. He was supposed to be a crack reporter yet his reporting style was atrocious and his sense of what reporters actually do was utterly absent. For a really good actor his performance was really bad.Michelle Williams; not even sure why she was in this movie unless it was for a paycheck. She was totally miscast and just not believable at all in her role. She couldn't pull of the funny bits (or what the director thought was funny) and she had zero chemistry with Hardy.The villain was about as villainous as a cranky high school kid. His actions in the movie were so illogical and senseless as to be stupid. You never understood what his motivation could possibly be because he didn't seem to know himself. And his staff were the most moronic bunch of scientists and doctors to appear on film since...well, since forever. As illogical and unmotivated as their boss was they were even more so. They were a bunch of sheep following along whatever he did. Oh, except for one of them, the woman who decided to turn whistleblower to Hardy's character then proceeded to do it in the most idiotic way possible. She may as well have come to work with a sign around her neck telling everyone it was her who let Hardly into the facility. Then she just sat in her office and waited to be killed. No one is that clueless.Humor; there was none even though the director and writer tried to inject it into the movie at every turn. Every single attempt fell so flat you could hear the thud in the theatre. The banter between Hardy's character and Venom sounded like the ramblings of two twelve year old's trying to be clever and failing miserably at it. It was immature and forced and just not funny. Michelle Williams character was just not clever, every time she tired to be edgy it was just embarrassing to watch. Trying to be Deadpool when you've already put together a putrid film is never going to go well.And finally, the CGI is this movie was truly awful. When I saw the previews I thought Venom looked like something from a kids Saturday morning cartoon show and assumed that in the movie it would be better. It wasn't, it still looked like a kids cartoon show. Venom was totally unbelievable as a real live entity, he just simply looked like a cartoon. And the non-threatening villain at the end even more so. They looked like special effects from a 80's or 90's movie only worse. Just absolutely terrible, I'd say it ruined the movie except that the movie was already ruined before Venom even made his first appearance.This is at best a mediocre children's movie, and I'm being kind. So yes, by all means DO believe the critics and avoid this train wreck at all cost.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Most of the action sequences are good, the performances are convincing, some special effects do not work at all but most are good, the CGI is good, one negative thing is the ease with things are solved, but despite that, it is a good action movie with a compelling script.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The acting from Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed was very good. I was a bit disappointed with Michelle Williams she has certainly done better work in the past but her acting wasnt terrible. The strange thing was that some of the supporting actors almost seemed like amateurs, stilted lines and little emotion. Very strange for a big blockbuster movie.The script was similar, on the one hand you had some funny lines, some interesting development of Brock as a lovable guy deep down but a bit of a loser. On the other hand some of the speeches they gave to Riz Ahmeds character were really poor and just provided no sense that this was a three dimensional character with their own motivations. It was like they were trying to make him out to be a Martin Shkreli character but really didnt capture the motivations.The action scenes were fine, there was some well choreographed scenes but they were not anything you wont have seen before. I think most disappointingly though was the fact that Venom is supposed to be the quintessential anti-hero, not good, just not really evil. That didnt come across at all. Overall this was a fine superhero movie, not a classic, not bad, perfectly enjoyable. You probably wont really remember it much in a few years though.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I won't go into the cgi, fight sequence, or source material because these things aren't really what mattered to me; I am the wife to a man who wanted to check this movie out, and someone who enjoys the mcu movies: this movie just annihilated all my expectations and I loved every minute of it. Props to Hardy and Williams, especially, for great performances. Hardy brings an unexpected amount of humor into his role and Williams manages to elevate the usual gf role. I appreciate that this movie is so different, tonally, than other super hero movies.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

It was worth the wait of eleven years as the character has been redeemed.Tom Hardy is hard not to like, he is a wonderful talent and his accent was amazing! His performance was amazing, Mr Hardy had to portray a difficult role that any actor would struggle to perform. Acting as two different characters in the same scene is very hard and was worth the practice as the outcome was amazing.Although this film is not officially part of the MCU it has been said by both Sony and Marvel Entertainment that he will crossover with Spider-Man at some point. This will be a very anticipated film when announced as the last time we saw this battle was eleven years ago.The acting in the film was very good but I had one problem with the film, I realised that Eddie and most of the city are unaware of aliens. If this film is meant to be close to the MCU then how can it be possible if no one knows that aliens exist after the events of Avengers Assemble (2012).One other small problem I had with the film was how rushed the first act was and the character development was not as good as it could have been. After we see Venom connect to Eddie it improved but the first act was still a problem, in my opinion.Overall I would recommend seeing this film but do not expect a perfect superhero film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Albeit with some changes and ""creative"" re-writes, this is an origin story of how Eddie Brock takes on the symbiotic alien referred to as Venom which gives him superhuman powers. Dark themes and adult content make this stand out from other Marvel films and that because this isn't a Marvel film, it's Sony - they bought the rights to a load of characters before the MCU was a thing and it feels like they're trying to use the rights before they lose the contracts. That's why as well as Venom you'll see other characters from Marvel appear in Sony films over the next few years.I have mixed feelings about this film. I enjoyed it, but I had to forget everything else I knew about the character while watching it. There was plenty of action and some tongue-in-cheek dark humour. Tom Hardy did a decent job as Eddie Brock/ Venom. I was a little let down that the story seemed like other origin stories that have been committed to celluloid previously - particularly with (spoiler) the other symbiotes that must be defeated here - kind of like Antman when he has to fight another antish-man (Yellowjacket), or Hulk fighting another Hulk, a super soldier fighting another super soldier, or an Iron Man fighting another Iron Man. It's not original is it - but hey, the formula brings in money.The CGI in the film is quite heavy. It was decent enough though; it didn't look too cheesy or fake for most of the film but there were times. Probably the best praise about this film that I can add to my review, while I had mixed feelings, my missus loved it. Admittedly the film could have been better, but it could have also been a lot worse too.

I dislike the save the world, bunnies and rainbows feel everything from Antman to Avengers has. With Sony doing something a little darker I was all in! We've seen other successes in non-Disney productions of Marvel characters like Logan, and Deadpool.  The only real complaint I have with the film are the special effects. Non essential special effects seem cheap, one such case deals with a rocket during the opening scene. However, when the special effects come to the main character, Venom, they are done perfectly well. Although it wouldn't change my overall grade more consistency in the special effects department could have increased the films overall feel. Where this film really strives is with the proformance provided by star Tom Hardy. For most of the film we see the struggle to stay human. That sadness that endures, and the hatred of Venom. The struggle between light and dark is exemplified through Tom/Venom, with a delightful conclusion. In other superhero films the hero usually doesn't go through such a drastic shift, and so the role doesn't require that extra effort in acting. The film is also getting a lot of flack for being a movie that belongs ""in the early 2000s"". While this point can be argued it is nice to get away from the cookie cutter format Disney repeatedly puts out. This story does not follow a group of unlikely heros banded together to save the world from an evil with a successful outcome just in the nick of time. This story focuses on 1 man and the pain he endures and overcomes. Venom is a nice change of pace and is just what comic fans need.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Critics are idiots that don't appreciate mainstream media and don't know how to enjoy a movie for what it is. Now that's out of the way, let's begin the review.Tom Hardy was FANTASTIC. The way he spoke, walked, acted and facial gestures was so, so good. And that's just him as Eddie Brock. Hardy as Venom was extremely awesome and exciting. Tom Hardy played the character extremely well and is exactly like the character from the comics. It's as if the director ripped the character from the comic page and plopped it on the screen.The movie itself was hilarious. Eddies and Venoms banter between eachother was really well done and would love to see more of it. Most of the jokes did land for me which is a win win. Mainly the dark humour of Venom and Tom Hardy's Incredible performance kept this film alive.I would also like to say the CGI was Outstanding. The way the symbiyote transformed round Tom Hardy was so well done and a pleasure to see on screen every time it happened. Another positive about the movie was the action. Some of the action was the best action I've seen in a superhero movie. And that's saying something.One grudge I would have on the movie though is the final battle between Venom and Riot. It's not very exciting or climatic. It just looks like two blobs of ink flying at eachother. You can't really distinguish them apart. Other than that, the action was spot on.I thought Riz Almend as the villain was great and creepy. I think maybe it would have been better if the final battle was so short though. The story also went in too quickly and didn't make much sense but other than that the story played together nicely and I don't think this Venom-Verse needs Spider-Man at all.One last thing I would like to say is stick around for the credits. The are two cracked after credits scenes that get me really excited for the sequel and future Venom-Verse Projects.Definitely go out and See Venom Now!!!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He's a loser. I love him.""Eddie and venom are your loser douchy friends who know they're losers but are actively trying to get better and enjoy their life.

I was so hyped for this movie. It's almost guaranteed it will be a great blockbuster movie.The movie contains great acting skills by Hardy and he really suits well as Venom. The movie delivers amazing action combined with a believable plot and humor. It reflects and shows the person Eddie who lost everything just like in the comics. The point in his life where he becomes a loser. I also can give credits to the animations. They teased us in a very smart way with the first trailer where you don't see Venom at all. So the hype was real tho. I can really advise everyone who ever loved Venom and grew up with cartoons and comics of Spider-Man to watch the movie. It's worth it.The only two minus points I have to admit is it seems like the movie is a bit too short. And my friend told me today the director just cut out scene material around 40 minutes which was told by Hardy himself. I just don't get it. Is it maybe because of the fact the movie might be too brutal and get a FSK 18 Patch ?!?! So I hope they deliver those erased scenes in a directors cut edition. The other negative point is that it was in 3D. I'm not a fan of 3D, but to be honest it wasn't that annoying. They force you in cinemas to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D !All in all I give it 10/10 I laughed many times, had fun to watch the movie. Not even a second you could say wow it's boring. WATCH THE CREDITS YOU'LL SEE AN AMAZING EXTRA SCENE :)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now while it's not anywhere close to being a classic, it has that same sort of subversive feel that you get when you watch Daredevil on Netflix for the first time. It's a bit rough, but worth the effort.One thing I have to admit is that the first half is a little on the slow side, but the second half just disappears. Seriously, one minute I'm thinking I'd made a mistake and should have waited for the bluray and then then I'm left wanting more. Brock and Venom make a great double act, it's like if the Hulk had Cujo as a pet. All Venom really wants is to eat things, everything looks delicious, and Brock is reeling him in all the time while apologising.This movie will not win awards, the industry simply will not allow it, that much is obvious, but... it will win fans, hopefully enough to gain a sequel :)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I say that as a viewer who just wants to be entertained and doesn't take all this superhero stuff seriously. I don't care if they diverge from the comics that inspired them, just that it be entertaining and Venom is. Riz Ahmed is the cold blooded rich guy experimenting with alien life forms that infect our hero, Tom Hardy and give him super powers. These movies have become boring now with their relentless special effects but Venom is mostly spared that with a great performance from a rumpled Hardy as a investigative reporter who gets fired for trying to expose Ahmed and his creepy scientific experiments. The humour starts to build and instead of the movie trying to take itself seriously like so many other superhero movies, it plays to the strength of that humour and I found myself chuckling more and more. If you accept it as a comedy, the leads, Hardy and the lovely Michelle Williams are very endearing and have great chemistry, rather like Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman. Enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It looks like Sony is deciding to launch their own Marvel Universe that is separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which I don't have much of a problem with. On top of that, getting Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock? This should have been something very memorable and fun. Unfortunately, what we get is an average superhero film that is uneven and doesn't grab your interest. Its not a good start to this new set of films that are being planned, if that's the case.The film is about a journalist who loses his job after he tried to report a scandal against a large corporation and the malpractice involved. His life falls apart and his girlfriend also leaves him. He soon finds himself going back to the corporation and gets infected by a symbiote that becomes a part of him. The symbiote causes voices in his head, a black shapeshifting substance that covers his body and gives him super human powers and a voracious appetite. The film also stars Riz Ahmed, Michelle Williams, and Jenny Slate. As with other Marvel films stay after the credits for a scene.Where do I start? The film has a few boring passages. The Venom character looks good in some scenes but then looks choppy in others. Tom Hardy does his best with what he could in a film that mixes darkness and humor awkwardly. The villain is weak and the film falls into the typical pitfalls of these types of comic book films. There are moments that are definitely fun. The quality of it is low compared to the incredible MCU films and this film comes in with a whimper while Iron Man made waves as the first in the MCU. It's unfair to compare sure, but the film needed a backbone of real originality to do the character justiceThe film has moments of intensity, which keeps it engaging but momentarily. Maybe Venom needs Spidey to really keep it interesting, I don't know. I mean I actually don't know if this film is any better than any of the MCU films, which is kind of insane. Overall, I wanted to really like this as it has a good cast and an important and popular character in the Marvel universe. It could have been so much better.6/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A somewhat boring movie that is somehow saved by the 2nd act and great perfomance by Tom Hardy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4386620/?ref_=tt_urv","sagniknath","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68150334/?ref_=tt_urv","9 October 2018","Long story short: This film came 12 years too late. A lot the dialogue, scenarios and character interactions feel extremely dated as if they belong to an early 2000s sci fi action movie . Even the CGI, while not bad, still looks like product of a bygone era (2005-2010)The first act was littered with early 2000s anachronisms : shady intelligent tech head with somewhat oscure motivations to rule the world, the scared scientist worker who wants to control her boss'dangerous ambitions; even a lousy metal head neighbor who needs to be straightened out Ala Catwoman(2004) style is set up. The third was no better as well. It was as if they now wanted the movie to end and made the climax as bland and generic as possible. However, underneath all this mess, Tom Hardy really delivers a good Venom/Eddie Brock performance. He was able to effectively pull off that Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy associated with his role. All the scenes that feature Eddie Brock interacting with Venom are interesting . The second act , which was all about Eddie finally acquiring the Venom form and getting caught in a city wide bike chase was definitely entertaining and gave me some hope for the movie after the sloppy 1st act. Also interesting to note is how different this movie could have been if it stuck to it's original R rating. There were definitely certain reshoots observed in the editing on account of some continuity errors. This was mainly to remove all that violent deaths from symbiote attacks to get the PG -13 rating. So instead of the camera looming on the death spectacle, it would transition to the expressions on the onlookers' faces. Overall, would recommend it ,despite being overall a mediocre film, based simply on Tom Hardy's performance","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But it was actually pretty fun.The story goes like this: Unemployed reporter Eddy Brock played by Tom Hardy gets a story from a woman working for LIFE organazation, Eddy goes to investigate and one of the Symbiotes named Venom gets to his body. Also another symbiote that was lost and transfered it self to random people found it's way to the owner of LIFE. That creates Riot .But i have two mane complains about the film for one when venom is fully Venom its really good but when his hand is venom and his body is hardy it looks really bad.And two the main villian is not interesting at all he is bland and we don't know anything about him other that he hates venom and he is evil.Anyway i think the film is still worth a watch.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't go in expecting stellar character work or great writing, this film doesn't provide that. However it does have some solid action scenes that keep the mood light despite featuring a monstrous alien biting people's heads off. Hardy gives a decent performance, and is just about enough to keep the movie going, but the supporting characters are quite unconvincing and play pretty standard archetypes. Compared to DC's 'adult' offering in ""Joker"", this film barely stacks up, but if you've got kids who have grown up watching the MCU, this film is at least a fresh take on the Marvel formula.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It isn't.This first thing to be said about Venom is it is really, really boring. The setup, in which we see Eddie Brock's pre-Venom life, goes on forever (well, maybe a half hour), interspersed on with a few look-how-evil-I-am scenes for the villain. At a certain point I started using the skip-forward button on my video player to see if I could find where the action started.As for the action, it was fine, I suppose. Venom's shape-shifting abilities lead to some decent moments. Not *great* moments, but decent.In fact, if you removed all the non-action scenes you'd have something short but tolerable. But it would be very short, because even when the movie kicks into its highest gear, there's still a lot of down time.The repartee between Venom and Brock is okay, but Upgrade, which I haven't seen yet, has a more entertaining take on the same basic concept in the *trailer*.Some critics described this movie as awful but entertainingly so. This is not true. This is unentertainingly awful. It should not be watched, by anyone, ever. The people rating it highly on IMDB should seek psychiatric help.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Later on that doesn't impact much of anything). However, he gets overeager and ends up getting fired. Offscreen? Shown? First one, then the other. It's one of several things where it feels like the script was first written to be one way, and then later rewritten, but they left in a lot of the old stuff. Another is that an astronaut whose body is temporarily taken over is named Jameson(yes, must in fact be the son of the Daily Bugle publisher and/or editor-in-chief). Why is that in a movie that doesn't have Peter Parker? It feels like something that was in an original draft for Sam raimi's Spider-man 3, before Topher Grace(I don't hate him in... hmm... Traffic. I'm sure he's a perfectly nice guy. I just don't want him in my action blockbuster sequels. He was wrong for Predators, too) was brought in to ruin the titular character of this. Anyway. He ends up being bonded with a symbiote(that's ""-ee-"", not ""-eye-""), and discovering... a fiendish plot that could destroy the world(*dramatic music cue*).As many(seemingly most) other audience members, I enjoyed this a lot. With that said, it could be better. Venom(Tom, with a modulated voice, with personality, not one-note) himself, always a voice(at first, that's all he is) in our lead's head, will frequently argue with him, occasionally answer his questions to other people, etc. And ultimately go from acting like he's in a flesh taxi, into agreeing to a coexistence that both are happy with(not necessarily credibly depicted). It's an unusual trait for this kind of picture, and is genuinely memorable. I mean that in a good way. Except for what you'll remember for the wrong reasons, such as the sitcom level humor of scenes like the one where he ends up taking a bath in the lobster tank of a restaurant, to the confusion of everyone eating there. The action, while cool, could have been unique. We get a motorcycle chase(with kamikaze drones that make you wonder why they don't use a single drone firing rockets) that's at least several minutes too long, some straightforward fighting(yes, it's unusual that he's ""not doing it himself"". That's also in The Tuxedo. It's funnier there), and an indecipherable climax(with very nifty weapons). It's badass. What it also is, unfortunately, is far below average for the subgenre, today. Yes, this does feel like it was made 10 to 15 years ago(other than the pretty good special effects), when expectations were lower, and they made mistakes rarely seen today(even in the DCEU). With that said, this is far superior to the likes of Catwoman, any live-action Fantastic 4 released so far, and the first Ghost Rider. It's also quite reminiscent of The Mask, and it doesn't top it.There is a lot of moderate violence, a little strong language, and a little implied gruesome gore in this. I recommend this to fans, provided they are fine with this being less than ideal. 7/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I really wanted this to redeem the Sam Raimi version of Venom from Spider-Man 3. Unfortunately this movie was all around a mixed bag.One of the biggest problems of the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. The film blends together romance, gory action, and the comedy together but never really finds Its voice. The film felt disjointed with the comedy completely out of place for the tone of the film. Not every superhero movie needs to try to add humor. The poor humor and romance subplot also slowed down the dark violent action that should have been the centerpiece of the Venom movie. There is no reason this movie should not have been rated R.The film's central plot was also formulaic and rushed together. There was not a single Innovative idea in the entire movie. There was a cookie cutter villain, a predictable love triangle, and a cliche plot conflict. The entire plot progression just felt forced. There just wasn't anything compelling in the story that made me get involved with the story.The film also did not feel like a Venom movie to me. It seemed as if they used the name Eddie Brock and Venom, but beyond that nothing else represented the characters I know. They made an odd choice to try to make the Symbiote a comic relief, which never worked well in the film. I'm fine with changing the source material like in Logan, but at least keep true to the spirit of the characters.Now as far as things the movie did well Tom Hardy is always a great actor. The material he was working with may not have been the best but he still delivered it well. He was all around a likeable protagonist worth rooting for.When the film finally got around to utilizing the Venom symbiote it was a lot of fun. The inner thirteen-year-old in me had a blast watching Venom literally bite the head off of people. The fight scenes were also fast-paced and well done. The cgi and animation were all around pure eye candy. Venom just being allowed to be Venom was the best part of the movie. I just wish there was more of it.There should have been substantially more of Venom being the dark and minesing anti-hero that he is. Unfortunately the film didn't have a clear idea of what it wanted to be. The film was all over the place, the central conflict was weak, and it wasn't dark enough for the source material. Overall it was a relatively dumb movie with a few fun moments peppered throughout. It certainly had its mindless fun moments, but the movie is a drastic drop in quality compared to a Disney Marvel film. A 6 out of 10.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

"2","/10","A toxic, venomous, and cyanide misfire and mess and major disappointment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4418072/?ref_=tt_urv","PradoCedric","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur74948321/?ref_=tt_urv","25 October 2018","This is definitely the most disappointing and one of the worst superhero film since Batman & Robin, Catwoman, Fant4stic, and Suicide Squad. There are so things that get this film wrong and right.For the wrong, the tone is completely inconsistent and all over the place. The film desperately tries to be gritty but turns to be a joke, and its attempt to blend in with sci-fi, superhero, and horror genres makes it convoluted and had a hard time seeking its identity. Even the CGI, editing, and pacing is laughably bad. The worst offender here had to be the script. From its clunky, bland and nonsensical plot to its terrible lines, dialogue and one-liners, it clearly shows the film's banality as well its toxic and venomous conditions.Even the most charismatic and respectable actors are wasted in this film. Riz Ahmed is horrendously miscast, and combined with his hammy, stale and mediocre acting. The fantastic Michelle Williams is given no favors despite her very best in giving her performance of Anne Weying with depth and conviction but ultimately falls flat and is even forced to deliver a weak dialogue and acting.On the other hand, here's what the film got right. Tom Hardy makes an excellent performance as Eddie Brock/Venom, which at least redeem its Venom portrayal from the horrendous Topher Grace performance of Venom in the terrible Spiderman 3. The dynamic and chemistry between Eddie Brock and Venom along with Hardy's performance are the only of the film's saving graces, but it's not enough to redeem this cyanide trainwreck.The most disappointing of the film itself is the PG-13 rating, which effectively weakens the quality overall and even restrains its character development from going to its darker characteristics, which this film could have gone better with an R rating, considering the success of rated R superhero films such as the Deadpool films and Logan. Still, this is not the worthy adaptation that Venom character is truly deserves to and even the performance of Hardy as well its dynamic deserved better than this misfire.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The look of the character and the writing were both on point, as was Tom Hardy's committed performance as both Brock and Venom, the symbiote that takes control of him. It's the relationship between Eddie and Venom, which starts off as hate/love and develops into something of a bromance that really makes 'Venom' an enjoyable, if flawed, movie.Asides from Hardy's lead performance, the best in a comic-book movie in some time, the rest of the cast highlighted by Riza Ahmed and Michelle Williams are very good. The plot's very simple and straightforward. There are a couple of small surprises but no twists or story elements that really wowed me. Same with the romance between Brock and his girlfriend Anne. It was merely serviceable. A major criticism of 'Venom' that i feel is undeserved is of the consistency of its tone. While it IS tonally all over the place, moving from drama, to comedy, to horror, to romance, almost scene to scene... IT works. That's because it's in keeping with the madcap and tonally uneven nature of the lead character(s) and performances. Brock/Venom are all over the place. So is the movie. And it's fun.I'd say the only big negative is that the third act and the third act climax weren't great. The stakes were big, but they weren't set-up properly. I didn't care about what the movie was trying to get me to care about. Also, the final fight of the movie was very underwhelming. Like 'Wonder Woman' and 'Black Panther' the final boss fight in 'Venom' was way too dark and busy. Hollywood's obsession with making murky night-time CGI action scenes must die. In any event, 'Venom' was really enjoyable. Check it out, it's worth the money, time.P.S. Stay after the credits. The Eminem song rocks and there's a little something after it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

His performance is very charismatic and charming. The relationship between Eddie and Venom is most definitely the best part of the movie. The films comedy entirely comes out of their bond. It rides the edge of what is intentionally and unintentionally funny, making you uncertain about jokes in the film that may have been on the nose jabs or just a mistake. This is something that intrigued me, and the uncertainty was rewarding in the long run. Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed, while doing a fine job, are on a completely different page to Tom Hardy, in terms of their dialogue and acting. Which may have been a fault of Fleischers direction or the different movie Sony wanted to make. This lack of direction isn't only prevalent with the actors; the tone seems to be wildly out of sync with the serious tones in the first 50 minutes (which matches the trailers) and then the wacky tone of Venom and Eddies adventure, which takes a very comedic and goofy tone. This was definitely the most effective tone that should have stayed consistent with the entire movie as it was the most enjoyable and what saved this movie from being a complete disaster. Carlton Drake/Riot as the lead villain was written and characterised so poorly. The final third act battle was so dreadful in the worst ways. It came so abruptly and the fight itself was extremely hard to see what was happening. It was abysmal. Aside from all that, this film would have benefited massively from an R rating. We see Venom bite people's heads off, but there is zero blood and it feels so tame.'Venom' is an extremely enjoyable and funny movie with two clashing tones, an abysmal third act battle, a villain which is much too dull, and Tom Hardy as both Eddie and venom doing a great job. It's a mixed bag, but the positives are enough to save this movie as an enjoyable, wacky and weird adventure.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It isn't a masterpiece, I'm not saying that, and it is a bit formulaic, but it is nevertheless a good, solid superhero film with an added bonus of a grungy sense of humour.Tom Hardy plays the lead as Eddie Brock, a celebrated investigating journalist, who has fallen on hard times after he reached too far with a story. But that same story, trying to expose a bleeding edge tech company, comes back to haunt him when the company discovers an alien lifeform.Hardy is a very talented actor and that is once again shown here. The man has a lot of range and can perform both as a dramatic actor and as an action hero. Which are both needed here. I also like the fact that his character is very dirty in this film. Meaning that he is allowed to look wasted, down on his luck, beaten and defeated. Venom as a character in the comics is after all one of the most well-known antiheroes, which is reflected nicely in the mood of this film.I also like the humour very much. The film is PG-13, but a lot of the jokes are rather gruesome and raunchy for such a rating. And it makes sense with this character.And then the negatives, which I feel the critics took a bit too far, but even I have to admit that it's a pretty textbook story. You can easily tell how the story will go from the beginning, there are no great surprises and the villain is lackluster at best. I do believe that the character of Venom, the humour and some of the other side characters make up for this, but I can see why these can be a problem for some.Nevertheless, Venom is a great watch if you're looking for a superhero film that's a bit rough around the edges and that has gone a few rounds already.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I love enjoying movies in any shape or form, and I think a lot of today's critics are very rigid about what makes a good movie, and every beat that you need to take in order to make a movie good. I liked Venom, it's not particularly good, certainly not in the same way my most recent review, BlackKlansman, is good. That being said, I had a fun time, I went in with low expectations due to the annihilation this was getting from critics, and came out not feeling like I wasted my time.Just to make it clear, it is incredibly flawed. Every character bar Eddie Brick/Venom are stale are stale as cardboard such as the villain, who Riz Ahmed is still putting as much life as possible in to, and the love interest, who Michelle Williams feels so wasted in, I was convinced it was not her due to the brutal material she was given.The first thirty minutes or so are pretty awful, the execution in to the main plot felt extremely flat. However, once the symbiote got in to Eddie Brock, played fittingly larger than life by Tom Hardy, I was able to switch my brain off and have a good time. The concept of this protagonist, who is practically inactive because of this being controlling him became so intriguing to watch, seeing this guy who had ultimately no control over the situation he was in. I began forgiving the movie for failing to pull me in earlier, cause now I was completely immersed in this large scaled adventure. While immensely flawed, I still enjoyed Venom, and would watch it again. The film carries out the traditional Marvel fare quite well, such as Stan Lee's cameo and an excellent after credits scene. Do not go in expecting perfection and you will enjoy yourself.
A down on his luck man gets more than he bargained for when taking on a huge project for his journalism career.

They either ALL love something or ALL hate something. But anyway on with the review...The film tends to sort of have two halves to it. The first half we spend a lot of time with Eddie Brock. We see the ups and downs of his relationship with his girlfriends, his attitude towards his work and those around him, and how he copes with these kind of things. The 1st half helps us to build an understanding of Brock. It might be a little slow at times whilst Carlton Drakes story at this point is kind of a subplot but when these two stories meet, that's when we get the second part.The second part is where the real fun begins. We're eventually introduced to Venom. The best part about this, and one of the standout things of the overall film, is the constant interactions between Brock and Venom. It's humorous and enjoyable to watch even if it is a little cheesy at times.The action is fairly enjoyable but not the best and there are some parts which feel a bit rushed particularly towards the climax of the film.The characters for the most part are interesting. I liked the dynamic between Hardy and Williams even if they don't have the best chemistry I've seen of on screen couples. Riz Ahmed does a good job as the villain but his character/s are a little bit uninteresting and disappointing.The film obviously has a few negatives. For example the plot seemed a bit thin and boring at times whereas i feel the makers could've gave us more to sink our teeth into. It almost feels like they hesitated when deciding what direction to take this story in. Another negative is the pacing. Whilst I enjoyed the first half it does move a little slow and then the second half seems to go too fast (partially due to the way the films edited.Overall i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and hope they do make a sequel or trilogy. As always there is a mid-credit scene which was satisfying so stay for that. If you try not to focus too much on the fact spiderman isn't in this movie you'll definitely enjoy it more. I think this film does prove that Venom can be a story on its own...at least for now.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Eddies is somewhat of a loser. He's plays hard, drinks hard, loves hard. He lives life on the edge. His girlfriend is a lawyer played by Michelle Williams.This origin story reveals that the bad guy, billionaire Drake, sent a rocket ship to space that came back with multiple Symbiotes, the body-sucking parasites that take you over, like Venom. No spoilers there. Drake is using his science labs to do some experimentation. Things get out of control and one of the symbiotes, named Venom, latches on to Eddie.The first part of the movie is a bit slow, up until Eddie meets Venom. Then the fun begins. As the movie proceeds, it becomes hilarious to see Eddie and Venom interact with each other. It's almost like Eddie has a somewhat-controlled Hulk that he can call out when needed to fight the bad guys.The movie then becomes mostly chase scenes and fight scenes. Over and over. That gets a bit tiring, but you get so see a lot of cool CGI effects for Venom.
The movies ends with an obvious hint that things will continue in the Venom world - I think they have a winner here.Tom Hardy delivers some strong acting. He also does the voice of Venom, which illustrates his strong voice skills. My biggest ding is the chemistry between Hardy and Williams. It's a lackluster sizzle. Perhaps a casting issue. Williams delivers a just ok performance. Otherwise, the big star is CGI because Venom is all over beating up bad guys and eating their heads, much to the dismay of Eddie.Altogether, a pretty good movie that ends up really delivering in the second half. Venom will be trained by Eddie to fight for the good guy in sequels it seems, which could deliver fun vigilante times like The Equalizer, The Girl in the Spiders Web, or Death Wish.
Enjoy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

While the film was not bad at all, it does not reach the cult league of the formerly mentioned.
The film had many good aspects. The most one to focus on is surely the casting coup of Tom Hardy who was a blessing for the film. He nailed the role perfectly and was able to add a lot of self irony to the film without forgetting to take his character serious (as much as it gets). 
The other great moments was when actual Venom was on screen, especially in the first half. And there is also the first problem. The film deserved to have more on-screen Venom and in the second half of the film the character lost a bit of its appeal and somehow his origins. They could have made more out of it and that role and generally had potential to make the film much darker but I guess they aspired the PG 13 rating too hard. 
Besides Tom Hardy we have the Reuben Fleischer had the great opportunity to have the wonderful Michelle Williams on board. However with that screenplay and her role it was impossible to use her full potential so she was more or less wasted. Kudos to Williams that she really tried to make the best out of it. Riz Ahmed was an interesting choice for the villain and it worked. The ending was a bit anti climatic. There were a couple of entertaining action sequences and exciting editing. The soundtrack worked and there is a great came of Woody Harrelson that really makes me hungry for a Carnage movie with him the title role. However, I dont think the world will need a ""Venom"" sequel. Nice try, not a failure but wasted opportunity.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Venom is just a poisonous outdated cash grab.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4390491/?ref_=tt_urv","TheMovieDiorama","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67902729/?ref_=tt_urv","11 October 2018","Oh dear. Superhero fatigue really is hitting hard this year. Sony is attempting every possibility just to keep the rights of a superhero intellectual property that is ""in association with Marvel"". Trying to kickstart yet another cinematic universe. I have no objections for these kind of blockbusters. As long as they entertain, they serve their purpose. This though, this is the complete opposite of entertainment. It's a catastrophic symbiotic mess. Eddie Brock, a well renowned journalist, loses everything by undertaking one interview. A few months later, he encounters a extraterrestrial life form known as Venom, where the two must stop another ""symbiote"" from destroying the world. Subjectively speaking, this is the worst blockbuster of the year for all the wrong reasons. But, let's start the review with some much needed positivity. Hardy, although incredibly miscast, commands onscreen presence and gives Brock a layer of likability. His schizophrenic-like behaviour with Venom manages to remain amusing, albeit frequently forced, reminiscent of the ""Buddy cop"" sub-genre. Venom, an anti-hero who suddenly turns into the world's saviour, maintains an enigmatic quality that feels alluring. Stan Lee's cameo is always a delight? I may be clutching at straws here for positive aspects, particularly with that last comment. There are so many underlying issues with Venom, that detailing them all would be a challenge in itself. Firstly, the narrative is tonally inconsistent. We have traits of the comedic 'Deadpool', action from 'The Incredible Hulk' and obviously the structure of 'Spider-Man'. It's not even inconsistent by scene, every act is so vastly different in tone that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Starting off as a generic romance, then breaking into the generic ""buddy cop"" action whilst also attempting to embed dark humour that forcibly feels negatively hilarious. The reason for this is the bad editing. Hardly any of the scenes have a narrative flow, with specific points in the plot being inserted at the incorrect time.This is particularly noticeable when portraying the antagonistic Carlton Drake, who's motives and backstory are thrown around like a ""symbiote"" on a rocket burning up through the atmosphere. One moment he wants to save humanity, the immediate proceeding scene portrays him wanting to destroy it. The horrifically written script, accompanied by unfunny quips that did not suit Hardy's acting talent, relies on an outdated superhero formula. Sony have failed to realise that these films have substantially evolved since the early 2000's. The ""save the world"" cliché and formulaic origin story are buried. Formulaic is an understatement, the story is atrociously predictable with its one-dimensional characters and heroic clichés that even the infrequent action scenes (all two and a half of them) couldn't generate any entertainment. The final showdown was a CGI ball of mess, making it particularly difficult to see what was actually happening. The motorbike segment was too pedestrian and lacked any excitement. Any combat scenes felt clunky and cumbersome, despite the innovative stunt choreography between Hardy and Venom. Ahmed gave a generically dull performance as the villain, one that I shan't remember anytime soon. Williams tried her best but again felt miscast as she attempts to create an emotional layer of depth between herself and Hardy. Oh, and Slate was underused, considering she has the most involving character. The slight comedic quips that Brock and Venom share are excruciatingly cringe inducing, trying so hard to make the audience laugh. There comes a point when Venom says ""pussy"", and I face-palmed so hard.Then we come to my favourite criticism of all. Plot conveniences. How did Drake know that Brock got the information from his girlfriend, leading to her firing? Venom was set on leaving Earth, how and why did Brock suddenly change his perspective? Why would he stay? (Don't even say because they are both ""losers""). How did Weying know to operate the speaker system at the launch pad? How did Venom survive? And why do megalomaniacs constantly keep killing their employees? Trust me, I really wanted to enjoy this. I went in with the best of intentions. But it's just not good. Completely outdated, utterly formulaic and so close to equalling the catastrophic disaster that was 'Fant4stic'. If it wasn't for Hardy giving a crazy Nicholas Cage performance by jumping into a fish tank brimming with lobsters at a restaurant, this would have nothing remotely amusing. Venom failed to find an antidote and instead succumbed to the poisonous traits of corporation cash grabbing by injecting no imagination or effort into the film, marking an all-time low in Hardy's career.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Half of the time it's horror the other half it's comedy. The entire movie felt like there were two directors and the two tones just don't mix well.The plot is everywhere and a lot of it is lost. The timeline doesn't make sense at all and the pace is also horribleThe thing that really saves this movie from being horrible is Eddie Brock and Venom. Tom Hardy does a great job and the relationship between venom and Eddie is a lot of fun.Action scenes looked kind of poor but not enough to make a huge difference. The action scenes were inconsistent, there were some brutal action scenes that were followed by some goofy action and they don't mix well.6/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't think it deserves the 28% rotten tomatoes review, and personally I'd say it was a solid 7/10. Some really really cheesy bits, but the action and whole feel of the movie was good. The story line wasn't bad and the CGI was good too. 
I think the final fight scene could have been improved quite a lot, as it was an anti-climax moment, however there was lots of scenes with Venom in, not just a handful here and there. Overall I would highly recommend this movie. Good storyline, good content and the humour was definitely suited to older viewers","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

They're everywhere. Granted they're pretty profitable and every studio wants a slice of Disney/Marvel's share of the market, so you can't blame Sony for 'rebooting' the popular anti-hero who was sort of featured in a Spiderman film which now feels like several hundred years ago.Die-hard audiences weren't happy with how the titular character 'Venom' was portrayed before, but, due to various licensing deals between Sony and Disney, this outing won't feature Spiderman himself. Therefore, few people had high hopes about whether this version would be much better than the previous effort.I don't know much about the comic source material, but I'm suitably informed that this new film changes Venom's origins slightly. A (typically mad) scientist intercepts a load of evil black space goo and decides to bring it back to Earth to eat us. One such kindly portion of black computer-generated nastiness infects a San Francisco news reporter, Eddie Brock, and - sometimes - turns him into a giant monster with a desire to eat human body parts. Nice, huh?Now, for some reason, everything about 'Venom' shouldn't really work. And yet it did. Granted it's certainly no masterpiece, but it's great fun for all its - many - flaws. For a start, as many pointed out, for a film which is based on an alien that likes to tear people apart, there's effectively no gore (it's PG-13 - a sign that possibly Sony are hoping to get Venom into Marvel's shared cinematic universe?). This annoyed some, but, like I say, I don't know enough about the original to really let it bother me.Marvel may be the bog kid on the block, but it's not beyond criticism, i.e. that almost every film without Loki is lacking a decent antagonist. Well, even the worst MCU villain is better than the businessman/scientist who's supposed to be Venom's nemesis. Yes, there's a post credit scene which is obviously designed to set up the next big villain and, from what I saw, he's going to be a damn sight more menacing that what we got here.Perhaps 'Venom's' main appeal is Tom Hardy. He's an excellent actor in everything he does and he seems to be able to lift a potentially mediocre film to something that's actually good fun. He's at his best when he's bantering with his 'alter-ego' as he can hear the alien creature in his head. In fact, he has more chemistry with a disembodied voice than he does with the obligatory 'love interest' who I can't even remember her name.I know that we're spoiled for choice when it comes to superhero movies, so, if you fancy one that isn't actually set in Marvel's 'shared universe' and is simple, fun and where you don't really have to think too hard about anything, then there's certainly worse about than 'Venom.'","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

7/10Sym-BYE-ote or Sym-BEE-ote? Which team are you? Either way, Venom is Fox's take on copying the Marvel formula. Trying and stumbling along the way. Movie starts out very slow. Definitely feel it is the worst half of the film. You follow Eddie Brock pre-symbiote (How do you think I said that?) While his story is good, the filmed aspect of it is boring. I felt the urge to want to check my phone. As soon as Venom is introduced into the equation, this film picks up and takes off, never looking back. Editing during action scenes cut around a lot, CGI is very good in most cases even though it looks odd at times. Story overall starts slow and then picks up and ends very fast it felt like. If you have an interest in the character or the movie, I'd say see this film. Is it one I'd say stop what you're doing to see? No. It is serviceable, great Redbox/Netflix movie. Definitely should see it but if you're on the fence or are excited to see things like First Man, I'd say go with your excitement. I saw this in IMAX. Definitely wasn't necessary to see there. TL;DR - This is Fox trying to carbon copy the Marvel formula and they do okay at it. The down times without Venom at the start are boring and slow. Once Venom is introduced Hardy shines and it becomes a film worth seeing. Should you see in theaters? Only if you want to, if you're excited for other releases this weekend, I'd pass on Venom and see it as a rental.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even though audiences liked it and critics hated it, I still wanted to see what it had to offer. This is one of the laziest films I've ever seen, and it felt as if everyone involved simply gave up with the character build-up and screenplay. The story was at least decent, yet it was half of what it could have been. I was actually fascinated the concept, but it treats the audience as if we don't know anything about good filmmaking... because the acting was pretty awful, and they delivered some of the most cliché, cheesy, and most overused phrases and sections of dialogue we've seen in films countless times. Yes, people will absolutely love this movie. But I was let down, and to be honest... I was really annoyed at how bad the dialogue and character development really was, and how the creators had a project on their hands in which they could've excelled at and given us something new. But unfortunately, we were treated with one of the most uninspired screenplays in years, along with the entire film trying to be many things in which it wasn't. This movie was barely watchable, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a true escape. Within the first ten minutes... I knew where the film was headed. The creators followed the typical Hollywood norms, tropes, and clichés. This movie was driven by predictability and something audiences would feel familiar with, which is something that really gets on my nerves. This movie had at least two or three enjoyable moments in my opinion. But the film as a whole was extremely and painfully predictable, cheesy, uninspired, poorly executed, and was afraid to give us something unfamiliar, in other words... fresh and new. Venom had the chance to be great, but it failed on so many levels for me.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

It baffles me how venom has performed worse with critics than such MCU duds like Antman and the Wasp, Thor the dark world, Iron man 2 or the incredible hulk.

This includes entries like 'Venom,' which is something that likely would not have been greenlit years ago.'Venom' stands out from its more family-friendly cousins for obvious reasons. For one, the film's star is not all that good. Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock is a conflicted but good-hearted investigative journalist, but his alter-ego has a mind (and appetite) of its own. Its darkness is an interesting departure from the usual lighter fare, but it's sort of refreshing in a way. The story is nothing special - there's the usual hero arc, duality of good(ish) vs. evil, etc. - but it's not as paper-thin as it could have been.And while this really is the Tom Hardy show, supporting performances from Michelle Williams and Jenny Slate in particular are noteworthy, although Riz Ahmed's Jeff Bezos-esque C-suite supervillain is not all that threatening.Regardless, 'Venom' is a good experiment in the expansion of the Marvel world and demonstrates there's life beyond 'The Avengers.'","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What a load of rubbish. The plot was thin. The main actor, frankly I felt his acting was arrogant, it was as though he felt he was above 'acting' and direction -like he went off on his own tangent-and instead of getting into the role to make it believable, it was as though he just decided to do what he wanted and try and be 'real'. Erm these are Superheroes with superpowers, i.e. fantasy, nothing 'real' about it, so this guy's lazy acting ruined it. It felt as though he felt he was 'better than this' and decided to adlib his way through it disregarding the years of world-building these cross-over franchises have built up.
Seriously, if you are 'too good' to be a graphic novel character, don't accept the job and ruin what could have been a good film. The whole way through the film, instead of being absorbed in the plot and characters, we were constantly made aware he was 'acting', it was almost a sense of his acting the role was doing us (the viewers) a favour. This is one franchise we will be avoiding. Someone needs to tell the guy, 'gritty' isn't always the way to go, especially when it isn't believable.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

TL;DR at bottomI saw this at the VERY first opening. I am a HUGE HUGE VENOM fan. I am also a fan of Tom Hardy. I love every movie he has done almost. He can play a funny character, or a tough as nails bad ass, or a crazed lunatic, to perfection. In this movie he played a psychologically messed up person to perfection. But thats where the good acting stops. 
I felt his girlfriend was horrible. She showed no emotion, I felt it was poor acting. I also did not like the villian. I never feared him. It never built up a scary bad guy. They had to share the focus on Riot and on the man, and without going into too much detail, it just didn't work. Reminded me of a DC movie. 
Also, the director could have done better. I did not like how it was kiddy-fied. Should have been more violence and some blood, and some bad ass scenes, and there just wasn't. The movie just followed the same storyline I felt as I had seen before. TL;DR
With all that complaining out of the way, I still thought it was entertaining. I still loved Tom Hardy, and I loved most of the scenes with Venom symbiote. It just left some unanswered questions, had a typical script, a bad actress, and it was kiddy-fied trying to copy Marvel's baseline. But don't let that disuade you from seeing it, its STILL VENOM AND TOM HARDY!!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I would not fault the acting because Tom is very talented and has not had a made film in my eyes however what stumped me most was the portrayal of the character Venom itself. I felt like the movie turned into a bit of a comedy so I found it difficult to take the storyline seriously... There was too many jokes to make this a seriously groundbreaking film. I was a little disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

On one hand, the action sequences are well choreographed and visually stunning, offering audiences a glimpse into the power and abilities of the symbiote. Tom Hardy, known for his intense performances, delivers a strong and convincing portrayal of Eddie Brock, the journalist who becomes the host of the Venom symbiote. He manages to capture the character's inner turmoil and struggle with his newfound abilities, making for a compelling character arc.However, the film struggles with its tone, veering between serious and comedic elements without fully committing to either. The result is a disjointed narrative that leaves audiences unsure of how to react to certain scenes. The plot is also rather thin, relying heavily on cliches and tropes common in the superhero genre, making it feel unoriginal and predictable at times. Additionally, the villain of the story is underdeveloped and lacks motivation, leaving audiences uninvested in the conflict.One of the biggest disappointments of the film is its lack of connection to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the film is marketed as part of the MCU, it feels more like a standalone film with little to no ties to the larger franchise. This disconnection from the larger universe also makes it difficult for audiences to fully invest in the story and its characters.However, the film does have its moments of brilliance. The special effects and CGI used to bring Venom to life are top-notch, and the dynamic between Eddie and Venom is intriguing and provides some of the film's best moments. The chemistry between Tom Hardy and Venom is impressive, and it's clear that a lot of effort was put into making their relationship feel authentic.While the film has its flaws, it's hard to deny the entertainment value it provides. The action scenes are well-executed and the performances are strong, but the film's shortcomings in terms of plot, tone and villain make it fall short of being a truly great film. It's a decent watch for fans of the character, but for others, it may be a missed opportunity. I would give it a 7 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The trailers did nothing for me. Plus they're telling an origin story for Venom without Spider-Man. That is just wrong. But nevertheless on a rainy Thursday evening on the 4th of October I went to my local cinema. Watched the movie......and I did not like it. There were good parts in it for sure, but it definitely didn't work for me as a whole. Here's why:First off, the good. This is actually a hilarious movie. There were a lot of moments in this movie that made me laugh hard. Violently even.Most of it from the interaction between Venom and Eddie Brock.The way Venom talks to Eddie in his head is brilliant, I especially love Venom's reactions when Eddie calls him a parasite. A lot of laughs were heard in the cinema. Funny that the trailer didn't tell us that this is going to be a funny movie. It really is. Makes you wonder how the reaction would be if they showed the comedic bits a little in the trailers.And that's where the ""goods"" end for me...Let's go to the bad, shall we. Let's talk about the other casts. As I mentioned above, the chemistry between Eddie Brock and Venom was great. Tom Hardy is a great actor and he did a wonderful job in this movie just like he does in every movie he's in and I'm a big fan of his. The rest of the cast though, was pretty bad. Michelle Williams as Anne Weying who is Eddie Brock's ex-fiancée is totally forgettable, except maybe for that 1 bit near the climax. If you have watched it, you know what I'm talking about. Besides that scene, Anne Weying is completely forgettable. The character of Dora Skirth played by Jenny Slate also felt flat nearly all the time.Then there was Riz Ahmed. My God, Riz Ahmed. He was absolutely bad in this movie. A dead person have more facial reaction than this guy and he had an emotional range of a teaspoon (yes, that was a Harry Potter reference). This guy is not believable as an antagonist at all. He was the worst part of this movie. Mr. Freeze from Batman and Robin was a better antagonist. You get the feeling like he doesn't care about this movie and is just there to pick up the paycheck.Now, let's talk about the PG-13 rating. This is a movie begging for an R-rating. Certain scenes featuring the symbiotes could've benefited from it. It would have made this movie better. Not by much, but still it would have made it better. We live in a world where R-rated superhero movies do work. Deadpool was awesome, Logan was amazing. Venom was a no-brainer for an R-rating. I know why they went for a PG-13 rating (wanting to eventually join forces with the mighty MCU) but was it worth it in terms of the story you want to tell? The rating certainly hurt this movie.Overall, Venom is not the worst movie ever in the genre. This is no Catwoman or Elektra or Fant4stic. It is not as awful as that. You can watch it and have fun with it.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Eddie Brock (Hardy), an investigative reporter down on his luck, becomes the unwitting host of an alien symbiote giving him superhuman abilities and powers. Brock thinks he must be going insane, but finally resolves himself to the fact that he has a ""parasite"" and must now learn to co-exist with Venom.It is the story of their battle to stop other symbiotes from invading earth and destroying it's inhabitants - while exposing Carlton Drake, the head of the Life Foundation for the homicidal experiments he conducts in the name of science. Brock finds out that the hosts normally die when taken over by a symbiote, but Venom promises to spare his life if Brock helps him stop the invasion.This was a fun movie, different than most super hero films, and maybe that's why I liked it so much. Tom Hardy does a convincing job in his role with solid support from Michelle Williams who plays the part of Anne, his love interest. This isn't a favorite of mine in this particular genre, but I would certainly watch it again and am looking forward to the sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Both were all over the place. A few scenes seemed like they were missing a lot of stuff, no really there was one scene that just stopped. None of the scenes had proper transitions. This could be the main reason that the pacing was awful as well. The pacing in this film was off for this type of movie. This is supposed to be an action-packed thrill ride but it's just slow. Now the main villain is just so bland. He has no evil mastermind plan and doesn't even have a reason for doing what he does. He doesn't act like a villain. Now the acting in this film wasn't that bad but it just didn't come across as people I want to root to win. One thing I look for in movies is character development and if the characters had any. This movie had very little to none. The final bad thing I want to talk about is the tone of the film. This film is PG, in Canada, and PG13, in USA, so they had to throw in some humour for the kids but when it doesn't fit the tone of the movie, don't. There were way too many forced jokes into this movie that was just out of place. Now the only good thing about this movie was the action shots. Once the action happened then that's when I was fully invested in the movie. The action shots and the music that went with it was terrific. They looked well rehearsed and well shot and the editing on those scenes were spectacular. In the end, ""Venom"" was a slow movie that was only worth it for the action scenes and probably would have been better with an R rating","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

One of the most amazing comic book characters, I was excited to see Venom once again on the big screen. Add to that Tom Hardy playing the titular role. Sony pictures had it sold to me completely. But all expectations came crashing down once the 112 minutes of the movie run time was over.The movie has the most simplest and basic plot line. Add to that no good side characters and patchy writing throughout. The only two good things about the movie were Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and the symbiote Venom also voiced by Hardy. Venom does not even appear until the one hour mark and that will lit your eyes up in anticipation and you will get an orgasm of a sort. Trust me. Whenever Venom is on screen the movie just becomes amazing just by his presence and his dialogues. Tom Hardy is exceptional as Eddie and Venom but he is tied down by the patchy writing and did his best with what he was given. Hardy has gone on record and said that they cut his favorite 40 mins from the movie. Add to that Sony going for the PG-13 rating rather than R didn't help the cause. I'm sure a R rated movie would have served a movie and character like Venom in a much better way. It just baffles me how the studios are seeing only kids as their audience and are neglecting the majority crowd who have grown up reading these comics and are well over 20 years now. But that is a different rant for a different time.Coming back to the movie, the visual effects are on point. The depiction of character of Venom and Riot is so amazing. So good job on that front. But the movie seems grossly underdeveloped, lacks depth in all departments and has zero character development. Every other character is a complete waste and reeks of lazy writing. The villain is the worst of all. Although still, this movie has it's fanboy moments. Eddie's and Venom's sarcastic comedy makes the movie worthy of one watch at least. They had sizzling chemistry which could have taken the movie to new heights but the overall writing just let's it down. Venom is a lazy movie and I wish they had put in more effort.Mid credit scene teases the character of Carnage.Post credit scene shows just a extended scene from upcoming animated movie 'Spiderman:Into the Spider verse.'","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was a lot of action, and the special effects were very good. The movie theater was full, and many people were laughing out-loud and clapped after the movie. Yes, the main character was kind of corny, but I found Venom's human ego less corny than Iron Man or Captain America. I also found it refreshing that it occurred in a world that wasn't already occupied by other super heroes. It seemed more realistic and adult oriented than other marvel character movies, but I would have preferred it being a bit darker rather than light hearted.I am not a huge fan of super hero movies other than Dark Knight, but I really enjoyed this. It shouldn't win any awards, but if you like the genre, I found it better than most. The movie suggested that Tom Hardy was a loser before he became Venom. If he was a loser, what the hell does that make me?","29 out of 53 found this helpful.

Also, there is no horror elements, except one early scene in the lab, which was lazily done. There is too much hype, about Spider-Man's most menacing villain/anti-villian, and it doesn't live up to the people expectations. But the critics backlash is unwarranted. What were they expecting?

I really, really did. Tom Hardy is always a fun actor to watch, and while it's not his best performance, he does a good job here. Michelle Williams is great as always as Annie, and Riz Ahmed (who I loved in Nightcrawler and Rogue One) plays a decent villain in the form of millionaire, borderline mad scientist Carlton Drake. Director Ruben Fleischer had previously worked on Zombieland and Gangster Squad, and while those two were better movies, Venom is still very watchable.
I'll be honest. The plot itself doesn't make much sense in a lot of ways. There are huge inconsistencies with the way the symbiotes work with hosts, and how compatible the host can be. The movie is almost 2 hours long and still felt way too short and underdeveloped, with some holes where scenes were clearly cut out, either for runtime or to try to help keep it PG-13. There's also an entire scene from the end of the movie that appears in the trailer, which was really disappointing.
With that said, I loved the visuals in most of the fight scenes, especially the one at the end. The back-and-forth banter between Eddie and Venom was a sheer joy, and probably my favorite thing about the movie. There was a nice blink-and-miss-it cameo with John Jameson at the very beginning, and Spider fans will want to stick around for the mid-credits scene.
There's a lot wrong with this movie, and I feel it's a huge missed opportunity for them not to go for the R rating, as we've seen Logan and Deadpool 1 and 2 prove that they can succeed with flying colors. I sincerely hope they release an unrated extended cut when it hits DVD and Blu Ray. As it stands though, it may be a guilty pleasure, but Venom was generally very enjoyable.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The obvious main strength of this film is the performance of Tom Hardy, particularly strong in the scenes where he is first joing with Venom. He was comical without being absurd or dumbing it down and also played it with a slight touch of madness in his eyes which I adored. The film itself is ok and so are the other performers although the typical 2d style bad guy brought the film down considerably in my opinion.
However as I stated at the start of this review it's all about Venom/Tom Hardy double act that really excels this otherwise average film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Between the lines; the movie leaves a space open for your choice of dark, darker or darkest. VENOM itself eats people alive and on top of that is pretty much killing the host (an outstanding Tom Hardy) so it is not really a very nice guy.The action scenes are original, tense and entertaining; something MARVEL / DISNEY could care less as seen in their last movies. There are lots of humor; sometimes towards to adults and language is strong (even a couple of F** out there).The only two minor problems; it takes perhaps a few minutes to more than necessary to turn on full motion and the script could have been a little more.In brief; pure satisfying and guilty entertainment","38 out of 72 found this helpful.

I liked this movie because it dares doing a few unthinkable things for a Hollywood action film. It dares showing, in a manner of speaking some collateral damage. I mean - in so many Hollywood action films bullets are flying all over the place in the busiest streets without a single bystander getting a scratch. In this movie they do get hurt, most of the time we see it off screen, but we see it, the movie acknowledge the fact the innocent lives are lost. For a comics based movie, thats as close to realism as they can (and should) get. 
 Another place where the movie is possitively daring, is in daring to show Venum as the character he was created on the comics, a savage predator, with very little noble emotions or caring thought for anyone other than its own self preservation. The movie does veer off the original comic book story of origin, but it keeps the comics book nature of the beast, and that's a big plus in my personal book.Other aspects of movie making: let's not speak about CGI anymore, I think it's a mere technical issue, and there'll always be those who say the CGI was lame. It wasn't but it's not a surprise, it's the way it is. The actors are very good, and I liked the fact Tom Hardy gets to play a comic character with his own face. I hated his mask when he was Bane. It was part of the character, but it killed half the potential of real acting in that film. Here he gets to really act, and he's great. Michelle Williams is as charming as ever, and perfect for the role, and Riz Ahmed is a very good villain. Jenny Slate should get more screen time, she's a great sctress, who doesn't get half the credit she deserves.Altogether, a great, slightly different sort of comic movie, if it wasn't a bit rushed with the convertion of Venum, I'd rate it even higher.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

In his latest video, he has tangled with Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of a bio-engineering firm that has been involved in a number of controversial events, costing him his job and his fiancé. Drake has secretly got hold of a bizarre, shape shifting mutagen, and after breaking into his laboratory, Eddie unwittingly becomes its host, transforming him into the crime fighting gargoyle Venom.There's nothing like an adult orientated comic book adaptation, not least because it excludes the auditorium you're watching it in from any noisy, rambunctious kids, as well as just generally providing a more rounded, uncensored experience. They tend to be more obscure, little known creations that just have their own little cult following among their devotees, and no parents will be pestered by their offspring to take them along to see it, having never heard of it. These have ranked among some of my favourites, such as Deadpool 1 and 2 and The Punisher films (no matter what anyone says!) but Venom sadly falls short of this mark, while doing nothing aesthetically wrong, it's just too mechanical and ineffective to be one you'd want to see again.The first big disappointment is that, in spite of the 15 certificate, there doesn't seem to be anything more edgy than in your average Spiderman film, despite some rocky language. The host character, played charismatically by a wise-cracking Hardy, takes up much of the first half of the film, but the titular character takes too long to make his presence felt, and despite being physically impressive, with a seriously scary face, sounds too much like The Honey Monster from the Sugar Puffs ads. The action is shot too close up, with too many quick cuts and, even being an action film, is too loud. All the dialogue feels stilted and staged, and none of it sounds real or convincing. The wafer thin plot isn't strong enough to hold everything together throughout the course. Meanwhile, Ahmed is too weedy and nerdy to be taken seriously as the villain.It subtly borrows little pieces of other films, from more adult fare like Predator, to kids films like Super Mario Brothers, without having any kind of solid structure to stand as a film on its own. It's all rounded off with the title track from Eminem, who's gone from making personal, deep raps about his life to doing the soundtrack to superhero movies. I've just found out the character was created by that Todd McFarlane guy, the same guy behind Spawn, which this reminded me so much of. The film version of that was absolutely savaged by critics when it came out, but I loved it. This, sadly, doesn't hold up, but you just know there'll be an inevitable sequel that'll be even worse. **","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

don't listen to them. This movie was pretty damn good.Tom Hardy was great and the smartest choice to play Eddie Brock/Venom,
now back in 2007 when I first heard about a Venom spin-off I felt very unsure
about that, but fast forward to 2018 with Tom Hardy in the lead role I was on 
board with it.This was a pretty standard adventure film at best but it was still good,
I would say the script was a little weak in places and the film as whole
was a little rough around the edges but I still liked it very much.The build up- is pretty standard stuff we've seen before but it's fine.The plot- is not the most original but still good.The CGI- was really good in my opinion, Venom looked fairly
real and he was interesting to look at too. besides don't listen to those
who say the CGI was bad what do they know.Overall, a popcorn fun action-adventure with anti-hero Venom,
Tom Hardy really caries this film well without him I think it
would have failed. Plus this leave you wanting more! 
which is always good in my book. I recently seen this in theaters
and i loved it. I give it a 7/10. I full-heartedly recommend it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And I went into this movie expecting it. This film is so boring bland and uninventive. Definitely would have appealed more possibly maybe 10 years ago, back to when the genre wasn't overly saturated and well known. But no, even then this films script is god awful and so bad. One of the worst scripts written of 2018, surprising enough the same writer wrote the script for aquaman which was a film that I overall enjoyed but the script was my biggest issue and of course it had to be the same person. The only thing this movie has going for itself is the performance by Tom Hardy, he steals the show with his acting and performance as usual. Everything else was either bad or generic. Even the venom character was so god awful. (I'm not a fan of judging a film so harshly on CGI and I won't do that, in fact I thought it was solid work with the effects department, and it wasn't distracting me from the plot so I'm ok with effects, and if anyone uses that as a reason to bash this film I think it's unfair, if that's that case you should bash older movies back in the 70s for having effects that weren't good) but back to venom, his CGI was great, his character was so terrible, THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE TRANSCENDED THE GENRE TO NEW TERRITORY, think about it VENOM is a VILLAIN not a HERO. Sure I'm familiar with comics and he was a anti hero in some, but this movie missed the mark to create a unique film, this movie is so bland and generic I felt as if I watched it before, the characters are boring the villain is even more boring the CGI final fight was ehh, and the ending is ugh, the action is so repetitive and unnecessary, this movie was god awful and the soundtrack was even worse, this movie is the downfall as compared to Eminem's song for this movie which was probably arguably even more worse and annoying than the film itself. (AND IM A HUGE FAN OF SLIM SHADY) Venom should have been DCs joker. Taking a villain and making a compelling story of the villain landscape, but no they turn him into a forced PG13 freak forced terrible dialogue and a plot so boring and far from original that the only interesting thing this movie has going for itself is the concept of the symbiotic/human relationship which for me gets interesting with Tom hardy and venom
until it gets annoying and the performance by Tom hardy holds this film up. THATS IT. The acting is all around actually good as well, it's just the script that really holds the film so far back and it's the characters around Eddie that make it so boring that I don't even like the characters no matter how good their acting and performance is.Acting 7/10
Script 2/10
Plot 3/10
Screenplay 5/10
Cinematography 4/10
Soundtrack 2/10
Special Effects 7/10
Editing 4/10Overall Venom has its moments to be held and saved nearly by Tom hardy, but the film was shot so blandly the bad script takes over the film very much and the compelling aspect that makes a film unique doesn't even feel like it's there, feels as if the director forced it to be there. This film should have been such indistinguishable and more hah just another generic boring story. Am I saying they can't make a pg13 venom movie? NO, and I think going a anti hero route can be cool, but this movie isn't doing it folks, and I am sure if they went the darker direction into diving into the villain side it would have been much better, but no, Sony wanted that money and these people gave it to them for this garbage film. terrible film 5/10 and that's just being nice","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The performances were really really good. Each of the human characters were well formed and pretty effortless. I think the whole thing falls down on the timing of the dialogue between Hardy and Venom. The voice work/dubbing for Venom is really laboured. It is just off and this really hurt the whole pace and flow of the movie. I think it is largely an editing problem, because the lines for Venom are kooky, menacing and over the top which is great. They just fall flat In the delivery. There was something really lethargic/sluggish about the integration of the CGI elements because all the scenes without Venom are seemless and comfortable and the Venom scenes are just sort of lame. Regardless of the timing issues which let our monster down, the kookiness overall was fun and Tom Michelle and Riz were great to watch. Even though it had a few glaring issues it is still way better than most of the crap out there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A wonderfully original concept in an extraordinarily tired genre. Great interplay between Venom and Tom Hardy's character, but I wanted more. In fact, I was bored with Hardy on his own. Yes he's a good actor, but not convincing as an ""investigative reporter""; more like a bike mechanic. Likewise Riz Ahmed is not the typical ruthless billionaire businessman. I would have reversed their roles. Besides the stock characters, the least convincing part of the movie was the plot, which moved at a snail's pace to a predictable conclusion, the only highlights being an amusing restaurant scene and a chase. Also, they made East Malaysia look like Beijing. That's like filming in Egypt and saying it's South Africa.

The trailers looked horrendous with no potential whatsoever. I was even surprised Tom Hardy took the project, considering every movie he was in was at the very least good. Look, I went in knowing it's probably really bad, but I was HOPING for at least a few entertaining moments. Did I get it? NOPE.Not only does the plot barely make ANY SENSE, everything about this movie is awful. The music, the dialog, the directing, the acting, the editing... Just a complete mess. Most of the action scenes had way too many cuts, the music was absolute garbage and didn't fit the movie for a second, the humor was truly awful and some of it didn't even make any sense, the villain's plan didn't make any sense at all (just like the main plot), there are literally no characters you give any crap about (not to mention that Michelle Williams's character didn't even have any sort of arc at all!!).I'm actually not really surprised this movie was that horrible, I'm just surprised Tom Hardy took the project! Riz Ahmed is also very good, even though I only saw him at The Night Of. Michelle Williams is also such a fantastic actress, yet she's given so very little to work with because of that mess of a script. Those actors (and actress) really don't deserve to be in a movie like this.","14 out of 36 found this helpful.

He will have to fight very hard with it and with himself in order to release it or co-operate with it. Its name is Venom and it will do everything to keep living and surviving on Earth as all symbiotes do.Despite all the bad critics I have to say that I enjoyed this movie and I had a really great time watching it. The plot was very interesting and not boring with some plot twists which made it even more interesting to watch. I also liked Tom Hardy's interpretation despite my first thoughts when his name was announced for the role of Venom. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Riz Ahmed's who played as Carlton Drake / Riot and he was very good at it. I have to admit that I expected more from Michelle Williams who played as Anne Weying and in my opinion made an average interpretation. The direction that was made by Ruben Fleischer was very interesting with many good scenes where there was a very good combination of action and adventure. Regarding Tom Hardy's interpretation, it has to be stated that it was so good that he made the audience feel all the stress, pain and the unknown when Venom was inside him and that's I believe the most important thing.Finally, I have to say that ""Venom"" is not just an average movie but a very interesting one, with good visual effects and CGI's, nice interpretations and a well-written script. If you are a Marvel fan I am sure that you won't be disappointed by it, but even if you are not, do yourself a favor and don't listen to all these bad critics and reviews, just watch it and I am sure that you won't regret it. So, I recommend everyone to watch it for all the previous reasons.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong. It's still an incoherent, painfully tone-deaf film that careens wildly between midnight body horror and goofy buddy comedy. It is also eminently watchable, thanks to Hardy's unhinged, balls-to-the-wall performance that would make Nicolas Cage proud. The messy script is maddeningly dumb and uneven, and you're left scratching your heads as to why such a high-calibre cast (Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed) would say yes to this clunker. If only it had the chutzpah to embrace its inner craziness fully, it could have been a bona fide future camp classic.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I cannot speak much about the VFX, but what i can speak of is the plot and narrative and the dialogues. It sure was an enjoyable experience. The plot was too fast paced and way less dark for an anti-hero film unlike Deadpool or Wolverine and some how dialogues, story development and ambience seemed familiar, like Amazing Spiderman franchisee hasn't been terminated. A lot of back story and pertinent explanations seemed missing. Riot especially was very badly built as a character.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Brock is a bit of a maverick and always tends to push things a bit far, both at work and at home. Brock targets for his latest investigation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed): a billionaire space pioneer (I hope the producers got WELL lawyered up!) Drake is a Bond-style megalomaniac who is intend on saving mankind by merging humans with aliens to create a symbiotic organism. Not wishing to go through all the nampy-pamby clinical trials stuff, he is doing live research on vagrants and others who ""won't be missed""... with generally negative results. Infected accidently with the symbiont called Venom Brock's future hangs in the balance: the meld will either kill him or else a new superhero will be born.For anyone with one foot already in the Spiderverse, Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom have appeared before, in the convoluted and pretty poor Tobey Maguire sequel ""Spider-Man 3"". In that film Eddie (played by Topher Grace) was the boyfriend of Gwen Stacey (then played by Bryce Dallas-Howard) who was similarly infected by an alien symbiote and was transformed into Venom.This new Venom incarnation is a Sony Pictures production ""with"" Marvel Studios, and although featuring a Stan Lee cameo it never quite feels like a Marvel picture. Posher critics have described it as ""tonally inconsistent"".... which is posh-critic language for ""it's all over the place""! And they are right. It veers suddenly from high drama and sci-fi action to plodding dialogue and Deadpool-style wisecracks with clutch-smoking rapidity. As such, the film never feels like it's decided whether it wants to be at the po-faced Captain America end of the Marvel specturn or at the wise-cracking Deadpool/GotG end.Tom Hardy actually gets to spend a lot of this film without a mask over his face, which is certainly a novelty! And he gives it his all acting wise which will please his army of fans. But his pairing with the Oscar-winning Michelle Williams never feels comfortable: there seems little chemistry between the pair given that they are an ""item"". None of this is helped by the grindingly turgid script which gives the pair, plus Reid Scott (""Dan"" from ""Veep"") as the third corner in the love triangle, some truly dire dialogue to spout at each other.An act I did like in the film was Riz Ahmed as the ""really bad guy"" Drake. I found Ahmed extremely annoying in ""Rogue One"", but here he slides into the smarmy evil role perfectly. A better script, like a future Bond film, would have benefitted from the turn!Woody Harrelson also turns up in a mid-credit ""monkey"" a ""well-known"" supervillain: which meant nothing to me but certainly does to comic-book fans.A technical shout-out should go to Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson (who's previously done ""Black Panther"" and ""Creed""): an unusual soundtrack with odd electronica, eerie electric-guitar riffs for Eddie's theme interspersed with exciting fast-paced action beats.This is not a classic Marvel flick, but for me it wasn't nearly as bad as some of the critical reviews have made it out to be. I saw this alone: and we were quite entertained.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Besides that, some of the action reminds me of horrible CGI.But the saving grace is Tom Hardy. His acting is flawless and he makes Eddie Brock unlikable and likable at the same time.

The first 15-25 mins of the film focuses on this in which he simply destroys his life and the life of his fiance. In process, he gets a cold dose of the reality of life. This also sets the main character up as good hearted individual who can't stands wrong but just does not know how to properly address them. He essentially comes off as a jerk and rather unlikable.After this drudgery, he and this alien life he comes into contact with slowly grow to realize their ""way of doing things"" can be useful if tempered with common sense and implemented at strategic points of opportunity. This was the entertaining part of the film and makes it worth watching. Additionally, this is a different take on one of the Spider Man villains which could lead to some interesting future interactions with each of these characters. The main question is if Columbia studios is willing to venture down that path.CGI, and other effects are top notch providing plenty of eye candy for the CGI geek. If you liked Spider Man, you may like this one as it does focus on a ""loser"" with a villainous alter-ego. If you like the Avengers chances are you will find this worth a watch if you have not seen it already. If you don't like the comic based films, then stay away.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are a few scenes where viewer discretion is advised, but it isn't that bad. There are a few curse words in the film, but nothing too bad. Not that scary at all, there are a few parts in the film where it gets a little intense, but nothing out of the ordinary. Also for those who have not watched the film yet, there is a scene after the credits, and its a pretty important scene. I really loved this movie and everything about it.

Don't worry, you're safe with me.Venom, if anything, is far from a perfect movie. It's not even a little bit amazing. But what do you expect from a popcorn blockbuster trying to win over Spider-Man fans? Venom is still a fun, action-packed, and even kind of good superhero movie that will not disappoint.What's the story? Journalist Eddie Brock is trying to take down Carlton Drake, the notorious and brilliant founder of the Life Foundation. While investigating one of Drake's experiments, Eddie's body merges with the alien Venom -- leaving him with superhuman strength and power. Twisted, dark and fueled by rage, Venom tries to control the new and dangerous abilities that Eddie finds so intoxicating.A field this movie does great at is the action sequences. I feel like these are some very well-put together action scenes that are very exciting and engaging. Whenever you see Eddie Brock transforming into Venom, it not only gives a sense of intimidation, but it also prepares you for a wild action-packed battle. Another thing this film does great is the visual style. Not only is the production design, the cinematography, and the symbiote particles very stunning to look at, but they also make the action scenes look AND feel even more awesome. The storyline, on the other hand, well... it's alright. I'm not gonna go into spoiler territory or anything, but it's not the most engaging story; the action does the job. As for the acting, I think the performances are superb, especially casting Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock. He does a great job with the character, but a nitpick would go onto Venom himself- whenever we hear a voice-over by Venom, it sounds pretty weird and, at times, even laughable. One final thing I'd like to analyze is the music. The composer, Ludwig Göransson, who also did the music for Black Panther and Creed, does a pretty good job over here. Not that Venom is his best score or anything, but it still gets you excited for the action, and it knows when the film transitions into a serious moment or a wild moment.In conclusion, Venom is enjoyable, cool, and quite underrated superhero film that deserves more praise and respect. You can tell that there's effort put into it, even if at times they try too hard with the film. If you like the Spider-Man comics with Venom in them (I know I'm a fan of the Venom comics), you'll have a fun time at the movies with good ol' Eddie Brock. I feel like this movie was a love letter to haters of Spider-Man 3, which underplayed Venom by a lot, so if you hated Spider-Man 3 because there wasn't enough Venom, there's plenty of Venom in this film, so I recommend seeing it for yourself. Hope you'll like the movie!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The character of Venom makes the movie good, it has a funny side to it which makes the movie very light and beside the visuals not to disturbing. The others characters are ok, but nothing more. The visuals and cgi is very good and I never doubted any of it. A point of criticism is that there where some very cheesy and predictable lines which took me out of the movie.

With nearly two hours of non-stop digital effects, mass destruction, cool transformations and plenty of action, my son had a jolly good time. Me, being an old-fashioned guy and a hater of computerized playgrounds, had quite many eye-rolling moments throughout the film. Still, I found ""Venom"" much more entertaining than the average installment in the ""Avengers"", ""Spiderman"", ""Thor"" or ""Captain America"" franchises, simply because the pivot character is (initially, at least...) a purely evil and undefeatable extraterrestrial force. I tried to look at ""Venom"" as a traditional type of alien invasion Sci-Fi/horror, with the nasty looking symbiote being reminiscent to the creatures in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""The Thing"". Although far superior to human beings, the alien is a parasite and needs a bodily host. The fact that he fires off slick one-liners and develops a conscience is most unfortunate, but commercially inevitable, I guess. Oh well, at least the big, ugly and monstrous creep bites off a couple of heads. I'm always in favor of that.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Granted, this has took a different direction but I liked it.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I thought Tom Hardy played the character extremely well. The introduction to the symbiotes was well done. Venom was a fantastic character and I really wanted to see more. Especially after what you see post credits (there's 2).A lot of reviewers say the script is a mess but it really isn't. It shows Eddies life, to turning to Venom and to them working together. It's a solid story, and one that I could watch again.The actors were brilliant, I can't fault any of that. It was fun, thrilling, exciting and has the right amount of humour in it. We saw Venom like we've never seen on the big screen, it was different but it was good.My only complaint is that the movie didn't feel long enough. We didn't actually see that much and that's my only complaint. If you're on the fence, go down and see it.

The humour was also well done in the movie as the movie does a better job of handling humour better than most Marvel Studio movies as in no way did I feel that the humour was out of place at all and with the funniest character being Tom hardy as Eddie Brock's encounters with the Venom symbiote at the beginning would make some funny interactions with other characters. The action was very fun especially with chase scene that would make the Mission impossible movies proud.For the Venom character before I say anything else yes Tom hardy's portrayal of Venom was better than Topher Grace's performance in Spider-Man 3. Venom was awesome he looked great, the voice was also great, most of the action scenes involving Venom were exciting, brutal and fun and funny...yes funny. Also, the way how they explained the Symbiotes was fine with the movie explaining its origins, weaknesses and characteristics. Another very important this was that not once did I wish for Spider-Man to be in the movie (would have been awesome if he was in tin though) as the movie does a believable job of telling Venom's story without Spider-Man and the movie was fine without the R-rating nuff said.What I did like about the movie or the ""bad thing"" about Venom was mostly the third half I don't know what happened but the last 40 minutes the movie was rushed had clunky action scenes and let me not get into the final battle or sequence of the movie cause it was just a big CGI mess with Venom vs Riot which was very hard to focus on especially with the movie being 3D,also some big plot holes involving characters happen and the villain...oh boy the villain, now Riz Ahmed who was the villain wasn't the problem the movie was, Riz character Drake had an okay reason for being a villain but it was never expanded on and ended up being a generic villain and another forgettable Superhero movie villain and when he became Riot the other symbiote character(Venom's enemy) it didn't help as his interactions with Venom were cheesy as hell and again the action scenes were clunky and messy.The second half wasn't as nearly as good as the first half of the movie with very little down time as you are being thrust into action scene after action like a Michael Bay Transformers movie. The time management in the second half was messy and rushed to say the least. There was a very weird scene between Venom and Eddie that happened (you'll know when you see it) and the story just wraps up outta nowhere as well.So, to conclude Venom is a fun movie with fun action scenes, good humour, a well-done performance by Tom Hardy, and cool end credit scene however the last third of the movie was rushed and clunky. As I said if you haven't seen it yet go see it and come up with your own opinion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yea why wouldn't he become the villain? That's never been done before. Venom has some comic book feels, but it's more of a sci-fi movie based on comic characters. When Venom speaks, it quickly goes from eerie to entertaining with the quick witted one liners he spews out, like his unrelated red and blue counterpart.It's not a bad movie, but it's not great.

For once, it's nice that a superhero movie is not trying to be another masterpiece but admitting it's flaws as they are, and building upon it. But it ultimately showcases why things change with it's extremely fast narrative which still feels unable to cover the whole thing in one line, instead what we get was a mashup of same things pounded over each other with everything repeated and predictable.I enjoyed the first half, and then was quite bored, as there was nothing except a plain obvious action extravaganza which is lackluster in front of bigger guys like MCU and even DC.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He eventually gets approached by a woman who wants him to bring Drake down but one of the alien subjects merges itself to him taking over his body.The film was originally supposed to be aimed at a mature audience but the producers decided on a light 15 rating (PG-13 in US) to grab a wider audience. Though there are some dark scenes they are not as dark as they should have to been. Whenever something brutal happens the camera cuts away and it's usually in a dark environment where we can't see much.There are a few decent chase scenes, one throughout the streets of San Francisco and another in a laboratory where Brock (Hardy) is getting to grips with his strength. The acting is fine from everyone else, nothing memorable but fine. Riz Ahmed plays the cold, sinister villain but he's a little bit dull and just appears bored throughout.It takes a while to get going but once the venom attaches itself to Hardy it gets interesting from there. Also voicing Venom Tom Hardy is easily the best part of the film, he's good at the dramatic scenes and he's very funny when he's mentally wrestling with the alien. It does some grim stuff like chewing off the heads of its victims and mentally tormenting Brock. But once they get to understand each other there is actually some chemistry between them.Unfortunately it rushes its climax and some character motivations feel forced for the convenience of the plot. There are a few rough edges with it suffering from a few pacing issues, dumb moments and some poor editing, but it's nonetheless a good adaptation of the character.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Venom isn't perfect but doesn't deserve the hate it's getting (seriously some compare it to Electra, WTF?) from the know-it-all critics. 
The interactions between Venom and Eddie (Tom Hardy) get quite amusing once he figures out that he has a parasite in him. Michelle Williams really seems out of sorts in this kind of movie. It almost seems like she did it for a paycheque rather than doing the movie because she likes the material. Her character is flat and kind of boring. Villain is very typical rich guy. 
My biggest problem with this movie I found plagued another movie, Spawn; it seems either Sony or the writing team couldn't decide on whether this movie should be PG-13 or rated R and it does hurt the movie. It really makes me curious as to the edited 40mins that were left out. Who knows maybe another version will be released like Batman vs Superman extended edition that was more well received than the theatrical version.
This is a perfectly good popcorn movie that will be enjoyed by adults but I wouldn't take a child under 10 to it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie exists purely as an overdue tie-in to 2007's Spider-Man 3: and boy does this ever show in the film's mid-2000s-inspired Hollywood aesthetics. It's got the hallmarks of a non-MARVEL Studios MARVEL film: stingy references related to the ONE central character in the movie due to rights issues and building up to sequels before even telling the story at hand.This film is an eccentrically empty action-adventure that's trying to tie-in with the modern superhero film craze taking the world by storm. Unfortunately, Venom isn't a very strong example of the genre's strengths: it's a movie made because 'it-had-to-be-done' for Sony (mind you it's not nearly as ATROCIOUS Fox's/Constantin Films' Fant4stic!). Venom's cynical but dumb fun, average story filled with 'ballsy' action sequences guaranteed to make fans of the character proud, but there's not a hell of a lot else to discover in this film.Venom gets 2.5/5 turds in the wind.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

So all characters in the scenes have to act & react in a believable way, otherwise the audience get taken out of the movie ( so unfortunately this poor choice of Director who in my honest opinion has never Directed anything that ended up being as good as it should have been was the main reason this film really failed overall ).Now the screenwriters have to take some of the blame too as they had too many characters saying too many unbelievable things, as looking at Jeff Pinkner's past writing not sure how he was allowed on such a big marvel film ( as he is not good ), as at least Scott Rosenberg was involved in some good movie screenplays such as Gone in 60 seconds & Con Air however most of the stuff he worked on was not good so again that would indicate that he was another poor choice for this.Kelly Marcel is still an unknown quantity ( she would have been the more junior writer on Venom one would imagine ) so we will have to see how she does on future productions, though really she needed to be put with much better more successful writers for us to know what her potential would have brought ( though as she is a good friend of Tom Hardy you would hope they would work well together on things ).Let us hope future Venom films get a better director & much more proven talented writers ( who actually understand the importance of having all the characters in the screenplay act & react believably ).Just because a film is based on a comic book film studios need to not think ""it's just for kids"" as first all all children deserve great writing to inspire them anyway & secondary these ""comic book characters"" are actually very well written stories ( in the comic books ) so have a lot more respect for the original writers & ensure scripts are much better.Let us hope Venom 2 with Tom Hardy will have a much better script & hopefully much better Director & much better senior screen writers.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

My group sat through 10+ minutes of credits to see what was after them, and we were lividly disappointed. It has nothing to do with Venom and it left us all genuinely angry. Please don't sit through the whole long list of credits only to disappoint yourselves. We all left the theater angry and ranting about it.","37 out of 73 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy as Eddy, aka, Venom is, for me the saviour of this film, as the rest of the cast are just cut and paste of characters we have already seen in other comic book films. No one stands out, but Hardy. The plot is pretty interesting, but is executed in a very goofy fashion. The pacing, however, was quick and witted, which, at least made the time go quicker. But I really wanted this film to be more dark and horrfying. Even though it's rated R, it feels like a PG 13 film, heck, eveb a standard PG at times. I am looking forward to Sony's future projects, but for me, this is one I mat not re-watch.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

After watching the film i found this movie to be funny than anything else.Plot of the movie is like any average cliche action film story . Lots of questions to be asked on the execution of the story but i guess action movies usually get away with stuff like logic behind every action. The bond between venom and eddie was very adorable. Some of the dialogues between them were really really funny and it really made my day. Anne and Eddie relationship was annoying to say the least.In acting department only Tom Hardy is worthy enough to be mentioned. He as usual lived up to his name with his sleek, calm and impeccable expressions and dialogues. Rest of the cast is disappointing to say the least and i wouldn't waste my and yours time to mention those lowly creatures.In short, if you are looking for a fun movie with lots action scenes and want to spend a happy time with your friends or partner than Venom is your answer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Played by Tom Hardy, directed by Ruben Fleischer, made for adult viewers - I was so hyped for this movie. But at the end Mr. Avarad and Sony had the final saying, so off course they had to turn it in to a trainwreck.Almost every scene is crammed up with forced ""whacky Humor"" and the narrative is as coherent as the one in ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"". Also felt the pacing of this movie like it whas made in the early 90ies. One does have to watch Eddie Brock stumbling around between a boring relationship and genericaly investigative journalism... for at least 40 minutes at the ""Beginning"" of the movie. After that, one is shortly rewarded with a couple of great scenes of interaction between Eddie and Venom... then you have to sit through the rest of the movie.But at least the movie is PG13,... So a lot of people will see this and that is all what counts in this business today. Congrats Sony!","12 out of 32 found this helpful.

He's the only person in the entire film who gives 110%, and the best parts of the movie are his interactions with him and Venom. Unfortunately, that's the problem with the movie; the only reason it's any good is BECAUSE of Hardy. He single handedly is trying to keep this movie afloat, and when your movie only has one thing going for it, it does not make it a good movie. Therefore, the most I can give this movie is a 6/10. If the sequel can give the supporting cast more to do, and keeps the pacing good throughout, then I truly believe it will succeed. Oh, and an R rating. It felt like this movie pushed the limits of a PG-13 movie, and the sequel could benefit from a hard R. Anyways, that's my piece. If you liked it, good for you. If you didnt like it, good for you. This is my take.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm also a big fan of Tom Hardy, this therefore was a must see film, despite the fact that the reviews I had seen were not overly positive.Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock an investigative journalist who through his work become 'infected' by an alien symbiote called Venom. He then seeks to save the world.Whilst this film is not quite up the, admittedly high, standard of Dr Strange, Deadpool and Ant Man & the Wasp for me I really enjoyed it. Tom Hardy is up to his usual standard and there are some good action sequences. Eddies conversations with his Venom-self add a nice extra dimension to the character. All in all a must watch for Marvel, Super-Hero and comic fans. My partner and I did wonder if they should have taken Venom into the x-rated comedy zone occupied by Deadpool but it is no problem that they did not.Apparently Tom Hardy has signed up for 2 more Venom films - great news! There is so much that can be done with this character I cannot wait.Great fun and recommended for all except those with no love of comic/superhero films.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The character is a sentient alien symbiote with an amorphous, liquid-like-form, who survives by bonding with a host, usually human. This dual-life form receives enhanced powers and usually refers to itself as Venom. The symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in The Amazing Spider-Man, with a full first appearance as Venom in The Amazing Spider-Man. The Venom symbiotes first human host was spider-man who eventually discovered its true nefarious nature and separated himself from the creature in The Amazing Spider-Man with a brief rejoining five months later in Web of spider-man. The character has been featured in various other media, including animated series, films, and video games.
This film is very good and artistic. It was a super genius idea for Ruben Fleischer to direct a spin-off based off the most famous villain from Spider-Man. Not only did they bring him back as a villain like in spider-man but turning him into a superhero. Venom begins with a journalist named Eddie Brock who gets superpowers by being infected by an extraterrestrial symbiote which species plans to invade earth and nothing else you could expect besides Venom just going to killing around people more like in his super-villain routines.
Venom is a American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name produced by Columbia Pictures. Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the first film is the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters. Directed by Ruben Fleischer from screenplay by Jeff Pinker, Scott Rosenberg, and Kelly Marcel, it stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, alongside Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Scott Haza, and Reid Scott. Venom was released in the United States on October 5, 2018. The film was a box office success, becoming the seventh highest grossing film of 2018, with over $856 million worldwide, and set several box office records for an October release.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I enjoyed Tom Hardy's acting and his character's relationship with Venom, ideally I would have liked the two to have come into contact a little earlier in the movie. I need to give it another watch, but it didn't feel like there was an awful lot of Venom in the movie, I guess you could put that down to Brock and Venom being kind of the same character. The story felt very generic and quite slow to start off with, it's a typical marvel story but it felt rather boring at times. I am certainly hopeful for a potential sequel and would definitely be willing to give it another chance, even if it was just to see more of Eddie and Venom.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's quite farcical and extreme and it may have been just the scenery and location, but some of it seemed like they were using 'Mrs Doubtfire' as a model for it.If it wasn't for the fact that Tom Hardy is my biggest celebrity crush, I might have turned it off before Venom even turned up.It's always a shame that with the first instalments/origin stories for these characters that they take so long to get started and established. That doesn't always mean that the sequel is any better, but it does cut out the explanation of where they get their powers and why they were such a hard luck story to begin with.It seems like it's the same format as a lot of others in this genre. A dangerous scientist with lots of money and big ideas that will do anything to prove how good he is and the little man who has to fight him. It's all quite predictable. I'd like to see them give it a bit more thought, consider what is already out there. Certainly it bares a strong resemblance to Ant-Man and most of the Spider-Man's, not least because the girlfriend is just another Mary-Jane.It's almost as if it had been made by DC instead of Marvel. It's definitely lacking the finesse of the majority of 'The Infinity Saga' and it's like a hybrid of 'Spidey' and 'Deadpool', but without the comedic talent or CGI budget. They didn't try hard enough to make it funny or they didn't make it serious enough, it fell flat in the middle.Venoms change of heart from his original plan is a bit crap and convenient too and barely even noticeable. I'm glad I was paying attention at that moment.If I hadn't seen Tom in 'Wuthering Heights' (2009) I might say that this is his worst character and production. I can only hope that as they have seen fit to make a second one, that they have given him a better story and script to work with. We all know that he, at least, is capable of so much better. It wouldn't hurt for him to be at least topless in the next one either.627.75/1000.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

when it comes to the story it was so plain but it didn't disturb me and also villain was so cliche and secondary characters were quite ordinary.
On the other hand Tom hardy's portrayal of venom was so good and I think his performance carried the movie, if it would be an R rated movie , it could have been more successful, who knows? also I liked interaction between Eddie Brock and Venom I wish there could be more.

In the end I would like to say that Tom hardy is now in the league of RDJ, Hugh jackman,Johnny depp because he has truly given justice to this icon and I would love to see another venom flick because of Hardy.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Occasionally it works, but mostly it doesn't. Mr. Hardy does his best but his character, Eddie Brock is just so 2 dimensional and badly written. Are we to believe a top notch journalist is actually such a loser? Tom is also far too old to play this part, Eddies very many character flaws could be excusable in a 25 year old but not someone clearly in his early 40s.
I'm not normally a big fan of CGI extravaganzas with run times of 2 hours plus with only 5 minutes worth of plot. In fairness, Venom is attempting to break that mould but I must admit to feeling a bit cheated. Is that it? Isn't there anything more? No, there isn't....","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It wasn't boring at any time and very fun to watch from the beggining to the end.
Also Tom Hardy feels like a perfect match to the role and does a fantastic job.
The only negatives i can find are that some dialogues seem a little too simple and rushed and the battle between venom and riot have bad cgi and doesn't look very good.
In conclusion one thing that bothers me in most of marvel movies is that every line has to contain a cringy stupid joke and like 1/10 jokes are actually good enough. In venom there aren't too many jokes but they are very amusing and really make the movie better!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Her role would have been much better as a friend rather than a GF.Carlton drake 's reason for procuring the symbiote is so bland making his character so one dimensional ! Also , it is no spoiler that the villain of this movie is also another symbiote. And venom's reason for fighting against his own kind is downright rushed !So the question is it worth the watch ?Answer : ABSOLUTLEY YES !The only reason the movie sells really well is for the love for our anti-heroic symbiote ! The venom character is the only thing that you came to watch! So if you keep that in mind , the above negative reviews can be given a pass !Now there is one mid credit scene , by now everyone knows 'cuz thanks to the internet !

Venom is both intimidating and somewhat comedic (as true to the comics). Eddie Brock looks like a terrible sweaty mess which is such a nice change of pace from Marvel shirtless male glamour shots. Also since we're talking about the positives Venom's voice actor and the CG they for Venom is just perfect, with the only issue to that statement being that venom doesn't have the symbol on his chest since he hasn't been bonded with Spider-Man yet.The only major downside (I feel) against this film are the absence of Spider-Man and the presence of a villain (Riot) that just feels like filler. Whenever Riot or the knock-off Oscorp CEO were on screen the film is significantly less interesting then when it's just Eddy and Venom. I glad that they made the relationship work between Eddy and Venom but the sequel is basically doomed to fail unless it's a reboot.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was released last week and I couldn't wait to watch it. So, I've went to my favourite cinema right away, but decided to finally try 4DX. And the movie is appropriate for it.
I can agree that it was definitely a great experience. The movie is full of action and immersion into it was pretty deep I'd say.
Will be Venom a good creature, or bad one? Will Venom control Eddie Brock by absorbing him, or the last one gonna be in charge? Is Venom a stupid bloodthirsty animal, or is he smart? These are question you have in your head before going to the cinema. The filmmakers tried to keep intrigue as much longer.
I'm a fan of Marvel movies and waited for this one, of course. In general, it's a cool film. Graphics is incredible. Venom and other species there look so real like in any other movie. And there is also my favorite Michelle Williams. But, Tom Hardy was on point as well. It won't be fair, if not to tell that the cast is just amazing.
But, actually that's almost all what I can say about it. If I haven't watched it in 4DX, I suppose that my impression could be even worse, unfortunately. Don't know what the authors did think about, 'coz the plot is so predictable. Why they decided to do it like that? Wonderful graphics, but simple plot. Hmm...
Of course, there is perfect humor like in other Marvel films, but not so much, like in Iron Man, or Deadpool, what you'd expect.
In any case, Venom is a great movie for watching in the cinema exactly 'coz of its marvelous graphics and action. And you'll for sure find something to like it for.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

He lives with his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) and life for Eddie is overall good... until...Eddie Brock is asked to investigate a celebrity, but he pushes the boundaries during the interview, costing him his career and sadly his girlfriend. Eddie is down on his luck until he continues to investigate the assigned case and comes in contact with an alien-type symbiote which releases an alter-ego character known as VENOM.For those who are unaware, this film is a stand alone film and can be watched without viewing all of the previous Spider-Man instalments, or the other Marvel films. To this day I have always been a huge fan of Spider-Man and also admit to a guy crush (aka guy love) on the actor Tom Hardy. In my opinion, the man can do no wrong in cinema today. From the announcement of this film and seeing the trailers, I could only pray this film could finally do what Spider-Man 3 failed to do back in 2007.I'm proud to say that Tom Hardy who plays Eddie Brock (and provides the dark deep voice of Venom) is incredible. Eddie Brock as a character is believable and even more so once he comes in contact with Venom. Eddie at times looks his absolute worst and somewhat gross as a result of his new encounter with the symbiote. Venom as a character looks and sounds amazing. The power combined of both Eddie and Venom is where the review score points come into play (even if some patience is required to get things underway). Once the 1st act has passed, the film goes into full gear.My disappointments; however, are found with those characters around Eddie & Venom. This includes the performance of Eddie's girlfriend (Michelle Williams), who I found unbelievable and annoying on screen (sorry, I'm just being honest here!). Similar comments could be made about the film's villain who also just doesn't feel right given the film's dark and gritty tone. Don't get me wrong, I feel these actors are awesome, but how they have been used along with the film's dialogue feels poor considering how much screen time they take up.I also found myself distracted during multiple occasions with some of the film's editing choices. Some scenes have unexpected cuts and edits that simply don't make sense or match up. One example is Eddie walking down the street during bright daylight, then suddenly after walking into a store it is night time outside. Slightly annoying and disjointed moments like these kept me thinking that I was missing out on other scenes or large cuts were made. Either way, I felt like there should be an unedited/uncut version coming to Bluray (fingers crossed). Either way, as a result of the editing some moments don't feel like a final product.Overall, I'm thankful to witness a greater version of the well known Marvel character ""Venom"". On screen Tom Hardy (as one would expect) does not disappoint or fail this role. I did; however, felt rather disappointed by the surrounding characters and bizarre editing choices that I found rather distracting or annoying. Hopefully corrections are made should we ever see... a sequel.5.7/10

The first 55 minutes are very interesting and keep you engrossed.As soon as Brock turns in to Venom, that is when things start going downhill. It's as if the first hour of the movie was directed by a completely different director than the one who directed the second half. Riz Ahmad's Riot is laughable. The dialogue between Venom and Riot is cringe worthy. The final battle scene between the two is embarrassing.I really wanted to enjoy the film but the second half and ending of the film was pathetic.

You walk away feeling that maybe an 18 certificate would have done the character Justice and you do want to know more about the 40 minutes left on the cutting room floor. There is plenty of action (in the second half mind) and venom himself works well (most of the time as CGI characters can be a little too quick in the real world). It is amazing too how quickly we humans can heal after being thrown 20 or 30 feet into a car! They do bounce back quickly in this film as if nothing happened. I did like the relationship between Tom hardy and venom and thought that some of the wisecracks worked. People's reactions to venom differ from 'oh for the love of God what is that...run' to 'oh, ok'. Imagine how you would react to him!Yes, there are missed opportunities and we should have got to venom quicker in the film (as some reviews have noted a bit of bordem) but I will certainly get it when it comes out 4k/ Dolby Atmos as it did sound great and I am sure I will enjoy it more of repeated viewing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not against trying something new or taking another direction with these type of movies but this failed on SO many levels. The pacing was excruciating. The first 40 minutes or so is worthless filler garbage. And a good chunk of the action pure CGI cheesefest. Not decent CGI. Really bad cheesy CGI like what you see in the early 2000s movies like the Incredible Hulk. The villain is the definition of cliché and does absolutely nothing except fill a gap in the void of nonsense that is this so called movie.

Being the first movie, yes it had to lay the groundwork to establish the characters, and yes it did lack the development here and the CGI was a bit chaotic. 
Was it as good as the avengers, No. But did I enjoy it, Yes! 
Tom hardy was brilliant, Michelle Williams a little wooden. 
It was action packed, and funny. I wish it had gone for the R rating and been that little bit edgier. If Deadpool can do a PG version for Christmas then I hope the DVD release of Venom has an R rating release.

Therefore, I expected this to be a hot steaming pile of dog droppings, but actually it wasn't all that bad. There is certainly things wrong with it for sure, and it definitely isn't the best comic book movie of the year, but this could have been a lot worse. The opening sequence was well done which was followed by a long stretch of the film basically doing nothing, except character development and exposition scenes, it just talking and talking and talking...and more talking. I was growing impatient as I just wanted to see the thing I paid money for, and the reason why I wanted to see this movie, and that is Venom. It wasn't until I was halfway through the film before he finally appears. From then on however, the film turns to a whole new direction, quickly becoming the film I wanted to see. Venom was frickin' awesome. The CGI on him is flawless, the design is menacing and intimidating, the relationship built between Eddie Brock and Venom becomes genuine, like you don't want them to split apart. Tom Hardy is a class act, and one of the most talented actors working today. The complexity in his acting as well as tackling the challenge of playing two characters and keeping it real is a testament to Hardy as a performer. And yes, Hardy provides the voice of Venom. The action scenes were fast-paced and sometimes vigorously violent. The fight scenes were good, but one fight sequence I had a problem with because it took place at night, and when you a characters wearing black it can be hard to see what's going on. Riz Ahmed is good acting the role, the character however is underdeveloped and utterly useless. Everybody else does a fine job. Clearly the best thing about this film is Venom himself and the relationship between Venom and Eddie Brock. That alone makes this film overall enjoyable, somewhat engaging, intense, along with some mistakes with the first half of the film, one fight sequence, and needless supporting characters. I wouldn't go into this expecting Black Panther or anything, but it's well worth the investment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It doesn't toy with the audience between moral and immoral to a serious extent like other MCU titles -- it's incredibly black & white in its portrayal. While the story is simple, the writing is relatively well done; it's funny when it needs to be, slightly scary at some parts, but ultimately leads to a easy and fun watching experience.The action was quality, CGI very well done, and so on so forth. It's worth a watch, although not very memorable.I wish MCU devoted itself towards creating some very quality, stylistic films, but we'll see how they carry out the superhero ideals in the future.

-CGI for transformations is cool and the symbiote moving by itself looks well done.
-I like the plot, especially for it being a solo Venom movie. However, I don't know how people are saying it's a ""break"" from the Marvel template. It's not special, and the general storyline is very similar to most MCU films.The Bad:
-As most people agree, this absolutely should have been R-rated. It's a dark character (which I feel like gets detracted from by near constant cheesy jokes), and there's even a scene where a guy's head gets bitten off that's so censored you can hardly even tell what happened. Making Venom PG-13 would be like making Deadpool PG-13. It's just not going to be as good.

During previous months I heard tons of negative opinions about ""Venom"", so I was completely turned off. Then one day, I really didn't know what to watch, so I remembered this movie. My expectations were really low, and maybe this is why I enjoyed it so much. Eddie Brock is very funny and charismatic. Without any doubts one of the most interesting characters portrayed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Actors were pretty good, but Tom Hardy is outstanding everyone else with his performance, and honestly Michelle Williams that plays Brock's fiance, was pretty sloppy. A real pity, considering that there are many positive and expressive females in almost every Marvel movie such as Carter (in Captain America) or Penny (in the Iron Man Saga).Special effects were stunning and I found some scenes very original and so different than the usual superhero movie. I really like the Venom design. Terrifying and deadly. Creators did a good job. Stunts were amazing, fight scenes are breathtaking.I liked how screenwriters developed the relationship between the alien Venom and Brock. It was for sure a different way to analyze a possible link between humanity and aliens. I don't understand all these critiques related to this movie: it is funny, and for sure a little bit different than the average Marvel movie. I recommend it and I give to it 7 out of 10 stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Certainly better than the sum of its parts deserves.Largely, I think it's because I've always loved be character. And seeing a movie based on Venom is a cool thing by default, even when so much of the opportunity is wasted. The best part of this whole mess by far is the character of Venom, itself. It looks like Venom should look, and fights how Venom should fight. The few action scenes pretty much saved the movie for me, and without those, this movie scores much worse.As for the bad, well there's a lot to choose from. The tone of the movie does not fit, and is not really consistent from one moment to another. Venom is a violent, brutal character, and does not mesh well with the lame jokes and all-around goofiness that the movie frequently delves into. This carries over into Tom Hardy's portrayal of Eddie Brock. It's just off, wrong, and far too silly. Michelle Williams is utterly wasted in a character that's barely memorable (other than the brief forest scene that's admittedly awesome), the villain is boring and cliche, and the first half of the movie (before the Venom character appears) is a dull slog.Finally, the lack of Spider-Man as a part of Venom's introduction/origin is a shame. The two characters are so tightly linked that Spidey's absence is sorely missing.Still, it's Venom. As terrible as the first half or so of the movie was, I was pretty dang invested once the symbiote started doing its thing. I can't really recommend this move to anyone, even fellow fans of the character. It (barely) worked for me, but I'm under no illusions that this movie is up to standard with the really good superhero movies we've been spoiled by the last several years. I really hope the sequel is better. If the after-credits scene is any indication... it won't be.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Although the film had its intense, scary moments, it was another marvel comedy. However, this was a pleasant surprise and made the film even more enjoyable. Tom Hardy played the role brilliantly, absolutely nailed it. But do not expect a violent horror film. The three times he did eat someone's head, it was either not viewable to the audience or contained no blood and gore and happened mostly off screen. Apart from all of this, the film felt short, rushed at points and the direction of the story changes throughout.

"6","/10","A fun character stuck in a generic plot. Not the best, but not the worst","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4386446/?ref_=tt_urv","paulijcalderon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21101534/?ref_=tt_urv","8 October 2018","Hey, I didn't expect to be so entertained by ""Venom"", but I would be lying if I said I wasn't. First thing to say is that the highlight throughout this ""symbiote"" film is Tom Hardy's performance combined with the fun design and personality of his newfound alien buddy. So Eddie Brock is our main character and our perfect host (as Venom himself would say). At first I was pretty OK with him being this ""hip"" reporter who rides motorcycles and isn't afraid to ask risky questions. However, there's a decision early on that changes his mentality. And that made a great impact because I found myself siding with him. Eddie quickly becomes a sad character who's trying to survive and make his life better. He's not a typical good guy or a bad guy. He's very nuanced in a way with his own faults and qualities. This made him believable and like a real human who ends up in the middle of some crazy stuff. I get the feeling they let Tom Hardy have lots of freedom to come up with any idea for the portrayal of Eddie. I wouldn't have minded to see a simple drama story instead. It would've been the life of a failed reporter working his through difficult/sad times in life. That could have made a more heartfelt movie, but we gotta have the comic book things here. It's ""Venom"" after all.Here's the thing, which I'm sure most people have been saying, but the relationship between Eddie and Venom is the heart of this otherwise thin plot. If it wasn't for them, you'd be watching a super generic action film about evil scientists and what not. I didn't end up caring for what was up with that corporation run by Riz Ahmed. And that guy is a good actor. In the end though he just becomes a cliche with no real personality left. The final action scenes were a mess. A bunch of CGI goo flying from on side to the other in shaky close-ups. Reframe that, guys. You don't have to get so close when the big alien guys are fighting. Use some more wides there, it's fine. Let the choreography do the job. Other than that the cinematography wasn't bad. It's coherent and follows the story nicely. It was just that ending fight that got frustrating and bland. Michelle Williams is always terrific, but underused here. I'm glad she actually signed on though. Her character manages to stand because she has the talent to make a character feel very much alive, and not a walking cardboard cut-out. Jenny Slate made an admirable effort, but again, her potential is quickly wasted. What also bugged me was this reference to Kryptonite. It confuses me because does that mean the DC comics exists within the Marvel world or something? Was it Ruben Fleischer letting the actors improvise? No idea, but a line was enough for me to start overthinking. And why, oh why did we not start with Carnage as the villain? It would have been much stronger. He's pretty much a psychopath and enough for Venom to understand where to draw the line of what's too much for an anti-hero. It's a villain that would be a deadly match and especially since he would strike fear and genuine tension. Riz Ahmed, you're great, but the villain here will easily be forgotten.I will end with a positive note, and it's that I laughed when I watched this movie. When Eddie starts hearing Venom's voice in his head things get brilliantly interesting. He goes completely insane at a point when he can't understand what's happening to him. I mean, there's another consciousness in your body who starts controlling you all the sudden. You would go crazy. Hardy plays the stress, the exhaustion and the general confusion so well. You wish the rest of the plot was as good as the effort in his performance. A scene I thought was perfect was when he interrupts his ex-love's dinner and proceeds to bathe in water filled with lobsters while eating them and yelling at the voice in his head. Oh, and he's also trying to convince people that a corporation is evil. I laughed quite a bit, it was really good. And you feel bad for Eddie, he's becoming an emotional wreck and it's near impossible to not wish he would get better. So there it is. Venom's character was funny, Tom Hardy's performance lifts the lazy script and you'll be amused by this wicked friendship. You'll be entrained, but you'll also wish the execution was more on par with what this concept deserves. Could've been better, could've been worse.

This film should have been a R RATED film not a PG-13 rating where Venom biting people heads off I never knew he could do that to me I wanted to see close up shots for it I wanted to see it but no it's PG-13 film ?? this is isn't spider-man or ant-man films this film is dark but not dark enough like R RATED style, I thought this film did good I like it I would watch it again and again. But end of day I would say it's not best movie I have ever seen, because Venom is evil not a Superhero he is anti-hero, Venom is meant to be violent dark, scary like a dark marvel horror movie that's how I wanted to see with Venom sometimes with marvel characters you got to see who they are like dead pool the name what he does it's not a kids movie, like Logan it's not a kids movie or look at blade, punisher they are not PG-13 if they were they would flop ! because those are not friendly type of characters those movies aren't for kids, so as this movie should not be for kids, PG-13 Venom sounds like scary name, he is evil looking would scare every single kid even if I say to my family I would like to see it my family would never let to see it because it looks like a horror movie not a kids PG-13 rating even if they look at rating they won't I wanted to see Hellboy but family didn't let me because I was 4 on that time again it looks like a dark horror sometimes with kids they need to wait because every parent is different if this movie was R RATED it would work a lot better and better over again seeing more violence more close up shots where Venom bites off people heads off, more horror darkness type of thing. Then that's when parents won't let kids to watch it but I don't understand why this PG-13 movie with horror and darkness is and Venom is not a friendly character not hero at all he is evil pure type of character.I thought their things I like about movie the action was fun, the movie wasn't boring like 2 hour long film, it was watchable fast forward not a slow boring type of movie, Tom Hardy I am not biggest fan of him but the role he did was fine nothing wrong with it I never really loved him, I didn't like him in dark knight rises of his mask sounds like Sean Connery. I thought tom is alright actor not best but not fan of him but I like him in this role, Venom was expected to begin both a new franchise and a new shared universe independent of the MCU, and was initially aiming for an R-rating on a smaller budget, inspired by 20th Century Fox's success doing so with the X-Men films Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017).Sony's director shortlist for the film was believed to include Adi Shankar, known for his dark, R-rated takes ""on the properties he grew up on"" and Adam Wingard I will not be suspired if he directed this movie. I mean as a director I would picked David Leitch or Jonathan Hensleigh they made their marvel movies R RATED and correct and dark as well. But this movie is not acting series like in trailer because in trailer movie looks series but in movie there are some stupid funny scenes like it's trying to be funny but it's not. You can have humour but not going over top, being stupid.I thought villain was very weak actor should got someone else as villain different actor Riz Ahmed very weak villain should different actor to be villain to be that character, Carlton Drake / Riot. I thought he wasn't good villain lame villain very boring. I thought action in movie was fun, I thought direction of this movie is good but at least theirs silly scene when all black staff went into dog I thought that was stupid. I thought some of the dialogue/story is clunky and there's some plot holes and missing info. It should been R RATED because Venom is not friendly character I thought it looked bit lame with Venom is PG should been R RATED. The action is fun but could been a lot better I mean theirs better ideas to have better action scenes. I wanted to be more sequels of this movie but with a different director who could do a R strong RATING of movie sequel needs to be more in proofed like first purge sucked sequel was better Purge Anarchy. Venom is good but not best movie in 2018 I understand the critics are disappointment because Venom is not a friendly character and another thing villain sucked, it should been R RATED showing all violence and gore in film because Venom is not a kids movie it's should be full on violence not PG like Spider-man I am like this isn't Spider-man movie, I think sequel needs different director and writers for venom franchise I am sick and tired of PG-13 I want mega franchise of R RATED dark Marvel movies like this, Venom is not a kids movie not a friendly type this is why it flopped.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

True fans of the comics will recognise this as being one of Venoms trademark traits, twisted somewhat offensive and dark humour, and for the most part it lands. This film plays more like a character study or more accurately a study of Eddie brocks relationship with Venom, these parts of the movie (I say parts not moments as they take up the majority of the film) are fantastic, Tom Hardys performance is yet again phenomenal his love for the character shines through. The supporting characters are a little flat and 1 diemensional and they're main purpose is aiding Eddie through the story. The Action scenes are well made for the most part the first action scene is incredible! And the last fight scene is pretty decent they're are a few low points throughout the film, but these are only seconds due to the films incredibly fast pacing that oddly suits the tone of Venoms character always demanding for things to happen immediately, impatient if you will. Some will find it hard to keep track of the discrepancies of the story due to this, as the high octane movie fails to make room for breathing. All in all a restricted yet still very enjoyable movie that will please fans and newcomers alike inviting them into Sonys new darker vision for its universe of all things marvel are too terrified to attempt... 8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even the short runtime was responsible for the failure as it denied the characters from any sort of proper development.
Though the movie took the wrong route in a lot of areas it did do Venom right. The symbiote from outer-space who has been a well-known nemesis of 'Spider-Man' was interpreted as a straight out evil character with zero emotions in Sam Raimi's third Spider-Man film and was portrayed the same way in many of the animated adaptations of the character. But 'Venom' took a different route as opposed to its predecessors and that was being honest to the comics. Venom was not as funny as he was in this movie but it did manage to show the inner struggle of Venom and its host - Eddie Brock which instantly makes both of them likable. 
The major mistake and disappointment was Riot, the villain of the story who suffered from the same problem every other character suffered from - insufficient screen time. He was portrayed as another generic villain with a lame, 'Conquering the world' evil motivation. Even the 'Life Foundation' and it's head Carlton Drake who was constantly mentioned to have a strong and powerful influence was only mentioned to have it and was never really shown properly when it had the chance to.
The only other thing left to say is to wait for the mid-credit scene as it sets up a potential sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The character set ups are done well with a great first third of the movie. As Eddie and Venom become one, it is interesting and a good watch to see action scenes- all of which are done well and something the film and CGI team can be proud of. Some true comic lovers may not appreciate the comedy elements, however I think this acts as a good device to set Venom apart in this universe. The film itself could have been longer, with the main plot seeming rushed as to Venoms purpose. I put this down to the need to spend time in character development during the film, and so, a sequel will hopefully be able to provide more on the plot front now that we have established the main character. Well worth a watch with an optimistic future.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Weak picture with the bluish dark effect in most of the scenes to give you the dark feeling which was noisy for me. My gosh, The story was just bad, The first 36 minutes building till we reach to Venom was disastrous , Eddie's relation with Anne (Michelle Williams) and it's very fast progress in three or four shots which didn't even make an impact for it's existence with Anne's character completely neglected and was unnecessary for the film with such the worst screenplay written for characters you can hear and I can't say that Michelle was even acting. Tom is the only interesting thing in the film of course with an average performance for the character that I didn't use to from him but I can say that it's the story along with the bad direction. The Vfx were very silly and quite disastrous in actions scenes but for Venom's design and appearance along with some fight scenes. The music written was very ordinary. The worst beginning I could imagine for the film because of the Vfx along with the story and how it was all done. Also the villain performed by Riz who is a weak actor for me with such a terrible performance and didn't even understand what he liked about the character. The cinematography just didn't fell right in the shots it took and the action scenes with the bad editing which didn't bring a fine picture with noticeable details cause of too much cuts and the scenes of showing off in the movie was not well done though it's good. The relation between Eddie and Venom and it's fast progress and the unreasonable turns it took rapidly with the reactions of Eddie and the most silly plot which led to the end from Venom wasn't convincing and he wasn't presented much powerful as I thought it would be. Also the story had that replayed scenes in different situation like the one when his neighbor was playing loud music with the silly angry reaction he took which could be understood If it was with Venom but it was before him and then happened again with the same reaction but with Venom so, are you telling me you are kinda stupid!?. Also the scene where the editing copied WWE and did that triple replay of a damn car hitting the front of two damn cars blocking the way for what was the replay I ask , did you see it the most dangerous move in the film!!. Finally , some black comedy came out of Venom which was pretty funny along with the entertaining yet not reasonable and fast relation with Eddie turned out to be fun and entertaining after all and even If the movie was R rated , it wouldn't have been better. 4.5/10 for the average Vfx and entertainment of Venom with Tom hardy and the surprises in the film and being harsh with the rating because of the high expectations and wasting a story where the hero is Villain but doesn't mean that you watch it and have enjoy in the end.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

One of those things is that ""You can not do a Venom movie without Spider-man!"". I am here to tell THOSE people, you are WRONG!
As those people are no doubting shouting profanities at my review right now, they have not considered that I went into this movie knowing NOTHING about Venom, Spider-man, Eddie Brock, Symbiotes, or how Venom came to be in the comics. 
This part here is the actual review.
The movie was good. Not bad, but not good. Think of early/mid 90's super-hero films. (Ang Lee's Hulk, Batman Forever).
The good parts about the movie is that Tom Hardy gave an excellent performance in this role as he has done in so many films. He really put effort in this movie and did as best as he could with what he was given. 
The relationship between Venom and Brock worked well to the point of you understand why Sony took a gamble on this movie. It actually makes you hope that Sony decides to extend the character to other movies.
The bad: This movie felt like it was filmed in scenes, seriously. All movies are filmed out of order and assembled together, however the ideal is for you as the viewer to watch the movie from start to finish in a complete nature. However when watching this film all you can see is scene/cut/next scene. Like a puzzle being put together. Also the relationship aspect in the movie was crow-bared in, to which it should have been left out. 
If you go see this movie, do your best to view it as I did. Forget the Venom you know in the comics or in previous tv shows. Just try to see the version in the movie, and you might have an enjoyable time. 
Please, like all Marvel movies, do stay for the 2 after movie scenes. 1 comes mid credit and one at the end of the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy struggles with his part for the first 20 minutes but once he finds his feet, he's good. When Venom appears the film gets rolling and is good fun, although slightly illogical in places - but who cares when your dealing with a film about an alien symbiote ? It does not feel like a Marvel or Spider Man film, but so what ? it isn't either of those !
I enjoyed it and found myself scratching my head a bit to try and match the critics opinions to what I was watching, perhaps we just compare everything to Avengers these days. It's good fun, shelve the critics opinions for a couple of hours and go enjoy yourself.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The acting from Elisabeth Williams is a little underplayed, but not to the point that it's unwatchable.

"5","/10","A flawed, erratic film adaptation for one of the most famous, savage and finest Spider-Man villains","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4518520/?ref_=tt_urv","FelipeCarrillo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61617922/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2018","Marvel Comics, the glorious House of Ideas of a troubled age, is one hell of a phenomenon. It has not only been at the top films at the global box office each year or nearly utterly ruled the superhero genre for ten years now, but also its characters and stories have stuck voraciously in the pop-culture of an entire century. Stronger than ever and about to wrap the most important phase of its timeline up, the subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company has ventured deeper into the industry by ordering new TV shows, a wide range of merchandising, books and comics; an expected movement if you know who's behind all this, of course, Disney is and as a proof just look at the reborn ""Star Wars"" saga. Invading unexplored places, it made the decision to expand one of its most acclaimed multi-universes: Spider-Man's. Tom Holland caught everyone off guard by putting the spider suit on in ""Captain America: Civil War"" two years ago contracted not only by Marvel Studios, but also Sony Pictures. Co-producing Spidey's solo outings because of a fruitful agreement finally signed between both studios last year, Marvel is generous, but not trusting, therefore, still has most of the creative control over the projects. The companies' deal for Spider-Man's rights doesn't include movies as part of the gargantuan MCU, instead, Sony is up to conditionally weave standalone films - such as the ""X-Men"" franchise, ""Deadpool"" and ""Fantastic Four"" by 20th Century Fox, - and all the box office bank still goes directly to them. Sooner than later, Sony Pictures revealed the list of upcoming productions, among which was one of the Marvel's most ambitious ideas that got stuck in the infamous development hell for almost ten years: Venom.In a world with too many superheroes, an anti-hero might be the most befitting antidote to fresh up the heroism-and-rightness-populated scene; as far as cinema is concerned, DC goes ahead of it, with ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Watchmen"" on opposite corners of the same ring. Marvel has followed much the same pattern, going through fire and water to conceive a new gem as piercing as original after bringing the Merc with a Mouth to the big screen; alas, has made the same mistake of its top contender.
At the last minute, ""Venom,"" which was supposed to keep going R-rated comic book adaptations, took a left turn, an utterly financial one, losing its primal R rating to drown in PG-13 waters. The film stumbles quick-fire, toning down material that must be naturally and strictly violent, extreme and frightening; the artistic vision opted to fall off from the original source in tone, becoming a mainly comedy amalgam lacking in visual appeal that if wasn't for the central figure's commitment, would easily have been on the darker side of the Marvel universe. After a hellish pre-production process, it's strange why Ruben Fleischer was the one to sit in the director's chair, a filmmaker renowned mainly for wisecracking ""Zombieland."" Marvel looking for new, fitting voices to take over its emblematic worlds is entirely understandable, however, it seems self-defeating to pick up a cinéaste who doesn't deeply know the company's storytelling-filmmaking dynamics. It's no surprise that Fleischer does a great job erecting a messy occasionally-watered-down buddy-comedy that shines by the symbiote-host duality employed incredibly halfway the running. The idea is hilarious off and on, aligning storytelling and performance organically, however, after Eddie comes to terms with the ""parasite,"" this funny underpinning spreads out abruptly along the ham-fisted third act.On the contrary, superhero-action-wise, the filmmaker gets unmistakably lost in a disaster of plots, skipping from a breakup with Anne Weying to a ""The Terminator""-esque body-hopping around the globe that reminds Disney Channel's ""Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior."" Poorly original and harshly introduced, such narrative threads run down the golden reputation the anti-hero has achieved in the comics pages along the years. By far it was clear this director wasn't a healthy choice for the character and yet Sony and Marvel refused to change its plans; we have now a Venom movie, a shonky superhero movie, and a good comedy at once, which, according to predictions, has put the worldwide box office on fire.
In a feature film that takes nearly forty minutes to land, the tone and pace are atrocious, yet there doesn't lie its greatest sin. ""Venom"" is on a knife-edge because of visual raucousness. With a hilariously bad CGI, the pictures, ironically composed by the very same cinematographer responsible for the dreamy urban landscapes from Bradley Cooper's Oscar-hungry ""A Star Is Born,"" suffer from a serious on-screen incomprehensibility reinforced by an oversaturation of black at key moments. Matthew Libatique won't ever be a bad cinematographer, he's flat-out an artist, hence it's far-fetched to see these opaque, ghastly set-pieces, visually unappealing, scrambles of semi-liquid creatures fighting on the screen untidily. Visually and narratively, this is oddly an outdated flick, coming likely from the 2000s, long before DC-Marvel's monopoly was a reality; nowadays, the movie feels out of place, an aesthetically huge misfire.The core cast is made up by four actors. Michelle Williams is larger-than-life love interest/ex-fiancé Anne Weying in the style of Jane Foster or Lois Lane; however, Williams' character is far from reaching the same plot importance of the previous two women; notwithstanding, the four-time Academy-award nominee embraces her role, understands it and does her best to attempt at shaping a fine audience-actor link.Jenny Slate as Dr. Dora Skirth doesn't mean a special addition, a disposable character that helps to move the plot forward; her performance, reserved and shy, is goodish, free of edges, one more prey of a wretched screenplay.Riz Ahmed, who is used to delivering good performances, as Carlton Drake/Riot is a half-baked villain, I.E., his motives do not convince, his actions fueled by stereotyped gears do not infuse fear or dislike, his bad boy is nothing more than the heartless monster of a corporate experiment who will destroy the world in favor of evolution; Ahmed should never have signed up for this.But who really does the ""heavy-lifting"" is the fantastic Tom Hardy. Praised by his taciturn, top-notch performances in masterpieces directed by Christopher Nolan and George Miller, Hardy grinds away at his physical performance portraying both the Symbiote and Eddie Brock, two roles close to his career. The ""Locke"" actor endows the exact dose of charisma and intensity, leaning heavier on gags and one-liners than awardable dramatic explorations, still the firm pulse and commitment the actor adds the role makes the offering stronger.Don't be deceived, Sony is sliding us into a post-factual, misleading ground, it's crystal-clear Daniel Espinosa's ""Life"" is related to all this.""Venom"" by Ruben Fleischer is neither a rotten film nor the most outstanding comic book adaptation coming from Spider-Man Sony-Marvel deal; at heart, a messy buddy-film of great inner comedy scope that rarely dabs at the source material in tone and pace; in appearance, a long-drawn-out fandango of obscure frames and unintelligible action sequences that provides neither the theatrical drama nor the visual spectacle the most renowned Spider-Man villain deserves. With an unexpected, enticing post-credits cameo, a mightily effective soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson - going viral at the expense of Eminem, - brilliantly comical fitfully and celestially saved by Tom Hardy's talent, ""Venom"" will please stop-and-go cinemagoers and the most loyal but uncommitted aficionados. It is certainly far from being the comic book adaptation must-watch was meant to be; Sony and Marvel didn't fight the parasite off, we do.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

He stood out from the crowd and I knew he would get big one day. His portrayal of Brock is spot on and is worth the price of admission just to see it. But you'll also be entertained as well because this was a better than expected movie with good action scenes and the funny relationship between Brock and Venom. I can't express enough how talented Hardy is. It's not easy to keep transforming yourself into different characters and if you see his body of work, he is a different person everytime, and that takes major skills. Tom Cruise is always going to be Tom Cruise playing characters, but Tom Hardy will literally transform into that character, from the habits, to their accents, all the way down to the walk, posture, and stare. He must spend a lot of time studying these characters because he's almost a master chameleon of sorts. But enough about the talented Mr. Hardy. Go out and treat yourself to this great movie.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

A secret science facility under the control of a powerful corporate tycoon, Carlton Drake, performs experiments with these symbiotes in an attempt to merge them with human test subjects. Eddie Brock, an investigative journalist, finds himself in the mix when he breaks into the facility to find out what's going on which winds him into a symbiotic relationship with the alien entity who calls himself Venom. Venom starts speaking to Eddie and even supplying him with special abilities. From there Eddie and Venom have to work together to save the day by stopping Drake's experiments and his diabolical plans to combine humanity with man eating symbiotes.I enjoyed this film, seemingly more than what a good portion of people thought of it. I avoided as many spoilers as possible, but it seemed like the word of mouth about ""Venom"" was relatively mixed. Either people hated it or they thought it was fine. I'm with the latter half and thought it was fine. Don't get me wrong, I don't think this was great or any sort of masterpiece because I had my fair share of issues with the film which I will get to, but for what I got I was decently enough satisfied.I would like to get into the positives before the negatives because I feel like the negatives may take up a bulk of this review honestly. Before we get to that, let me point out what I liked about ""Venom"". Number one being Tom Hardy; he is easily the best part about this movie. His performance as Eddie Brock and voice work as Venom was solid, I was mainly entertained by a lot of the humor found in their banter with one another; honestly the film could have used a lot more screen time of their quirky, opposing odds relationship. The look of Venom is pretty cool, it's nice to see a fairly accurate visual representation of the comic book character translated to the big screen. The action was fun to watch, aside from some poor CGI in parts, I thought that the fight choreography and action beats in general were well done. And that's about all I really got...This leads me to the negatives, a lot of which aren't necessarily the movie's fault, however the similarities between ""Venom"" and ""Upgrade"" are so undeniably there I can't help but compare. If you haven't seen Leigh Whannell's ""Upgrade"" here is a quick synopsis: ""Upgrade"" is set in a not so distant future where a mechanic, Grey Trace, and his wife are attacked by vicious criminals. The assault leads to the unfortunate death of Grey's wife, as well as Grey becoming a quadriplegic. Weeks later, Grey is approached by an old acquaintance that claims to be able to give him the ability to walk again with the help of an implant called Stem. After the surgery to implant the Stem microchip, Stem reveals that it can actually speak and begins to help Grey seek revenge on his wife's killers by supplying a set of new special abilities to him. And what you get is a superior version of ""Venom"".Both films involve a second party taking control of a man's body while this second party also has the capabilities of conversing with the human being effected, not only is this a major part of their stories but it also feeds into the action and the comedy of the films. However the symboitic relationship between Stem and Grey is far more developed and goes into far deeper themes than the one between Eddie and Venom which mostly feels simplified and more acceptable for mainstream audiences. Plus, as decent of a job that Tom Hardy gives with his physical performance, it really doesn't compare to the one Logan Marshall-Green gives in ""Upgrade"" where it truly feels as though there really is something else actually controlling his body functions. Both films deal with a romantic tragedy of sorts and ""Upgrade"" is the far more effective one because the one portrayed between Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams just feels underwhelming. The villains in ""Upgrade"" are so much more menacing and memorable than the corporate baddie or the other CGI splooge monster that I've seen a million times in other comic book movies. Which also brings me to the effects work; some of the CGI in ""Venom"" is bad. I mean really, really bad. Once it got to the third act climax when all I could make out from the action was the occasional face and a bunch of rubbery alien gack all over the screen, I was relatively annoyed by the incomprehensible mess on screen. Some of the effects were okay, but when you compare them to...""Upgrade""...there is no comparison. The practical effects in ""Upgrade"" are simply phenomenal and even the rare use of CGI in the film are decent, but with ""Venom"" it was severely hit or miss.Seeing how these are both action films, it only makes sense to touch on that aspect of course; and I've got to say that the action was more visually interesting and innovative in ""Upgrade"" with its concise camera movements and amazing fight choreography. ""Venom""'s action was good, but with all the bad CGI and the fact it was so obviously afraid to go for an R rating, it does sully the action a bit. It teases trying to insert a very light amount of gore, but because of how ""Venom"" is shot and edited it is barely coherent of what even happened. ""Upgrade"" keeps its story tight with an hour and forty minute run time while ""Venom"" pushes its run time to nearly two hours; which would be fine if it was filled with more of the arc and relationship between Venom and Eddie, but it squanders a good portion instead on unneeded scenes that only reiterate what the audience already knows. My last criticism is the ending; ""Upgrade"" has an ending that is risky and provocative while ""Venom"" has a very generic 'setup for sequels' type ending that was extremely on the nose and just simply lame.So I know that I basically bashed on ""Venom"" for most of this review, in all honesty I do recommend that you watch ""Upgrade"" over ""Venom"" any day of the week, but I actually still liked ""Venom"". I just had my issues with it. The villains, the special effects, the arc between Venom and Eddie, and the story all had their problems. But there was also enough entertainment gained from Tom Hardy, the action and comedy that it did carry me through easy enough. So if you are in the mood for some light action fluff, then ""Venom"" is perfect for that.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I saw this movie twice in hopes of it changing my opinions and and to gauge the audience, but it did nothing other than show me that a lot of people laughed at moments that weren't supposed to be funny.

He brings a character and stature to this movie that elevates the poor script. However, the script is quite bad without Hardy would have been a turkey.The entire first hour of the script is set up for the plot but in no way does it need to be that long. The movie wants to establish that Brock is a rebel journalist in love with Anne and that the evil ""life foundation"" is up to nefarious things. All of this could have been done in 15 minutes. Instead of scene after scene of Brock and Anne with happy looks on their faces -- all they needed to show is just one of them living a normal couple life. The audience could have filled in the rest.Once symbiosis happens, there is a good and long action sequence. Great... but then there is another one right afterward... throwing off the flow of the plot and taking time from the best part of the movie, Brock and Venom.Just about everyone but Hardy is horrible here. Michelle Williams doesn't have much to work with but she has an obvious wig and a plastered smile. Jenny Slate as a brilliant scientist? HA! And she is utterly stupid as she easily is manipulated by the bad guy. Riz Ahmed is just a one note bad guy that could have been so much more.

Once again displaying his action chops, but also encompassing a dark comic humour that works well tonally with the source material and keeps things interesting throughout. There is some really good interplay between Hardy and his dark alien alter ego once the movie hits its stride.Tonally, the mix works well and there is enough good stuff throughout to make this an entertaining and engaging movie, despite taking a little while to pick up the pace and establish itself. The plot and story are solid enough, however the remainder of the cast do get caught under Hardy's Shadow and struggle to keep up, seemingly little more than accessories at times.The action scenes are mostly gripping, if not a little over the top, even by Marvel standards. As is the use of CGI, which may have been supposed to look more than a little cartoony than vividly realistic, but can get a little hard viewing and confusing especially as many of them are set at night.There are a couple of plot holes that you will
pick up on, especially if you are a Marvel fan, however nothing that detracts to much.I would have liked to have seen the movie connected a little more to the wider MCU as I feel that Marvel movies always benefit from at least a little connection, but that might just be me.Overall, good entertaining fun with a lot of potential for the inevitable sequel, if they can make improvements.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The pacing of the movie was the most obvious to me because Act 1 seemed to take forever and I was just sat their waiting for Eddie to become Venom but then Act 2 flew by and we hardly had enough time to meet Venom until it was Act 3 and their was the big CGI fight between Venom and Riot. However I absolutely LOVED the movie anyways because I was always laughing and whenever Venom and Eddie where together it was always really interesting and fun to watch because of how well Tom Hardy acted them both.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The ratings weren't like the other marvel movies. But this movie has a true potential. The dark humour was the highlight of the show. It was scary and comical at the same time. It's definitely hard for movie creators to pull that off.The writing was well thought and scientific. It does differ so much from spider man's version of venom. Eddie Brock's character pairs well with venom's making them an effective pair. Most marvel movies are just superpower and action oriented. But this movie had the best balance of story, psychology and action.Absolutely loved it.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Consequently, most of my knowledge of the franchise comes from the show. In my mind, the symbiote storyline that introduced Venom was one of the best in the series, and I was disappointed when Spider-man 3 (2007) woefully miscast Eddie Brock with Topher Grace. Flash forward a decade later, and the big screen is taking another crack at the Venom storyline in a standalone film...but without Spider-man.As a long-time fan, I appreciated the mostly faithful origin story in Venom (2018), with a few minor and vital details still retained to make it close to what actually happened. This time around, Tom Hardy was a much better choice for the titular role, even if his mumbling accent was a little distracting at times. While the physique was a match, the character did still feel a little off, mostly because his primary motivation (i.e., revenge on Spider-man) was no longer there. Venom is a pretty brutal villain in the Marvel universe, but for some reason, we can't have the main character of a superhero film be as sinister as they should be. I blame the misunderstood Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War (2018).So, despite taking a villain and turning them into a hero, Venom still felt pretty solid, especially with the setup for an exciting sequel. Sure, some of the action was too shaky or dark to understand what was going on, but it was still well-paced. In the end, it was some pretty standard origin story superhero fare, so if you like that, you'll be satisfied. However, I felt the after/end credits scene completely undid any of the great things this film did by teasing a potentially much better movie that hadn't come out yet.A standard hero film that happens to feature a former villain, I give Venom 3.0 stars out of 5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He's like a hero and villain, a man and a monster in the same package, so you never know what to expect.First of all: Tom Hardy makes this movie. He's great cast for the Eddie Brock role. Also how the character is written works really well. There's a lot of humor in how Eddie interacts with the Venom symbiote thing. You could argue if there's even too much of the comedy element but I think it works and makes the movie more unique in the superhero genre which often takes itself too seriously or tries to rely on bad one-liners.The special effects, well, I guess ""ok"" for this type of thing. The Venom ""suit"" looks kind of cool but I'm just not fan of too much digital effects, and I felt like the human acting was better than the action scenes.Not the best Marvel movie but better than most of the Avengers-related stuff. I might want to wach it again at some point but not anytime soon.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Herein lies the problem and the reason for so many bad reviews. It fails to live up to the standards set in the first 10 minutes. Tom Hardy's acting skills have improved over the years. Michelle is okay, but alarm bells always start ringing when I here or am able to detect fake accents in a movie. Like when a black african woman speaks with a fake American/English accent in the laboratory. I let that slide & the directors didn't let her speak again anyway. Masking tape put to good use, metaphorically speaking/writing.
But then comes the villain (Ahmed). His acting is poor. Where did they find this bad actor? There are better more credible actors playing villains in Flash season 1. Pick one from any episode. It's as if they were trying to......let me stop there. You figure out how he got the job.In fact, I can't be bothered to go on with the problems littering this film as it progresses from the score to the inept script and why should I, if they can't be bothered to make at least a half decent movie?I will say that the positive reviews of 8-10 are sooooo exaggerated they have either been bought, are from people under the mental age of 14 OR are from poverty-stricken countries where they're just so happy to get to visit a cinema they would probably give an 8 to a blank screen.2 marks for a decent begining reminiscent or plagiarised from Terminator with the first ""symbiot"" (an asian woman) playing an extremely brief role.

The writing was probably the biggest weakness, I don't know if an 'R' rating would've done that much but I would've liked to see how that turned out.

The events are sequential, and we move quickly into the action of ""Venom"".The CGI and special effects are great, specially the blue fire and the chase scenes.There are a lot of goofs in the movie, this may disappoint you if you pay attention to details.""Tom Hardy"" performance is great, he is funny, his reactions with ""Venom"" fit to the role, and they show a lot of chemistry between each other. All other actors didn't affect a lot, they could be replaced by other actors and we may get better results.The story is kinda short and oversimplified, it's understood that it's only to give an introduction about ""Venom"", but more events and complications could be added in order to see more sides of the ""Venom"".Finally, it's a good action movie, its science fiction part is simple and explained well. I am looking forward to the next ""Venom"" appearance and of course no space to feel bored here.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Watching Tom Hardy's 'Eddie Brock' interact with his parasite is hilarious. It might not be any of the actors' best work, but that's not a bad thing. Especially Michelle Williams' character is written paper thin. 
As for the special effects, they were actually not that bad. After the trailers, I guess they must've polished them a bit more?! It's a comic book movie that fans will appreciate. And there's also two cameo's, one you'll expect by now and the other during a mid credit scene.

Anytime Venom or the other alien popped up on the screen, it took me right out of the movie, I felt I was watching an animation film instead of a live action flick. It wasn't that funny, how did Venom know all those phrases. Why did these aliens give themselves english word names?!

Hardy is phenomenal, per usual, and his surrounding cast is very solid as well. The action sequences are fantastic, including that throwback scene to Bullit. *Fun fact - this film was released on the 50th anniversary of Bullit's release in 1968.*So with a great cast and filming crew, the script, plot and directoring had to follow suit. For the most part, I thought they did. Of the three, I found the script to be the strongest. This movie has multiple, great and original one-liners. And overall, the dialogue was entertaining as well, and often comical. The directing and plot were about even and although they weren't the strongest aspects of the film, they certainly did not expose any weak points (plot holes, scenes that drag, pacing, etc.).8/10 - Very funny and entertaining. Stan Lee's cameo is one of the best in all of his movies - you will never see it coming. Will definitely watch again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie was a great time. Tom Hardy once again proved his worth as an actor with a borderline over the top performance. His ability to connect with venom was amazing. While the movie had the traditional villain premise, I was still sucked into the story and the stakes.
The intensity of the action sequences is where my story begins. I saw this movie in IMAX 3-D and the sound was so loud and the images were non stop cuts from one death to another that it triggered my motion sickness and I threw up in the hallway of the theater. Overall this movie fulfilled every expectation I had going into it. From a bland female character who had little to do and scenes that would've been perfect had they pushed for the R rating, this movie was exactly what I would define as adequate. Nothing particularly stuck out to me as innovative but I still had a good time watching this (mostly due to Tom's amazing performance). I just wish that if they were going down the route of dark, that they would've gone all the way. Marvel/Sony could've had their own Deadpool but I guess I can settle for a less funny, darker PG-13 version.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So, I had a chance to see this and overall, I was moderately to very satisfied. I want to praise particularly the story writers, who obviously stayed true to the comic series that inspired this and of Tom Hardy's acting. This is an actor that can easily go from titular character in Bronson to this role and read from a script that while it being what it is, he can read from it well. Also want to praise the director and production team as they found an actor who is Eddie Brock in true form. It was great to see Venom on screen for the first time. Would love to see a sequel and if they're building up to a Sinister 6 film, obviously follow the main cast and crew and the formula that's being used now. But, want to see them take their time with this build- up though. Would love to meet Spidey showing up in this world.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"3","/10","""I'm killing you, I'm so sorry.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4435229/?ref_=tt_urv","richardgeuter","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur86366563/?ref_=tt_urv","3 November 2018","At its core, ""Venom"" is the story of Tom Hardy making friends with an intelligent goo from outer space. That earns some points for weirdness. Sadly, the movie as a whole is not bold enough to fully embrace its weirdness, constantly undercutting the inherent darkness and brutality of the Venom character with cheesy humor and tired superhero movie tropes.There are some things that work okay in this movie, though none work exceptionally well. The cast is maybe its strongest asset, but makes the uninspired script all the more annoying. Seeing Michelle Williams, an amazing actress who has been incredible in almost everything I ever saw her in, be reduced to ""the girl"" is saddening. Riz Ahmed, though I admire his being cast as the mad scientist character in theory, is very believable as the scientist but could have been a lot madder. And Tom Hardy is clearly trying to give Eddie Brock some dimensionality, but in some scenes, it seems like he's not taking this whole thing very seriously. I can't blame him.The script to a superhero movie doesn't need to be devoid of any clichés or familiar tropes, but if it employs them in such a liberal manner as in ""Venom,"" there needs to be some self-awareness in it. Ruben Fleischer seems like the perfect director to make a script like this one work, because ""Zombieland"" was a very self-aware movie, and on top of that, it had good sense of character and even drama, in spite of its inherent silliness. But for some reason, he can't do the trick for ""Venom."" I could forgive the film for its other flaws if he had played it more for camp, but as it is, the movie seems like an unintentional parody. You might enjoy it on that level.Much of the dialogue, especially in the first half, is filled with cheesy one-liners and clichéd jokes that, while they did get a few chuckles from me, it was mostly for the wrong reasons. There is a particularly painful scene of Eddie Brock embarrassing himself in a fancy restaurant that reminded me of early-2000s mainstream comedies in the worst possible way. Overall, although a few of the funny scenes in the film are genuinely entertaining, it's mainly because of the
talented actors in the piece and the details they bring to the table. But generally, the jokes in ""Venom"" more often fail than they don't.Another aspect of the film that could have redeemed some of its narrative and tonal flaws is the action. But here lies maybe the biggest weakness of the film: there is not that much action in it, and what little we get is awfully staged and edited. Even during the one-on-one fights in the first act, the director fails to make the stunts look like Tom Hardy is actually doing them -- which he might have, in which case this flaw is all the more unforgivable. Later, when the action goes bigger, we are treated to an atrocious chase sequence in which the filmmakers completely fail to give us any sense of location, so all we see are random shots of cars, faces, and streetlights, with no indication as to where those things are in relation to our main character. And for the finale, they decide to pull out every tired superhero movie cliché in the book. I could list them, but that might count as a spoiler, though if you've seen any superhero movie in the last ten years, suffice it to say, you will not be surprised by anything in the last 20 minutes of ""Venom."" Or rather, the last 40 minutes, because the credits sequence alone is 20 minutes long, during which the filmmakers saw fit to give us an almost comically formulaic mid-credits scene (if you consider the fact that the movie has a mid-credits scene a spoiler, you might enjoy the last fight scene) and an ad for an upcoming kids' movie. Classy.Although I did not like ""Venom,"" it should be noted that I did have fun watching it. It is, like ""Suicide Squad"" two years ago, an entertaining trainwreck, and for that matter, it might even be one of those cheesy blockbusters that might be redeemed in couple years' time. But today, it feels very derivative and uninspired.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy delivers a standout performance as Eddie Brock, a down-on-his-luck journalist who becomes infected with an alien symbiote that gives him incredible powers.The movie is a departure from the traditional superhero formula, and it is all the better for it. Director Ruben Fleischer has created a visually stunning movie, with action scenes that are both brutal and inventive. The special effects are top-notch, and the design of the symbiote and Venom himself is both terrifying and mesmerizing.But what really sets Venom apart is its unique tone. The movie is dark and violent, but it is also peppered with humor and wit, making for a refreshing change of pace from other superhero movies. The relationship between Eddie and the symbiote is particularly compelling, as they struggle to coexist and come to terms with their shared existence.The supporting cast is also strong, with Michelle Williams delivering a solid performance as Eddie's love interest, and Riz Ahmed impressing as the villainous Carlton Drake.Overall, Venom is a must-see for fans of the anti-hero genre. It is a dark and thrilling adventure that is sure to satisfy audiences looking for something a bit different from their superhero movies. Tom Hardy's performance is worth the price of admission alone, and the movie as a whole is a wild and satisfying ride.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately it didnt.
All im going to say is this film is really slow for the first 20 mins, then it gets over hyped bike chase scenes. It doesnt flow from scenes at all. Plot holes include eddie and anne being engaged, splitting up and amazingly she moves onto another guy in what seems like 3 days. Unbelievable! 
Non the less the cgi is good when venom is standing still but the final fight scene exposes the shoodyness.
Also the music is awful, they chose a terrible hip hop song and the main score is hardly used.
All in all i would give it a 6 and that upon reflection is being generous.
Save yourself some money and watch it for free on channel 4 in a few years.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy acts well considering the crappy script he was given, the visual effects were good and Venom looks like he is susposed to (apart form the white spider symbol).The Bad:
The script is trash, even when you put aside the fact that they ignore all pervious incarnations of the character its just plain and simply horrifically written. As I mentioned in my headline it is extremely formulaic and it doesn't try to be anything more than ""Popcorn Flick"". I won't go into to much detail but several scenes that take place in the movie actually don't make any sense stuff happens that either has no relevance to the plot or Is not explained (""The Amazing Spider-Man 2""), there is also a scene in which they try to convey serious emotion and it falls flat on its face.Conclusion:
The worst part is I thought in line with ""Sony's"" pervious escapades it would tank at the box office , but in fact it has soured especially in China, I just hope that the inevitable ""Venom 2"" is better

In terms of enjoyment, this film is fantastically entertaining, though I really doubt I enjoyed it the way the filmmakers intended.

I have little knowledge about comic characters and hence my review is unbiased. Tom Hardy is brilliant as always and there is no other actor who could pull off Venom with the casual ease as him. He wins hearts by playing this loser protagonist. There are hilarious conversations between him and the Venom and Tom breezes through this film with his usual ease. Absolutely a pleasure to watch the man act. 
However, it does look like that the movie run time has been significantly reduced. Also it seems that the film ran into budget cuts.
This is the era of brilliant graphics in movies. So much so, that we have subconsciously trained ourselves to accept only the best quality graphics in films. Venom is a good example where the quality or the lack thereof of computer graphics has a determined the overall acceptance of this film. The Venom transformation scenes required to be a lot better. The fight scene between Riot and Venom required to be significantly better. I truly believe that it has become very difficult to please audience nowadays. With big budget Marvel movies people expect nothing less than a graphic spectacle. Perhaps the reason why Suicide Squad failed to make a real impact. 
Cinematography is good and Matthew Libatique has done a good job. I can not say the same thing about Ruben Fleischer.
Overall there is a sense of disappointment when you leave the theater.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having now watched it for myself, I can say that I found many of the reviews I have read to be somewhat unfair, and its a much better and more entertaining movie than expected. Its a darker comic book movie than you might be used to, with some scenes that may be genuinely creepy and scary for younger viewers. At times, Tom Hardy's performance as the tortured investigative reporter playing host to Venom, wonderfully draws out elements of schizophrenic humour without allowing the movie to fall into slapstick. Venom is not perfect by any means. It falls victim to many of my Holywood movie pet hates, such as employing a well known British actor and forcing him or her to put on an American accent that takes a lot of getting used to, or such as making a movie pitched at a PG-13 audience, and squeezing in as much pointless and completely unnecessary profanity as possible. Nevertheless, minor gripes aside, its a well constructed and enjoyable addition to the Marvel catalogue.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With all that said I would recommend watching this movie because it does take some risks and that alone was enough to make it fun, but don't be surprised if you come away wondering what could have been.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Let's talk about the cast first. Tom hardy as venom is great! He just fits in the role pretty well.. But the supporting cast is not that good.
eddie brock's girlfriend or fiancé has zero chemistry with eddie, All the scenes with both of them are skkipable.
The villain, is so damn bland.. Its a casting disaster. If this movie had a good casting, then it would have shined.
The script is lame and predictable. It looks like an episode and not a movie.
The action is ok, considering the budget it could have been epic. A similar movie called update came out before venom and it had quite a similar scenario but it has a really good
Screenplay and action sequence.
I was expecting venom to be better than upgrade but pheww didn't happen.
The movie is yet watchable only because of tom hardy, rest is just mediocre!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot follows a good man named Eddie Brock, an investigative reporter who crusades for humanitarian causes. He becomes infected by an alien parasite that wants Eddie to be its host in order to conquer our world. Capturing this symbiote invading mass is the main objective for Carlton Drake, a rich mad megalomaniac who want to control its power for genetic engineering purposes. Of course, good and evil will collide in a fight to the finish.The film quickly loses any logical sense...sometimes the parasite kills its host as it moves from victim to victim, other times it is comfortable in its temporary lodgings, or it leaves without any fatal effect. The screenplay-by-committee approach is evident in the script by Scott Rosenberg, Jeff Pinkner, and Kelly Marcel. It is standard storytelling in need of more dark humor and wit ala Deadpool.Conventionally directed by Ruben Fleischer, the film also is in need of better craftsmanship. The CGI is sub-par, the creature design looks artificial, the sound design is somewhat inaudible, and many of the action sequences are blurry and sloppily edited by Alan Baumgarten and Maryann Brandon.What almost saves the film is a darkly comic performance by Tom Hardy in the lead role. His physical reactions to his transformations from hell and back are priceless and provide the only fun in all of this heavy-handedness.The odd couple bantering between Eddie/Venom helps the film achieve some sort of strange buddy movie vibe.Otherwise, the actor stands alone. None of the other cast members register a glimmer of authenticity. In fact, the usually reliable and talented Michelle Williams as Eddie's girl, adds nothing but confusion to her under-written role and has little chemistry with Mr. Hardy. It is one of her weakest performances in her strong resume of films. As the villain, Riz Ahmed, a fine actor himself, lacks any real menace in his woeful role. And in the end credits, there is also a strange cameo by Woody Harrelson in a red fright wig that hints at his being the next villain in its sure-to-be-soon sequel.Enjoy Mr. Hardy. He is honestly the only thing worthy in this movie. This Venom numbs rather than stings.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The combination of formal but conversational outbursts with the mock sinister voice is a comic gold mine, and the theatre I was in laughed at almost every line he said. Sadly, Tom Hardy's Venom was so good that he did somewhat upstage himself as Eddie Brock who I felt was a confused character with no clear defining qualities apart from making bad life choices and being quite friendly, whilst also running a successful news program and exposing extreme injustice - sound like anyone you know??? Me neither.Short story shorter, CGI fight was about as disappointing as you might imagine, first 30-40 mins is by and large pretty dull, but the second act makes it worth it for the Tom Hardy double act which will have you in tears.

I am a comic book enthusiast and I love Spider-Man. What was intended to be an alternate suit for Spider-Man, turned out to be his one of the prominent nemesis. I was quite shocked to hear that this movie doesnt include anything about Spider-Man, not even a cameo or a mention. Still, since Venom is such a rich character, I was rooting for this movie and actually looked forward to it. 
The whole movie, the fun part of it, all credit goes to Tom Hardy. He is a talented actor, and he delivers. What I really enjoyed is the chemistry between Venom and Eddie Brock. The emotional turmoil, the voices, the comic relief. That's where the good part ends. The rest is a just a hotchpotch of the same countless comic book movies we have been watching. Also I really wanted this movie to be a R-rated. 
Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake is not convincing enough. He is talented as well, but the casting feels wrong. Same goes for Michelle Williams. The CGI could have been better, since it's coming from Sony. The soundtrack was good. 
I would recommend to watch this movie. It is different than the usual Marvel formula based movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a standalone movie useless. Effects you have seen dozens of times and a dozen of years ago, the story itself is just horribly conveyed - I do not know any previous history let alone comics about the character, granted that. But the whole thing would really only make sense as a mediocre attempt for a first installation, in order to set ground rules for future sequels that would then - hopefully - make more sense of this symbiosis and its treats as an addition to some superhero/anti-hero verse.
On its own, to me, disappointing story-wise. After the show, the same nagging feeling you have with a first season being too short of episodes on top, that leave you frustrated with the revelation to be dependent on general reception / quota if there will ever be a season 2. This is not what cinema is supposed to be.
4 stars simply for the popcorn element, but I am really inclined to rather 3 for the disappointment in general.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story was barely entertaining and was met with so many flaws. Not even a magnificent actor like Tom Hardy could save this movie from being yet another comic book movie from the bunch. I've read other overstated reviews praising this film as if it was excellent; but it's hardly any good. The CGI fails to deliver a simple visual representation, it's way overdone and doesn't reflect fittingly in the screen.Tom Hardy tries but can't seem to make a flawed script work with his acting, which I find it to be average. Venom's look, CGI and symbiote voice was the only thing that truly appealed to me about this film. But of course it's not enough, although it deserves some points in that aspect.
I completely forgot Michelle Williams is in this too, so imagine how plain and nondescript her perfomance is.Invest in this film if you wish to, I can't guarantee you'll enjoy it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot was overly simple & its execution even more so...the action sequences were either underwhelming or soo frenetic & obscured by darkness that I wasn't exactly sure what I was seeing...there was 1 shining star in this film & that was ( of course ) Tom Hardy. Hardy delivered his typical stellar performance, unfortunately it wasn't enough. I'm sure there will be a sequel as people seem to love this film.

I think it would have been fun but from a business standpoint, Sony wanted to expand the audience to people that were a little younger. I think most people wanted a more comic accurate adaptation, even do it was not the best adaptation, it had great Venom fun.I think the movie itself is ok, it's pretty simple and has a dark tone to it, it has some great fun between Venom and Eddie Brock, played beautifully by Tom Hardy, it has some funny scenes and some interesting fight scenes. The villain is kinda bland but you can still see how much of a bad guy he is. Venom looks ok, he sometimes there is something of about him but overall he looks pretty good, his eyes especially look really bubbly and gooey.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I went in to this with low expectations given what I read from the critics and what I had seen in the trailers. I was pleasantly surprised, this movie is definitely not as bad as the critics are saying, but it is not great either. The movie overall was enjoyable, there was plenty of things I liked but also plenty of things I hated. The relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom was the best part of the movie, Tom hardy is an amazing actor and they nailed this aspect to perfection. The relationship between Eddie Brock and Anne Weying however, was not so great; it is like these two had absolutely zero chemistry which is believe is a fault of the script not the actors. There also really isn't really any incentive to care about any of the other characters except for Eddie and Venom, that is where all of the character development went. Riz Ahmed, though a great actor, was miscast as his role of Carlton Drake/Riot. The villain just wasn't interesting or believable. This movie also could have benefited from an R rating, but the action was definitely enough to please the hardcore fans. If you are not a stickler for the comic books and can see this movie for what it is, then you will surely enjoy it. Definitely some things that could be done better but overall not bad, I was not disappointed.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's insane). However, I have to say that I've enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. The movie is fun, mainly after we see the ""real Venom"", it becomes an entertaining dark comedy almost body-cop movie.With that being said, we can't help but think that the movie actually could have been pretty awesome if they had gone for the rated R. And is odd to think about that, Logan and Deadpool (twice) have already showed us that you can make a superhero movie that don't try to reach as many people as possible, and instead focus on being the best as they can for the older audience. And let's be honest here, Venom is a huge monster that eats people's head... do I have to say something else?Anyway, the movie has a pretty basic storyline, the villain is just kind of an evil scientist, as we have seen lots of times before, but it's fine. The acting is good for the majority of it. The soundtrack is a bit odd at times (with some pop/hip hop songs that didn't quite land every time).Overall, I think that's it. The movie is very fun, mostly when we start to see the relation Venom x Eddie. I believe that a sequel has potential, but they really should stop this nonsense and do a rated R movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Venom brings a very different and fun supervillain story to the table that people have never seen before. The movie is not only funny, but it is action-packed and a very engaging ride! Tom Hardy's acting in this movie makes it worth watching alone and it was thrilling to see his character struggle between Eddie and Venom. The flow of the movie and its plot was something that could have been better. I never found myself getting lost in the story because in the end I already knew what was going to happen. The villainous Carlton Drake was plain and simple. His character contained no background and I the climax of his character arc was brushed over in a short scene. As for Eddie and his fiance, I simply don't understand how a couple can go from living together and getting married soon to breaking up over a job. That's just lazy writing. However, most of the audience does not see that as a major issue. So, for the most part, it makes it an enjoyable movie that I would definitely watch again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Venom gets a 5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tom hardly was pretty good.
There were a couple of hiccups in the CGI where it looked really bad and you couldn't tell what was going on but I'll forgive it. The final fight was honestly really predictable. Just felt like it need something a little more but for venom's first solo film I would say this is a watchable movie.
The Tom Hardy/Venom Combo really work they both connect really well and I enjoy Eddie and venom going back and forth banter I wish there was more of it.
Do I think this movie need a sequel No,Would I like one,Absolutely! With a better animation team and better dialogue writing and more character development then yes. My finial verdict is a 7.5/10 my girlfriend said that she would definitely see it again. I will too
This is way better then anything Zack Snyder has put out and a lot of credit goes to the director who really knew what he was trying to do. So stuff just needs to be worked on in the sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, the trailer shows me that the average young person, sorry to say , isn't very intelligent. So Venom would ""crush everyone else""? Really? The most powerful super hero in the MCU is Hulk, Thanos is not a super hero, he's a super villain. I'm pretty sure Thanos would slam Venom like a rag doll, as would hulk. What is with the young generation and ""dark heroes""? You know, those ""anti-hero"" types who represent amorality? Like ""the Dark Knight"", why is that character so popular with young audiences? Because the younger generation do not understand that there IS good and evil. If they had lived during the WWII era, they MIGHT think differently, or possibly WWII would have ended in a victory for evil since I doubt today's generation has the courage or sand to fight for what is right. Just my opinion, but while the WWII generation is the greatest generation, I'd say today's youth represents the nothing generation. Truth hurts.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy looks like he's having fun with his role, and Venom himself, I can only describe him this beautifully strange and perfect combination of The Joker, Deadpool, and a heaping helping of his own murderous charm. I really don't have anything bad to say except it was really slow going for about the first third as they set up the story. Lots of exposition there, but once the title character appeared onscreen it was everything you'd want it to be with good action and lots of rampant destruction. if it weren't for that real slow first third of the story it'd be an easy 9/10. Still completely worth watching if you're willing to wait a bit.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It goes without saying that he's one of the better leading men working today. And without him, VENOM (2018) would almost certainly be a truly disastrous affair.From a storytelling perspective I'll concede it's not good. On the one hand, seeing a stand alone comic book movie is refreshing in this era of tie-ins and Easter eggs. But the script feels ten years out of date. The villain is just some shady businessman that gets the same powers and the setting is another generic urban landscape for Venom to smash up cars or jump off buildings.Yet strangely, because of Tom Hardy's commitment to the role, I was still along for the ride. Once the Venom symbiote enters the plot, the movie picks up steam and is enjoyable. Brock and the symbiote's banter is often funny and helps to liven up the picture.Riz Ahmed is game to play a hissable villain as Carlton Drake but the part feels too much like an Iron Man reject. Michelle Williams likewise seems like an odd fit for an offbeat superhero flick like this but she fares better. Some of her comic timing and reactions are funny to see.Even while I criticize the narrative, I see things that work or would be more interesting if the script was fleshed out proper. I read that a good chunk was cut out and they initially aimed for an R rating. That shows in a few of the action scenes. Speaking of which, the fight scenes are decent enough but could benefit from the splattery gore like the Deadpool movies.I was ready to hate this movie but I was surprised that I wound up enjoying it. It's certainly dumb and short of its potential. But it's a reminder that sometimes good casting makes all the difference.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, a journalist who becomes host to an alien symbiote, Venom. Hardy's performance is a standout, delivering both the physical intensity and the dark humor required for the role.The plot revolves around Eddie's investigation into unethical experiments conducted by the Life Foundation, led by the enigmatic Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). The narrative effectively balances the darker aspects of the story with comedic elements, particularly through the interactions between Eddie and Venom. Their dynamic is a highlight, bringing an unexpected but welcome levity to the film.The action scenes are robust and visually engaging, showcasing Venom's formidable powers. However, the film does suffer from pacing issues and a somewhat formulaic storyline. The supporting characters, while well-acted, could have benefited from more development.Despite its flaws, ""Venom"" succeeds in creating an entertaining and distinct entry in the superhero genre. It's a fun, albeit unconventional, ride that sets the stage for future adventures with the symbiote anti-hero.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I mean that in a good way! The way Eddie Brock is portrayed in the movie is much more charming and likable, same goes for the venom symbiote. This movie is a great example of how the movie can change the narrative for the better. Yeah yeah I know that Spider-Man is an huge part of Venoms story in the comics, but he was not necessary in this adaptation. It was actually nice not having Venom attached to Spider-Man in the sense that he had his own identity and story. I have always loved Venom and the white spider logo on his chest along with the other abilities gained from Spider-Man, but this movie made him independent and capable. On screen Eddie Brock and Venoms relationship was perfect and would have only been further complicated by adding Venoms hate for Spider-Man and that relationship. Great intro for the character and who knows maybe later on they could bring Spider-Man into it and have him gain his abilities, regardless I honestly don't feel that it's needed.Massively underrated, don't listen to the critics low shots. Is it the best superhero movie ever...? Probably not, but it is was very enjoyable and Venom is awesome to watch. I think they made it spot on for the resources available at the time and what they did with the character.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

So the main problem for me is that you cant have an origin story of Venom without Spiderman or without even mentioning him. That was the biggest disapointment for me .In general the movie is not bad , nice action scenes , the plot isnt bad for an action movie , and with nice CGI . But it isnt a venom movie , its more like the video game Prototype than then classic anti hero from spiderman . If you guys ever played that game , its almost like the story there , eating people , jumping arount , having tentancles doing your killing , it feels more like that , than a venom movie.I prefer to have a second spiderman cast (Hollands spiderman is too young for Hardys Venom) on the sequel than having Venom dealing alone with Carnage (i supose he will be next if a sequel happens) , that will be an awfull experience as Carnage is way to strong for Venom (in the Comics and even in the Animation series) .But in general if you arent a fun of the classic comics or even the animated series of spiderman and Venom\ Agent Venom , then you probably will enjoy it more than us .","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But I was pleasantly surprised, Venom is an enjoyable action romp, Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed do great jobs portraying their characters, and Michelle Williams does well in a fairly thin role.For once a movie that doesn't bother with 40 minutes of everyone's back story, which was a positive, the story kept moving along at just the right pace although I suppose you could argue this was at the expense of fleshed out story telling?Just when you were thinking hmm could do with some Venom round about now, the movie delivers, and it pretty much keeps on going until the end.San Francisco looks fabulous throughout.Only downsides? The end 'fight' sequence is very difficult to follow and the twist in the plot is bordering on ridiculous (but necessary).But I do recommend watching Venom, definitely a film to make your own mind up and not be swayed by reviews. 6/10 possible case for 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not very good because it provides the bare minimum: hollow character development, motivation, creativity, and logic. Really, Venom is just a collection of popular superhero movie tropes. It's an origin story where the protagonist hardly arcs. Its villain is cartoonishly evil with no depth. The stakes are contrived and the subtext is nonexistent. Still, because Venom has fun with its basic formulas, it avoids becoming a complete mess. It's generic, but playful. In particular, Tom Hardy saves the sparse material with skill and charisma. Overall, it's mindless, but at least Venom isn't painfully dull or bloated.Meanwhile, Venom possesses some craft. There is an interesting scene transition, a handful of appealing shots, and the effects include some real stunts. Also, the design of Venom's voice is compelling. The final action scene is cluttered, but thankfully, isn't overindulgent. The music is forgettable and the production design is sterile, but at least they are competent. Lastly, the direction lacks an artistic voice, yet mostly remains efficient. The best thing about Venom is that it keeps moving. The build-up to Venom's reveal is decently paced and the filler isn't overbearing. Ultimately, Venom's inferiority is softened by its levity.Writing: 3/10

But, reality often strikes hard as the film was mediocre at best and there are only few notable things from the movie itself. I would rate it about 6 at best.
The only fun things here are the interaction between venom and tom hardy, even though when they are not fighting and just in daily life. The action scene is nothing spectacular and felt can be unique and special by utilizing venom's power. The hue is kind of blueish horror but the movie can be felt jumping from comedy to action and then to horror and then back to action again which felt somewhat unfitting for the tone of the movie.
The story was nothing special, but I felt the villain is very inconsistent with his principle. I think riz ahmed can be good, but the character he plays seems to be so boring and have unclear or yet conflicting motive for doing what he does. I think that the more suitable villain for venom should provide more brawl than the one this movie provide.
My biggest disappointment is of course, the lack of violence and blood. I mean it is venom, the enemy and rival of spiderman which is vicious, but in the movie there are barely any bloods and graphic scene. It was hindering the viewers to grasp the true nature and the danger of Venom. I am sure that this movie is not made for kids, so I was wondering why the movie does not have more violence.
 
Well, not all is lost because by the credits scene rolls, we are presented by Eminem Song - Venom. Which is great and I love the song better than the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Venom is a science-fiction/action movie that even audiences who don't really have a taste in scientific action stuff might decently enjoy.This movie is perfect when it comes to character development and setting up a wildly fun story. There's the brilliant special effects in action context and sci-fi context that all of these genre'd movies should require, but it's very simply and very interesting at the same time. And apart from the loud action, extreme power and explosions, the symbiotic relationship is the witty touch.Literally almost every detail throughout this story is absorbing. It gets to the point where the movie's already had success in catching viewers and keeping them entertained. It hit an appealing target, but missed an opportunity to be scarier, in which the scientific threat and action is actually more than intense.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy did the best he can in this movie, and I would say he did a pretty good job, and brought charm to this film, and his relationship between Venom was also pretty nice.But the rest of the film doesn't fare so well. The first 15 minutes are extremely rushed, and the first part is crucial to the to first act. The first act of the film feels like 50 minutes, the 2nd act feels like 15 minutes, and the 3rd act feels like 20. The movie overall feels disjointed, and it feels as if over an hour of the film had been cut out. The other characters, besides Venom and Eddie, are extremely bland and uninteresting. The actors did the best they could, but they couldn't make up for their poorly-written roles.Venom does have a good lead character, and delivers a little charm, but is overall a slog of a movie. The pacing is very off, and the other characters are as bland as they get. This film might be for some people, but not me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Riot was a very poor villain in my opinion and Riz Ahmed had very little to play with the character given how talented he is.Also, the CGI Venom looks very cool but Riot, on the other hand, looks like he's a video game character.

This movie was nowhere near the hype it created through the series of some really awesome trailers. The only points it has scores are purely due to Tom Hardy's acting and a good (if not great) CGI which made our one of the favourite Anti-hero look convincingly real.The acting of all the major characters is pretty decent in most parts of the movie, be it Riz Ahmed, Michelle Williams or Reid Scott. The cinematography is also clean and appealing especially during the chase and the fight scenes. Though it could definitely have been better in a couple of scenes but nothing big. This movie missed exactly where it matters the most, i.e. the story.Coming to the story, I'd only just like to say that it was just plain bad and definitely one of the worst written comic book movie scripts of all time. The story was ambitious but it just never made sense. You'll constantly ask yourself throughout the movie, what the hell is happening and if the directors even gave the script a second thought before they decided to convert it into a movie. You can't find plotholes in this movie because the whole movie is one big plothole in itself. I can enlist all of them here but it'll not just make this review invariably long but also shell out some serious spoilers which I'm refraining myself from doing.In conclusion, I'd recommend you this movie only if you are an action movie lover and can just overlook the story aspect and doesn't care if the movie connects all the points or not.PS: There is one really awesome end credit scene featuring RIOT which pretty much sets up the sequel and I've my fingers crossed that SONY will work on their mistakes because seriously in my opinion, there is scope for a lot of improvement.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

My second main issue is the fact that we saw little to none about the antagonist, the anti-hero in the movie, which is a let down. I hope that the sequal involving Carnage will bring more action and deepness to the movie as a whole franchise, giving more meaning and quality to the first movie also all together.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My rating:-2.75/5
 This is the only villain spin off i have ever most enjoyed. Lots were good. Some parts were bad. There was unnecessary chaos. Some parts were worst. Especially the climax. When it arrived, i thought 'Oh! So, is this the climax?' I was pretty disappointed with the climax. It could have been better. One more problem with this one is duration. It could have been more long. Because they could have taken more time to establish everything perfectly. So don't worry with this movie. It's just the first one. It will certainly keep you up interesting throughout. Tom and Tom's charismatic bromance with Venom literally saved this movie. If you are a big fan of spider-verse , you should definitely go for it, you will certainly enjoy it. If you are a marvel fan and you know a little about venom, you can go for it , it will be a decent flick. If you know nothing about marvel and spider-verse, then you should stay away from this, because what remains is lot of chaos. All venom fans wait for it, because when he will get out, there will be lot of carnage.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was enormous potential here for a dark, unique and complex story, and I, like a lot of others, was interested to see how Sony would handle this new Spider-verse of theirs, despite the lack of an actual Spider-Man. My excitement began to deflate, however, when the film's rating came out. The choice to make this film PG-13 seemed odd, having seen the recent success of R-rated antihero movies such as Deadpool and Logan. Then, as the premiere date neared, the abysmal ratings began pouring out from the internet. The film stands at an atrocious 31% on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 33 Metascore, which disappointed me. Nevertheless, as a fan of the Venom character, I went and saw the film anyway, bracing myself to see a disaster.Having seen Venom yesterday, I can say it in no way deserves the horrible score it got on Rotten Tomatoes. Sure, the movie has tons of problems, but there is a lot to enjoy here as well. It has it's moments, and is by far one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year.First, the negative. The blaring problem here is the script. The plot is extremely cliché, and the awful dialogue made me want to leave the theater and bang my head against a wall. Some of the lines seemed as if they were written by a 10-year-old. I often found myself laughing out loud at the delivery of some of the dialogue. The script's handling of the characters was also very poorly done. Tom Hardy does an exceptional job, but his character of Eddie Brock and the characters around him are so poorly contrived. Nobody has any sort of character arc, and our main protagonist is written completely backwards. He begins the film as a cocky, arrogant, and awkward reporter, only to end the film the exact same way. Michelle Williams's character was maddeningly boring and her performance was dull. You felt no chemistry whatsoever between the two leads. The villain is another glaring negative. While Riz Ahmed is a fantastic actor, his portrayal of Carlton Drake, the head of the sinister Life Foundation, felt extremely cliché and formulated. Drake is given almost zero motivation for his actions, and is not interesting in the slightest. He interacts very little with our main hero, then does ridiculous things towards the end that make little sense.Now I'll head into the positives of the film. The bright spot of Venom is no doubt Tom Hardy's performance. He gives 110% to this role and goes way over the top. The dynamic between the Venom symbiote and Eddie Brock, and the back-and-forth exchange between these two is no doubt another highlight of the film. Despite my wanting them to go in a darker direction, the dialogue between the two lended for some pretty funny moments. The action scenes are pretty well done excluding the final fight between Eddie and Carlton Drake, which had too much going on and was often times hard to see what was happening.Overall, the film is covered in problems but enjoyable nonetheless. Its damn entertaining once Venom makes his appearance. I'd recommend this movie as it doesn't deserve the terrible reviews critics have given it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy is perfect for the role and gives a great performance. Venom's appearance and powers are faithfully adapted. An extreme improvement over the Spider-Man 3 (2007) version of Venom who didn't look like Eddie Brock or Venom.
What's negative:
This movie was made by a director and studio guys who a.) don't care much about the source material, b.) don't understand the source material and c.) are driven by greed.A Venom movie done right would be R-rated, because Venom is no hero, but he is very dark and kills a lot of people. Also it would have Carnage as the antagonist, because this is the best and most iconic villain. There would be no forced comedy and no forced romance.The Venom movie we got:
In short: Greedy studio and bad director show what's wrong in Hollywood: PG-13, forced comedy, forced romance, hyper editing and everything as big as possible.This movie is not as bad as garbage like Fantastic Four (2015). It has good aspects, but it could be so much more.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

After his previous and shallow appearance in Spider-Man 3, people have wanted a proper adaptation of the character. I am happy to say that ""Venom"" has done that very well.
Eddie Brock, played by Tom Hardy is accurate to the comics, but it also realistic for the modern world. The writing of the Venom/Eddie Brock characters were well accomplished and believable. Their interactions with each other are effective to the story and create a character that is fighting with the demon inside him, which a lot of people can relate to.
In terms of the story, the villain Symbiote does not get very much development which is disappointing since his character in the comic books was very interesting and creative.
The action in this film was impressive and big. Although, I would have liked to have seen more of Venom's abilities from the comics presented in this movie.
Overall, this movie was entertaining, funny, and action packed. With a flat story, it does dampen the experience, but it is still a fun film to watch and a good addition to the much loved Comic Book Movie genre.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't let what many of the critics tell you ruin your experience. Although I wouldn't say this movie was a great film, I had an absolute blast watching it from start to finish. It's incredibly cheesy and the dialogue sometimes made me shake my head in embarrassment, but it's just great fun, and you can tell Tom Hardy had a blast with the role. He carries this film, and his joy in the role is certainly contagious. I thought several times between his interactions with... well, himself... that I would absolutely love to see a sequel happen. Tonally, it's a lot less dark and serious as the initial advertising and, frankly, the character of Venom himself makes the film look... Instead, it's cheesy and, by the end, somewhat endearing: Brock/Venom are definitely not wholesome characters, but you do come to root for them in their quests to become less ""UNwholesome"". This is definitely ""anti-hero"" Venom and not so much a typical ""monster-like"" character.Additionally, I think the film would have received a lot less ire from critics had it been released around the same era of comic book films as the first Blade film. Venom (the character) is great to watch and the first time he appeared on screen, I actually said to myself, ""hell yeah!"" He's very reminiscent of, for those who have played it, the Venom from the Spider-Man game for the PlayStation 1 back in 2000. If you enjoyed that rendition, I think you'll enjoy this big cinematic update.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The plot was incredibly weak and it seemed like the actors felt that way too because the scenes between Tom and Michele felt awkward.The visual effects were the best part of the movie as well and the odd relationship they made with ""Eddie"" and the symbiote but the whole thing just felt like Sony needed the cash grab or maybe needed to make this to keep the rights to the character.
In reality I'd say this was a 5/10 because the effects were great and the symbiote looked cool but I had to give this a 1 because as a fan I thought it did Venom no justice and honestly comic book movies are not what they were 20+ years ago. There have been excellent comic book movies made these last 10 years that have set the bar very high and this one never even came close.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

After seeing some clips on YouTube, I figured maybe I was being too critical. I grabbed the Blu-ray when it was on sale and the film got better.Tom Hardy is delightfully over the top, he was passionate about the role since his son loves Venom. When the film came out, some critic actually compared Hardy to Jim Carrey in Liar Liar. The cast overall was fine, nobody else had juicy material. Maybe Riz Ahmed had two juicy scenes cut from the film. Anne is another generic love interest but she isn't a damsel in distress.Venom is a dark comedy, it doesn't take itself seriously. The humor works, I laughed a lot. I guess everyone liked the Brock/Venom dynamic regardless how they feel about the film.The story is okay, nothing special. Venom is intended to kickstart Sony's Marvel Universe but it doesn't feel that way. Venom is a small scale superhero film which feels like it was made around 2005. The film is short and fast paced but not too fast.The action scenes are fun, the motorcycle scene is the best. I understand why some fans feel the action scenes are cliche or workmanlike. Some fans were upset the film is PG-13 but the violence pushes the rating. Sony naturally wants Venom to crossover with Spider-Man.Overall, Venom is a fun Marvel film. Tom Hardy made the film fun, he was passionate. A better story or better villain would of been nice. Venom: Let There Be Carnage comes out next month, it should be better.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Still, I had a few mild laughs.For me, the beginning was slow. I kept waiting for the movie to get going. A lot of effort early on was put in to proving that Eddie was a loser and not a hero, so I guess that makes sense.Wild special effects, although some of the fight scenes were hard for me to visually decipher.I always love Michelle Williams, but the part didn't give her a chance to shine.Plenty of violence including machine guns and bodies getting slammed, but relatively light on the blood and gore.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Fool me twice shame on you AGAIN! No no I actually wasn't excited for this movie at all. I thought Venom himself looked good in the trailers, but never did I think ""oh wow I think this movie will be good!"" I went into it thinking without Marvel, Sony can't make a Spider-Man movie to save their life. And yup, I was proven right. Here's the thing, I'm reviewing this movie in two different ways. The first as a movie, and then second, a comedy. I kid you not I had a really fun time watching Venom. It's such a fascinating movie to talk about. It's so bad I was practically crying from laughing so much. I probably ruined it for a lot of people in the theater but I couldn't help it. As a movie it does not work at all, it feels so dated. If you remember watching movies like Ben Affleck in Daredevil or Ang Lee's Hulk, it feels exactly like that. Cheesy editing complete with comic panel shots, nonsensical plot and pretty much no character development whatsoever. Tom Hardy is AWFUL as Eddie Brock. I don't know if he actually thinks that's how Americans act but he's just a bumbling buffoon who hunches over almost all the time. None of the supporting cast is given anything to do either. The bad guy is an Elon Musk looking stock character evil business man 101 who gets another Symbiote to just have a big Symbiote fight with Venom at the end. (This fight looks worse than Bay's Transformers movies I couldn't tell what was even happening I'm not kidding). Michelle Williams is here I think for the money? She had no chemistry with Tom Hardy either I did not believe they were engaged. Venom as a character is great but has practically one of the worst arcs I've ever seen in a superhero film. If you're hoping to get a really dark, gritty, edgy monster movie with Venom you can just throw all that out the window because that's what Sony basically did. However, if you want to see a really bad comedy that has some shining scenes with Eddie and Venom then I say you should absolutely watch Venom. Whenever they're on screen together I actually enjoyed it, they gave his character funny dialogue that kept me engaged and made me wish this Venom would interact with Tom Holland's Spidey soon. It seriously would've benefited the movie if they just had Tom Holland show up and make it a buddy road trip type film where they have to work together to achieve a goal. Aside from Eddie and Venom's relationship I couldn't salvage anything good. ""Venom"" is incoherent, poorly written, stupidly acted, it's a movie that falls flat on its face and you'll either think it's terrible or just comedy galore. As a movie: 3/10. As a comedy: 10/10 BABY!!🎊🎉

The (extremely) shallow characters and terribly written script bring this movie down to Punisher and Daredevil lows. The action sequences are good, yes, but even that's not enough to save the movie. We've seen car chases and CGI fight scenes before. Give us something else!To add to the woes, the creators failed to capture the characters of Eddie Brock and Venom accurately. Here we have a comic and fun take on a dark, violent, and conflicted character. Venom was something controlling Brock, and giving him power. Considering Brock was depressed, unstable, and violent, this power empowered him to attack those he believed had wronged him (i.e. Spiderman). The symbiote was never Brock's ""friend"", as the movie would like us to believe. Now, I understand the studio wanted this movie to be PG-13 and cut-out several scenes to keep it at that rating. But even at a PG-13 rating, there could have been more effort to get the backstory right.If you were a fan of the more poorly received superhero movies, you will like this movie. If you would prefer seeing something on the Avengers, Deadpool, or Dark Knight level, well...skip this one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I wasn't disappointed with the result. Venom has two main parts: establishing the character and an action-packed second half. A smart move since Venom will stay here for a long time in the Marvel Universe and has plenty of room for future collaboration. A funny, entertaining watch, especially the scenes where Venom is having conversations with Eddie. Tom Hardy's performance is always a joy to see, in addition to the VFX, which I found quite satisfying. A good experience, and I am eager for the next one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At under 2 hours it doesn't overstay its welcome. Ruben Fleischer who directed Zombieland, takes the director's chair For Venom and like Zombieland, makes a movie that you go to to have a good ol' time at the cinema! It doesn't take itself too seriously, has many moments of humour, and also many scary scenes too. Very cool visual effects! Tom Hardy only adds to the movie's likeability, because he knows how to play a down to earth character, and a mad man at the same time. The director and producers, it was said were paying a lot of homage to Films of David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. I couldn't help but think of The Thing while watching this, and yes if you enjoy movies like The Thing, and the crazy body horror of David Cronenberg, you will no doubt enjoy this. Take that and add it into a marvel movie about a hero/anti-hero and you have Venom. Sure they could have made it R rated, but honestly it didn't really bother me that much. It seemed like they pushed the PG-13 rating as far as they could go with this. A definite theatre watch! 8.5/10","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Starring Tom Hardy in the title role, it is a strange anomaly of a film that feels like it is from another generation altogether.In San Francisco, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), a former investigative journalist, comes into contact with an alien symbiote that transforms him into a monstrous beast and gives him superhuman abilities. The beast calls itself ""Venom"" and tells Eddie that in order to survive on Earth, it needs to use him as its host. After discovering he is being pursued by a dangerous corporation, Eddie decides to ally with Venom to fend off the attackers.Tonally inept and quite bizarre, Venom revels in its campiness and its weird entertainment factor. Every terrible moment is often cancelled out by something so ridiculously fun that it is difficult not to be entertained by it, and in turn, for every great moment there is usually something stupid to undo it, effectively bringing some kind of warped balance to the entire viewing experience. Tom Hardy's performance in the lead role garners somewhat mixed reactions. As Eddie he plays it seriously but the moment he becomes Venom, he hams it up to absurd levels, especially with the voice he uses once he has transformed. The film does, however, nail Venom's personality traits and super abilities, in addition to showcasing some cheesy CGI effects on his character model. Overall, Venom could be seen from two different perspectives, the first being that it is a somewhat satirical take on some of the ridiculous superhero films of the mid 2000s (think Spider-Man 3, Fantastic Four, Daredevil), and the second being that it is yet another modern comic-based misfire from Sony Pictures, further proving that they should just give back the character rights to Marvel. Which of the two is entirely up to the viewer.I rate it 5.5/10","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Also, more humor than I expected as well ( which I enjoyed :) my oldest kid only gave it three out of 10 stars because he wanted it to be darker and harsher ( so, if that's what you're looking for, maybe you're not going to enjoy this as much as I did )","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The MCU has made all these studios wanna use the same blueprint and that should not be used in a Venom movie. This movie should be dark and have both body and psychosocial horror. If they wanted to eventually crossover with Spider-Man that's fine being PG13 in the future, but the origin story should be R. Now if the sequel with Carnage, who is a horrifying entity, isn't R, that will be terrible. That'd be like making Deadpool PG13. it goes for stupid laughs like that lobster tank scene. Eddie Brock is suppose to be a bodybuilder too, I love Tom Hardy, but he really doesn't make a good Eddie Brock for me. Sony is 0/2 on Eddie Brock casting. It's not to say this movie is a 1/10, but the fact that it's not very true to venom while also not being very good makes the movie a 1/10. It's been proven many times with Deadpool, Logan, and now Joker that R rated superhero, or antihero, or villain movies can be R and successful","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Fighting against a film that wastes its large budget on tiresome and forgettable action scenes (the film generally lacks a good set-piece), amateur editing and a thoroughly boring support cast led by Michelle Williams, Jenny Slate and Riz Ahmed, Hardy dives head first into his role and tries to single handily give Venom the spark it needed to succeed in embracing its zaniness. Much like Ryan Reynolds slipping into the Deadpool suit like a match made in movie heaven, Hardy feels like the man made to be Brock/Venom and as his down on his luck reporter begins his life as a duel being, Fleischer's film shows glimpses of what could've been had the studio had the guts to commit itself to joining Hardy in going after the true spirit of this creation. It's often laugh out loud hilarious seeing Hardy learning to deal with the new voice in his head (ever wanted to see Hardy sit in a tank full of live lobsters fully clothed?) and his new powers and at various times in these instances Venom becomes a genuinely funny and excitingly fresh feeling comic book movie but these instances are always fleeting as Fleischer's lifeless directing and Venom's tired plotline take hold once more. Fleischer's whose been in a funk since his breakout hit Zombieland allows Venom to truly become one of the most glaringly obvious cases of an actor trying their best to elevate a film they're in in quite some time and one hopes that as the film turns a profit, Hardy will stick around for further adventures that hopefully learn from the mistakes made here as this property feels far from D.O.A should the studio and future filmmakers match their actor at his game. Final Say - There's a lot wrong with Venom and its following of the rule book is both tiresome and unfortunate but there's no denying Hardy's brilliantly bonkers lead turn is worth the price of admission alone, even if everything else in Fleischer's film leaves much to be desired. 2 ½ newspaper vendors out of 5","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I am a big Tom Hardy fan, so I knew that for me it would be worth watching, even though I am not a follower of the Venom comicbook character. I was happy to read that Tom Hardy accepted the role partially because of his son's affection for the character, and that he also purposely minimized excessive violence and gore for his son's viewing pleasure, which I also prefer since I personally don't normally watch ""thriller"" films. The added humor helped create a more realistic and believable character in Eddie Brock. My film-snob friend who accompanied me was reluctant to see it, but I was relieved that he offered very few negative comments after watching the film. It is thoroughly entertaining, and I believe that Tom Hardy created a much better story and character that the average person can enjoy.

The dark humor was great, if not toned down. Could have been much better had they taken a queue from Deadpool (cough cough R-rated). The plot however was useless and the first half of the movie setting up the cliche ""villian domesday plan"" was C+ at best. In fact the script was so bad and expository that I started to pretend that there were ""comic book speech bubbles"" as the characters delivered their lines. After doing so, the movie turned a foot and became quite good. It became a live action comic book that was all but missing the fun visual aids and cut scenes that Ruben Fleischer absolutely nailed in Zombieland. Overall good time but definitely lacking an edge. Hardy as Brock / Venom was unquestionably memorable. Loved the anti-hero bro dynamic and hope they make a DARKER, more outrageous sequel featuring 2 hours of straight-up buddy comedy.

It's silly, stupid, and it takes itself entirely seriously. And I love it for those reasons. This movie is really fun, but the final battle was pretty awful. It's incredibly hard to follow, as Venom and the villain are nearly the same color, so it's just a confusing CGI mess. This movie is worse than most of the stuff Disney Marvel put out pre-phase 4, but I'd watch this over those any day of the week. Venom is terrible but it's so much fun, whereas pretty much all of the MCU movies (with a few exceptions) are just mediocre. If you like movies that are so bad they're goof then you'll probably like both of the Venom movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie isn't terrible, but Eddie Brock is a dweeb and Venom/the symbiote is definitely the much funnier and better character. It was pretty predictable with a by the numbers plot. The movie picks up once Eddie and Venom meet with the symbiote having quite a few hilarious lines.

This was somewhat the case for Venom. He did a great job as the lead role but the writing of the film felt bizarre and we are left with a film that should have been much better than what it was.Venom made a lot of money at the box office and is getting a sequel, but this film has divided critics and causal audiences. It's current Rotten tomatoes critics score is 29%, while the audience score is 81%. So that's to say this is a film where the audience saw something completely different than the critics. And which is why many of these IMDB reviews, we see titles with ""Ignore the critics"" or ""The critics are wrong"".Overall, Venom is decent fun but not great at all. The story line and plot is too predictable and at times unintentionally funny. The action is okay. This movie most likely would have been better with an R-rating for violence, but of course given its PG-13 rating, it was very toned down. The good thing is, a sequel is coming next year so it will give the studios a chance to get it right. It can't be as underwhelming as this.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

One of the reviews said that Venom isn't fun compared to Thor Ragnarok. I happened to find that entry to the MCU to be too childish. Too many forced jokes, and a serious lack of danger for the characters took me out of the film. Venom doesn't need constant one-liners, or surprise jokes to be entertaining. This film shows that Marvel films can still be great outside Disney control. Tom Hardy does a great job of balancing both characters as Eddy, and Venom. I've seen this movie twice and will be picking it up when it releases. Their is so much potential in this new Universe. Carnage is coming, and Spider-Man will fit perfectly here. Lets hope the critical response doesn't kill this series's momentum!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It isn't a slam dunk but it's not half bad either. Tom Hardy is great as usual and this film has some strong points. It was new to see a scary and big creature feature as an unusual hero. We are used to seeing prettier characters with fancy weapons. Venom chooses to be different and does an okay job of it. The humor is nicely done and the plot is decent enough and worthy of the marvel franchise.A few tweaks could have made this film fantastic. A more developed backstory for Hardy, also his decline is just too fast. In minutes he is fired and his fiance leaves him. Also the origins of Venom and its species could have got screen time. Any other Marvel film would have devoted 10-15 mins to this part. Also a different and killer soundtrack could have done wonders for the movie. But at the end of it not a bad installment in the Marvel franchise.7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This gives him super power such as incredible strength and self-healing capability.

The story and filming just fall so short of my expectations. I was hoping for a Deadpool/Logan approach that usually incorporates humor and dark storylines intertwined. This movie felt very targeted towards non-fans of the original anti-hero and seems to have been severely edited with loads of removed scenes. Once Tom basically bashed the movie in an interview, I knew this was going to disappoint. Hardy delivers a good performance but you can feel a true void between the acting, writing and the actual direction of the film. However, the movie did have some cool spots in it but ultimately just fell flat for the most part. This could've been Sony's redemption on superhero movies, but they've once again proven why their vision is lagging behind by 15 years.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film also explores Eddie's relationship with the symbiote, and his conflict with the film's main antagonist, Carlton Drake, played by Riz Ahmed.One of my personal favorite aspects of the film was Tom Hardy's performance as Eddie Brock, he perfectly captured the character's inner turmoil and his struggle to control the alien symbiote. The visual effects used to create Venom were also impressive and added to the overall enjoyment of the movie. The action scenes were also well-choreographed and provided some exciting moments.However, the pacing of the film was uneven, some scenes felt rushed and others dragged on for too long. The film's plot was also a bit simplistic and felt formulaic. Additionally, the chemistry between the characters was lacking and some of the subplots felt unnecessary.Overall, Venom is a film that provides some exciting action scenes and impressive visual effects, but it falls short in terms of pacing and plot. Tom Hardy's performance as Eddie Brock is a highlight, but the film's simplistic plot and uneven pacing make it difficult to fully enjoy the film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Great Action & Humor!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8187909/?ref_=tt_urv","jonnaharkenson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132381721/?ref_=tt_urv","30 May 2022","A solid 8/10 rating. I am not a hardcore comic book guy nor am I one of those nitpicking film critics who criticize films too hard. The film was certainly entertaining and enjoyable, it was not a solid 10/10 rating like you'd expect from 'The Avengers' films but I personally think it's good and the story was creative.I grew up watching Marvel cartoons and collected their toys as a kid. This is a great spin-off film about Venom, which from my memory is supposed to be one of Spider-Man's prominent archenemies... though in this film, he is (or they are) the good guy(s) and not a bad guy.I liked the backstory of the film, and I really liked how the film was shot in San Francisco (they actually filmed on location for some scenes) and it's a nice change from New York City. The buildup and conflicts of the relationships of the characters were good: both the guy Eddie and Venom, and also Eddie and his supposed love interest, Anne (which was played by Michelle Williams whose acting was very good). And there's a good amount of humor between Eddie and Venom, and Tom Hardy who plays Eddie does an amazing job acting as both characters.There's a balance of action, humor, and a slight dark tone (though more action and humor). If anything, you'll at least enjoy the action scenes which were a combination of live action and CGI which looked pretty decent. The fiom is very easy to follow along with, especially if you have zero knowledge of any of the Marvel comics or films, there were no plot holes that I recall.Overall, I recommend this film.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot holes are enormous and the movie is so slow. It took forever to get to the venom part of the movie so when it did they totally missed the mark. There were so many great opportunities to make some great scenes and instead they made venom look stupid. Some fight scenes were ok but the whole movie was a convoluted mess. It lacked direction and character development. This movie is like they took a good movie, put it in a blender and then tried to put it back together with pieces missing.

I feel as if alot of people only know Venom through the Spiderman film and therefore were expecting something totally different.It does feel a bit rushed as a standalone film and gives an impression that they weren't exactly sure how it was going to do on release and so have held back a little but it was a steady film kept me interested, didn't do anything well doesn't do anything bad.Tom Hardy does a good job as Eddie and the relationship development between Eddie and Venom is good. I'm hoping the second film (and hopefully more) will bring out venoms character more, he lacks his Bada$$ image in this film and doesn't really feel like an Anti-hero but we shall see what happens.Would have loved to have seen it as a more darker film which it would require to really bring Venom out but obviously the 15 Rating does not allow this.That said, its definitely worth a watch and I look forward to seeing where it goes.

But as a Marvel fan who thinks Marvel movies are becoming repetitive, it was nice to watch something different other than the regular super hero movie. Now, they tried their hand at comedy which was almost equally a hit and a miss. There are also a few plot holes, in my opinion. It shouldn't be rated PG-13 either, because Venom is a beast and viscious. It should've been rated R like Deadpool and Logan. The movie feels restricted simply because of that PG-13 rating. I also think it would've been better if they had put Venom in a Spider-man movie again before making it solo. In conclusion I give it a 7, because I still enjoyed it despite what I mentioned before. Not a great run for the first movie, but maybe they'll get there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The two join together in the course of the movie and literally form a homogeneous mass. This process is staged very nicely. The way the two communicate, feel each other out and slowly learn to cooperate is extremely harmonic and makes you want more. The combination Tom Hardy and Venom fits like a glove. This is a highlight of the movie.The other characters remain flat for long stretches and are only sparsely lighted up. One of the biggest weaknesses of the movie is the run-of-the-mill villain. This is more than just one-dimensional and a really comprehensible motivation cannot be discerned either. Of course, the protagonist is the focus, but for me the antagonist is also an important part of such kind of movies.The framework story also has no real depth. You know relatively quickly what it all boils down to. If you look at the running time of the movie, most of it is used to build foundations which is basically good and definitely necessary. The showdown at the end is pushed through. The ratio doesn't seem coherent. It wouldn't have hurt the movie at all to be half an hour longer. More time to intensify the frame story, more time for the final showdown and more time to fill important secondary characters with life.Tom Hardy is the bright spot and Venom offers potential for a sequel. I would be up for it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's nothing more than the studio needing to push th ratings to recoup more money from consumers.Venom is a popular comic book hero because of his storyline. Leave it to Hollywood to screw up an awesome character. They always have to use the same vomited formula. Do they realize there doesn't always have to be a ""Good Guy"" that does the right thing? Venom is written as a bad guy in the comic books yet the movie decides to make him into this good guy-esque figure.The comic book story was a winner. Once again Hollywood creates a loser. It's getting to the point that anything Hollywood touches turns to shhhhh. Not sure what happened to the writers of generations past, but the writers of the current generation in Hollywood need to go ahead and pass the torch because the last 10+ years have been terrible.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

So much, that I didn't realize nearly 2 hours had passed by and the movie was nearing its end. But it could have been so much better with an anti-hero like this. I enjoyed Tom Hardy and his Venom persona but was really upset with Riz Ahmed, he just didn't have that main character feel and couldn't convey his 'I am saving the world by killing people' rhetoric. John Cena did that so much better as Peacemaker!The other side characters weren't convincing either, it seemed like Tom Hardy solely carried the movie. A lot of the jokes fell flat, the focus on Venom seemed quite less and Riot didn't seem like such a Riot after all. Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't bad, I'd actually re-watch it someday but it had so much wasted potential. I plan to watch the second part though someday and hopefully; it isn't a letdown.It was really nice seeing Stan Lee though, in 2022. His movies truly carry him on.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I love Spider-Man. He's my second favorite superhero of all time (if you know me then you know a Man of Steel is number one). I know more about Spider-Man than I care to admit. Venom, outside of The Joker, is probably my favorite villain. (Yes I do know he's an antihero as well but he can be both) I was not on board with a Venom only film. I hate Spider-Man 3. Their portrayal of Venom is awful. (And how is that still the highest grossing Spider-Man film of all time worldwide?) Making a Venom film with no Spider-Man is just criminal. Sony wants to make sure to keep all the rights to the web-slinger in-house while they lend him out to the MCU. So here we are with a Venom film starring the always good Tom Hardy in the role of Eddie Brock.Like in sports where they talk about a tale of two halves, this is a tale of two movies. The first half of this film is dull. It's really only set up what we all know what will eventually happen. But it's not interesting. Eddie is a reporter in San Francisco with his own investigative show like Anderson Cooper 360. He had a wonderful girlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams) and a decent life. There is two at most mentions of his life in New York City at the Daily Bugle. Which is like the only thread to anything Spider-Man.I don't want to give too much but while asked to do an interview with billionaire head of The Life Foundation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), Eddie stumbles upon something huge, that sends his life into chaos of the epic kind.Now, this eats up at least 40 minutes of the film. And it's not worth so much time taken to set all of this up. It would have been so much easier if the opening credits could have been the montage of Eddie's show. And splice in shots of him and Anne living together. This film benefited from Eddie already investigating The Life Foundation. Then from there get wild and follow Eddie when he first meets Venom and their interactions. Because when this film is the Eddie/Venom adventure, this film is so much fun and entertaining.As soon as Venom shows up, the second half of this film is everything I wanted in a real Venom movie. Hardy as Eddie is okay. Hardy as Eddie deal with Venom (also the voice of Venom) is hilariously fantastic. The film becomes this fun adventure, action fantasy with Eddie trying to control/get rid of/come to terms with Venom. When Venom speaks he's smart, he thoughtful and so funny. 90% of this film should have just been an adventure following Venom and Eddie. Michelle Williams does get some good moment but she's the only one. Riz Ahmed is the typical villain who thinks he's doing good. He brings nothing to the table and that part could have been played by anyone. Jenny Slate is wasted as a scientist working for the life foundation. When you have their talent, play to their strengths not making them cardboard cutouts.For the amount, I've crushed the film, the second half kind of makes it all up for me. Venom onscreen looks exactly like he should. He hulking, a beast of a creature and at times terrifying. Some of the FX work is shoddy (parts of the final battle) but for the most part, works. The action is fast paced and fun. The tone and look of the film does have the quality of the older Spider-Man 2000's films. I hope in the sequel they can make it look less dated.I loved this movie (especially the second half). It has its flaws, but I wasn't expecting something to blow me away. It did in a sense. Tom Hardy is great as Eddie/Venom. The action kept me on my toes. When Venom, the film has all of the fun brought back into it. What anyone expected from the trailer is exactly what is on screen. This is a midnight movie dressed up as a Sony/Marvel blockbuster. This is one of the few films I can see myself watching over and over. I only hope in the sequel they build on what worked so well in this...more Eddie/Venom, please!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are some great actors here as well: Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed. These combined with the alien's sarcastic wit and some nice special effects make the movie better than average. What takes away from the movie are some poor film-making mistakes that the clutter the movie. For example, the bad corporate guys (from the Life Foundation) seem to have unexplainable superpowers of their own in their ability to instantly show up, find and track the lead character in all the chase scenes. Most movies are like this, but not as vividly as in this movie. Another problem is the character arc of the alien itself ... there's no rhyme or reason to it ... it seems so random. It's very poorly thought out.The critics are nailing this film for good reasons. A lot of bad mistakes were made in scriptwriting, editing and directing. But for me, the ""big ideas"", special effects and the alien's wit were enough to make this movie likable. If you like other Marvel movies, you'll probably like this one too despite some very rough edges. Let's hope all is fixed for future iterations.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

My friend and I went to see this in the theatre opening night and we had an amazing time. We both agreed that Tom Hardy did an amazing job as Eddie and Venom. I can imagine that his work playing two characters in the movie Legend might have helped him out a little. The plot isn't anything special but I'd still recommend seeing the movie for Tom Hardy's amazing performance. Not to mention it's a really funny film and I can't wait for the sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the case of Venom, it adheres to the typical Marvel movie formula, featuring familiar elements such as an ordinary individual gaining superpowers, a formidable antagonist, and a clichéd love story. However, this well-established formula works consistently because it fulfills our expectations for a superhero film.The character of Venom holds a captivating allure, having been misrepresented in the past in ""Spider-Man 3."" Fortunately, this film allows us to witness the Venom we cherished in the comics, brought to life through Tom's exceptional acting prowess. It serves as a promising beginning for this character, and I eagerly anticipate future developments in Venom's cinematic journey.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had not even heard of Venom before I watched this film but decided to take a punt as it seemed like the only film we could all decide on as a family. Well, it blew my socks off!!!! Hooked from the very beginning. It's not a typical Marvel film at the start as it has elements of horror and doesn't have a heroic theme until further into the film but I was absolutely captivated. The jokes were funny, the CGI amazing and Tom Hardy is one of the most unvain actors around. Perfectly cast for this role and it really shows off his versatile acting skills. Marvel actors don't normally win oscars, but I would nominate him if I worked in the industry.
The only downside to the film , and this is only to balance out my critique is I found the actors not looking in the right direction when interacting with the CGI symbiote. But that was only in two scenes, the rest of the movie is flawless.
It's a great film which will entertain you and leave you with the biggest smile ever. Critics dont always get it right, and this is one prime example.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was a blast to see Eddie and Venom bond, and Tom Hardy played a very good Eddie Brock. Also, the acting in general was surprisingly good.

It's a mess but I had a lot of fun laughing at it's expense. It was basically everything that I hoped for...well okay an R-rating is what I hoped for but ehhhh...Tom Hardy has a really bad New Yorker accent that's like a cartoon, but looking past that he did a good job here. He really gets his character and does add a lot to the movie. And the relationship between Venom and Eddie is pretty great. It's not quite a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" situation, but the whole interactions between the two characters were pretty great. And the stuff with Venom that we do get is also pretty cool too. I like the buildup to when we see full Venom in action, and he does remind me a lot of the comics. So that is the one real genuine praise I can give outside of some odds and ends like the motorcycle chase being pretty fun to watch and Michelle Williams is also good here too despite her weak character, but more on that later. Unfortunately for some, but fortunately for me, the movie is broken!The action scenes are pretty bland. While I did like the motorcycle chase scene, outside of the Symbiote power there really isn't much new when it comes with the framing and stunt choreography that I haven't seen before, and honestly better. The motorcycle chase is the only good action scene, because every other action set piece is poorly shot, jumbly edited, and depending on the setting also hard to follow sometimes when it's in darker settings. Which is especially true with the fight sequence with Venom and Riot. Both characters do look rather similar and seeing them duke it out with the mess of editing it makes it hard to figure out who was fighting who. But it does have a roundabout way of being funny to watch when you see these reoccurring elements done before in other action films.Riz Ahmed makes for an underwhelming bad guy. Sure he is a generic bad guy, but if you ham it up it can be fun to watch. However Ahmed plays him very reserved and not very expressive, always having a very blank expression. Which I guess is kind of the point given the character is supposed to be cold, but I just never bought him. The character is a more evil version of Mark Zuckerberg, but he comes off more like Gabe from the Office! Although Ahmed got nothing on Jenny Slate! She is flat out terrible in this, underacting and looking so bored on screen! She always has a super bland and blank expression! Like there's a scene where she gets caught whistleblowing the company she works for, and her expression when she is caught comes off like she left the lights on in her apartment when she left. Like...why?There was some bad publicity leading up where Tom Hardy blatantly said that 40 minutes of the film was cut, I don't know if it was the more gorier parts of the film that was promised to us, but I think there was a lot of development cut out, because judging on the theatrical cut this script is underdeveloped! I gave Michelle Williams credit for being pretty good in the movie, and she is, but the relationship between Eddie and her character is extremely underdeveloped, especially when there are like some kind of romantic tension with her and her new man, who is absolutely pointless in this regard. I honestly did not care about Tom Hardy and Michelle William's relationship at all. The relationship with Eddie and Venom also felt underwhelming too. Like the general tension between the two is fine, but Venom turns from a ""I wanna wreck things in this world"" to ""actually this planet is pretty cool I'm gonna save it"" in the blink of an eye! Like...where was the development? The movie flies by so fast too! It's barely 2 hours long but it feels a lot more like an hour and a half film. Which does run into a problem with the short development and story arks and especially the third act which flies by very quickly. The tone is also a mess. It's not a straight up horror film, but it does have a ton of psychological elements to it mixed with a campy Marvel movie, it's jarring but it's also hilarious having these two different tones at odds with each other. Like the third act has a song cue right out of an Avengers film and it is so out of place, it's amazing!If there is one thing I can credit about the script, it's the dialogue. There are some intentionally funny scenes and quips, but for the most part it's poorly written and pretty cheesy and edgy. It was hilarious, and probably unintentional too which makes it better!Overall the movie is garbage but go in with the right mindset it is a fun movie to rip apart with friends. The jarring tones, underwritten screenplay, and corny edge makes this a hilarious romp! Although I will say that it is also a bit disappointing if Sony kept it as an R-rated movie, developed more on the relationship with Eddie and Venom, and had someone who wasn't a studio hack like Ruben Fleischer and had the tone feel like an Evil Dead movie, then it would be a fun watch AND a legit good movie instead of making a safe movie for a doomed and terrible Spider-Man-less cinematic universe. But I am satisfied with the trash baby that it is!Also the movie has practically the same story beats as Catwoman and that got me SHOOK!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Slow introduction of characters (several of whom I find to be mis-cast), the ordinary guy becomes the 'hero' (SpiderMan infection thing), difficulties are faced and ultimately overcome.
What makes Venom at least tolerable is Tom Hardy. He has a depth and presence that compel the viewer and makes the comic light relief believable. Otherwise, Venom would really be less than average.
Good SFX, well-filmed, but overly long intro, rushed ending, poor casting and an unoriginal story line make Venom average at best.

It follows a not too confusing and linear pace, but at the same time doesn't feel too rushed and allows for some really intimate and engaging acting unlike - Avengers: infinity war...Let me assure you, the curse of spider-man 3 has been broken! Venom can work as a violent yet funny character similar to deadpool, the CGI is incredible, the humour and script is well-written, there's even hints of Alien-film soundtrack and the famous French horn sound used as the theme for Venom in Spider-man 3 makes a return.This film could've turned out much, much worse. Don't trust those bad reviews based on other repetitive Marvel films, look at the winning financial viewing results, or better yet watch it yourself and decide.

The biggest flaw in the movie is really that a few characters could have been written better, which does hold it back a bit. It's nothing terrible, but nothing amazing either.

From the eyes of a Fanboy it may be nice or funny.
That does not make it a GOOD movie.
In any case, it makes it more fan service than a movie.
And what is happening is just what happened with Bright and Suicide Squad, these are ""nice"" movies for the average moviegoer, but for critics and people who have some film or media training it is not a good production.
And this is the reason why we have two scores for the movies, audience and critics (Yes, I'm saying the general audience tends to be stupid)So in summary Venom IS NOT GOOD, in the best of cases it is a movie, nothing more than a sequence of images accompanied by soundThat's just my opinion, and I honestly think it's valid, because the people that told me Venom is good are the same people who like Transformers and Fast & Furious, which I guess is what the studio was going for, the mindless audience.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

As funny as that was, it wasn't 50% accurate. 2018's Upgrade was 5x the movie Venom was.That said, Venom was still somewhat worth watching, if only for the hunk Tom Hardy is. In the first half, anyways.After an enormously long first act, we finally got to some of the symbiotic goods. Generic rich bad guy brings back a parasite (sorry!) from space, but fails at finding the perfect host. Enter in Bane, sorry, not him or the 3rd villain from Spider-Man 3 and Venom is born.Follow that by some so-so action scenes with several horrible CGI effects, we finally land on a plot and the final act can put us to sleep. Well, it did me. I literally had to rewind it several times to complete the climactic battle between two battling blobs.Sad thing is, while said first half was slow, at least Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and other characters were interesting and deep. The moment the CGI hit the bodies, Hardy turned into a cartoon and comically bad to watch. It was like two completely different movies for him to star in and lost me.Additionally, it felt like the script just needed one, maybe two more rewrites. The whole movie felt disjointed at times and almost a chore to finish. Also, Venom/Eddie Brock's not just an antihero, he's a straight up murderer...so stop trying to get me to be on his side!***Final thoughts: Boy, do I miss Spider-Man. Guess I better see his animated movie soon in theatres and wash this black goo right off me.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy is both engaging and hilarious as both Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom, and the two and fro between the two characters is what really makes the film work.As a film though, it's fine, but relatively unspectacular. It follows a reasonably generic Marvel-style pattern which guarantees it's head is kept above water, but it also means that there is a little case of ""Seen it before"" happening. The script could be better and the CGI is pretty terrible and looks more like late 90s tier computer images.However the Venom personality, while essentially evil, becomes incredibly endearing towards the end of the film, and as such and ropy effects or script blandness were made redundant, plus I was left hoping for a sequel.If they can get a better script with sharper banter between Brock and Venom and have the film a bit less generic in structure then this could be a fantastic franchise all on its own. No Spider-Man required!All in all, a great start and a very entertaining film which has it where it counts.Recommended!","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Due to the way I personally experienced this film, I would love to sugarcoat it and talk about the positives and mention why all of the negatives are really positives, but that would just be ignoring the film as a whole. Venom is the latest attempt at starting a Marvel franchise outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and if this movie is any indication of what their plans are, then I'm afraid for this world to expand. That being said, at times, this movie is a blast to watch and I had a decent time at the theatre. I'm by no means calling this a good film, but here's why some viewers will probably find some enjoyment.Taking next to nothing from the source material, Venom follows Eddie Brock as he stumbles upon an alien life form known as a Symbiote. The company known as the Life Foundation has been running tests on these Symbiotes in hopes of merging them with a human. Once Eddie merges with the Symbiote known as Venom, chaos ensues and he begins to wreak havoc on the city, or face certain death if he doesn't cooperate. The fact that his life is in danger is literally the only glimpse at the true origin of this character. Quite honestly, the fact that they weren't able to use Spider-Man really took away from the depth that this film could've achieved. That aside, I chose to watch the movie as if it was an original film, with no comic origins to weigh it down.As a movie with absolutely no baggage, it creates some of its own by having a first act that relies far too heavily on the serious aspects of this foundation and not enough humour with the character of Eddie Brock. By the time Eddie becomes one with Venom, his sequences are very funny and easily staple themselves as the highlights of the film. From the dialogue to the set-up, this character was far better than the film that surrounded him. I found myself loving every whimsical second of the presence that either Eddie Brock or Venom provided. Their interaction with one another made me wish I had been watching a better movie with them in it.As far as the action goes, the second half of the film is loaded with it. When this film begins, it drags on quite a bit with a very mediocre premise, while also rushing through many story beats, making it quite the jumbled mess. If you're willing to be patient with a film in order to get to some awesome and even comedic sequences, then I would recommend Venom to you, based purely on entertainment. This is a film that would have benefitted from a teenage audience over a decade ago. The standard that has been set by many comic-based hero films these days are just too high for a film like this to match.In the end, Venom is a film that has a very strong, entertaining, and even hilarious central anti-hero. Its biggest flaw is the fact that every character is very standard and one-dimensional, and given that this film has a supporting cast in Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed, that's quite upsetting. It has a decent score and the action is entertaining at times, but the story itself falls flat on its face. This movie would've benefitted from the true origin of its titular character, but the presence of that character is pretty awesome on-screen. Although the movie is very hollow, I would almost recommend this film for Tom Hardy's performance as Eddie Brock, because it was fantastic. Overall, Venom isn't a good film, but there are some terrifically entertaining moments.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

I got easily bored watching this man.
Trust me when i say this, too much senseless CGI, a weak villian and a weak lead actress.
The only reason to watch the movie is to see the bad ass Tom be a total bad ass in screen.
Well thats my two cents, watch it but it aint good.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I get the strong feeling this film has been targeted by spammers and trolls to bring it's ratings down, which is a shame.
 It's a good movie. 
 Don't get me wrong, it had its flaws so I'll get them out of the way so I'm not being biased.
 Some of the action and CGI was a little lacking ie one fight scene could have been more impressive and brutal. It has a 15 rating in England and I didn't see that it needed one, I'd take my kid to see it and not worry. 
Those were only minor gripes to me as this movie was so much fun to watch. 
 I didnt mind the changes from the source material, they still crafted a very enjoyable origin story for a great Marvel character.
 They got the look and feel of Venom right, and with a brilliant performance from Tom Hardy you can't go wrong. He really made the balance of twisted and dark humour that makes Venom so enjoyable as a character. 
There were some hilarious moments and the conversation between Eddie and Venom was just how I wanted it to be.
 Well worth the watch.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

After failing to reboot Spider-Man and coming to an agreement with Marvel Studios to share the character, Sony have been left with the web-slinger's rogue gallery, and with some kind of anti-superhero universe clearly in mind, they have kicked events off with their most popular villain, the hulking and long-tongued Venom. You may remember the character from the franchise-killing Spider-Man 3 in 2007, and you also may believe you've gone back in time over 10 years when watching this spectacularly dull and frustratingly origin story, which harks back to the dark days of the Ben-Affleck-headlined Daredevil and Tim Story's Fantastic Four.A spaceship launched by the shadowy Life Foundation crashes down to Earth carrying four symbiotic alien lifeforms gathered from a nearby comet. Three are retrieved by the Foundation's Elon Musk-esque CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) and taken back to their San Francisco research facility for experimentation, but one escapes, latching itself on to an ambulance driver before hopping between various people in an attempt to find a suitable host. Enter Eddie Brock (Hardy), an investigative journalist who trades in exposing and bringing down corrupt organisations. When given the chance to interview Drake, Eddie naturally uses the opportunity to question the entrepreneur about some of the horrific allegations, including experimenting on humans. The interview is cut short, and soon Eddie finds himself fired and split from his fiancee Anne (Michelle Williams). He sees the chance to redeem himself when a disgruntled Life employee gives him access to their labs, which turn out to be holding cells for symbiote testing on the homeless. The rest you can guess: a symbiote finds its way onto Eddie and he spends the rest of the film dealing with newly-acquired powers (and taste for human heads).Marvel Studios have got the formula down to a tee, endearing superheroes to millions of new fans who had never touched a comic-book in their lives. It's somewhat sad to see Venom try to take the genre back more than a decade, when many studios were under the impression that the only way an audience will buy into a world of superpowers is through forced humour. The MCU balances humour and drama in a way that almost guarantees your emotional investment, and if you're going to go for all-out comedy like Ant-Man or Thor: Ragnarok, y'know, make it funny. The sight of Hardy cooling down in a lobster tank or flashing expressions of gormless confusion for nearly two hours does not make for pleasing entertainment. The actor is incredibly bad, and his choice to go with a mumbled accent and hunched posture means that his character fails to convince as a journalist with serious credentials. The remainder of the cast don't fare much better, although its hardly their fault. It's a thankless role for Williams, who is given little to do other than playing the role of Eddie's conscience, and Ahmed has no dimension to play around with as the stock soulless corporate type. The climax is a forgettable smack-down featuring two indistinguishable CGI creations, something The Incredible Hulk did far better ten years ago. Despite all of this, Ruben Fleischer's bland fossil of a film raked in over $800 million worldwide, so I'm afraid a sequel is inevitable.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was excited for this movie. I love Spider-Man a lot and Venom is my favorite Spider-Man villain. Sony also just did Spider-Man: Homecoming which is one of my favorite marvel movies and actually movies of all time because it was done so well. The trailers didn't look that great but I was still hoping it would be good. The reviews came in and I got less exited. This was a huge disappointment. It was trying so hard to be great but there were so many problems. Before the long list of negative here are some positives. I liked Tom Hardy as usual. He wasn't my favorite choice for Eddie Brock but I liked him. I liked the twisted relationship with him and Venom. I really liked the after credit scenes, especially the very last one. The movie seemed to get more entertaining to watch as it went along too. That's about it. Now the negatives. Wow what a bad script. You could tell some scenes were rewritten because they just didn't seem to fit after one another in some cases. This made the pacing choppy. Speaking of pacing, the first 45 minutes were so boring. Nothing was happening. I was wondering if we were ever going to get to Venom because there was just about only one hour left. Finally Venom comes in and it get a little interesting. The CGI wasn't that good I will add. There was action scenes that were just ok. Venom is black and most of the action scenes were at night so you couldn't really tell what was going on sometimes. Also it felt weird when it ended for me. The poor writing just made it seem that the climax of the film wasn't, but I guess it was. Speaking of poor writing, and I won't spoil what it is, but if you have a good ear there is a small DC reference in it. This is a Marvel universe film where DC doesn't exist. That bugged me a lot. The tone felt off for me too. It was an action film that was trying to be like a horror movie with more funny moments in it, which I can kind of see because Venom is supposed to have a twisted sense of humor. The way it came off though didn't work. I think the movie would've also benefited from an R rating. Everything was censored when it shouldn't have been. Rated R Marvel movies like Logan and the Deadpool movies were great. Without those R ratings I think those movies wouldn't be as good. They rating really needed to be changed. Alrighty on to characters. Riz Ahmed played the antagonist, Carlton Drake, and he's a pretty good actor. I really liked him in Nightcrawler. He was horrible in this. I think it was because of his character. Drake was a scientist who doesn't care about people and just about his experiment and power. Nothing else. It reminded me of Yellow Jacket in the first Ant-Man. Michelle Williams was also in this and I didn't enjoy her character much either. Also she was barely in it. She's a very talented actress so I thought they would use her maybe a little more. I don't know what else to write about. All I can say is that I'm very disappointed. Especially with a good director, Ruben Fleischer, who director Zombieland. If you want to see it don't be too surprised if you don't like it. I knew I wasn't going to like it based on the 30% Rotten Tomatoes gave it and 35 by MetaScore. For some reason some audiences have been liking it. On IMDb it has a 7.1/10. And audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is an 89% somehow, which is higher than A Star is Born (very good movie and I will have the review posted soon). I don't know. There was a good performance, good relationship, and it kind of got better as it went along. Also good after credit scenes. Though one is setting up for a sequel which I'm happy for but they'll probably mess up like they did with this. See it if you'd like. I'd suggest A Star is Born, the better release of this past weekend.My Grade: C-","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The bike chase provided a little bit of a thrill but not that memorable.

I'm pleased I watched It at the cinema because if I watched it at home I would of been playing on my phone out of boredom.

Venoms Voice and what they did to his Character is a shame.

Still not a great film I'd say, but a solid one.Tom Hardy gives a great performance as Eddie Brock/Venom, same with Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake/Riot he's a great ass hole. I'd have to say my favorite parts of the film are when Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Reid Scott are together on screen they all three have great chemistry, and lead to some laughs.My biggest concern is now leading up to Venom Let There Be Carnage is the PG-13 rating, as well as the runtime. This films run time was 1hr and 52mins but still felt short. Venom Let There Be Carnage will be sporting a run time of 1hr and 30mins way shorter than the first.All in all this is an enjoyable film but in my opinion didn't quite live up to the hype.5/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But too many plot holes to be anything close to a worthy Marvel film. Certainly considering how awesome this anti hero can be, it's hard to imagine how this film could have gone so wrong.Sadly, it just doesn't work. The closest I can get to pin-pointing the problem is the character direction. These characters and actors are all pretty decent, but they seem somehow stunted in this timeline of flat, non-emotional dialogues for a good few hours. Better direction of this film may have saved it.Otherwise the film is quite good. Venom is a fantastic character and concept and I'm gutted this film didn't do it justice. Moreover, scared that it's coming around again for a sequel - when they'd be better off signing the character over completed to the MCU who could encapsulate Venom a bit better.

So y should just stop trying and give venom and the rest of the spider verse to Marvel who actually know what they're doing.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The earth is dying, the human race on the brink of extinction.
The villain runs a technology company, brings slimy aliens back from a space expedition, he wants aliens to inhabit humans, escape the earth and build a new world somewhere else. Tom hardy plays the sarcastic anti-hero with some humour, but not enough.
There's the standard love interest, but I'm bored with this stock character.
There's some exciting CGI action sequences, but a bit dull before Venom properly appears. I found it hard to relate to anything.
Tom Hardy never appears to be in jeopardy.

I shouldn't look for a plausible scientific plot in a comic book movie, but I am pretty sure the planet is not one generation away from being uninhabitable.. c'mon!!!

Only good parts we're some of the banter between Hardy and Venom, a lot of the jokes come off as cringe-inducing, and some of Hardy's acting.
Use of actors like Riz Ahmed were underutilized.

This movie feauters one of the best action sequences of the year so far (nothing compared to anything in Mission: Impossible - Fallout but still impressive) where Eddie Brock (Hardy) escapes his persucers on a moterbike aided by the abliities of Venom. After a pretty slow bulid up this scene really beagn to peak my intrest and get me ingaged in the film, despite obvious cuts around the more violent moments this was a real highlight.It's a shame that the rest of the film cannont live up to this however, the paper thin plot moves at a snail's pace, any attempt at horror is lost in the edit and the massive CGI mess of a finale is extermly difficult to follow and extemly dull to watch.Riz Ahmed is terribly miss cast as a suposedly threatening villain and Michelle Williams plays the same shell of a character that she has been stuck playing for years. this cast desevers so much better than this and so does the character.I really don't have to much else to add about this film, it's just pretty boring.

Venom ate someone in a trailer. That's all I needed.Venom is direct and straight to the point. It builds up a little background, just enough to give some weight to what is to come. But it's enough. I don't need Eddie Brock's childhood story, or to see him getting his first journalist job. Irrelevant. Eddie is shown as a maverick journalist, who will do what he has to for the truth. That's honestly all we need to know. This is an action movie about aliens and humans morphing into one.It was quick paced, brought in secondary characters and let them go as needed, with just as much as we needed.We showed up for Venom wrecking carnage and eating people. To him being an antihero. And for him and Eddie to be bros as they had some violent good times. I got exactly what I paid for.Tom Hardy delivered, the effects were great and didn't take me out of the movie once with any awkwardness. I was a little put off with Hardy's and Michelle Williams' chemistry. Both were fantastic, so I will chalk that up to me not feeling it. But ... who cares?The real romance was between Eddie and Venom, and that chemistry was real and palpable. A true love story.Get the origin stories of other Marvel films out of your mind, cleanse that palette for this. This movie is rougher, darker and obviously more violent. Doesn't make it better or worse, just different. This movie knew what it wanted to be and grew up to be it.Nine stars for being awesome ... minus one star for no knowledge currently of a sequel.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Why: just to make sure enough kids will be allowed into the cinemas. So instead of getting a lot of good dark humor we got a lot of stupid dialogues. Instead of seeing few great CGI we see a lot of bad rendering. They even cut out some scenes from the trailer... that's suck. Like this whole movie.Marvel is known for making rather fun to watch movies. Nothing too sophisticated nor too dumb. Association with Marvel here ends with the main character.

Maybe a 7. But its good. Not the greatest. But the dynamic between organism and host its really enjoyable to see through the whole movie. Thats what pushes the movie forward. So in the end Venom works. Its entertaining enough for a second watch at theaters. Definetely Will do that.But on too of that i need to address the fact that Critics these days are biased towards product and company.How can Critics give The Last Jedi stellar Reviews and Stellar when that movie is a complete disrespect of all sorts. And then give this movie the lowest, when what it sets out to do it makes it with a bang!I dunno judge for urself. But what i say is. Make ur own voice and this time around ignore the Critics score about this one. They are the ones who thought it was cool to not think anymore. Why did Luke leave a map behind for the resistance to find him to begin with when all he wants is to die... (Which he accomplishes masterfully... Snoke didnt even tried... No one did... So lame it stinks) and then comes this really enjoyful flick and they take it too seriously.Critics are down and out from now on. It was enough. See the movie u want to see and if it was bad, carry on. Next. But don't let Critics steer u away from good movies. Just because they made a name for themselves.Be your own. Raise your voice. And remember if a movie is good just spread the word to ur closest and enjoy a good night at the theater with the ones u dig.Take care y'all
Its a venomous world now.

I had my doubts that they could make a decent film out of this particular character, but I didn't think it could be quite this horrible. The tone is all over the place, with attempted jokes in the face of head-eating and mass murder, none of which appears to leave any impression on the characters, who act as if everything is a minor inconvenience to be shrugged off with a smile and a bit of shoddy wit. The ""motives"" of the characters (including Venom) are so vague they might as well be considered a form of arcane mysticism. Tom Hardy is an intelligent performer: I am sure he knows that this was strictly ""get paid and get out"" territory. The ethical landscape of the film is a disaster site, with a cool hipness being displayed between scenes of rampaging violence on a mass scale, and no lasting emotional scars on any of the participants. No consequences but for one death, and a lot of innocents slaughtered to no apparent end. The art direction is poor also, with everything in a splash of light blue. Difficult to watch and really emblematic of the general degradation of American cinema since the 70s. A vacuous exercise in mindless action and lack of human psychology. Wretched.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yup. It's WORSE than your average Marvel movie.I know acting might not be one of the more important thing in this kind of movie but oh boy it sure sucks. This movie contains some of the most unbelievable characters on screen. Drake doesn't act and feel like a leader of any foundation, he just walk around acting angry and spoilt (and the scene with the kids in the beginning makes him look like some low lever employee in the foundation). And the girlfriend is even worse. Zero believe-ability. Even a ""rented girlfriend"" can act better. There were ABOUT TO GET MARRIED and there isn't a slight tint of sadness of regret during all the breakups etc. Apparently bonds can just come and go like some weekend fling. Either this is some American culture which I don't understand, or the acting is just not there.Next, the humor parts are embarrassing. Some humor in any movie is ok. But not the way it was done in Venom. It gets incredibly cliche from the middle towards the end of the movie. In the beginning there's still some people laughing at the bad jokes in the theater (you know, those people who can laugh at anything), but even they stopped laughing towards the end. OK, at least they only brought these on towards the end, else people (like me) would have left the theater half way. SMART.The worst thing is .. these stupid humor were being performed on Venom himself .... oh boy these destroys everything. Venom was actually kind of cool (with the intelligence and the voice) and I might actually watch a part 2 just to see that but now .. NAY. Forget it. I have a personal theory: Any movie that uses these kind of bad humor doesn't have any confidence at all that the movie will succeed. It's like using sprinkles on top of very bad food. If you have them there, it at least looks complete to sell.Last time, even bad movie had some standards.
PS: I didn't know I have to even further lower my standards to enjoy movies like these nowadays. (Which I can't sorry)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

On one hand this movie is a ridiculous mess with no clear rythm or structure. On the other hand it's one of the funniest experiences I've had for the longest time.
It's like someone decided, that they wanted to combine The Mask and The Room, and turn it into a superhero-movie from the year 2003.
Tom Hardy is great as Jim Carrey, who gets infected with the biggest sociopathic and monstrous gay icon from outer space. Together Eddie ""Jim Carrey combined with Tommy Wiseau"" Brock and Venom have more chemistry and personality than rest of the cast combined.
This movie is like a trainwreck, which somehow managed to become a beautiful, surreal sculpture after the crash.
If you want to see a good movie with great writing, and a good balance of drama and comedy, don't see this movie. If you yearn for an accidental dark comedy with what feels like the longest chase scene ever, then this is the right mess for you.
Even though I loved every second of this burning pile of trash, except for the boring and confusing beginning, I can't give this a good rating.

First off, thanks to those of you who did rate the movie low for obvious reasons. This review goes straight to the knuckleheads who criticized the bad user reviews.First of all, to put things in perspective, I don't think I've ever picked up a comic book in my life unless it was because a real book was underneath it. So the problems some users had with the absence of Spider Man or the fact that Venom wasn't as badass as he is supposed to be didn't give me any issues. This is a real movie review from a non comic book fan. I should also say that doesn't mean I find fault with every comic book movie. I loved both Deadpools, enjoyed Fantastic Four, didn't really like the last Avengers movie but liked the ones before that. I like Guardians of the Galaxy, Batman and Superman are meh. Thor is pretty cool. Point is, I watch these things and it's not like I avoid them like the plague.Venom is like an Adam Sandler movie. No, not one of the classics. We aren't talking Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, we are talking Jack and Jill bad. I agree with the users who made it seem like Venom was going to go dark, but just withered. It's like when your big brother jumps out of the closet to scare you but in the end you see he's just wearing a white sheet and was too lazy to even cut out or draw on eyes and a mouth. The jokes I was expecting to be funny based on user views here must not have made it into the cut I watched. I think I maybe laughed once. There's just not really much of this movie I liked, whether it was a 40 something Michelle Williams dressing like a university Freshman, or the attempts at slapstick that made it look like the script writer fell asleep and his 14 year old filled in some blanks mad libs style. It was just not intelligently written, poorly stylized, lacked any cinematic beauty, and the action wasn't all that interesting. The only redeeming quality was that of Hardy's acting. He's legitimately a good actor. The rest is drivel.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

They injected a lot of humor, and it lands. The whole theater was laughing, and all the humor helps making the public go onboard with all the darkness this movie has. I mean, our protagonist is infected with a monster that likes eating heads of living things.Second, similarly to the Alien movies, they do right by not having actual Venom too much time on screen. That way when it is, it's kinda terrifying keeping you on edge.Third, Tom Hardy does Venom and Eddy Brock, and he does this really great. The chemistry between Eddy and Venom is the best part of the whole movie.Final positive notes, CGI, specially Venom, generally looks great. Pacing is really good. The movie is around 2 hours long, and you don't feel the time pass. Actions scenes are pretty good as well. Many people complain about the climatic ending being a CGI-fest, but what the hell were you expecting when you signed up to see a movie about giant alien monsters?Negatives, the rest is pretty mediocre. The story is pretty much there just to get the movie going, and it does that alright. Support characters had almost no development. The villain is pretty generic, although, I was pleasantly surprised to see them take some different directions to the ones they usual take on the generic villain. They could've gone further with this concept like Deadpool did, and I really hope they do in the future.This movie is more funny than many comedies, has decent action, and good looking CGI. Totally recommended.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's got decent characters and jokes that aren't your typical MCU humour but will still make you laugh, but more than anything it's an intro to the Venom-verse and the universe of the symbiotes.Ignore the critics, go watch it and have fun.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

First, the negatives:
Venom was a tonal mess. Inconsistencies throughout. Couldn't tell if it wanted to be dark or funny. The first act was also pretty bad and dragged on for too long. But the worst thing was the script and dialogue. It got very cringey at times and was pretty bad. Venom's voice was also bad. The trailers sounded so much better. The side characters had some duds and weren't great. Riz Ahmed as the villain was passable but forgettable; as was the story. Also, the PG-13 rating hurt it a bit, but not as bad as people thought.
Now, the positives:
The character Venom looks good. His CGI was done well and so was the villain's CGI work. The character of Venom also was taken care of well. He was semi accurate to the comics and actually eats people as seen in the trailer. Tom Hardy performed well, and although his accent didn't work well he portrayed a scared, possessed man pretty well. The relationship between Brock and Venom was also good. The second act was a huge step up from the first as well, once Venom was on screen, the movie got into signs of greatness. 
However, it didn't fully recover. The third act was only okay and the movie overall was pretty mediocre. Definitely worth a rent on something like Redbox, but I wouldn't pay much to see this movie. It had potential to be great, but this PG-13 flick couldn't escape mediocrity.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, upon seeing the movie myself, I was pleasantly surprised!Honestly, as with many similar movies recently, I feel that many viewers tried their hardest to jump on the bandwagon of hate, with some opinions barely saying anything more than the movie just being ""bad"".Anyway, if you're going into this just because you're expecting Spider-Man or Marvel Cinematic Universe connections, you'll be disappointed.But if you're going into this thinking of Venom's portayal by Topher Grace in Spider-Man 3 and hoping they did a better job of the character, then I have no doubt you'll be happy about Venom's portrayal in this one.Seeing Venom being a condescending, witty and creepy character who communicates with Eddie constantly was amazing. Exactly what I wanted.The set-up for potential future characters in a shared universe made me really happy as well. Stay for the mid credits scene!Otherwise, I really hope they continue on with this franchise and improve what viewers complained about so that they do even better next time.With the recent changes and additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I really hope that this Venom franchise gets connected somehow.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It started off promising enough, Tom Hardy as down on his luck journalist Eddie Brock giving a good performance. Once the alien Venom has become part of him, however, is when the film starts to go downhill. In a scene with Brock a silly but failing to be scary voice from nowhere says ""HUNGRY!!"" I'm like ""what the...!?"" From this point on we get Venom with his annoying voice talking with Eddie, much of the time trying to be comical but failing. So Venom and his voice are what I disliked about this film, otherwise there is plenty of action, stunts and special effects. As a simple popcorn movie it ticks the boxes. During the end credits there is a short animated Spiderman sequence, did nothing for me but I'm sure Marvel fans will enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And three hours later (transportation to the film is included in that time estimate) the credits rolled and I felt about the same as when I went in.In short. The movie is a trainwreck. But it's not interesting enough to survive on that merit even. The actors try their damnedest and maybe at some time in history there was a great story here. There are remnants of interesting bits. But no threads are pulled on to get at any meat. Stuff happens and suddenly there's a climactic fight and then it's over.Sony has to do something about their popcorn film division. Sure they once in a while release some David Fincher thing but noone up there seems to have no idea what to do when they have potential. And the Spiderman debacle has been like a dying horse they've been prodding for decades now in hopes of getting something out of. And now they're trying to launch a franchise of Spiderman villains, but by contract they cannot use spiderman?In the end, Sony makes awesome hardware. But whenever I see its logo on a film I flinch... Because clearly there's noone steering that ship. Just a bunch of execs blindly turning the wheel...Some people seem to enjoy the butchered humor present here.

Now while I saw hints of this, the sheer humor and creativity of Venom's and Eddie's ""bromance"" does a lot more than just ""save the day""-- it makes this movie go beyond any other superhero movie (including the formulaic movies we see from MCU) ever made, because it is the first movie actually centered around a supervillain. It is funny, absolutely awe-inspiring, and so terrifyingly violent that even my Mom (who is so critical that she thought Infinity War sucked) actually liked Venom, and to me, that says a lot.So please, do yourself a favor and see this movie before it goes out on DVD because you will be missing out on a historical milestone if you don't.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

And yet, as the release date got closer and closer, I simply lost my interest. After watching the film, I was left wanting more out of the movie. The pacing of this film is far too uneven, especially the end. The ending for this film happens far too quickly and I felt that it was left open without a sense of closure. Granted, there were things I liked in the movie, such as the first on-screen debut of Riot, who plays the part of the film's main antagonist, and there were some fun ideas in the action of this movie, yet I also felt that it wasn't nearly as brutal as it should have been. Venom is a terrifying being who will eat anything that moves with bloody, vicious intent, and this movie does not portray that. A solo Venom movie should be rated R, while this film suffers wirh a PG-13 rating. The performances were solid, yet I saw no chemistry with Eddie Brock and Anne Weying; yet, the chemistry between Eddie and Venom was perfect, creating a feeling of a shaky friendship. All in all, this is a mediocre movie with a mediocre plot, and I would only recommend this film only to those who know little to nothing about this character or the most standard of filmgoers.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It feels like it is constantly holding in to maintain it's PG-13 rating. You can almost pinpoint the moments cuts were made (the plan was to make it R-rated). It causes an unbalanced movie that is struggling to make it to the finish line. The dialogue can also be extremely akward and cliché. Michelle Williams is way to qualified for the role given and at some moments I would swear I felt her trying to keep it cool while babbling nonsense.Nonetheless, I was not always bored. Tom Hardy does the best he can with the given material and has moments where he made me laugh.
I read reviews where it was said that the action scenes where hard to make out, a lá Transformer movies. Where I can't handle the Transformer movies at all, let alone the action scenes, I did not have that feeling with the action scenes in Venom. I found them adequate, nothing more, nothing less.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't believe it deserves the ratings that critics have been giving it and don't understand how they could have not enjoyed it.

Honestly, The scene where tom brady changed into venom is awesome.
It could've benefit more if it's rated R.
I don't care about the corporation and the villains.
He's the most boring villains ever.
I don't find him menacing.
I don't think there's a chemistery between tom hardy and michelle williams (his ex).
This movie could've benefit more if it's rated R, For example, they cut away when he's gonna bite his head off.
In the end, Venom It's not as bad as I heard it was and also it's not as good as we wanted it to be.
Tom Hardy and venom, that dynamic is the best part of the movie (By far!).

If you're expecting anything but a romping, chomping and relentless comic book to movie about one of the more outlandish creations from an era where Marvel comics still played it safe then this might not be your cup of tea as it's unabashedly chaotic, funny, dark, weird and absolutely a popcorn action flick to just indulge that action, action, action, stunts, stunts, stunts itch with no pretence of being anything more than what Venom is. As a Brit, I do tend to lean toward UK productions such as Dredd and this movie eschews much of the MCU formula and just blasts you full force from the opening until the close with a UK production crew and Tom Hardy delivering a Riot Carnage of a new origin story that had me grinning like an idiot as that's the Venom I imagined as a young British lad.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

While Venom was not as epic in scale and delivery as those in the same genre that have come before it, it was a fast-paced, visually intensive, funny, and ultimately entertaining two hours of story-telling. Eddie Brock was very human (and ultimately - as this is first and foremost an origin story - very alien) character with plenty of heart to overshadow his faults. Venom's strength lies in the fact that Eddie Brock's interactions with his lady-faire, the various people in his life, and his titular parasitic companion are interesting even without the obligatory bad-guy to fight. Some CGI in the film could have been stronger, but when it works, it works brilliantly; and while there is comic-book predictability to the plot, the story is enjoyable enough that the shortcomings are only a slight distraction to a movie which is ultimately worth a second (or third) watch.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

As a huge fan of Venom in the comics this was a great throwback to his hay day in the 90's. Venom is a deep, charismatic, quirky, off-kilter character that really deserved more than a cameo to explore why he is so beloved as a comic book anti-hero and this movie really pulled it off. Tom Hardy did a GREAT job playing all of the dynamic facets of Eddie Brock's character and this carries over into the symbiote himself. Venom is cruel, hungry, ruthless, and vulnerable, all at the same time. Many will assume that Venom is supposed to be a heartless villain bent on destruction but the reality is that he is a dynamic character that has many different motivations much like many of us. The action was great and the action was just as deserving. I would go see it again for the great performance by Tom Hardy and the accurate portrayal of the historic anti-hero.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

For the main reason, they were clearly perceived to be representing.
It seems that the whole concern of the director was on the screen a new figure, a new being from the other world unlike any other.
And it hit that goal, but the story that counts sucks, (was it a low-cost production?)
First, a journalist (Tom Hardy) who apparently had his name among the many good, who suddenly deceives the bride, showing an eguismo and egocentrismo, which disgusts. Is it an egocentric human that we want to be the new hero?
Second, a scientist (Jenny Slate) who puts a journalist who is willing to destroy that company, and tells him to go in and not mess about anything?
Third, the Owner and the company (Riz Ahmed)? Why Rix Ahmed? he has no physiognomy to play the part of a person without pity, a hard, unconscious and authoritarian person. It's a bad choice.
I loved the trails, but as often happens, the trailers show everything that the film has of fantastic, a county that has not seen the movie, to see only the trailres, because they promise a lot and there is nothing more.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The action scenes left me feeling like it was straight out of a power rangers episode on Fox. How do you mess up a car chase in San Francisco? It's made for car chase scenes.

In what was initially a planned piece about the opposite of positive hype for a film - in which there would be discussion on how negative reviews had set up for a hilariously bad film that in reality didn't deliver - soon had to be scrapped the moment Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock comes into real contact with the titular Venom.The criticisms you may have heard are all correct. It feels like a superhero movie from 15 years ago. The effects - especially the symbiote sans human host - look goddamn 90s garbage. Tom Hardy once again showcases how tone-imperfect he is with a performance all over the shop.What you might have also seen however is also true: The film is fun. In all the ways it doesn't intend to be. Venom is so hilarious and so unintentionally brilliant that it's hard to despise. While a good first third of the film is full of boring setup, once we get to the meat of the film (if you can even call it that) you find it's just...stupid entertainment.Let it be known that Venom still isn't good, by any degree. It's a sin on the eyes and everything makes you wonder what the hell is going on. Whenever Venom and Eddie interact, however, is gold. It made myself go ""What *IS* this movie?!"" every. Single. Time. It made me want a buddy cop movie between the two. It made me want a romcom where Venom tries to help Eddie get back the girl. It made me want Venom being rehabilitated to the world of humans for an entire feature runtime.Basically, it made me want any movie other than this.There's something about a good bad film. Venom could have easily been another Suicide Squad. It could have easily been bland and forgettable like Fan4stic and...some other movie...But maybe Venom just knew the trainwreck it was becoming and leaned hard into that. I highly doubt there's a good cut or a serious cut out there (#releasethehardycut) but the 2/3 of the film that's hammy, hot trash has Hardy piloting a film right into the sun and I am there for it.Maybe Ruben Fleisher also thought this. Where he could have gone forgettable once again like Gangster Squad or 30 Minutes or Less again, he instead went Zombieland. It's still gonna be forgettable, but goddamn I can't say I had a bad time at the movies.Venom is a product of a different time with a different aptitude. It's recommended on pure funny hate watching alone, because you're not gonna get anything else.But did you expect anything good in the first place?Still, it's worth the trip because it's the best comedy out in weeks.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I haven't watched very many Tom Hardy films and I don't know if he just sucks at playing an American but his acting here was terrible. Half the movie he walked, talked and acted like a five year old. It was awkward at times to watch. This Riz kid (emphasis on kid) acted well but how formidable can you really be when you look like a teeny bop? That also needed a switch. An actor too old cast as the hero and an actor too young cast as the villain. I can think of Jake Gylennhal being better for Venom and it's odd he hasn't done a Marvel movie yet. If we had to have Tom Hardy he needed to drop about ten pounds or so (sorry this is just business not ""fat shaming""-eye roll-obviously he's not fat but a more athletic build would tighten up those fight scenes). Moving on, story wise his girl was made out to be pretty unlikable pretty quickly. She was gonna marry this man and six months later she's got another dude? Her and doc should've just been friends. Venom too quickly decides he likes earth telling Eddie he convinced him. When? How? Did we miss a scene? I think so. The end fight was a bit too rushed and predictable. I give this film props because it was entertaining, Venom had some funny one liners (the ones you could understand with that voice) and he was a likable antihero.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, my love for Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed made me go watch this film, and I'm so glad I did. It was fast paced with an interesting plot and good direction. A worthy introduction to the scary but cute antihero, Venom. The action sequences and CGI were terrific, especially the last fight scene. The jokes were on point as everyone at the cinema laughed on cue.The acting was great! Tom Hardy played the role of righteous Eddie Brock brilliantly, where one would love him most of the times and at the same time feel frustrated at some of the choices he made. Him and Venom made the perfect yin-yang. Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake created the right menacing auro his character required, despite being a slim, harmless looking guy, he still managed to play the powerful villain role excellently.Michelle, as lawyer and Eddie's ex-fiance, and Reid, as her new doctor boyfriend, supporting Eddie were sweet to watch. Last I saw Jenny was in Parks and Rec so it was nice to see her doing a completely different role. Scott as Carlton's hitman, Wayne, Peggy and other cast were all good in the role they were given to play. Over all, the movie was not ground breaking 
by any chance and had a couple of flaws, but it was a fun fun ride, definitely worth the ticket and time. There's a credit scene guys, so don't leave!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Lots of flaws, cliches and inconsistencies, predictable as well, if it wasn't for Hardy the movie would have been bad. Some super-hero movie received way more criticism than they deserved, but this one deserves criticism. Yes, most people might find it somehow entertaining, but that's what Marvel is all about. Unfortunately for me I have seen lots of super-hero/comic-book movies and this one I wouldn't put in the good half. It's just nothing to like, except Hardy (but that's definitely not his best role, far from it) and a few jokes. It's meant for 14-16 years olds in my opinion. Sorry if I'm hard on the movie, but let's not fool ourselves, it's just an okay movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I ignored VENOM at the cinemas and watched it instead on DVD with my mouth agape at how annoyingly puerile the film is. Then again, I'm past the age of bed wetting and know how to read so I'm obviously not the target audience.One element of the film I found interesting was its strong socialist message that pits the plight of America's poor, homeless and marginalised against the amoral excesses and indulgences of the rich who quite literally make their money by exploiting the poor and desperate. It's a fascinating subplot although of course its a message lost on its kiddie audience who want big bang smash boobs.Elements of VENOM reminded me of the reviled and largely forgotten 1997 anti-superhero film SPAWN, although primitive CG aside, that film, which of course is terribly flawed, is still significantly better.The least annoying parts of the film are undoubtedly between Williams and Hardy, but not even Williams could save the lifeless two-dimensionality of the screenplay. Williams is the more nuanced actor of the two leads, while Hardy has always gravitated towards grotesque, excessive roles that lack subtlety. Then again, subtlety and nuance is something that contemporary juvenile American audiences (a tautology if ever there was one) simply cannot abide.The true standout in the film was Riz Ahmed who played his villain very straight and never ventured into histrionics or excess. His performance was so chillingly pedestrian that when he becomes Riot the character loses all sense of threat to a silly Decepticon wannabe. I guess his underplayed performance fell off the radar for a lot of folks but its the emotionlessness and lack of empathy that made him a true villain, revealing what it takes to make it big in America.I was gobsmacked to read the claim from many reviewers that the film is not formulaic, because VENOM is absolutely color-by-numbers filmmaking that feels like it belongs in a Michael Bay movie pack. You could pretty much set your watch to the inciting incident and all those other formulaic screenplay structures that have reduced commercial filmmaking to telling lifeless repetitive stories. Indeed, the film is so horribly Michael Bay that the dialogue between Eddie Brock and Venom is uncannily like something I'd see in a TRANSFORMERS movie. ""What's wrong with that?"" I hear all the four-year-olds scream. I rest my case.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, due to an awkward script, confused identity, and bland execution, the film disappointingly fails in every way. Despite the amazing cast this film has, the material they are given never fully plays to their potential as actors. The only redeeming element of this was the lead, Tom Hardy, who tries his best to make up for a lackluster script, but ultimately comes off as trying too hard. With how far visual effects have come in the filmmaking industry, the effects in this film feel cheap and lazy, taking away from potentially interesting action scenes and the seriousness of the characters. The script is beyond a mess, with dialogue that is written awkwardly with forced comedy and a story that has been done many times in the past. It made the overall experience cringe-inducing and legitimately hard to get through. Because the film is trying to replicate the style of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the tone feels inconsistent, with a mixture of generically forced elements, mixed with the style of a director doing his best to maintain cinematic integrity, making for a confusing clash of ideas. Overall, this film could have been amazing if not for the clear studio meddling behind the scenes and the use of a story that was representative of the serious and dramatic nature of the comics. However, because of the film's execution, the product results in an excruciatingly hard movie to get through and one that should be avoided.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Extremely predictable throughout, I was not impressed by this mess of a film.Personally I find Tom Hardy to be quite a decent actor with my favourite portrayal of him being his performance in 2015's Mad Max Fury Road. In Venom he plays our main character Eddie Brock, quite an amiable everyday man, who works as a news presenter in his own personal feature. I believe his version of the beloved comic book character was relatively well-done compared to other depictions of recent years (Spider Man 3 as an example). However he could only carry this character so far because of the abhorrent script which in my opinion was the clear-cut worst part of this film. After the rise of the Marvel Universe movies every superhero film has felt the need to adopt their constant quippy humour, which can be used quite effectively when it's fits the correct tone, but this was executed very poorly in Venom's case. You'll have a seemingly serious scene setting a darker tone and then instantly switch back to Tom Hardy popping off one-liners completely destroying the aura the film hoped to create.I found our villain of Venom to be quite weak because of the little development he got throughout the picture and as many have already mentioned I believe that most of the films problems could be solved with a slightly longer runtime, more fleshed out script and stronger villain. I'm hoping to write another review of this film when I get to see it again but for now these are my initial impressions.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm not a particular huge fan of Marvel, even though I watch them all, but I like those kind of movies because it's easy entertainment. Venom might not be a superhero but it's for sure entertaining to watch. Not as funny as Deadpool, but funnier than all the other superhero movies. Tom Hardy has the right character face to play this role. But the most positive point about Venom must be the special effects and CGI's. Those were on top and made this a proper action movie that you will enjoy from the beginning till the end. So just forget about those negative reviews, they just don't have a clue how an enjoyable Marvel movie should be.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

After suicide squads deception, I was very exited for a good antihero movie. However, still this wish has not been fulfilled. Venoms plot was so see-through that I knew exactly what was going to happen in the first 5 minutes. We get introduced to some problems in tom hardy's life. He gets infected, deals with some easy problems before facing the big villain, and after being the underdog, miraculously wins with the help of his pals. This is exactly why Infinity War stands apart from all these other movies. There is an intersteng character development, twists in the plot and an villain with an actual purpose. I mean, I kinda get the idea of Venoms villain (what was his name?) motive, as they want to live on the bodies of earth and thrive here (after writing this im not sure I actually do though...). But really, what is Venoms motive for saving the world. His explanation is that he likes tom hardy and started to like earth? But why? What underlying reason is there, what carter development supports this?Then there are the many inconsistencies in the film. Venom first states that he knows everything tom hardy does, but at one event has to ask Tom Hardy crucial plot details as a way to tell the audience. Then there is the issue of the villain travelling to SF for what exact reason? because he knows there is a spaceship? Which they don't have in India or other closer countries? Or the fact that Venom knows that Tom hardy should not open the door in the first venom scene, however lacks all these spider-senses in the next when he crashes in to a car during the mandatory action movie car chase. Well, I could go on and on, but you get the point.I'd like to finish by discussing the quality of acting. Although the movie does not allow for any character development, I do think we should give Tom Hardy some credit for portraying a flat and shallow character in a decent manner. However, especially his costar and ex lover was an atrocity to watch. All the lines, however badly written, were delivered without any emotion and with the sole intention to get a laugh from the audience. She actually seems like the real villain in this movie. Lets quickly analyse: She leaves TH without having evidence of him breaking in to her computer. All the while she was informed about the Life corp's wrongdoings and didn't do anything about it. She dates a nice surgeon (golddigger much?) who actually is respectful towards TH and even helps him. Then she goes and cheats on him again with TH and waves it off in a joking manner.. Want to wake up next too crazy?Final recommendation: Watch this to be able to critically judge other movies and see all the cliches to avoid in a summery of 2 hours.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've seen when it's come into its footing, and I've also seen when it was struggling trying to find what can make the genre special. As the 2010s have brought some of the stronger and genre pushing films, Venom on the other hand brings forth the mediocrity I wish we abandoned in 2002.The film focuses on Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) as a hard boiled journalist who has reason to believe the Life Foundation is running illegal tests on humans with a alien being known as a ""symbiote"". After sneaking into the labs, one of the symbiote's attaches itself to Eddie and we realize that alien being is....Venom.The easiest thing to talk about is the first 40 minutes of the movie that every one agrees is the worst part of the movie and they are absolutely right. For a film that focuses on a head chewing alien, it spends entirely too long setting up the world around it in the most boring and uninteresting way possible. The movie forces you to care about Eddie and his ex-fiance, but there is NO chemistry between them whatsoever.Even when Venom attaches itself to Eddie, not only does it feel too little too late, it also is never as interesting as it should be. We never get to see Venom until almost an hour into this 110 minute movie and none of the action was worth the wait. The action is shoddily and dimly shot which is shocking given this was by a cinematographer I tend to like Matthew Libatique. It gets even worse when it gets into the finale which is a splash of CGI blobs being smashed together.There are many people who enjoyed Venom, and personally I'm not one of them. I never found Venom as an interesting anti-hero, but instead just a thing that exists for franchise money. The film obviously is missing 20 minutes of solid character development and the end credits sequence doesn't excite me for a sequel at all. It's not the worst movie I've seen this year, but its one that frustrates me given how far superhero movies have come for films like this to exist.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie felt rushed. Weak character development and story. Thankfully we won't be seeing anything more as the movie not only bombed at the theaters but afterwards as well.
One thing could have saved this movie and it wasn't there. All they had to do is go with the story of Eddie Brock in love with J. Jonah Jamison's daughter and had J. K. Simmons reprise his role. But they dropped the ball on that and made up a whole new story for Brock that just didn't resonate with Spider-Man fans. Please don't try again.

Darker than the Dark Knight, hilarious split personality schizophrenic discussions between Brock and Venom, excellent action scenes, light on the romantic elements, and a true anti-hero in Venom. Limited number of characters and ample character development as a result. A movie! Not a cartoon portraying itself as a movie. The ending was tantalizing too. Hope the sequel is as good as this.

"5","/10","Dysfunctional Frenetic Tone Diminishes Likeability","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4386942/?ref_=tt_urv","kgprophet","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1158617/?ref_=tt_urv","9 October 2018","One thing that became clear in reviews I read was that this film was disjointed, lacking a consistent tone. Nevertheless I went to see Venom because I like the other films Tom Hardy has been in. Unfortunately, the frenetic feel of the film for the most part is due to Hardy's performance. His behaviour is jerky, impulsive. I think if the tone of his character was more pensive, showing a bit more of a sound mind, he would be more relatable. I suppose when someone is on the skids it is hard to look and act stable. My feeling in general about the story was that it was trying to juggle too many balls at once. Ball One: Breaking up with his fiance. Ball Two: Being fired because of a controversial CEO. Ball Three: Dealing with another entity living in his body. Ball Four: Following a lead on a big story involving that vindictive CEO. Ball Five: Dealing with attempts at treatment with Ex-Girlfriend's new doctor boyfriend. Ball Six: Trying to find a new job. There is also the tired Marvel template of some over-the-top villain who always wants to take over the world. Must they always be trying to take over the world? How about just cornering the market on some new miracle drug (with nasty side effects)? Also present in every Marvel film are action set pieces, usually timed to go off every ten minutes or so. You get a mixed bag of the quality of the effects. The were moments, such as when a person was flung through the air, that didn't feel right. The effect of gravity during some CGI shots don't feel quite right. Saying that, SFO is always a fun playground for big action scenes, and this movie does fine with that. Riz Ahmed plays the big bad CEO, something that now has become generic in superhero movies (Zuckerberg in Batman vs. Superman for example). He partakes in illegal activity, and enjoys immunity from prosecution because of his power of being rich. I found nothing either outstanding or lacking in his one note performance. I blame the script more than him. For the most part the film tries to take a serious tone, however the entity living in Hardy's body is presented with humor. This is one of the more fatal errors of the film. With a dysfunctional tone to begin with, adding humor works against all the serious stuff. There is a scene that feels like it is out a kid's disney film, where Hardy is forced to misbehave in a fancy restaurant. Playing for slapstick humor in this sophisticated script does not work. With that being said, this movie certainly could have been worse. I would say it is about par for the Sony superhero outings. They deliver the goods to a certain degree, but lack the correct tone that Marvel has perfected. Their attempts at Fantastic Four are a good example. I don't regret seeing this in the theater. Timing of the release is one key factor. The post summer 2018 release schedule has been lacking any good action films.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ok, so by now you probably know I'm not a big fan of superhero movies, and especially American superhero films. I must admit, this one had a lot more depth and Tom Hardy was really good as the protagonist. He goes through an unfortunate break-up due to circumstances, and then attempts to rekindle his relationship, but to no avail. So I really rooted for and felt sorry for the guy. I suppose one could refer to him as a loser. And this plays a pivotal role later in the film, so the setup was very well done.The make-up and visuals are incredible, but unfortunately the film becomes so CGI-heavy that all the depth is blown right out the window. It becomes nothing more than a typical Hollywood CGI superhero fare that doesn't feel fresh and new. Instead, it feels like a rehash of a plot we've seen so many times before, with a predictable ending. The film also felt a lot like a more extreme version of 'Upgrade' starring Logan Marshall-Green.Although it was by now means a bad film, it wasn't that great or special either, and chances of me giving it a second viewing is very slim.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

As I sat in the theater and looked at my ticket, I soon realized two things: it was rated PG, and it was going to suck.
I experienced a spark of hope early on: when Eddie Brock is first infected and changing you almost experience the same kind of horror and revulsion you get from watching Jeff Goldblum's transformation in The Fly, but sadly it doesn't last as he and Venom very soon become straight up buddies.
On three separate occasions, Venom bites off someone's head, and each time the audience was meant to laugh, not scream, because that's how the scene was crafted.
The longer the movie went the less gravitas Venom gave off, until, towards the end, the villain role is filled by some under-developed character, leaving Venom playing the role of the hero for some stupid reason.
The whole thing falls flat on its face and I very nearly left the theater before the end because I just didn't care.4/10 Stars. Should/could have been rated R.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It does feel very much what superhero films were like 15 years ago, before Marvel took control of their own destiny and began to make films of different genres, with their characters in them, rather than believing that ""Superhero"" is a genre itself. This is a regression to a time when a bit of CGI and a superhero name was enough to get people to go. It's not that world anymore and ""Venom"" comes up sadly lacking. To sum up the plot, whilst investigating the shady science of tech Billionaire Carlton Blake (Riz Ahmed) journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is exposed to an Alien Symbiote named Venom. The two eventually form an uneasy alliance as Brock tries to take down Blake and Venom hunts for Riot, a fellow Symbiote who wishes to bring about the end of humanity. I want to split my criticism in two now. Some for the character of Venom and some for the film itself. I'll start with the film. With any character as the protagonist of it, this film would be a bit of a mess. It takes a long time to get going, it ends with an anticlimactical incoherent CGI battle that looks awful, but worst of all, is inconsistent across its running time about its own rules. Sometimes, bonding with an alien creates a zombie like status in the human, with the symbiote in full control, sometimes the connection results in a sickness for the human (though it is explained that the alien essentially eats the host from the inside, if they aren't fed) but sometimes, it creates a perfect symbiotic relationship immediately, where the human gains extraordinary powers and they share the same goals - fortunately for the dull plot, this is the case for all three of our leads. One thing that some people may like is that the film is a story in itself, there are no links to any pre-existing universes and very few Easter Eggs beyond nods to the creators. Personally, I like those little insider nods and the film felt worse for it. The CGI is bad, the music is worse and the practical stunts are underwhelming. The portrayal of Venom himself is an odd one. Giving them an internal (and sometimes external) monologue was a way to go - and sometimes it's funny, is it always trying to be?. . I'm not sure, but there are laughs to be had there. Hardy is very game to make himself look foolish, and the voice he provides for Venom is interesting. However, I don't really buy into why Venom suddenly decides to side with the humans against the other symbiotes, surely not one brief moment considering the beauty of and Earth city wasn't it? If it's the influence of Eddie Brock's humanity, why doesn't that work in the other combinations? Eventually, just as the film was ending, the ""pairing"" began it hit their rhythm, so much so that if they made another ""Venom"" film that could fix the problems I detailed in the previous paragraph, I'd be willing to see it. I wasn't disappointed, as the critical response prior to seeing it had dulled my anticipation but I'd genuinely struggle to recommend the movie to anyone, fan or otherwise of the character.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And don't think that anything good happens in that 1 hours, oh no, not even a shred of characterization.Action scenes are decent and Venom's design is cool and all, but that's the only thing I can say about this movie, there's no substance or a good plot here, and the writing is abhorrent.The villain is most generic thing you can imagine with the worst and most laughable dialogue ever.This movie could've been a great antihero movie with some gore and violence but Eddy and Venom just joke and fool around.This had the potential to be a breath of fresh air in the midst of all these Marvel and DC movies with good guys as protagonists who always joke and are light-hearted, and become something like Deadpool 2016, or what The Punisher was. But no! You HAVE TO make your protagonist a ""good guy"" even though he has a hungry man-eating symbiote inside him. You have to make him a ""fun"" character by making him joke with Venom all the time, because that's what makes the kids buy our toys apparently, because god forbid if we made our protagonist an anti-hero for once and not cringeworthingly copying Spider-Man.What's the difference between this movie's Venom and Spider-Man again? Ah yeah, that's right, he occasionally eats heads of people off-screen.Venom also says that he knows everything Eddy knows cuz he's in his head and body, which makes sense, but literally asks who Anny is the next scene. What?Character motivations are really confusing and dumb, Venom tells Eddy to get ready for his world to be dominated by symbiotes and then in the next scene he has a change of heart and is a good little symbiote boi just like that, and he says that Eddy changed him. Can someone tell what exactly Eddy did that made Venom not want to eat people anymore and become a good guy all of a sudden? Yeah, you can't.Even at the end of the movie I didn't care about any of the characters as the characterization and character development is abysmal in this movie.It's been for how long these companies have been making movies? And they still don't care about hiring good writers? You're paying 100 million for the movie and not for once it occurs to you that maybe it's not a bad idea to invest in good writing instead of just CGI monsters fighting each other?","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Pathetic and weak villain.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7018259/?ref_=tt_urv","Stenian","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9960377/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2021","I know what you'll say, ""but this is an origins movie and so you'll get to see more of Eddie"". Well, yeah, but the film focused on Eddie Brock's life way too much in the first hour. They might have well should have shown him pooping in his toilet (they probably did). I really didn't care much about him in all honesty, and much of the scenes of him at the beginning which dragged. Even Tom Hardy, who is a good actor, didn't really rivet me to his character.I mean, Eddie Brock was never a famous or popular comic book character anyway. He is no Joker, Peter Parker, The Riddler or Bruce Wayne for that matter. Why would we need to sit down and watch Brock for like 50 minutes? I'm pretty sure most people came to watch this film to see Venom. And the film should have gotten on with it as quick as possible. But it just went on and on with Eddie Brock's apartment life.And that pathetic villain, Carleton Drake. Not sure if it was the character or the guy portraying him. But I think it was a mix of the two. He was so unlikable and ""uncool"" for a villain. A try-hard, typical and cliched villain at best.As soon as Venom appears and becomes more prominent, the film starts to get entertaining. I enjoyed Eddie's chemistry with his ex girlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams). I enjoyed her performance as well. Let's hope the sequel will be much better and, I believe, we would probably get to see more Venom.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

That is where the good aspects of this movie end for me.Sony had been trying to get a Venom movie made ever since the aforementioned Spider-Man 3. Though I'm a fan of the Venom character, I never particularly felt that he needed his own solo movie but still I remained cautiously optimistic about it. My expectations for Venom weren't particularly high to begin with but somehow it still managed to disappoint me.The first major issue with Venom as a story is the lack of Peter Parker. A big part of both Eddie Brock and Venom's characters is their relationship with Peter Parker/Spider-Man, in fact he is the very reason that the Venom character we know even exists. Take away Spider-Man and you take away a big part of Venom's character and the story that makes him so interesting as an antihero.Since Spider-Man is not in this story, Eddie Brock instead is turned into a generic hero type who lacks the complexity of his comic counterpart. Throughout the movie he reluctantly helps the Venom symbiote whose motivations and loyalty are ambiguous and unclear.The actors give okay performances but feel like they aren't giving it their all. Supposedly Tom Hardy only agreed to be Venom because his son likes the character and it shows.The attempts at humour are cringe inducing and often fall flat. It feels like they were trying to imitate the MCU's style of humour but it honestly feels more like the kind of humour you'd find in a Michael Bay Transformers movie.The villain is forgettable and ultimately just ends up being a silver version of Venom. The CGI in the big fight between the two characters also doesn't look very good.Overall I'm not really sure what everyone sees in Venom that makes it such a masterpiece, they must have been watching a completely different film. Despite my dislike of this Venom movie, I hope they will manage to fix some of these issues in the sequel and perhaps then we can get a worthy big screen adaptation of this character.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

What it isn't is fantastic however.-buildup. The intro of the movie was fine. Nothing spectacular but certainly progressed the story into the right direction. Though it did linger on for a tad bit too long.-The plot while amusing, is definitely lacking and drops the ball at least at a certain point, which i cant really dive into here due to spoilers. This certainly is the biggest problem with the movie. -CGI. Not great but certainly far from bad! -Venom. The symbiote is awesome and i loved the bonding with Tom Hardy's character which truly moved the movie forward. Definitely the strongest point within the movie and was eager for more!-Overall. Ignore the damn paid critics. They are a dying breed and should've been put out of their misery years ago. This movie is entertaining.

The effects are 100% on brand for the loveable annoyance that is Venom. Tom Hardy is wonderful and in a sea of superhero movies Venom is almost like a Judge Dredd lower budget character driven film mixed with Guardians style humour. Definitely a worthwhile sofa watch but I confess I am already sure I will go to see Venom 2 in the theatre.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I believed the poor reviews and actively looked for the odd scenes that would result in unexpected laughter. I really thought it would be a a bad movie! I'm thrilled to say the critics were dead wrong and I not only liked the movie, I laughed at the right time and got to know this complex hero. I gave 9 stars because the chemistry between Tom Hardy and his co-star didn't work imho, but overall Venom is very watchable and I enjoyed it from start to finish.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's not well-written, it's not technically well-made, and it is stupid! However, I actually enjoyed it a little. Most of this movie I found to be slow and kinda dull. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, I started having fun. This movie is at its best when it is being crazy and over-the-top! However, there isn't a lot of that in the movie. That only really happens in the middle of the movie. It takes a long time to get going, it goes for a little bit, and then it just kinda ends abruptly before it even really begins. It's very poorly paced, probably because of the re-edits. I thought there must've been more to this movie, I was only 90 minutes into what's supposed to be a 110-minute movie, but nope! That was it! There are, no joke, 20 minutes of credits! That's including two post-credits scenes, but you can just turn the movie off after the first one. The second is just a clip from Into the Spider-verse, nothing special. I heard there were about 40 minutes of footage cut from the final film, and yeah. It shows. Overall, this movie is a hot mess. If you're in the mood for garbage, give it a watch. It's like one of those less-than-wonderful 70s and 80s B horror movies. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this. If you want an actually good movie with a similar premise, however, watch Upgrade instead.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can imagine them saying, lets expose everyone to enormous amounts of violence, in glorious colour, backed by music and sound effects, all in the name of good conquering evil.Then we can create all the wars we want, steal all the resources we need and paint other evolved cultures and religions as evil.Hum..........This violent boring vapid movie contains great acting from Tom Hardy but it is the relentless body count and violence that lets the movie down.Once upon a time, Heroes stood up for the weak, the poor, the undefended, they had a message to convey to the world.

It's just so good.It's basically about a guy called Eddie Brock (hardy) a reporter of the kind that outs wrong doing and he stumbles into a company run by a Carlton Drake played by Roz Ahmed and he has managed to acquire an alien being of sorts in the shape of a black gooey entity from outer space.Eddie somehow gets access to the laboratory and somehow this is where he consumes but not through choice Venom. The fun begins and by fun I mean it's hilarious. Venom and Eddie have this funny dialogue between them and it's just so funny.It's action packed, adventurous, funny, filled with effects and gripping as Eddie with the help of Venom sets about stopping Carlton Brock from creating the ultimate weapon.With a budget of $100,000,000 You kinda see why when you watch this hilarious and at the same time action packed sci-fi for yourself...well worth the 10/10 I gave it","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

While fans of the comics might not like some of the changes that have been made, I find it hard to believe that it's enough to ruin the experience. The CGI isn't perfect (especially noticeable when Eddie and Venom have their first face-to-face conversation) and some other small factors take away from the believability (if it can be called that) but the film is still THOROUGHLY entertaining and a huge upgrade from Venom's appearance in Spider-Man 3. Tom Hardy obviously takes the cake with his portrayal as Eddie Brock but all of the other actors did amazing, believable jobs as well. The only thing I'm really clinging onto is how short the film seemed to be (even though it's not short at all) purely because I was enjoying every second of it. Cannot wait until the sequel.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Venom does make up for it. Sony trying to create their own universe with their own superhero films. The movie is awesome with Tom Hardy taking the role and the action sequences are top notch exciting. It does suffer from a boring villain and a thin plot but it could have been a whole lot worse. The plot follows a space probe crashing down on earth with a corporation Life foundations trying to reclaim four symbiotic lifeforms. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) is leading Life foundations and only discovered three symbiotic contained while one is missing. Meanwhile, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is a journalist reporter talking about current issues about our todays problems. His fiancée Anne (Michelle Williams) is an employee of Life foundations and he decides to use her intel to interview Drake about people being test subjects for his experiments. When the interview goes bad with Brock losing his job, relationship, and his life's work. An insider decides to help Brock get inside Life foundation to gather evidence of Drake's evil experiments with people. Brock gets infected from a symbiotic known as Venom. With Drake and his paramilitary after Brock. Brock soon learns to cooperate with his alter ego of Venom to fight the bad guys.The film's plot was pretty thin. The first act is a bit slow with Brock living poorly after he lost everything. And Drake becoming a mad scientist with experimenting using symbiotes on people. Trying to find a perfect host for the symbiotes. Until, Brock becomes Venom than the rest of the movie is Drake having his men chase him down. And the villain's plan on sending another space probe into space. Riz Ahmed was not as intriguing as the villain Carlton Drake. He plays like a mad scientist that is obsessed with trying to find the perfect human being that can host a symbiote. Venom does face off against another symbiote known as Riot which was cool. Especially, during the chaotic fight in the climax. Tom Hardy is great as Eddie Brock/Venom and he also voices Venom. It is pretty cool to see Eddie battling with himself as Venom's voice bickers at him. That is were the fun begins in the movie. When Eddie notices his appetite has increased. And he thinks he is going insane with the voice in his head. He is running around the street and restaurant with his maniac behavior. When the bad guys show up and Venom takes over to fight them off. It is pretty cool. There is also thrilling motorcycle chase. And Venom battling through a SWAT team. And the climax battle with Riot. Michelle Williams was good as Anne, Brock's ex's love interest. The visual effects were great with Venom. The motorcycle chase scene may have some cheesy effects but it's almost unnoticeable. Overall, Venom is a good superhero film. The action sequences are awesome. It is nice to see Venom fighting bad guys/ even some gritty scene were he bites their heads off. Seeing Eddie and Venom talk their differences is fun. Tom Hardy is great as the character. The plot may be thin and have a boring villain like Carlton Drake. Still makes an entertaining superhero movie.There is also a mid credit scene that foreshadows for a sequel villain. And a post credit scene which sony is marketing their other animated superhero film which I do not think it is important to the Venom universe.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Rarely has a conventional Hollywood hack job been more copy paste. And rarely has modern CGI looked less inspired and impressive. The film's most boring parts are remarkably not those that are most marred by the aforementioned characterisation, but rather the pre-programmed action-sequences. And the director is just as much out of his depth with the actors as he is with the action. Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed are equally unimpressive.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I mean it's not a Batman and Robin kinda bad but it is just a passable unnecessary film.I heard a lot of people were saying this film isn't as bad as critics said it is but I ended up agreeing with what the critics said.I didn't find any redeeming quality in it. This film wastes too much time to establish what it needs to. They spend nearly an hour going over stuff that could have been over with in the opening fifteen to twenty minutes.There's too much of Eddie Brock and too less of Venom. I found Eddie Brock to be a very one dimensional paper thin protagonist. Tom Hardy was just OKAY in terms of acting. I don't know why people are praising him so much.Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed are totally miscast in their roles. Not only that, their characters are very one dimensional too. All characters in this film are one dimensional except for the Venom symbiote itself which was intriguing and had a few funny lines.There are lot of unnecessary cringe-y attempts at comedy in this film. The only time it was kinda working was when Eddie and Venom had a conversation. The comedic tone clashed with the supposed dark tone of the film. Tonally, this was a mess. What is this film trying to be? A nicolas cage style comedy? A dark and gritty monster film?. It just ended up being a generic #1000 blockbuster action film you'd usually see The Rock in minus Rock's charisma.A generic story is no problem if you can find new ways of telling your story. Venom follows the same pattern you'd see in any origin story except it takes too long before anything interesting happens and when something remotely interesting occurs, you realize the film is about to endThe action scenes felt incoherent and hard to follow at times. And if you have seen the clips and the trailers, you have seen pretty much all the decent sequences.By the time I got near the end, I realized at least there's at least a CGI filled finale which is always cool to see but who gives the damn when the rest of the film does a piss poor job of building up to it. And the ending was very quick and abrupt.This was a very unnecessary quick cash grab by Sony. Venom is a cool bad ass character and his dynamic with Eddie is interesting but Eddie himself is very dull.It sets up a sequel and I kinda want to see the sequel instead of this film. I honestly think they should have avoided doing an origin story when it's this simple. We didn't need this film. It was totally unnecessary and forgettable. They should have followed whatever they are gonna do in the sequel for part one instead of making this film.If you were looking forward to this film, maybe you should see it instead of letting my review ruin your anticipation but this is my opinion on the film. But I don't think this film is worth your money. You deserve better. I don't know what people saw in this film that made some people say ""It is really good"" but if you liked it, good for you.Suicide Squad had some redeeming quality and BvS was quite good compared to this. Most mediocre films like Kong Skull Island etc etc do. This film? there's barely any redeeming quality about it.Final Rating: 4.4","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I really don't like superhero/vilains movies, but I had to watch this one because of Tom Hardy.Well, I guess a good actor is not enough to make a good movie.The buildup is really nice, we can see that the hero is kind of a coward, which is surprising for Tom Hardy. We learn about him and his character in a very simple, efficient way. I especially like the editing sequence showing his reporter skills.Anyway, he eventually gets in contact with the Venom, this alien thing with confusing intentions, and then the movie goes beyond ridiculous.First, characters take insane risks when the Venom clearly proved his dangerosity (talking chill in front of the clever Venom, just separeted by a glass window...)
But the character of Tom Hardy just vanishes when he gets the Venom.
It's just too powerful. It stops bullets, it fights everyone around him (yes, also behind him) so he is just a supermachine which will get whatever he wants. You can't make a story with a hero that facerolls on everything. He just has no challenges anymore. The fighting sequences are just plain and dumb.After a while, he has a discussion with the Venom, which explains his alien origins, and that he's been chosen (but why ? ) and the movie just doesn't make sense. I didn't read the comics, and I don't want to. It's ridiculous that the movie didn't make the job of being self-sufficient.Plus, the hero doesn't even control the Venom in any way (even if he makes some deal at the end), so as I said, the hero and his intentions are not relevant anymore, the scenario is gone, and you should be too.That being said, I love the visuals of the Venom parasite when it's free, it really has a special, fascinating texture. For same reasons, the combat between two Venoms in slow-motions contains an outstanding visual sequence, merging together but also tearing up, very special stuff.
But I don't buy Venom aspect on characters. It looks childish and laughable.I don't recommend. Visuals are not enough. The story is just weak.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yes, it's a Marvel movie so there's talks of politics/religion but it seems a little un-fit since it's never good to go ""that deep"", especially with this movie being more fun than it is dark. There should be a balance.The cut for PG-13 is also a bummer since it looked like there was supposed to be blood in the film and in the good moments that would feel cathartic. I hope the sequel with Carnage will be better.These movies don't have to be rated R either. Sam Raimi made Spider-man 2 TERRIFYING with Doc Oc. Even his movie Drag Me To Hell was PG-13 and had a good mix of blood and scary cinematography.Just my opinion. It gets a 7.5 out of me because of Tom Hardy and his girlfriends performance and Venom fighting other Symbiotes was badass.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The issue with Sony brought my expectations lower, early reviews came in and some were mixed. If you like mindless entertainment then this film is for you, the story itself is weak and unfortunately makes Venom the jokester. It seems like the writers chose to copy Deadpool's style of quippy jokes and they insert it into Venom. There are some moments that are good, example the chemistry that is barely shown between Venom and Eddie Brock shines, it had me engaged. Yet the film quickly reverts to it's terrible jokes, and crappy story. The film shines when it keeps focus on its core character and his struggle, if they kept a serious tone then we would have a good film. If they had a serious tone and better told story this film would be great. Sad to see a terrible comic book related film make its way onto the big screen.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Which is a shame as Venom and Eddie have a interesting dynamic in the comics, but in here we have Venom used more for comedy relief in the film than anything else, skipping over most of the character development.The story itself has no pacing issues but its just so dull and a ton of scenes just feel so pointless to the story leaving it feeling like filler.What was a big disappointment however were the action scenes, the venom tentacles that you see in the trailer just look very cheesy and weird. Venom only has a couple of fight scenes which are just OK which is a shame when you have a power house like venom in your film, plus they take place at night which makes it very hard to see as Venom is basically fully black.Tom Hardy was good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But overall, it is there. The plot, Eddie Brock coming into contact with the creature. The creature choosing eddie/earth. The creature atleast for now conforming to some basic rules regarding co-existence.
Also the Eddie/Venom relationship that is being built. I really enjoyed it, there are moments where i feel too much was cut out, if i did not read spiderman all my youth i would not know what it meant.
But most of the time it was done so atleast it felt natural in the area of self preservation, social justice and political science. And for me that read alot of the comics. Fairly to the point as can be expected with all the ""spiderman universes"" taken into consideration.
I gave this title 9/10 not to boost the grade. But simply because i enjoyed it to this grade, i laughed, rejoiced and got treated with some great action, Also at the end got a treat hoping for a spiderman?, venom carnage followup. went to my summer house and brought home two boxes of my old spiderman collection.

This isn't venom at all. Not the story, not the origin, and not even the same character in personality. This is a funny buddy cop type anti hero movie with a character that borrows most of the looks from an actual established awesome character from Spider-Man's world.I can't stress this enough, this isn't Venom the cool alien villain who is a mockery of Spider-Man and one of his best villains. Venom shouldn't even exist without Spider-Man, not in name or looks. Venom's looks come from Spider-Man's looks. Everything about Venom comes from Spider-Man and the anger both the symboite and Eddie have towards Spider-Man. He isn't a good guy with stupid jokes. Venom is the combination of Eddie and the symboite, the name deriving from Spider-Man to challenge him. No Spider-Man origin of Venom gives venom no purpose. He's just a silly alien with a human body which allows him to form into a tangible monster. Eddie kinda just takes a back seat when the alien symboite takes over. They should work together as two beings forming into one being, that being is called Venom. This movie treats Venom like a friendly demon possessed Eddie and now they've become buddy roommates.This movie isn't remotely representative of the actual venom. It's like they made up a whole new character and borrowed venoms looks for the most part.I couldn't get past that aspect as it makes everything make no sense for venoms existence. However, if you know nothing about Venom or Spider-Man, you might like this movie. It's entertaining for sure, but even then, it isn't that great of a movie. Very mediocre.I'm a die hard Spider-Man fan and grew up living in the world of Spider-Man, he was my everything as a child. I loved venom as a character and he was so cool against Spider-Man. One of my favorite villains. This movie made a joke out of him. I want to see the actual venom in an actual Spider-Man origin film.This would be a somewhat fun movie if it wasn't suppose to be about Venom from Spider-man's world. I can't get passed the disappointment. Sad this movie will probably soon take over on what venom actually is and people will love Venom due to this movie, and not love the actual venom from the source material. Just more reshaping of characters and leaving the original ones to slowly fade away, watching as their name and looks are stolen to form a new version that loses the heart of what made them a character worth loving.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Eddie and Venom have some great scenes together, and the action in this film was shockingly engaging for a modern superhero movie. I loved this film. Not everyone will, but it's at least competently put together and is overall a fun ride.

I also like the villain's design and how the symbiotes can make weapons out of their hands.The film does have a 15 certificate due to strong threat, horror and violence.

But for some reason I feel the need with this.I really don't know where to start with Venom... which I guess puts me in the same room as the writers and director, because the whole thing is a mess from start to finish.It just doesn't know what it's trying to be and as a result, isn't really catered in one direction or another.The ""jokes"" are regular, but barring one smirk and snigger, were more eye rolling than anything else. The CGI is weak. The characters are 2 dimensional... scratch that, I don't think they had 2 dimensions even; the acting feels like they knew this wasn't going to turn out well; the storyline... well, flawed is being extremely kind. It's barely there. The action/fight sequences feel like something from a Michael Bay Tansformers movie for the most part (anyone who just asked what the problem with that is: get out now); as for the Venon ""character"" - it's just annoying in this movie and not remotely funny.... like a turd rolling down a hill (that's an actual line.... Jesus).Honestly, there are 2 films I can think of, where I've been close to suggesting we give up and walk out of the cinema: Bird-man and this.All I can think is that Tom Hardy's fan base is extremely loyal and that others enjoyed seeing Michelle Williams runaround in a short skirt (ok, I liked that too). I pray they don't make a sequel or if they do, they treat this as having never happened and start over with it.Awful. Awful. Awful.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

But it is let down by a painfully agonising script filled with cringey humour, flat characters, and an extremely underwhelming finale.
Tom Hardy is pretty good as Eddie Brock, a few scenes are hit and miss but he shines as Vemom. The banter most of the time between Eddie and Venom hits. Michelle Williams is fine as the love interest but I feel she wasn't given a lot to work off which is a shame as she turns out to be someone who is just there. Riz Ahmed puts up a fine performance as the villain Carlton Drake but again it's the writing that holds him back from being an interesting antogonist. He ends up being an evil businessman fed up of human beings, nothing new there. 
Action scenes are fine, some cool moments in fact which usually lead to someone's head coming off which was bloody entertaining. 
Overall I can say I had fun with the film but for the wrong reasons. This film was a huge missed opportunity and although a sequel will probably happen I'm not that excited for it. I must say the end credit scene is pretty darn good except for that last line (again the writing).
5/10 seems a fair score for this blunder.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a performer, he brings an uncommon realism to films that are lucky enough to have him. His voice is one of the most imitated among modern actors. He serves as a vocal chameleon. But I took issue with his latest movie Venom. The story was entertaining and I feel I got my money's worth. Yet, the plot was so riddled with holes that I could not help but feel a little insulted. In terms of character progression, Eddie Brock and hi symbiote counterpart develop too slowly at first and then assume a sudden change of heart. The film was 80 percent backstory, 10 percent climax, and 10 percent credits. At other times, it felt as though the screenwriter meant to be humorous while the director wanted a darker tale. Tom Hardy's voice also bounced around from soft Bane to squeaky New Yorker. Of course, it is only fair that I offer some advice to pair with my scrutiny. Venom's producers need to look at Deadpool for inspiration. Deadpool uses humor to such a degree that the audience laughingly overlooks plot holes and deus ex machina devices. Venom needs not take itself too seriously in the next installment.After all, I had a good time in the theatre. I likely would not pay to see it again, but I don't regret going in the first place.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He is funny like he is in the comics and he is a gooey psycho and I love it. However, the movie is ok in the CGI department and a couple of scenes drag out longer than they need the be. My main problem is the fact that it feels incomplete. I think they made a more rated R film and cut that stuff out. You'd be surprised in the lack of blood for a monster that chomps off heads. There is literally only two sequences with blood. Now would blood make it better I don't know. (I would have enjoyed that though) So overall it's pretty decent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is a good film and well worth watching. Definitely has the potential to be a very good series of films.Tom Hardy is a good choice to play Eddy Brock, his skills aren't exactly pushed but what he does offer is natural comedic timing, coupled with his usual blend of 'rough suave'. The creature 'Venom' has some great lines and hope this continues to develop in the following films.The other actors within the film, Riz Ahmed, Michelle Williams are both good within their roles, Mr Ahmed, plays his character with intelligence and artistic value, it is a slight shame that this wasn't developed a little further. Ms Williams, offers a decent portrayal of the love interest and again, like Mr Ahmed, could have been given a bigger position within the movie.Personally, feel the film suffers from trying to fit within a time frame and much of the story was left on the cutting room floor. Could have been a full 9/10 instead of the 7/8 if the story had been further expanded but still a very entertaining watch.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nothing fits.
Nothing is smooth, and it has no chemistry. Within minutes you realize something is very OFF.
 What's 'off' (in my opinion) is that entertainment STYLE and sense of humor does not always translate through to people from different countries and cultures. What you have here is, a fair attempt at an 'alien on earth' drama with a great leading man, trying his very best to work with a sub standard script, which includes humor that North American audiences will NOT find funny (just horribly corny)
During the last part of the movie I just started surfing the net, because it was too predictable (and just cheap) Ultimately the villains in this film reach out and grab you JUST LIKE GODZILLA and it's enemy, (what-ever-its-name-was.) If you WANT to LIKE this movie, I suggest you have a few alcoholic beverages first. LASTLY, don't think I'm biased or anything. I've watched movies with nothing but subtitles and loved them INCLUDING some Jackie Chan ones that barely got shown in North America. This poor movie VENOM, just doesn't measure up.

Venom was awesome every single second he was on screen.Other than that, the movie is quite terrible. It just doesn't commit to a style and, in my opinion, suffers for it.Starts Sci-fi, then its typical origin comic book, then action-comedy with dark touches, then...The humor, which is mostly dumb, mixed with dark jokes and some visual absurdism doesn't sound bad per se, but the reality is that they just don't nail a good enough amount of the jokes and Hardy's interpretation serves well some kind of jokes (when he is talking to Venom) and literally nothing else in the movie. Eddie Brooks is a just weird character. Human characters: A realistic portrait of a relationship starts with Hardy's Brook character and his girlfriend. But after the first act, its just silly and all over the place. A philosophical villain didn't mantain the tone. At times he was a bigger than life thinker and crazy scientist, and at other times he was a typical sutarday cartoon villain. The action is good, not great. It takes waaaaay too much time for fun things to start to happen. It seems the first act was writen by somebody, then the middle part for another one, and ANOTHER one had to wrap the story and the arcs of the characters (and failed).Honestly. Its a dissapointment.Having said that: I don't think ""I wasted my money"", because its enjoyable and I want more. This one had a low budget and it was a bet. I'll support Sony.

The makers did a good job in humanizing Venom and the way it shipped Eddie and Anne was pretty cute.

Unlike other Marvel titles, Sony is clearly restricted to spider-man and his supporting cast. For this title, however, they seemingly made the decision to remove Venom from any shared universe. As such, Venom's origin story is very far removed from its comic counterpart and despite having strong overlap with spider-man's design the movie makes no connection between them at all.A missed opportunity for Sony was to be the first to have a villain origin movie, which could easily culminate into a spider-man vs. venom movie where neither hero nor villain needs more than half of the movie's running time to get established. Instead, Venom is sort of a hero but edgier. As if you were watching a deadpool movie without humor.After all the nonsense stuff venom was saying and stupid decisions he was making, I finally called it quits when venom casually revealed he was a loser on his home planet (I almost quit when he just casually revealed his weaknesses to someone he hardly knew). In just a handful of seconds they established a (very poor) reason for Venom to become a good guy and it sucked.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed also do well in their respective roles, despite being giving little to do in the script. The action is also quite interesting, and despite the rushed fight in the end, it's very well done and you feel energized after going through it.

The script is very adult, the characters well written.
Eddie Brock is the Antihero, with two personalities standing out. Brock has a moral compass in a gray area, can break the law if it suits him but he has a good heart.
He fights the symbiote Venom within him in the beggining, but he acepts its true nature, because they both realize they need each other. It's a comic relief to see their interactions.
The True Villain Carlton Drake aka Riot, is a great villian with no regards for human life, even if he works in the LIFE Foundation.
But his motivations in name of science are plausible and make sense.
The movie is slow paced in the first hour of the movie it's true, but because it wants to tell us a story of a man in a downward spiral that looses everything, and the motivations behind the Life Foundation, and that is made masterfully.
The rest of the movie has good action scenes, a great epic Chase, and the CGI is ok but not the best. I've seen better special FX in other movies. The ending of the movie is good, but a little rushed out, the fight between Venom and Riot could have been even better.
Kids that love Avengers or the new Stars wars Trilogy wont like it, because they want cheap thrills and laughs.
But i can say this, since the Dark Night i dont see a Superhero movie with such good story. It is Marvels darkest movie, for me it could be even Darker and more violent, but the PG13 tag, stops the movie from trully shinning.
If Spiderman were here, it would be the best Spiderman movie for sure.
PS- The Post Credit Scene is Great SEE IT! A hint: There will be CARNAGE.

When Eddie's sad he looks miserable and teary and openly expresses why. He shrieks when he's startled. He panics when he's confused and worried. He silently screams when he's angry and can't do anything about it. He reacts to the events of the movie in a way that someone might actually respond.Tl;Dr: Venom was an amazing movie with good acting and the critics are wrong","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Honestly I was disappointed I wanted this to be a really good film. After the terrible portrayal by Topher Grace in Spider-Man 3 I wanted a good movie with Venom. I decided to go in and see the film for myself. I actually enjoyed the movie. The film has many flaws and I will talk about them but first the good stuff. The movie delivers when its trying to be funny. The back and forth between Eddie and Venom is fantastic and quite funny and I wish that there was a bit more of the interaction between the two while Eddie is trying to have normal conversations with other people. At first I didn't think I would believe Tom Hardy as a reporter but he fits quite well with the way he was written and as always Tom Hardy gives a great performance. So some negatives. The PG-13 rating is a problem, it should be R and a lot more bloody and gory and the movie really should have shown the intensity and the savagery that Venom is. The action scenes could have been better, for the most part they were good but the final battle should have been a bit longer and I wish we had seen more of Venom during the day because black on the night sky is a bit difficult to see. The villain of the film is a bit cliche but still tolerable. Overall I honestly found the movie enjoyable and not bad.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Dear movie lovers, Rotten Tomatoes can be right on a lot of things but can also be wrong. I went to see Venom tonight with the only thing in my mind which was to hate in to its core. But I left the theater with a grin on my face. This movie isn't flawless, the reactions going out were a lot of ""It was so short, could at least lasted half an hour more"", this is all due with its pacing. Venom has a really fast pacing which doesn't allow the audience to feel like they're invested in what's most important in movies, characters. Also a lot of cheesy lines and plot points seem like they're not always on point with what you want to watch. But, Venom has really cool action scenes, great humour and also a delightful duo between Eddie Brock and Venom. My only point is this, if you are a general movie lover who just wants to tske a chance by seeing this movie then do so. I believe if Fleischer makes enough at the box office that he'll do a great sequel if he fixes his issues up because what has been teased in a post-credit scene is something I wanna see next. Enjoy everybody, Venom is quite fun","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Not a disaster, but not the best start to a new franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4383446/?ref_=tt_urv","rcolgan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20595945/?ref_=tt_urv","7 October 2018","Sony may have finally agreed that the MCU can use Spider-man after failing to start up their Amazing Spider-man film series, but that doesn't mean that they can't keep milking their biggest cash cow in every way they can. Thus we get Venom, one of Spider-man's biggest enemies getting a new origin without Spider-man and a film franchise of his own. The end result is a strange mixture of dullness, weirdness and a few blushes of genuine fun scattered throughout. Set in San Francisco, the film stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, a journalist who is going after a man named Carlton (Riz Ahmed), a multi-billion dollar entrepreneur who is in on the verge of many breakthrough discoveries and is involved with several deaths. Whilst investigating one of his facilities, Eddie comes in to contact with one of the symbiotes that were brought to earth by one of Carlton's deep space discoveries. This symbiote then attaches itself to Eddie and creates Eddie's new personality called Venom.Probably the biggest disappointment for anyone who's a fan of the comics will be that they never showed how the symbiote corrupts its host through its power. Even Spider-man 3, in spite of having one of the worst dance sequences put to film, still showed how the symbiote blended with Peter and was able to corrupt anyone it came into contact with. But in this film Venom and Brock live mostly in harmony, with Venom never really trying to take over and never actually doing anything evil either. Venom does still try to engage in a few horror elements, with the overall plot of the film resembling a classic monster movie formula and Venom's gothic design feeling like it's been ripped right from the pages of the comics. However, this does often lead to the film being tonally confused, with something that should be horrifying like Venom taking over another character and making them kill other humans for the first time is played up for laughs. Despite several moments clearly being cut out of the film, mostly as a result of Sony cutting out several darker moments to avoid an R rating, Venom does have a few creative action sequences earlier in the film. They take full advantage of Venom's powers, morphing and extending his arms in to various weapons. Unfortunately the actions sequences do seem to get worse as the film goes on, with a final battle between two symbiotes which ends up being the kind of computer generated mess that you would expect to see in a Transformers movie. Though the main driving force that gives this franchise some potential is Tom Hardy. Whilst he doesn't get the opportunity to show himself being slowly corrupted by the symbiote, it is great to see Hardy get a chance to stretch his comedic muscles, arguing with a character than nobody else can see like a psychotic version of Will Ferrell from Stranger than Fiction. Unfortunately outside of Venom there's not much for the supporting cast to work with. The villain played by Riz Ahmed feels just like any other crazed entrepreneur and whose motivations are never made clear. Also Eddie's ex-girlfriend is played by Michelle Williams, who does have some good chemistry with Tom Hardy but also has so little to do in the film that her role feels pointless. Overall, it's not the best set up for a franchise (which like every other superhero film already has an after credits scene already confirming a future sequel). There are a few things to work with through the fun dynamic between Eddie and Venom and the creative designs, but hopefully a future sequel will be able to develop Venom's character more effectively.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Skip It (D+) *new grade*
Not as completely irredeemable from positives on this rewatch which it has a fun but crazy over-the-top performance by Tom Hardy as well as some good acting from Michelle Williams, Scott Haze and the rest of the cast. The score by Ludwig Gorannsson is still fun to listen to and the banter between Eddie and Venom is still fun. I still like the action sequences and cinematography here too. But my biggest praise is Venom's look and it is a major improvement over his look in Spider-Man 3But between those positives, this movie still has the big issues that keeps this from being a great stand-alone Venom movie such as the inconsistency in the editing at times especially in the action sequences (which are still fun but problem is, some of them are not cut right) and most of the movie at times and the editing is pretty bad at times. The script by Kelly Marcel (and the 2 writers of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle & The Next Level) is really terrible and this movie suffers from Sony's usual studio meddling as well as no mention of the web singer, Spider-Man himself which was and still is desperately needed. Riot is a very disappointing villain with no clear motivation despite Riz Ahmed's best efforts but his performance is incredibly over-the-top. Not to mention there's some bad CGI here in placesBut of all of the problems this movie has, it's biggest and major problem is it's PG-13 rating really hurting the film's full potential and desperately needing for a hard R and the extra 40 minutes that was cut.Not the worst movie ever but still one of my least favorite superhero movies ever and one of the worst of last decade but it does have enough merit to boost the grade up. 4.5/10 (D+)","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

When I watched this movie, I get the thing why people liked it. Venom was creepy, it was action, and of course Tom Hardy in the main role. Tom Hardy is a good actor, really. But in this movie, I think he didn't know what to do, it looked like that. He played really badly in this movie, what is very sad, because he is overall a great actor. I didn't care about the rest of the characters, except the villain, and the villain was really not a scary or rememberable character, that was also disappointing. The plot was weak, like everything else, some space monster, someone got infected, that is nothing new and original. If I am going to watch the sequel, I expect better. Better story, acting and overall movie. Venom was creepy, though, he was creepy and rememberable, that is the good thing, at least they made Venom good. Venom is not a movie worth watching, unless you are going to watch all of the Marvel movies, then you got to watch this one too. But if not, don't waste time, and drink some coffee instead.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Imagine Ironman in a reboot as a villain who makes weapons to get richer and richer and then makes the suit to be the King of the World. This is why people don't like this movie.

They try to keep the whole universe together, give food and jobs to everyone, keep everyone calm to make it a peaceful universe with harmony in it and here comes that little rebellion with his fellas to conquer it not giving a damn about the people and other creatures in it.

The best performance was delivered by the older asian lady while she was following the girl. That was the most impressive part of the movie.Average action and silly jokes in a story that was made in a thousand other before.. How is that good?

Without Spidey around, Venom's existence feels pointless, his origin bland and dull and the stakes never feel meaningful. Even his costume just looks like black vomit without the prominent white spider symbol that SHOULD be there. I've heard the movie called ""fun"" and it is if you turn your brain off. It's fun in the way a Rambo movie is fun; bad dialogue, flashy action, dumb plot, lots of special effects. Is it a good movie? No. Not even close. Does it do the character justice? Well, no.

It doesn't really have any serious problems, especially if you consider that the studio had to it without Spider-Man. Of course, some things had to be changed. For instance, Venom is kinda dumb and also a bit heroic. Riot is the main villain, but it (he? I don't know, it's a symbio) lacks character development. But the relationship between Eddie Brock and his Symbio is pretty fun to watch. By the way, Tom Hardy delivers an acceptable Eddie, considerang many aspects os his personality were changed because he's supposed to be the hero here, the good guy. Overall it's a fun, decent movie, and it is worth watching.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy is a great actor, Marvel had been on a mostly good streak, but when this came out I never saw it. After hearing mixed reviews, I finally watched this and was fairly disappointed.The good: Tom Hardy is a good actor, some of the interactions between him and Venom are pretty fun.Honestly, that's about all I can say for this movie. Tom Hardy is a good actor, but a lot of his performance in this movie feels strange: watch this pretending that he's drunk and it totally fits with the way he delivers lines and moves. The side characters are very forgettable, and the villain even more-so. Ultimately, all of this would have been fine if once we finally met Venom, he had the right chemistry with Eddie Brock and the movie started really picking up speed. Instead, their relationship did not work for me, feeling random and not having the connection or humor that they needed. CGI not amazing at some point. The movie felt like it wants you to take it seriously, but then the main action scene has the Elon Musk villain deploying exploding drones at Eddie Brock in the middle of a random street, blowing up random cars and, again, shooting drones at him.I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if it brought Venom in sooner and really nailed their relationship. But because of the movie we got, I doubt I will ever want to watch this again and I don't know how I would even feel about seeing Venom in the MCU. I wish I could have just enjoyed this movie like a lot of people did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I am not telling that the movie was awesome but it was not bad either. It was a average movie with very simple plot.
Movie has good cgi, good action scenes, good background music but the main problem with the movie was its plot. The story was sooooo simple. When the movie was over I was like 'Huh thats it?'Many from audience was also dissapointed from story. The second promblem of the movie was its villian. Its villian was sooo weak. There was a scene in the movie in which Vemom said we have 0% of winning against him and them he killed him in 10 minutes.
Overall the movie was average time pass movie. It is not that type of movie which will stay in your mind for weeks or months. There are 2 post credit scenes in this movie and both of the scenes worth watching.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The entire movie itself was just awful, from the acting to the plotline. I felt as though it had an identity crisis, it didn't know whether it wanted to be Deadpool with its humor and sometimes grisly scenes (I'm looking at you Justice League) , but stopped short of actual violent gore or if it wanted to be an lackluster spider-man. 
I'll I'm saying is Sony has tried and failed on numerous occasions with spidey, I mean spidey 2 was great, but that was over 14 years ago and the only taste in my mind is dancing black symbiote Toby and a fat guy in a rhino suit from the AS movies. 
I just think the head honchos over at Sony should take a page out of the previous people in charge and do what they did with Spidey and give venom and all the other characters to Marvel to work their magic. I mean at the end of the day isn't all about the bottom line for them anyways? At least this way it's a win for Sony and Marvel (Disney if you're so inclined) because for sure it will make boocoo bucks and it's a win for all of us because we know Marvel will do their characters justice.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie is held together by the performance of Tom Hardy as Venom and Eddie Brock. Which is all this movie is really suppose to provide. If you're unable to find the tone of the film, it's a Dark Action Comedy. But it's so fun and exciting that I felt like I was Eddie just kinda along for the ride. The movie could have done better with an R-Rating. There is no doubt that, some scenes felt a bit awkward with the lack of violence or gore. Especially because that's who Venom. Regardless, it stays true to Venom is which is dark, funny and inappropriate. Similar to who Deadpool is. The only real problem I felt with this film was that it needed to be longer. Only 1 Hour and 52 minutes wasn't enough to dive in and flesh out the events and characters of the movie, which led to a really fast paced movie, which is great. But for this movie, it's too fast. Things are constantly happening and the story is progressing along so quickly that we didn't really have the time to watch Venom and Eddie really bond or create a relationship.Otherwise, this film is so fun. I can't wait to see it again. I highly recommend seeing it, especially with the predictions of a sequel. That's something I know people will be wanting to see. Please go see Venom.

It was like watching the Evil Dead again for the first time, in that i truly enjoyed it in a dumb way. Quite surprised that Tom Hardy is so good at physical comedy, the smashing plates over the head routine would have fit right in. CGI was pretty run of the mill, couldn't tell who was who in the final battles, too many particle effects. Think it could have been even funnier it there was was an 18 or R rated cut.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I don't regret the time at all but I definitely will not try watching it again.. it is a mixture of Marvel's black superman, resident evil's monsters and some other movies.. i think there were some lines that were supposed to be funny but the character couldn't deliver and left us to decide whether this line was supposed to be funny or out of context!!. ok let's just say: don't expect good laughs as in Iron man or deadpool.. although Tom Hardy jas it in him to drop some jokes but the script was too busy making this movie all about action and tough guys. i enjoyed the action and effects but no thanks to supporting actors as they were like robots just reciting with no face impressions. Only thanks goeas to Tom Hardy.. i believe he would've raised this movie to a much higher rating if there was a better cast acting more alive next to him.I am giving it a 5 because as much as i feel; A good average movie .. if you have other choice at theatres, opt out from this one.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Them alone in the movie would be funny. The dialogue and delivery between them is spot on and I hope for more of it in the sequel. It could have been R rated, I agree with others. While it hints at gore it doesn't show enough of it to make us want to turn away. That's what it is lacking for me. Don't half do things, the film portrayed Venom as human ripping alien and didn't follow through. So get it right next time I say, go full out make us look away squeamish gore.And if there exists a Venom symbiote out there in real,life. I want him. That's how good it was.I've never listened to critics, never will. If we did listen then we would have missed out on some great films through the years including this one.

The villain is generic & STUPID. 
The love interest is shallow & STUPID. 
Even Venom himself is STUPID.

I genuinely could not tell what was going on.  Tom Hardy did a great job and his performance is the only good thing about this movie. It makes me really sad that he wasn't given a decent plot.

Again, a simple thread of consistency a movie maker throws out for the sake of a story line.So, that's the irritating bit.But I love the Marvel movies. This one was different but nearly as much fun and exciting. It was also surprisingly funny which I simply did not expect. My girls sitting next to me in the cinema starting laughing at one point, and I was like, oh shhh. Then the next thing all the cinema was laughing also, and I realised I was taking it too seriously.I liked the action, I liked the humor, especially from Venom, it really was quite witty in a simple way. Tom Hardy's performance was great, he was perfect for the role.Great movie, great setup for sequels. Worth going to see.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I forgot everything that happened. I had to watch a recap to watch the 2nd movie. It's just so bad. Possibly 1 star. It's supposed to highlight Tom Hardy, I guess, but he's not that great. The Venom symbiote tries to be funny, but it's not. Venom is supposed to be evil or a super-villian, but they try to make him an anti-villain, at best, I guess? Again it's so bad, I wish Sony had control of this so he could be a part of the Spiderman univers, but he's not and it really is just so bad. Venom acts if he's not in control and he's just a bad comedian that tries to take over and be a goofball companion instead of being an alien symbiote that is an evil-supervillian that rivals Spiderman.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you're not a fan, then I don't think you would fully enjoy it. The movie started off a little slow but once Venom really became active, I feel that's when the movie began.The jokes worked good as long as you could catch on to them. If anything, the CGI was amazing and there was just enough action to help cary the movie.I liked how they slowly introduced the second ""parasite"" as it made it's journey to the rocket. Each host it bonded with, seemed to take to it better than Venom took to his first few host. The way the second parasite revealed his true form would have caused me to pee my pants. He looked more intimidating than Venom.Thank goodness there was no damsel in distress like there is in typical superhero movies.Overall, the movie was funny with a side of action. A movie I would sit down with the family to watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I wonder how they will deal with Carnage, as that guy is pure ultraviolence.

I have always loved the character of Venom, even in Spider-Man 3. (and we all know what a train wreck that movie was) so when I heard that a Venom movie was in production I was thrilled. The previews for it looked amazing and when I saw it opening night I was not disappointed!
The special effects used to create Venom were spectacular in my opinion! He gave off a creepy vibe and in some scenes he was downright scary. I loved the dynamic between Eddie Brock and Venom and I must say, Tom Hardy has never been one of my favorite actors and I was a bit skeptical when I heard about his casting but he totally pulled it off and now I can't picture anyone but him in that role! This movie was a great mix of action, suspense, comedy and horror.
I will admit that towards the end it did feel a bit rushed and I do wish that they had expanded a little more on Riot's storyline but still I very good movie.
If you are a die hard Marvel-Only fan there is a chance you won't be thrilled with this movie as it does have a totally different feel than movies like the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. In my opinion it was one of the darker and creepier superhero films. Just a warning if your planning on taking a small child, the kid next to me in the theater who was maybe 10-12 years old was terrified by Venom and the other Symbiotes and kept his eyes covered for most of the movie, and when the it was over I heard his parents saying that it was much darker than they had expected. Some people might not like this darker ""superhero"" movie but in my opinion it was perfect for the character that the movie was about (Venom is an Anti-hero not a superhero, there's a pretty big difference).
All in all I really enjoyed this movie and honestly I would gladly go see it again before it's out of theaters.
Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the critics, you'll miss a very well done and entertaining movie if you do.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But somehow i really liked the movie for what IT is. Just plain dumb old fashioned super (anti) hero action. I really missed the Gore and i can't wait for the rumored uncut version.

Tom's performance is great, not so cannonical plot is well written and actually makes a lot of sense (when it comes to comic based movie). Looking forward to the second installment.

Every other character in this film was bland and had nothing to offer for me, and incredible waste in the talents of Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams. Tom Hardy will always have an incredible screen presence and people will definitely enjoy this. It's by no means Catwoman level of bad, or does it deserve a 28% (or whatever it is) on Rotten Tomatoes. However it doesn't deserve to be put on any kind of pedestal for an achievement in film making either. Summary: Go see the movie, there is fun to be had here, just don't expect MCU level of balanced action/comedy and world building.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Venom is not your usual superhero movie. And that's a good thing!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4393400/?ref_=tt_urv","carlasantd","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur93812497/?ref_=tt_urv","12 October 2018","Honestly, the critics don't do Venom justice. The movie is funny, but not Marvel-like funny. Don't expect them to crack a joke every five minutes - not gonna happen. And as a die-hard Marvel fan, I say it as a compliment. Venom is refreshing exactly because it doesn't try to force what other superhero movies have been feeding us. It doesn't try to be what is not. It lies between serious and funny, but it doesn't exaggerate either. It does feel like it came straight out of the early 2000s, and again, it's not a bad thing. 
People comparing this movie with Marvel and DC current movies forgot they had years and years to prepare themselves to get where they are now. Marvel alone took 10 years! So being hard on Venom for it it's just plain silly. 
Tom Hardy gives an amazing performance as both Eddie and Venom. And seeing the main characters' chemestry develop on screen is utterly amusing. 
Of course not everything is great. I think Michelle Williams should have been given more screen time being the talented actress she is. Also the plot was way too simple and at some point we didn't have a clue where the film was going. Some events felt rushed while others felt slow. 
Still, I must say I had a really nice time watching it. I've watched it twice already and it's funny because the first time I saw it, I gave it an 8. But now that I watched a second time, it's a solid 9 for me. 
Venom doesn't deserve the bad treatment and low scores it's receiving. It's a fun ride and you need to appreciate the movie for what it is.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let's talk about the good things, first of all, the dynamic between Eddie Brock and Venom is awesome, as a big fan of Venom, that worked very well, the banter that they have is very funny, Eddie's Ex, Annie, played by Michelle Williams was a nice add on to the movie, but isn't very important, or a character that I should care about. The villain Carlton Drake, played by Riz Ahmed, was pretty bad. Then there is Tom Hardy, he plays Eddie Brock so great, he clearly cares about the character, wanting to do the character justice after the problems with Venom in Spider-Man 3. Let's talk about the problems with the film, first problem, the movie was TOO LOUD! Jesus, me and my sister both thought, ""bloody hell, every fight scene is soooo loud"", which put me off sometimes. The pacing was a bit off, it had a rhythm, but not a good one, there would be a scene with Eddie and Venom, it would be funny, but then right after there would be either a talking scene with Carlton Drake or A GIANT FIGHT SCENE, WHICH WAS SOOOOO LOUD, then some more banter, it was a big issue, the CGI could have been a bit better, in terms of the Venom vs Riot scenes. A lot of the plot threads aren't good whatsoever, it's drags on with the Carlton Drake stuff, which is soo boring.Overall, pretty bad in terms of a movie, BUT if you are wanting to watch a movie with your brain switched off, and all you want is some fun action, then this movie is still not for you, because all the boring stuff is used as much as the Venom stuff. 5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One such goopy critter manages to escape, inhabiting a series of human carriers like a serial carjacker, while the others are whisked back to company HQ for various pokes and prods in the lab. There, a forsaken ex-journalist with a grudge against the CEO (who is eeevil, for the record) makes off with one of the remaining creatures and everything quickly descends into metro mayhem and superpowered action.The nuts and bolts of how Venom's symbiosis functions are interesting, and the running conversation inside his cranium is campy yet entertaining (think Willem Dafoe's competing personalities in 2002's Spider-Man), but the human characters are generic, the plot is full of gaps and the narrative is terribly predictable. We also don't get a lot of good reasons to cheer for the star, beyond the visceral thrills of watching him crush cars, eat heads and say precisely what's on his mind. He's a victim of his own bad decision-making, both as the human Eddie Brock (simultaneously killed his career and his love life in one selfish act) and his eight-foot, alien-skinned alter-ego (prone to violence, wrests control from several unwilling host bodies). They're better together, occasionally pushing each other to grow and learn, but that feels more like a throwaway scrap than a theme and the climactic struggle falls short of achieving redemption.Tom Hardy turns in another satisfying performance as the twin leads, completely transforming his voice to inhabit the role of a bloodthirsty foreign consciousness, and the effects work is appropriately exciting. In all his glory, though, Venom looks rather bland without a big, white spider icon on his chest; his design is basically all head now. This isn't boring, it's just incredibly dumb.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I Worried about the PG-13 rating going in, but it didn't stop Venom from doing what he does one bit. I'd say any gore absent is not sorely missed and isn't for lack of violence. I thought it was handled well.I'm hoping we get another movie with more focus on Eddie living with venom and doing a little more crime fighting or whatever equivalent activities Venom is capable of.

Having now watched Venom, I can see how both a critic and your average film fan would feel after seeing this.On the whole, Venom doesn't offer anything new: cliched jokes, standard fight scenes and the superhero trope of underdog survival everywhere. The most disappointing aspect of the film was, in fact, Tom Hardy; his acting felt forced and unnatural, a far cry from his villainous performance as Bane in the Dark Knight Rises.Overall, Venom for me doesn't earn itself a sequel or any continuation, a shame considering the strong character background given when exploring Venom itself; however, if you're a fan of the genre and don't mind a classic slash and hack film, then you may enjoy this more than I did.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Enjoyed venom, however I feel much of the film left a lot to be desired, off the bat, Eddie Brock and Venoms relationship was fantastic and the characterisation of both characters was superb. However I feel that story they were in was lackluster and disapointing, the film starts incredibly slow and fills us with far too much exposition and not enough action I was fairly bored throughout much of the first act, once Venom is introduced the movie picks up its pace a lot and is very enjoyable, the humour works and the character vibe together fantastically, However the plot and side characters are utterly dull and Venom and Eddie don't have a very good motive to come into the final act of the movie.Overall fun but disapointing","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I have nothing against A Star is Born, but if that is indeed the case, then that would be the dumbest idea. Just in case for those who are excited for A Star is Born, word of advise, please try not compare it to Venom and just chill because they're both NOT a like. I mean, if ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Shazam"" were released on the same day in 2019, then there could be a HUGE disaster and where the hell would we be? Reviewing an action movie JUST to support a love movie is REALLY pointless and not the same thing as reviewing a DC movie JUST to support a Marvel movie. So about Venom, yes, the look of Venom is exactly like from what I saw in the images from comic books and he looks definitely a lot better than how he looks in Spider-Man 3. It's NOT even boring like Batman & Robin where you have an action scene for about 10 or 15 minutes and then we have long boring scenes, NO, all I see is action. I realized that the pacing is almost fast, but not as fast as the pacing in The Dark Tower, it was just...there. I also found two silliest moments that will be my favorites which I will not tell you which because I don't want this review to contain SPOILERS!!!Also, they tried. They tried to have Venom be part of the MCU, and I know that the creators of Venom wanted to have Venom in the MCU and I don't know why Feige wouldn't do that, I mean he's supposed to be the archenemy of Spider-Man, why couldn't the producer of the MCU work with the producers of Venom like how he handled with the producers for Spider-Man: Homecoming? It makes no sense.With that out of the way, I don't think it's that close of being bad. I still think it's both entertaining and silly at the same time. I can't tell you WHY because this is spoiler-free, if you go watch it yourself, then you'll understand.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Venom isn't a good movie. It suffers from a bad script and a rushed plot, jamming as much detail into Venom's origin story as possible, but ultimately taking away from the power any one scene could have had. What Venom does have is star performances (Tom Hardy getting a Best Actor Nomination at the Golden Globes could definitely happen). Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Riz Ahmed are phenomenal on screen and they 100% make this movie into a really good, entertaining Bad Movie. It's worth watching. It's so bad that it's laughable, but it has some genuinely funny moments. The Eddie/Venom dynamic is fun to watch and again, brilliantly acted. 
But I wouldn't expect a sequel anytime soon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, this film falls short in achieving the full potential of the character. The main issue i have with this film is the poor attempts at humour throughout - if anything i feel it undoes the fear factor of venom and creates a goofy vibe throughout the entire film. The CGI also looks odd throughout and certain action sequences are let down due to this. Tom Hardy is a saving grace for this film and does his best to carry the film's plot and dialogue. Overall, i would argue this might be one to avoid; that being said if you're a fan of the venom character, Hardy and fancy an easy watch then it might be the one for you.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not a good movie. It's not a bad movie. It's a movie and it's not as bad as Others would have you Believe. Tom Hardy (that is Tom Hardy running around doing stuff in the movie, right?), likes tater tots, and thankfully, so does Venom.Venom's weaknesses are dog whistles and the occasional desire for deep mouth kisses (or is it deep-mouth kisses?). Venom's other weaknesses are that the animations are lame and whatever plot there might be gets lost in the complete absence of Spider-Man. It's ultimately for the best that the thin plot easily dissolves away for exciting zooms and slow-motion explosions, some of which also involve motorcycles and the streets of San Francisco.Without having read any of the source material, Venom is really strong, talks like Tom Hardy wearing a Bane mask, is persistently hungry, and has an uncanny knack for sensing quiet love. Venom moves fast, talks slow, and has separation issues. Oh, and there are other aliens that are like Venom who live on Venom World, but they are not as nice as Venom. Add that all up and the final lesson is that we are all our own worst enemies, both personally and in the more general sense.Check your brain at the door until there ain't no more Venom!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Are you sure this was made after his performances in Inception, Dark Knight Rises, Revenant, and Dunkirk!?After what seems like a lot of negativity above, although I knew what I was watching was quite poor, I surprisingly still enjoyed parts of this film.

The premise of the film sees a struggling reporter bonded with an alien parasite who have to save the world.Main Character
Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock and he does a decent job here. You can tell he is fully committed and giving everything to the role and because he is a good actor it mostly pays off. It's not one of his best performances but he has a bit of charm and humour to him that does enough and his interactions with Venom is the highlight of the film. Hardy also voices Venom and is really good at it, the dynamic between the two of them is really good and I just wish there was more of it in this film.Supporting Characters
Michelle Williams plays a romantic foil for Eddie Brock and I just couldn't get invested in her as a character. The dynamic between her and Hardy is just never there for me and it just feels like that there has to be a love interest but they didn't put much time and effort into it. Riz Ahmed plays a bad guy and honestly, I have never been a huge fan of his and he is just really bland in this film. This is a mixture of poor writing and a weak performance that doesn't hold up against Hardy who is really trying. This cast is so small and unfortunately, apart from Venom and Eddie there are no character that stands out.Story
The story is also a mess, things just don't make sense and none of it is interesting at all. The bad guys plan doesn't add up and the plot is really not given the focus that it needs. It takes way too long to get to the meat of it and even then it doesn't do enough to keep your interest.Script
The script actually has some funny moments, the dialogue between Eddie and Venom is decent and thank goodness for that because the drama is poor. The relationship drama doesn't work and the conflict between our protagonist and antagonist is not done well to say the least.Style
Venom himself looks great, the CGI is really good and I really like how large he is compared to the previous iteration that we saw in Spider-Man 3. Some of the action scenes are decent as well, but I do wish they could have pushed the violence a bit more as it seems a bit tame for Venom. The pacing for the film is a bit all over the place too, it takes too long for Venom to actually come on screen with the film being quite short, it doesn't use its time effectively.Overall
Overall, Venom is a below average film. Tom Hardy really tries but the rest of the cast aren't great and the story is all over the place so lets hope the sequel will be better.Rating - 4/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy should avoid being casual.
There is nothing more UNfunny and awkward than Tom Hardy in this ""movie"".Everything about this movie is awkward. The first act intro and set up, the endless cliches, the contrived dialogue, the special effects circa 1998... it just never stops, and it seems like it never stops.I had very low expectations and WAS so disappointed.

This is not venom in my voice, this move is poison for your mind.This move pushes the overpopulation myth and climate change while consuming how much resources to make it?

Most critics are saying this movie is bad because there's no spiderman but it's still possible to make a great venom movie without spiderman. I think sony got this one right and they were smart about it too. I believe sony not including spiderman was a tactic in case the movie didn't do well then it wouldn't effect the MCU at all. Sony does plan to get venom and spiderman to meet in the future so then we need to see this film with that in mind. Sony is building up to that moment and so what better way then to keep spiderman and venom distant for the moment. MCU does this very well and has been doing this since the beginning with the ultimate meetup on the avengers. This movie gets me excited for the next venom movie and ultimately the spiderman vs venom film. Aside from that this movie is hilarious and stays true to the comics (I'm referring to the venom comic) I feel when this movie hits bluray we will get the unrated edition which may show the 30-40 min that was cut from this film. Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It was so fun and I may end up watching it again on a Tuesday ($5)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

During pre-production on that film, the creative team decided not to include the character so they could focus on introducing the protagonists, Eddie Brock and Venom.

I'm not very educated in the history of the character's and whatnot. So this is all coming from my knowledge from the movies and such. 
I will start with the positives, because that's fun! 
I thought that the fight scenes were well choreographed, for the most part. I thought that Tom Hardy as Eddie could have been better performed, he could have been great if it weren't for some of his stylistic choices (or it might have been the director, I don't know!)
And here' s where I start the negatives...
I didn't think it was very ""entertaining"" how Tom portrayed Eddie. He was very casual and upbeat but it a way that was way too cheesy and would be seen as bad acting. Sometimes that's ok, but only if it's in the right context and environment (that's when it can turn into good comedy, which this clearly was not!). Eddie's strange character was put into situations were the people around him didn't react or play off his attitudes, that made it so that I would feel uncomfortable watching it instead of the characters around him feeling uncomfortable, which something that can be easily achieved if you write good character interactions! 
I did not feel a single thing for any of the characters because there wasn't enough content or information that showed how each of these people are with each other. One scene (or multiple even) with cheesy and awful dialogue won't cut it so I can feel something for them. The simple rule of ""Show, Don't Tell"" clearly lacks in a lot of scenes. I can't believe that two characters love each other just because they say it, you need to put in some steaks to a simple feeling or emotions so the audience can see!
But you know, opinions are subjective. If you enjoyed this, good for you. But I do think it is unfair to label this movie anything higher than an 8 and anything lower than a 5. 
Sometimes opinions stop us from really seeing that true quality of a movie. 
I did not enjoy Venom. I will not be seeing it again.
But I will give credit where credit is due. 
This movie was good enough to deserve a hard earned 6!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film was fantastic, with a perfect mix of gory tense action and rib tickeling comedy. The film definitely subverts your expectations and brilliantly allows you to connect to a humorous alien blob of goo. 
The critics of this film completely miss what makes this film great. It isn't a storyline masterpiece but it is the film that venom comic book fans have been waiting for. Reviews totally rip apart a film that should be praised for its unique take on a very unusual character that has struggled to make its way successfully on film.

"8","/10","I was hoping for the movie to wash away the negativity yet again,and it happened by a long shot !","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4379143/?ref_=tt_urv","gautamania270","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33525686/?ref_=tt_urv","5 October 2018","Before I begin, I'd clarify that I'm no comic reader and the only thing I knew about Venom was that he is a Spiderman Villain and the only time I saw him before, live action or otherwise was in Raimi's Spiderman 3 but as with everybody I've been a fan of the character,and secondly I watched the film Hindi dubbed.
From past sometime, it's as if there is some kind of propoganda working against the Sony. It's understandable that it's the job of the critics to find flaws in the movie and write about them and they need to be appreciated for the work they do but the kind of Undermining articles that I read about the Venom after its screening were just too hard to believe. Plenty of things were said about the plot holes, how the comical bits impose themselves and whatnot but unless I'm a total dummy; something which I highly doubt I couldn't find one such single flaw which would have remained at the back of my head throughout the run time of the film, much less something I'd give a second thought after the movie gets over.
It was a well paced fine entertainment and infact people cheered in so many scenes where I watched the film. 
As is the case with me, if I read about some film being too bad and if I happen to watch it in the theatre, the first that I do is empty my mind of all the preconceived thoughts and take one scene at a time, I failed to do that in case of The Nun because it's story was really that bad but this film had nothing of the sort. It infact immersed me completely and there was fun all along.
It could be said that the major villain Riot appeared a bit too late but even that wouldn't be the reason for me to hate the film. Action scenes are solid, chemistry between Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams isn't bad either and story is pretty good. Where do I find the hate from then, and why should I bother finding it?
They did the same thing with The Meg and it's box office collections are for everybody to see and after a few years from now, people would hail the film for being a rejuvenating film in the Shark horror department and critics will be forgotten. I'm hopeful that same would happen with Venom and who will become the turd in the wind; The venom or the critics will be for everybody to see.
My best wishes for the movie :-)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film doesn't seem to know what it is. Ruban Fleischer has an eye for visuals but the guy has directed four feature films, only one of any critical and audience success was Zombieland. The entire cast, especially Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed are wasted with poor dialogue and weirdly placed monologues. Overall, Venom is not a turd in the wind, it is not Catwoman level of bad, but it is not on the same level of MCU blend of humour and action, which unfortunately it seems to try to achieve.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After the film's marketing run which I feel in my opinion, didn't leave people thinking about rushing to the cinemas with mammoth expectations to see it. 'Venom' was better than I expected and it surprised me.Tom Hardy is excellent here and fully embraces the ridiculousness of the role and it works 100%, anyone else in the role and it wouldn't have worked. The relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom is the saving grace of the film and it provides a lot of comedy which is hilarious. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if certain things were meant to be intentionally played for laughs or not, and it didn't bother me. The film at times feels quite self-aware of what it's doing and knows what its trying to be. During a certain chase scene, the action mixed together with the comedy created an incredibly entertaining sequence.There are a few characters who are in a completely different film. Riz Ahmed is a terrific actor but his character and portrayal doesn't work. The villain is very bland and boring. Michelle Williams is also a excellent actor but her character doesn't work. Both characters take up so much screen time and are rather underwritten. Mix all this in with a very quickly thrown together generic superhero third act, some dialogue that just doesn't work and a few plot holes.When this film works, it is fantastic and the highs are really high. When the film doesn't work however, it creates some seriously conflicting tones, cliche's and just makes you wish you were watching more of Eddie and Venom. I enjoyed this movie and am looking forward to a sequel if it happens. It did enough good for me, but upon further thought it has its problems. Also, 'Venom' doesn't really suffer a lot from being PG-13, however, an R rating would've been interesting and preferred.People will have very differing opinions on this film. If you love it, I get it and if you think its garbage, I get it. Go watch it for some fun, it is hard to not have a laugh during the runtime, whether you are laughing with it or at it.C+ = 5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There's no doubt that the movie would be weak without his talent.The story itself is overall not hugely original but it provides many of the stereotypical superhero scenes that Marvel fans crave. After watching Moon Knight a couple of years later it becomes clear that they took a lot of the concepts from this film . In many ways Venom does not get credit for setting the stage for future Marvel productions.Hardy would be an excellent addition to the MCU if they manage to work him into the story with some other heroes likely to die facing Kang.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The cast is pretty good and there is a bit of humour all tho it's hit and miss and sometimes feels rather out of place. I was surprised that there was a few scenes where it was slightly more graphic than expected for the rating drop, However it definitely could have been a better representation of Venom if they went for a R rating and it very much feels like that was the original aim.My biggest issues with Venom are the completely overdone safe plot and that later fight scenes especially fast moving ones have a lot of motion blur and I found it pretty hard to follow, I could tell what was going on but the detail was completely lost to me.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story of the film is based on the Venom: Lethal Protector(1993) comic book, but many things from it was cut out to make a much more realistic story introducing the character. Journalist Eddie Brock is trying to take down Carlton Drake, the notorious and brilliant founder of the Life Foundation, who won't stop at anything to achieve his goal, even if it means to sacrifice people. While investigating one of Drake's experiments, Eddie's body merges with the alien symbiote Venom - leaving him with superhuman strength and power.Even though the film has a PG-13 rating, watching it makes you wonder whether the adult rating was intended in the first place, because some scenes draw a really thin line between the two ratings. Comic book lovers won't be disappointed with the look of symbiotes and some action scenes are impressive and interesting to follow. Also, the dark humor and Eddies interaction with Venom must be pointed out. Venom is not just a black costume with powers, it's a different personality living in the head and taking care of the host. What makes it special is that Tom Hardy made the voice of Venom and their conversation feels real due to pre-recorded voice over which was used on set.Unfortunately, nothing much can be added to the advantages of the film above. The film has many problems starting with a poor script and ending with a temp of storytelling. Characters are written to be plain, without any depth and development. Even understanding the writers idea to prepare the viewer for symbiote appear, first act of the film some may find boring and excessive.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the comics, he's a reporter with a grudge against Spider-Man who forms a union with a morphing alien ""symbiote"" that shares his hatred of the Webbed Wonder. Together, they're ""Venom"", at first a wrathful villain and later a monstrous anti-hero who protects the marginalized in NYC.Unfortunately, this film is way too vanilla -- and too goofy -- to do the Venom character justice. Part of that is the PG-13 rating, which kicks into high gear anytime a character would plausibly drop an f-bomb but says a lesser expletive instead. More importantly, it results in painfully obvious cutaways whenever the alien symbiote gets a hankering for human flesh (and heads).The other issue is the humor, which is now a certifiable part of the Marvel Movie Formula. When the alien starts talking to Brock and cracking jokes, making fun of his love life, and being forcefully ironic at ""hilariously inopportune"" times, I just had to shake my head. The comic books had it right, where the creature knew Brock's innermost fears, secrets, and desires, and would sometimes manipulate him or lead him towards questionable actions. Instead, what we have here is Deadpool-lite in alien form, all silly jokes and goofball humor when real gravitas is called for. Like many superhero movies, this one is ashamed of its source material and so feels it must cloak it with humor. That works in Thor: Ragnarok, but it's facile here.The movie's story is also too rote, too standard, too vanilla. It's loosely based on some of the comics from the 90s, but it's so un-involving; you'll see all the barely curved ""twists"" coming a mile away. It's hardly compelling, mostly acting as the glue for the action setpieces which unfortunately don't last long enough. I wish this film was crazier, more bombastic, even stupidly so like the first (and only watchable) Michael Bay Transformers movie. The plot of ""Venom"" is also suspiciously similar to 2008's ""Incredible Hulk"" with Edward Norton.The acting is decidedly average. There isn't much to Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock, a plain-jane everyman whose supermodel good looks never allow him to look as disheveled as his character is supposed to be. Michelle Williams is boring as Brock's ex, on whom is he is fixated, and Riz Ahmed is one of the most dull villains I've seen on screen in awhile. Edit all of his scenes and put them in a supercut on YouTube; you'll cure someone's insomnia.I'm a Venom fan, who reads Venom comics and just wanted a fun, bloody good time with bone-tearing symbiote action. Unfortunately this movie was too tame, and too un-interesting, to be the kind of turn-off-your-brain popcorn flick it wanted to be.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There's thousands of movies that start out with 'successful guy loses everything and is sad about it and then something life-changing happens.' It's not a bad start of the movie, it's just not special. However, about half an hour into the movie, the true magic begins.The main reason for this is Tom Hardy. I know he's is not going to receive an oscar for his performance in this movie - it's just not that kind of movie and we all know it, but boy, does he deserve one. The acting in this movie is one of the best I have seen in any Marvel movie, especially because this is one of the most complex characters to portray. I'm glad the writers of this movie started out slow and took their time to guide us through the struggle and the confusion Eddie feels at first. Yes, it starts slow, but it's not boring for a second.The only thing I wish was different about the movie is that the creators decided to make it PG-13 and not R-rated. A little more blood and swearing never hurt anyone, especially not in a setting like this. The after credit scene was on point, though. I'm already craving a sequel as much as Venom craves to eat people's faces off.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm not well versed in spiderman/venom storylines from the comics so it's just a take on the movie from someone wanting to see a decent superhero flick with action and laughs.This movie barely delivered on the laughs and couldn't even scrap together any memorable action scenes. Venom's awful storytelling definitely begins with the incoherent and messy script, with multiple plot lines leading nowhere and a villain that challenges the cheesiness of phase 1 marvel villains in blandness and forgettable lines.Tom hardy as Eddie Brock seemed to be the only redeeming quality in this movie, using his natural charm and persona to interact with the venom creature in a meaningful way. However, his initial backstory as a news reporter was told in a matter of minutes at the beginning of the movie as a series of montages. Same thing with his relationship, quick few scenes and BOOM cut to 6 months later after everything goes downhill for Eddie. The movie spends roughly 30 minutes on 2 absolutely useless plot points involving symbiotes, adding nothing to the story and dragging it down even further.The jokes were a hit and miss, but a lot of them just came down to 'the venom symbiote is talking funny in Eddie's head teehee!'. The comedy was one of the better aspects of the movie in terms of enjoyment.The action? wow, it was downright handheld garbage for a good 80% of it. The character of venom looked pretty good most of the time, and big fans of him will be pleased to see his CGI on screen. The issue is 2 of the bigger fights involving venom fighting the villain and his goons of course take place at night and are barely lit enough to gain a coherent visual on the action. Venom absorbs heaps of bullets and damage and leaves Eddie without a scratch, yippee. The final fight played basically like Black Panther's final fight in terms of being a forgettable, dimly lit mess with no memorable action.I'll try not to spoil anything, but the movie basically boils down to ' bad man wants bad thing to happen to earth, but good man who make past mistake try to stop bad man because he bad!'. No subtle underlying themes or messages. I'm not asking for Kubrick levels of subliminal messaging, but the story had no substance to offer whatsoever, except for a hamfisted relationship that's been played out to ensure the audience connects romantically to the movie, which of course adds nothing to the already barren story.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm not sure about the writing. In any case everything else just came together well, and, thankfully, there was a bit of humour in the movie that wasn't hamfisted and lame, which helped take the movie from a ridiculous place into somewhere enjoyable.Its good enough that I still can't believe this was a Marvel film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"4","/10","An utter crap fest that is boring and disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4388286/?ref_=tt_urv","felix-wyderka","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57321744/?ref_=tt_urv","9 October 2018","When I went to see this movie I was worried I might waste time and alas I cannot easy your mind a little. The movie is just as bad as many critics have been reporting.
Before I start I want to say that the only the reason I gave the movie a more than three-out-of-ten rating are considerable acting efforts of Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed who raise the movie's quality from completely unwatchable to at least a little entertaining.
I believe we have been spoiled by Marvel with many great movies over the years. This one is a certain misfire. It lacks the stability and excitement we usually find in a Marvel production and it mostly lives off of it's great acting performances. 
The movie starts with a scene of a crashing space ship. On board this space ship are the so called ""Symbionites"" (which by the terms definition is wrong). These creatures search a host and essentially connect with them so they can survive. 
That is exactly what happens to investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). The Symbiote connecting to him is called Venom and once the two find each other the wreaking havoc starts. 
This is a very short description of the plot of the movie and basically that is all that you have to know. There is rarely something exciting happening in Venom. 
Before we get to the aforementioned connection between man and alien we have to wait a bout an hour. Before that there is a fairly boring plot that explains next to nothing about the creatures or the reason they are on earth. 
Unfortunately the second hour is not much more interesting than the first one. 
There a few well made scenes when Eddie fights the bad guys from the so called Life Coporation. But that is most of the action you get. 
This year we have seen a few action with many great chases. The best by far is the motorcycle chase in Mission Impossible: Fallout. There is a motorcycle chase in the second half of the movie as well but is so dull it make Tom Cruise cry in shame.
A thing that Marvel usually does particularly well is choosing their villains. This time however it was a swing and a miss. 
While Riz Ahemds villain Carlton Drake is a complete ass he is neither threatening nor scary. In most Marvel movies while you can relate to the villain you still hate them. This is not the case here mostly due to the fact that Venom is a kind of villain himself and seems ay more threatening than Drake.
While the action scenes are a positive aspect of the movie there is one in particular that fails to hold up the standard.
In the end of the movie, when Venom fights another Symbionite, the fight is utterly boring. I have never seen a fight in a movie as bad as this one in all my life. 
Apart from the scene just taking three minutes, instead of the usual ten, there also is a total lack of creativity. Often in this kind of movies the final fight sequence offers us some creative new ways to make the scene more exciting. This is not the case here. The two participants just hit each other a few times and then before the fight even really started it is done. It simply was a complete disappointment. 
The thing that surprised me the most however was the lack of humor in this movie. Granted Venom is a dark character and it hard to laugh about man-eating, parasitic alien that threatens to wipe out humanity but usually Marvel still managed to make the audience chuckle. In Venom there is a complete lack of humor and when the movie tries to be funny it usually just feels more awkward than funny.
But luckily Venom isn't all bad. There were some good choices that Marvel made. 
Those choices were mostly made in the casting department. 
Hiring three respected and popular actors was a good choice. 
The most exciting performance in the movie was of course the one by Michelle Williams. She is a widely under appreciated actress and one of the best of our time. I cannot remember the last time she had to work so hard to make her character likable and authentic. But nevertheless she does it perfectly. 
Williams had a difficult job making an utterly uninteresting character interesting enough so we care about her. She managed to hold her ground against a totally screwed up script and steals every scene she's in. 
Riz Ahmed had it a little easier. While his bad guy Carlton Drake is not as threatening and unlikable as he should have been Ahmed still manages to bring out the ass persona in the character. 
Other than his two co-stars Hardy seems lost in the role. But while he does his best in this thankless role what he does is neither here nor there and his talent is wasted in this film. We get flashes of his considerable acting skills in the beginning of the movie but the longer the movie goes the more lost and bored Hardy seems to be. 
One thing that I was pleasantly surprised about was some of the production design. The Life Corporation head quarters were designed with precision and an idea. They look so authentic that one might think the set actually existed somewhere in the world. 
I also enjoyed some beautiful shots of the San Francisco skyline and harbor. 
In conclusion I must say that Venom is a complete crap fest that makes too many bad choices for it to be a good movie. If you plan to spend money on seeing it, I strongly advise you not top do it. It's not worth it. This one of those movies that you will catch on cable some day and that you will forget about as soon as you leave the couch.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And when I see Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, Venom's alter ego, it makes me feel happy, contented and as fuzzy as the symbiote. In the comics, Eddie Brock is a character that is a bit of an outcast, is unsure of himself and gets even more confused (initially) when Venom entered his life, and Tom Hardy channels Eddie Brock to perfection!!! Venom in the comics had some dark-ish humour, and the humour that Venom spouts in the movie is spot on - in fact Venom gets the best one liners. And the biggest laughs from the audience. The movie portrays a beautiful symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom, and shows progression in their relationship throughout the movie. The CGI for Venom is also spot on, making him a highly flexible and versatile character with the symbiotic extensions doing some cool stunts. It makes Venom look cool and dangerous at the same time. The pacing is just right, and Tom Hardy's versatility as an actor really stole the show, so much so that this would work even if this was a one man show. And the post-credit sneak preview is ""one to die for"" - I DEFINITELY want to see the next Venom - it'll be CGI carnage...Peeps, forget the previous incarnation of Venom, this is the REAL deal. Possibly the best movie I've seen in 2018 to date. Stuff the stuffy professional critics. They haven't had any clue for the past 25 years and are no longer credible sources for good movies - much like the fake news. Go watch Venom.

The classic superhero movie as we love it is not about action. Not about super fancy special effects. And not a comedy. It is about an under dog standing up for what is right. It is about the hero we all wished we were. And about the hero we all can be everyday in whatever life we lead.

The movie may be enjoyable, with its entertaining scenes and dialogues, but it may not be satisfactory or sufficient. Still, it's not too boring.

Or watch it - what do I care? haha All I know is I waited for months to see this movie and was cautious of the hype both for and against it. Well, I have to say, it was way worse than I ever expected. Tom Hardy, normally such a great actor, seemed like a first quarter drama student. Riz Ahmed & Michelle Williams are both great too - but not here. Williams was phoning it in from frame one. There's no real reason for the carnage that ensues either - it's all just big dumb, loud and graphic. It would have been a hit in about 1993, but today - I'm sorry - it flat out SUCKS. Three stars just cuz it's kinda fun to see a character I grew up with and frankly, he does look pretty good in a few scenes - not many, but a few. And the whole ""not in the MCU"" thing - that's just the cherry on top.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

First issue is the actor Tom Hardy does not have a clue about comic books 0 he does not care mainly he did it for his son and money so starting there you have an actor with 0 passion and that is not giving anything for this movie to be successful, rest of the cast is non existent, CGI is the worst ever, the director have to be demoted to direct 2 minutes shorts in you tube.Last but not least they blew it again by not doing an R rated movie! Venom should be different to anyone else but the only thing they did was to do a very bad copy of a super hero movie from the '90. Don't watch the movie or you will feel sick from all the Venom a bad move like this has.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't think it was a great idea coming up with a Venom solo movie and didn't have any expectations on this, but it still disappointed me.
The move is an alien invasion movie with the character's name on it and some similarities, but nothing to do really...
Not only is not faithful to the comic (which I don't mind really) but it has stupid characters, ridiculous situations, bad acting, silly story, cliches... it has it all ...to be a mess!!
I'm only giving it this rating because of the final fight scene, it's the only decent scene in the movie, even if it's not even anything new or great.
Want to see Venom? Go watch Raimi's Spiderman 3, it has it's flaws, but it's definitely a better movie and better adaptation of the comic book character.

I was skeptical because of the reviews. I have to start by quoting CinemaSins: ""the books, or comic books, does not matter!"" I won't go into details as towards why, but the summary is that they don't matter because movies try to reinvent, reinterpret, or sum them up. Movies don't have enough time, let's put it simple.So Eddie Brock (wannabe Pokémon master, lol,) is a ""looking-for-the-truth-at-all-time"" type of reporter. He is always looking for the ultimate slip by big evil companies. He gets the big-shot opportunity to interview Carlton Drake, leader of Life Foundation, whom Eddie distrusts. Life Foundation is secretly trying to find ""something"" in outerspace to augment humans to live in other planets, which leads them to slip onto the extraterrestrial Symbiotes.One problem is evident from the main plot: the movie does not develop Eddie enough so we sympatize. When Eddie messup big time, it feels like he did it out of selfishness rather than trying to help the others as he and the movie implies.The movie really begins when Eddie is possessed by the Symbiote called Venom, which I always thought it is stupid, why would an extraterrestrial lifeform call himself Venom or Riot; how would they know English? Whatever. Well, Venom possesses Eddie in search of a strong host. At first, Venom just wants to consume everybody in the world; later, he simpitizes with Eddie, I don't know why for sure.Then, of course, we have Venom wanting to save the world for reasons.The movie is not terrible like some people mentioned. I guess it is just out of place. The puns and humor touches are actually enjoyable. CGI is meh. This movie is just not up to the most recent Marvel movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is fun and entertaining with great character quirks but there's a very noticable lack of emotional connection most of the time. You don't get to understand the characters much or why they make the decisions they make. 30 more minutes run time in order to develop the story wouldn't have hurt. This is a fun movie and if you're going to watch it with a critical eye regarding script writing and story telling you will most likely not enjoy the ride as much as I did. Tom Hardy steals the show and I found myself forgiving the movie for it faults at the end because the things it did great, it absolutely nailed. It almost felt like a mixture between a movie aimed towards chinese audiances and western audiances. I suppose it was just the right mix for my taste buds.I recommend this movie if you're out to get some dumb fun entertainment with badass visuals.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Usually I just rate movies. I'm writing a review for this one not because its my fav movie of all time (its not), but because I feel the critic ratings are way off. Most give a rating equivalent to terrible, but I throughly enjoyed this movie. The comedic elements were great and made the movie that much better. I enjoyed the storyline (I don't know much about venom from the comics so i don't know how that compares). The action scenes were well done and the music fit the vibe of the movie. Now, Do I feel the movie could of been even better if it was rated R definitely, but i think this is a good start and I look forward to the sequel. Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams on screen chemistry had me a lil concerned at the beginning of the film but by the end I really liked how well they meshed together. Lastly, I'll say the only movie comparable to this one in style out right now is Predator and let me tell you it's pretty terrible.

Even a kick ass car chase scene that I wasn't really expecting. Didn't really care for the San Francisco angle, but I suppose if they were going to keep it separate from the other super hero movies they would need it as far from the big apple as possible.Glad I stayed passed the credits.

Tom Hardy was an amazing choice for the role of Eddie Brock and he really shows why he was chosen to play the part throughout the film. Plenty of humor which pleasently blends with the darkish undertones of the story. This movie is a true spectical for the eye and is easily one of the most enjoyable Marvel movies alongside the Avengers and Spiderman alike. You will get more than you bargained for! A must see indeed!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I love how Venom/Eddie Brock were the main heroes of the story.I always like how Spider-Man wasn't in the movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, but, let's be honest. If Spider-Man was in the movie. He would have ruined Eddie's career and Eddie would have bonded with Venom just to have his revenge. And that would make this movie about a villain being the protagonist against the hero which is the antagonist. And that would just be wrong on so many levels.But anyhow, I love the movie so much because they treated Venom has the hero. And that was pretty awesome to see. So, I obviously have to give it 10/10 for the whole entire movie! Hope you agree!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is embarassing! The first third of this film plods a bit, but from the scene where Venom first speaks onwards, it is a riot. Funny, great designs on the character, silly, dark, thoroughly entertaining. I don't know why the critics are still in employment. I think any film that ends up having you rooting for a fangy, demonic, head eating, psychotic alien symbiote has to be on to a winner. A few lines fell flat, but aside from the slow opening, this flick is a riot. Good acting from Tom Hardy too.

"10","/10","The reason this movie is brilliant is the reason purists and critics don't like it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4494664/?ref_=tt_urv","nikhildmahadeva","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96020335/?ref_=tt_urv","4 December 2018","People bemoan the abscence of Spiderman, the abscence of Venoms core personality traits - his obsession with Spiderman as a host, and his uncontrollable bloodlust from the influence of his previous hosts. The movie isn't sticking to the story of Venom as found in the comics.Now, I love the comics. I really do. But frankly, these traits were also the most dull part of Venom - every story, he gets better, fights the bloodlust (or gets reset), reaches some kind of balance, and then bam. He's an obsessive, homicidal maniac again. It's a tired cycle. This movie on the other hand, is a refreshing, dark humor approach to the beloved Kyntar that frankly fits perfectly into the marvel universe as it is now.Tom Hardy's portrayal of Eddie Brock, the imperfect person that he is, and Venom actually showing the productive relationship that his race is technically intended to have is the perfect setting for an antihero of this kind, and frankly, the kind of anti hero that should be in the MCU (Too bad this is a separate universe). Comics get retconned all the time. Consider this a retcon that makes Venom a stronger standalone character, rather than having to lean on Spiderman all the time for his pathos.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A great movie from the Marvel Universe","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4407406/?ref_=tt_urv","MihaiSorinToma","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16488747/?ref_=tt_urv","19 October 2018","After a failed interview with a very famous and wealthy figure involved in space research, Eddie Brock loses almost everything he had and worked for. As a result, his life is turned completely upside-down. But, as he gets infected with an unknown parasite which grant him superhuman powers, he finds out that there is an even greater power which threatens the human species. With his new powers but also new ""friend"" inside him, Eddie will have to do his best to change his egocentric behaviour which brought him into this mess and do what is best for him and for humanity alike.It's a quite impressive movie which presents investigation reporter Eddie Brock, his personality and his new form after his gets infected. We follow his evolution as he slowly figures out what went so wrong with his life and begins to try and repair what is left. Venom's character and look also play a very important role in the story, as he is responsible for plenty of action, laughter but also emotion.The plot presented is quite good. It brings a good idea (that of symbiotes) and builds up a good intrigue based on it. The characters portrayed are complex, likeable and well played by their actors, making the experience worthwhile. It brings action, drama, emotion and suspense through impressive visual effects, so another plus from this side. It also manages to not be predictable, although the main story tents to be quite linear, without anything out of the ordinary in terms or twists.There isn't much not to like if you ask me. As long as you go with the story and accept its fantastic premise, you're about to have a very good time. You may find some aspects quite exaggerated or a bit illogical but as far as I'm concerned, they fit into the fantastic setting that the movie proposes.Overall, I saw a very good movie in every aspect, with a good plot, good actors, plenty of action and special effects and also with a good dose of unpredictability. It gets a clear recommendation from my side.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was in it from the beginning, no bad moments at all and suddenly it was all over. Great ending too. Makes you eager to watch Venom 2.Tom Hardy does great as Venom. If you can't stand jokes in a superhero flick stay away from this. The spiderman flicks did had funny situations and the Deadpool franchise was over the top of jokes, this is in between. Because the 'parasite' do talk to Tom it makes it all great. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of fighting going on and that is really nasty, no jokes there.Better than expected, Venom is really worth seeing.

"10","/10","A movie for people who love Venom, not people who hate movies.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4396721/?ref_=tt_urv","bretthohenwarter","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur93883868/?ref_=tt_urv","14 October 2018","It took me a long while to put into words exactly who the audience for this movie is. It's not for kids, because it's just a little too dark, and it's definitely not for the 30+ movie-goer who's never heard of Venom before (but LOVES other Marvel movies). This movie is for fans of Venom who voted with their wallets, and definitely not the people who ""decide"" how well a movie deserves to do at free showings.That said, the movie brings a lot of elements to the table that leave you either leave you chuckling or pumping your fist in excitement. Hardy's delivery of Eddie is /supposed/ to be tacky, because Eddie isn't your normal, bad-ass super ""hero"" like in other Marvel movies. He's a reporter who's been infected by an other-worldly goo monster, and reacts how many people would: with fear of course, but also amazement, from somebody who can't believe what's going on. Venom's quips are on key, the ways he interjects into Eddie's life are pitch perfect to the comics, and they're also perfectly portrayed as the badass creature that Venom is when the fists (and goo) start flying. The plot doesn't try too hard because that's not what fans need. There are enough deep, amazing arcs in the comics for Venom to be explored; we just wanted to see Venom rip it up in his usual style, and this movie delivers. Little vignettes that show fans that the makers of this film know their subject material very, very well, and want us to feel good for knowing it, too. I don't want to spoil anything, but I can guarantee that fans of the character are going to have a blast with this movie.The problem with everything I said there is very obvious. If you're a movie critic, odds are your entire life (I mean, it has to be?) is centred around watching film after film, with no room for fandoms or other time-demanding hobbies like comics. You don't have time to invest in something as deep as Venom. He's an admittedly B-rate villain with his own convoluted arcs and lore, which is obviously less accessible than someone mainstream like Spider-Man or The Avengers, but one with his own charm that can't be found elsewhere. All critics have time for is watching a movie when it comes out, writing notes as it plays and missing the point of certain deliveries entirely. They are paid to hate movies, picking out every little irrelevant detail because they aren't even watching the movie for themeslves; they're watching it for money. It sounds conceited to say, but critics just aren't in the loop with this one, and it's not fair to the movie itself.Critics seemed to expect the usual easy-to-digest Marvel $300million suck-fest, with very clear goodguy/badguy roles, designed to rake in as many non-comic-nerd people as possible with shallow story telling, huge action sequences, and set pieces to make the kids freak out about the new merchandise at WalMart.Venom is not for those people. People have been wanting/trying to make a Venom movie since 1997, and fans (fan is putting it lightly) of the character like myself have been waiting so patiently for our chance to see the Lethal Protector in screen. My score? 10/10. The risk payed off, and I know many fans who have gone back for third or fourth viewings. The producers knew exactly who was going to see a film about Venom, so they made this for them as an apology for taking so long. The sequel villain reveal in the credit sequences? A beautiful mixture of ""no they didn't actually"", ""oh man that's so perfect!"" and ""what is even happening?!!"" burst out in the theatre, which tied up the whole movie with a beautiful ribbon. Similarly to how Neill Blomkamp made Chappie as an apology to fans for the absolute train wreck that was Elysium (spoiler alert, critics liked it but Neill fans didn't), Venom was made for people who love Venom, not people who hate movies as a job. Go see it if you can suspend your disbelief for a moment and really sink your teeth into something designed to make you laugh, but have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Personally, I loved it. I thought that the last fight scene felt a little rushed, but other than that the movie had a great plot and some pretty good supporting characters. Some critics are saying that the movie needs spider-man, but I never once though of that wail watching the movie. I thought it was a great movie on its own. I would definitely see a second one in theaters, and the director set up the after credit scene to give access to a second film. The movie is so far doing great in the box office an I expect it to continue bringing in money for quite a while. If your into a darker toned movie with heroes or aliens, you will like it. A small touch that I like is how comedic several of the scenes are, and they are always in the right spot.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Other than take no notice to what others are saying about this being a flop, go and see it for yourself, make your own mind up and you'll realize that it's another great Marvel movie. Takes about 30-35mins for the action to kick in (Eddie and the symbiote to join forces) but when it does and the creation of Venom happens, it's non-stop action there after. The special effects are out of this world and the banter between Eddie and Venom has some funny laughts. Again take no notice to what the boring so called movie buffs are saying about this being a flop, believe me if this was the case I would say so. Don't miss out get the the flicks and watch one of this years great Marvel movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I really liked it. It was a ton of fun and Tom Hardy was amazing. It doesn't have any of the bland checkboxes that MCU films have. Marvel is great, but it gets a little predictable in movie style. Venoms plot was not the best and the writing wasn't great either, but none of that mattered once Hardy came into contact with the symbiote. I would love to see this Venom take on the MCU. Or at least spiderman in a Maximum Carnage arc. Anyways, go see it, it was as good as 50% of MCU films.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Seriously, it's not nearly as bad as the critics made it seem. The movie is fun, entertaining and different from the past superhero movies. It has a lightness to it - almost like an early 2000s superheroe movie. I'm stil disappointed it was rated pg13, but you know what? It makes sense. 
The movie does have its flaws, like a weak and simplistic plot and slow-paced scenes, but quite honestly I couldn't care less. I was so into the whole Eddie/Venom saga that it just didn't matter. Tom Hardy did a great job and delivered some really good and funny scenes - intentionally or not. 
Maybe we all feel like every movie should follow Infinity War's steps now, and therefore become more serious? I don't know. But I was not demanding that from Venom and had a great time. And not for one minute I caught myself thinking ""I wish Spider-Man was in it"". It was all about Venom to me. Again, this movie is not your usual perfect superhero film - but it's way far from being horrible. Give Venom a chance!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The hero has to have his world continually crash down around him and remain a gentleman. Tick. The heroine has to have her heart broken, and often be shocked beyond any reason to forgive, and come up roses. Tick. The baddie has to maintain a veneer of control over increasingly diabolical circumstances challenging moralities all around him. Tick. It's a hard working movie. There is a lot of dialog. It's always fresh and witty. The dialog has to deal quickly with a new intruder. Tick. Is there humour? Plenty. So Venom succeeds as conventional theatre. From what I know of cgi and how its made my inexpert opinion is that this movie may represent something of a watershed moment in cinema, if not a technical apex. Recently I saw Terminator: Genesis and the particle graphics blew me away. Venom seems to go a step higher. The action is tremendous, a car chase so awesome you'll grip your armrests, and battles right at the outer edge of imagination. And all done so vividly well! From any point of view then, Venom is ten big ticks from me.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was very well articulated and picturised. Theme of movie stand up to ensure it does off the track. VFX at it best and all character were able to do justice with story running behind introducing this character.
If get thrilled watching fictional characters then this must watch and I feel it's beginning of Venor movie series which will eventually show competency with other fictional characters in Hollywood movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the critics review. However, the IMDB reviews were pretty good so we gave it a shot. We weren't disappointed. Tom Hardy was AWESOME, the comical moments were hilarious. My just turned 12 year old daughter also loved it and laughed through much of the show, especially once the action started.....and didn't stop. Of course, she has a wonderful sense of humor and gets most jokes. The violence wasn't gory or graphic, almost comical in some instances. For us, this show had the right amount of action, comedy, and absolute entertainment. It was just FUN!All in all, it was a wonderful experience at the theatre, totally satisfied. I hope they make a sequel with Woody Harrelson (he'd make a great bad guy!!), another one of my favorite actors, along with Tom Hardy.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The numbers don't lie! (take note Kathleen Kennedy!) Venom is a hoot!
Yes it's a bit slow to get going, as often origin films are, but it's a good story and everything comes together well.
Tom Hardy is brilliant as both Eddie Brock and Venom as is his nemesis Riz Ahmed.
It's Dark and yet humorous, as expected from these kind of superhero movies the effects are superb and I had tremendous fun watching it.

LOVED IT, the relationship between Eddie and Venom was really well done they literally fed off each other. Tom hardy was fantastic and acted his little heart out. Bit of humour as always but not enough to turn it into a comedy show your usual sarcastic comments and it still had its dark elements throughout. Story was good may of taken a little while for some to start but I think that times important as it gives you time to really invest in Eddie and his character before venoms introduced and it's worth it.

So I was really curious about watching Venom. Honestly, I am happy to say the movie didn't disappoint AT ALL! The fact that Sony is trying to start a new universe distant from MCU is probably the only thing that makes me think about the future of this and maybe the critics were in disbelief even though that's not an excuse about the low score they gave on this one. It was at least an OK movie and in my opinion more than ok. I would really love to see a Tom Hardy Venom/Tom Holland Spiderman crossover but I know it's not gonna happen. So that leaves us where? Will at some point Venom meet Spiderman? And if yes who is gonna play Spiderman?

Well it is! From comedy scenes, to action, to some crazy special effects, this movie has a little bit of everything and is definitely worth seeing in the theater if you can! The movie is about a alien species landing on Earth, they are called symbiotes. Most need a to connect to a host to survive, so what ends up happening (Avoiding Spoilers). One of the symbiotes ends up connecting with the main character Eddie Brock who happens to be reporter.
He ends up finding out about a man (Avoiding spoilers). Who runs illegal experiments on people for the sake of ""Science"". Eddie tries to take him down with the press but it ends up backfiring on him, which makes him lose everything. So with the symbiotes help he plans to take down the man and destroy the experiments he has been working on. Or so he hopes.
The special effects were phenomenal, there were a lot of action scenes that just wowed you or left you looking all around the screen to try to absorb every thing thrown at you at once. Although that may seem overwhelming at first it honestly doesn't. It's made by one of the most brilliant companies named Marvel, who is known for making some of the most spectacular super hero movies of all time. The acting also is played by good actors so nothing really seems corny or cheesy. The main character is played by legendary actor Tom Hardy who is known for many of his parts in movies such as, The Revenant, Dunkirk, and many more. Overall the movie is spectacular and is worth seeing if you haven't seen it already!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Why the hypocrisy? Admittedly, The Last Jedi was aesthetically better, but it was buried by a mountain of flaws. Venom was a much better overall film which easily overcame its flaws. Perhaps Sony should learn from Disney on how to pamper (i.e. Bribe) these paid critics. But I digress.Venom was Sony's answer to Deadpool. Though not as graphic as the R-rated Deadpool, Venom still succeeded with its cast, story and humor. Given the negative reviews by critics and my doubts that a movie about a blob from outer space could be any good, I had low expectations. But Venom easily won me over.Key to Venom's success was the performance of its lead actor Tom Hardy. In this fast-pace, action-filled, CGI-heavy film, Hardy managed to add realism to it in his grounded portrayal of Eddie Brock. His performance brought empathy and likability to his character. Caring about the protagonist is essential in any story, especially one that's been told before.Strengthening this film was the addition of Riz Ahmed (Nightcrawler and Rogue One). Ahmed is a talented actor who managed to turn what must've been meant to be a two-dimensional character into something more believable. Along with a strong cast, Venom had a clever script, a good story, and tense action sequences.There's even a catchy song by Eminem written specifically for Venom. This was a refreshing surprise. Up until this song, the closest thing we had to an original song for a Marvel film was The Foo Fighters' Walk for Thor in 2010. But that came from a previous album.The story might've seemed too familiar and might've reminded us of the cult-classic sci-fi film, The Hidden, or the more recent The Incredible Hulk, but Venom introduced enough new elements to justify its existence. And it would've been nice if the film had explained how Eddie Brock (and his girlfriend) could survive and co-exist with the symbiote while others could not. Also it would've been nice to see a more convincing explanation of Brock's quick transformation from a selfish, publicity hunter to a selfless humanitarian.Venom was refreshing change and a nice kick in the rear to the Marvel franchise. It's so good I didn't mind the cartoonish CGI Venom. But I would like to see this improved upon in the next film. I would also like to see the graphic violence turned up to Robocop level. I'd put Venom in the top 5 of all the Marvel films released this past decade.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first fifteen minutes is not as seamless as other Marvel offerings when it comes to the character introduction but when the pace picks up, one can't help but guffaw at the funny lines and the action scenes which even though not as original as expected, it still provides adrenaline rush to the viewer. Tom Hardy fits the "" sweet loser"" role to a T. The main cast also delivered good, only noticeable that Riz Ahmed seems to be typecasted to roles as young billionaires who have grand schemes in their heads. All in all, seeing Tom Hardy as the reporter Eddie with an internal symbiote forming inside of him, becoming him, anti-hero sort of hero character will kind of remind you of people you might see or even know, whose attention seems elsewhere and there's a dialogue with himself and another version of himself talking to each other.

Spiderman may have been a great plus to include in, but is not needed, at least for now.
The world around Eddie Brock and the characters around him are likeable, and the acting of the cast is very good. I really liked the relationship between Venom and Eddie. 
Tom Hardy makes you feel Eddie as a real person with flaws and virtues, and Michelle Williams' performance is always great to watch.
Of course this movie has flaws, probably because they wanted to apply some of the superhero movie formula that's being profitable for years... I hope they fix it in the next movie.
The FX give life to Venom as I expected, they're everywhere you look.
Please make the next movie R rated, in order to fullfill the promise they make in the post credit scene.
Go and watch this movie, you'll be pleased and have a good time. Yes, Venom is a Marvel character, but not a Marvel-Disney character, and that's a difference I enjoyed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The entrance set up the storyline. I thought the story, direction and screenplay was very good. Some movies just seem to have the superstar or star cast or even the super villain or hero and no story. This was not in the same category thankfully. I wanted venom to have more character/persona and mannerisms. More unruliness and unpredictability or pure rage is what would done so. Some parts were a little slow. The girl friend and her boyfriend parts were a bit of a distraction and maybe not so necessary but it was ""okay"" I guess. Better fight sequences with Venom/Riot in them would have been very much appreciated. Tom Hardy was good but Riz Ahmed was spectacular. After Nightcrawler this was another great performance. Wish there was more of Cletus Kasady. Cannot wait for the sequel.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is a Venom movie that fun filled with crazy action ride. I really like the relationship between Eddie and Venom, even though the story seemed messy, and there's some plot holes. Tom Hardy did a fantastic job, amazing as always. The film is completely different from the trailer -- much much better. And the mid credit scene make it even more better!It was quite fun, entertaining, thrilling film. I hope it was R rated but Sony decided to cut it down to a PG-13, for any potential tieins with the Spider-Man MCU. The action was cool but the villain is cliche and no surprise at all. It could've been alot better, but it's not terrible. Nothing really memorable except ""We are Venom"" part. There's no futher explanation for what happen with the villain and the lab.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film is brilliant and has to be one of the best marvel films I have watched this year. It took a while to get into, but once it does it's all go go go. In terms with the people complaining it has a lot of CGI, of course it does, how else are they going to make venom. The scene after the credits is not worth the wait, and if you're like me and not interested in the Spiderman into the spider verse then don't hang around. Overall a great film that I've watched twice and will watch again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It had some good action scenes, some good laughs, and a cool plot. There were a couple good fight scenes, but the two that stick out were the motorcycle chase scene, and the final battle. The motorcycle chase scene was a classic car chase scene, but it was still pretty cool. It felt more fast paced than some other car chase scenes, and I liked that. Also, the final battle was very cool. Venom Vs Riot, two huge powerful symbiotes fighting on a space ship was very cool to watch. This movie also had some good laughs. Venom is hilarious, especially when he and Eddie bicker. Finally, I personally liked the plot. I though it was unique, and interesting.

Physical comedy and situational comedy done right; many scenes that connect both characters symbiont and host as one while both are facing and fighting different demons. True to the Venom character I remember reading in comic books when I was a kid and Tom Hardy; who has his own style does well in the collaboration proving once again just what a chameleon he really is. Michelle Williams is a stand out serving her own brand of heroism and intelligence that feels believable and in no way makes you think of her previous roles. Great writing, directing and cinematography; again, at no point are you pulled out of the movie every shot you are right there with the characters trying to figure your way out.

I walked into the movie theatre thinking, there were 30% reviews, I didn't hear anything about the movie, honestly forgot I was gonna see it that day
and for some context, some RT (rotten tomatoes) reviews said, ""it should be R-rated"" or ""is this a comedy?""
back to those in a second
from the opening few minutes, I was like well here we go the cliche dark music to start, rushed through the opening sequence, non-impressive special effects, I even pulled my phone out 5 minutes in to check the running time which was 2 hours 20 minutes, at which point I mouthed ""damn iT""
so clearly I couldn't be more biased from the RT reviews I read a few minutes ago
as I start to watch, the comment about the movie that it should've been R-rated started to sound more and more true: ""damn imagine if venom destroying those ppl in the beginning were R-rated. wow this movie has such a lack of focus. what kind of audience are they trying to reel in, <=13yo? would've done wayyyyy better with R-rated elements.
I'm hating on this movie so hard. 
now let's skip to when Venom comes in. we're at the part where Eddy (main character) has become a host for the Venom (aka he's infected-ish). the part when he gets infected is kinda cliche which just made me even more angry, but I was somewhat excited to see how Venom plays out in Eddy's body.
A few minutes later he goes home and Eddy, looking at a mirror, suddenly shouts the word ""FOOD"" and scares himself into passing out. Eddy himself did not say this, but it was Venom, which lies in his body. I was like what the f, cuz his voice was in perfect adult English, complete with personality, and still monster-like.
Anyways Eddy and Venom end up having a relationship with each other. It starts off just animalistic from Venom's side as it tries to survive and stuff. But as the movie progresses, their conversations start to reflect that of a of friendship laced with banter, but tied by the need for both of them to survive (if Eddy dies, Venom dies).
Their interactions (especially with an English speaking Venom inside Eddy) start to become funnier and sometimes stupid. I laughed in the movie sometimes because scenes and dialogue were downright stupid, and sometimes because Venom is a real charm.
Anyways by the end I was genuinely sad that our time with Eddy and Venom was coming to a close and I was shocked that 2 hours and 20 minutes flew by so quickly.
comment on those RT reviews: I do agree there should be an R-rated version and it would be amazing, but this is just such a treat that I appreciated not passing up on. Also is this a comedy? I would say yes. Because I've learned one thing from watching movies. You enjoy a movie not because it's perfect (though it definitely could be), you enjoy it if you love at least *one* aspect of it. For Venom, everything was arguably trash, EXCEPT for Venom and Eddy.something I kept saying to myself in the middle was ""Venom is a *really* good Youtube-style movie"". like you know how there are some long movies that ppl upload on youtube. the quality and laughability of this movie reminds of something I'd see on youtube but is like 10-star at that level nomsayin. WATCH THIS please","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sure, it might have benefited from being R rated but oh well, its still a faithful representation of the Venom character. I love that Venom was being his normal goofy self, still trying to understand human behaviour and bond with his host. Equally good to see is his relationship with Eddie Brock portrayed correctly this time, Venom is a symbiote, not a parasite (something that Venom loves to remind people) and he simply wants to existand be as strong as possible while having some fun, he isn't really trying to hatch any cliché super-villian plans, he is just rebellious.Its a HELL of a lot better than that horrible version of Venom in the Toby McGuire era of Spiderman. This is the Venom I wanted to see.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Hardy and Venom trying to get along! That was pure fun!
The movie has laughter, actions, thrill ...all that a comic based movie needs! Venom is just how I imagined he would be! 
For me, the movie wasnt at all disappointing except for the little screen time given to Riot and the final fight (The fight was cool but was finished way sooner!)

I like some of them, but they never impressed me as much as another genres.
Until I watched Venom. I know, It's not basic comics, but I really start to love it! The plot is funny and quite gripping. I thought I watched it only 15 min when I realized it was 112'. I'm 100% sure that the best think on Venom (If I can say think :D) is Tom Hardy. People who maked this film really knew what's going on. I adore him at the other films and this one wasn't different. His humor, acting and calm face in various situations will make you laugh. I just need to add that I watched Venom 2 times seccessive. Big goal with comics for me.

I never review movies. I do not do this, I do not see a point to this, and I do not think the effort is worth it. That being said, this movie has been done so dirty by movie critics that it is my patriotic duty as a gay person from the San Fran area to defend it. 
The primary problem with this movie is that it leads you to believe it's an action movie. It's not, that's a lie, accept it. Venom is not the big dumb action movie we deserved, it is the big dumb gay romcom that we needed. It is yet another blessing of 20gayteen. Tom Hardy's acting is stellar as usual. Some of the other actors are a bit too concerned about the events of the movie to fully channel San Fran but that's alright. Venom was always going to be a difficult character to translate to the big screen, but overall they did a pretty bang-up job. 
Also, any movie critics who say that Venom is ""in desperate need of a stronger attachment to Spider-Man"" need to read the actual comics because Eddie and the symbiote are married. They have a kid. Fake nerd boys are always getting everything wrong. 
I would also like to add that the CGI in this movie was incredible. Serious kudos. How long did that take?
TL;DR Venom was gay- I mean great- and fabulous, movie critics need to shut up and actually judge movies on the proper criteria, and the most unrealistic part of this was that people in San Fransisco would allow big pharma to move in and sign up for clinical trials.

Lots of action. Lots and lots of action, but not so much that the characters and story were compromised. We have Eddie Brock, who is a genuinely good guy by nature. He butters his bread as a reporter who tells the truth and exposes corruption on many levels. This obviously, can be a dangerous thing. When the situation becomes one where telling the truth is a conflict of interest to his own livelihood.. he chooses truth and is broken by the fall out.
I recognized early on that Brock was not TOO smart, TOO strong, or TOO talented at .. well .. anything. He is a regular person like us. Just doing the best he can.This is where it becomes interesting: Venom is so much like Brock. He shares the same lack of control over his impulses. He considers himself a ""loser"". He encourages Brock to pursue his ex 'fiancee (Williams) so you see Venom as a sort of hopeless romantic as well. He can lack confidence ( ""zero percent chance"" to defeat Riot) Symbiosis becomes quite a positive thing - you're not left feeling that Eddie Brock has been possessed or hijacked.Sign me up to see the sequel now! The perfect actor for the villain part has been cast.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Hardy plays it very well, really likeable as Brock and the buddy-buddy commentary with Venom is excellent and he's done a really good job of voicing both.
The CGI for Venom itself really has borrowed a lot from the Darkness games/comics and to good effect, the dark beast is menacing and you believe it really does have some incredibly strength and power behind it.On to the actual story - well it is fairly straight forward and run of the mill but it works well and there's no clock checking boredom during action scene downtime that can happen with other superhero films. It's no Lawrence Olivier production but for a dark super hero film it paces itself well and the humour levels are the correct balance compared to the comics . It does suffer with a rather quick battle conclusion which feels a bit 'quick' compared to the rest of the film.Other than that only minor gripes are some CGI on Venom looks a little strange but no stranger than say Hulk growing/shrinking in Thor Ragnarok and that it would have been better with a little more gore BUT I appreciate this opens it up to a larger audience so I'm all for that.A great, great film and I thoroughly recommend it, one I'll be picking up digitally post release myself for a rewatch.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong this movie couldve been even better but i was satisfied with what I got.Tom Hardy is the man for this rol and his acting is on spot.
Venom is amazing the relationship between him and Eddie Brock is top notch.
The plot for this origin story is quite interesting and better then what I expected.
The special effects are awesome especially when you see the transformations.Overall I highly recommend this movie and hopefully you dont buy into all of the critics non-sense , YES this movies is good and YES it is possible for a VENOM movie without Spider-man so YES go ahead and watch it and you wont be dissapointed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The action is great, the laughs are plentiful and the movie as a whole is a fantastic ride.Some of the positive sides of the movies are-
1. I am very much surprised by how much I liked this movie.
2. Humor in this movie is persistent from starting to end so it will make you laugh throughout the movie that you won't see any other DC,Marvel movie these days and which should be the most important aspect for a movie.
3. Best acting by Tom Hardy, He is most suitable hero for this character in every aspect.Best decision made by casting director for this movie.
4. All Action scenes are very crisp and clear , you will be able to see from landing of the punch to the people falling and shattering till they drop dead, which is not present these days in action sequences of the movies.Check this movie out for yourself and vote accordingly. This movie deserves that at the least.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sony rebooted Spiderman so many times that it's only natural for them to finally reboot that one sore spot left unattended: Venom. He is no longer remembered as black Spiderman with teeth played by the adequate Topher Grace. Rather, he will be remembered as was always intended: the gigantic musclebound black slimey creature with huge teeth that likes to snack on humans.Comic book nerds, rejoice! This is our Venom! For all of you that recalled Marvel's ""homecoming"" storyline post-Secret Wars, or remember reading and collecting Todd McFarlane's run on Amazing Spiderman, this is your Venom. This is what you've always wanted. Well, this film does not disappoint. While the film barely scratches the surface on the Venom origin and story, it sets up a good beginning that leaves us questioning if and how it will connect to the Sony Spiderman films (not even mentioning the connection that those films have to the Marvel Cinematic Universe but let's not get ahead of ourselves). Could there one day be a Tom Holland/Tom Hardy cross-over? Here's hoping, true believers!Overall, the story is a great, if a little rushed. If you recall the Venom comic book mini-series where he goes to San Francisco, becomes an Anti-Hero, and gets hunted by a nefarious tech company....that's this film in a nutshell. However, without giving too much away, it definitely makes some necessary changes in the adaptation to keep things exciting on the big screen. Let's make one thing perfectly clear though. This is not a child friendly film. There are no cutesy super hero origin stories here. No great powers with great responsibility memes. The world in which this film exists is cold, dark, gritty, and most definitely cruel. In this Venom film, people can, and will, exploit the innocent to achieve power. That is, ironically, one of the things that Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock, a no nonsense crack-shot investigative journalist, seeks to expose and ultimately to what he falls victim.Tom Hardy exudes his usual bravado and tough guy swagger, which works well because that's what Eddie Brock is all about. My only issue is that I would have liked to see a more involved role for the beautiful and ever graceful Michelle Williams. Her character is the string that keeps Eddie Brock's humanity intact so that the monster inside does not consume him, and yet she's also tragic in her own right. A little more screen time and some further development of her character would have been great.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Luckily, I spotted some online youtube reviews from regular joe's and the feedback was highly positive and peaked my interest again.I caught a 4pm screening as I had some time to waste, not expecting much from the movie due to the before mentioned ""highly respected"" critic reviews. I was almost expecting Venom to be another 2018 ""Predator"" pile of trash. I clutched my seat hoping I didn't waste $15.Needless to say. The critics have no idea what is good honest entertainment anymore. Venom is fun. Enjoyable. Tom Hardy does a great job again delivering a character that is rounded. Someone I want to invest my time in and want to follow his journey. I couldn't help but smile at the father and his son sitting a few seats away from me, as the young boy laughed and tried to imitate Venoms voice. He was enthralled, amazed, laughing and loving his time with the movie. I could almost say his enjoyment was infectious, and I enjoyed the movie more because of some little kid having the time of his life. Very much relieved and surprised by the film. PS. I used to be a big fan of the Spiderman / Venom comics and animated series and am not phased by this new origin story for venom. I like that he is an antihero hero... if that makes sense. 8/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was a great romp!I never went to see this in the theater in part because of the bad reviews and having seen it now, I'm very disappointed I didn't listen to my gut and go see it in the theater anyway.The story has a different take on Venom's origin than the comics do. Normally, I dislike too much variation from the original story line but this new version is definitely an exception and is really fantastic in my opinion. It fits great into the two-hour movie format, it makes Venom more relatable, and it still manages to grasp the essence of the character.Lots of reviews are wishing for an R rating, presumably to bring out Deadpool levels of gore and language but I really don't think it's necessary here. Venom does some rather gruesome things and I don't see any problem keeping the gore down to the level that they did.There was a great balance between character development and good 'ole Venom action. The acting was excellent, the action and effects were very well done. The Venom visuals were very well depicted (yes even without the spider logo). In particular, I loved the personality they brought to the symbiote. The relationship between Eddie (a relatively good guy who's fallen on hard times) and the symbiote (a carnivorus creature with a lack of understanding of the value of human life) is a fascinating juxtaposition and most of the time it's just plain fun!If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and see it now!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Plot was a bit obvious at points however what superhero movies aren't after so many being made. The side charcters were a bit forgettable but this is an intro to character movie so the main point is letting the viewer see who they are going to the movie to see, as well as let us know what this version of the character is going to be like. The interactions between the two main characters (Venom and Brock ) were great, I do hope that now the character has been flushed out a bit the next movie contains a little more depth. Can't wait for a sequel.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Nicely done in all areas and humour included.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4404437/?ref_=tt_urv","johnyskar","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23456650/?ref_=tt_urv","18 October 2018","So are we Venom after all? You bet we are. Spiderman is my favorite Superhero character and Venom is the best Villain/Anti-Hero because they have common ground. You know who else is also great because of that? A guy like Venom but red and more crazy, but more on that later. So Venom and Eddie stood up to their own standalone movie and delivered. With the merging of the studios with Disney i don't know how much is Marvel contributing to these movies(Venom, X-Men, Deadpool etc) in comparison to their pure Marvel in the Avengers Universe but the result is a serious movie with a main character who is relatable, strong, kind of a loser and some times pretty funny.Now like most of us, i of course know the Venom character for many videogames and Cartoons but i have not read the old comics that the movie is built on. So i found the different approach alien-ating(wink wink) at first, but got in the mood pretty fast eventually!
Because you know Eddie is the jackass enemy of Peter Parker as Venom is to Spiderman and here he is a likeable guy. He actually reminded me of Spidey with the bad luck in a combo with Hancock in an antihero manner. Anyway i think Michelle Williams's character Anne is kinda irritating unlike her female counterparts in Spidey's side but maybe she'll change later.The movie had an origin story that didn't drag out, some strong action scenes with great visuals and sounds and to my surprise various jokes and funny moments! If the movie was R rated it would probably touch the Deadpool lines of humour that would suit it's style but who knows. I would like if Venom had the Spiderman style with the spider symbol and swinging but i didn't mind at all. Only thing was at the end in the last fight scene that is kinda messy cause all of the CGI but i guess you can't avoid a minimum use of that in this type of movie. Great acting overall from Hardy, the dark role suits him and Venom is an awsome antihero after all! The movie rolls pretty easily and the time passes by enjoyably. Now that red guy i talked about earlier, will be represented by a Marvel-ous(ok enough with the puns) actor and will surely bring Carnage(last one ☺ ) in the second movie and i think he as an antagonist will elevate the whole thing to new limits! Cause you know who is just about crazy as Venom but even more? Cletus Kasady, as a human that is... Now imagine what Woody Harrelson will bring to the table with this persona and what result we will have with the combination of the Symbiot.✍ Great job, and what amplifies the movie's image even more are the reviews that brings you to the ground, because i think it was very good anyway, but when i went to watch it with low expectations today i found it even better than that. Will wait for the sequel with great interest and who knows, if Venom makes an appearance in another movie(cause sadly this didn't happen here with Spidey) that would be guaranteed fun. Maybe some reinforcements for Avengers? ;) 📝:9/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It had a lot of heart. Tom Hardy played his part well considering he was talking to himself mostly.

Much better than the critics are saying.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a shame alot of people disliked/hated this and gave it low ratings, and the amount of people who hated it ""just because others were too"" because it was a really fun film to sit through.Tom Hardy played his part great, his style of acting and from what i can only assume is improvisation in scenes made it even better. he is an absolute genius on screen.Movies plot wasn't anything huge but i think that helped, didn't throw too much to the audience, yes there was a few continuity errors but every single film in existence has them so people who judge a movie based on that need to wake up and accept nothings perfect.

Whilst you can see lots of elements borrowed from other marvel and superhero films, what actually stands out for me is the performance from Tom Hardy.Strangely I think Hardy's Acting ability is too often missed, because of his heart throb status. I was slightly worried to see him in a film like this , hoping that this wasn't just a tick box role, but the internal fight with his alter ego, resembled that of the struggles with some mental illness conditions and had a much more realistic tone in a fantasy world.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Ignore the pretentious critics - this is solidly entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5201944/?ref_=tt_urv","jimbo-53-186511","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26154754/?ref_=tt_urv","20 October 2019","Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) works as a journalist, but upon accidentally exposing some 'dirt' on a company called Life Foundation he decides to interview the CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). This all backfires on Eddie when his allegations are not backed up with proof and Brock is subsequently fired from his role. However, 6 months later he's given another chance to expose the truth about Drake's company when employee Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) decides to assist him in his investigations. But events take an unexpected turn when Brock falls victim to Drake's experiments and becomes Venom which ultimately puts Brock on a collision course with Drake himself...Despite Venom being a Marvel original film, in some ways the premise to this film reminded me of a film called Upgrade that I watched earlier this year (whereby both parties end up with some kind of AI which can control their thoughts and make them stronger). Scarily enough both of the main stars of each film bear an uncanny resemblance to one another which makes things all the more spooky.That being said, Venom is a very entertaining film with a likeable protagonist (Brock is a victim of circumstance rather than being a bad person) and therefore at no point did I take any sort of disliking to him. I felt Brock's struggle every step of the way (his initial resistant to Venom) is believable given his contrast in personality to Venom, but the film takes an interesting turn when Brock and Venom start to understand each other which is when a sort of surreal dynamic starts to evolve.Venom is a slow-burning film so you do have to be patient when waiting for the action to kick in; whilst the action sequences are never 'blow your mind' crazily brilliant they are good enough to hold your attention and I did find the action sequences to be satisfying and acted as a nice backdrop to the fairly decent origin story.Tom Hardy really needs no introduction having proved himself to be a very capable actor time and time again; here he is simply marvellous and doesn't put a foot wrong (he seems to be able to turn his hand to anything and I can't say enough good things about the man). Michelle Williams is good in support (and does prove pivotal in the second half of the film). Ahmed is good as the villain of the piece, but it's only these 3 players that make anything of the film.Venom is a very entertaining film as well as providing an interesting origin story and a strong performance by Tom Hardy. The film does have a light-hearted jokey feel to it (not surprising given it was directed by Ruben 'Zombieland and 30 Minutes or Less' Fleischer - incidentally I hated those 2 films and did not find them funny), but Fleischer seems to have got things right here (perhaps because the focus isn't all on comedy here - he's managed to fuse an original story and injected it with moments of comedy - mostly from Venom) and made it work. The end result (despite what the critics will have you believe) is something that is immensely watchable and thoroughly enjoyable.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

2021 or 2022 sequel announced.My favorite line in this movie: ""Goodbye Eddie.""Just watched it for a 2nd time. Loved it the first time; loved it even more the second time.I am shocked at the fact that despite the HORRENDOUS CASTING (except for Tom Hardy of course), the movie was still awesome. It must be thanks to everyone else who worked to make up for the cast's deficits.John Papsidera, CSA - during the credits at 1:33:50 it says casting was done by this guy. So this guy is the man guilty for casting the wrong people for this movie (the female supporting actress and the villain specifically). If it was not for the CGI, cinematography, screenplay, plot, and Tom Hardy, this unforgivable casting mishap could have caused the whole film to fail.Tom Hardy (the protagonist) - this guy made up for all the bad acting in this film. He did a great job acting.Michelle Williams (the female supporting actress) - I have NEVER seen a worst female supporting actress as bad as this woman. Worst acting ever. Definitely wrong actress for this role. Maybe all the good actresses out there were busy with other films and turned down the role; this must have been the case to go with this so-called ""actress.""Riz Ahmed (the antagonist) - very poor acting overall; very underwhelming. Cannot believe this guy was casted as the main villain.Jenny Slate (the scientist) - she did good.
Reid Scott (the MD) - he did fine.
Scott Haze (head of security) - he did fine.CGI and special effects: excellent; lovely. Loved Venom all the way. His voice too. Awesome fighting scenes especially the final fight. I mean I re-watched the 86th minute of this film at least TEN TIMES. The orchestra was excellent in this minute.Cinematography: great; no complaints.Plot: simple and sweet. No complaints.Conclusion: simple and sweet plot; awesome special effects and CGI; great cinematography; great final battle; good ending; great character development of the protagonist and venom. Tom Hardy was excellent as the protagonist; however, Michelle Williams was the worst possible ""actress"" for the female supporting actress, and Riz Ahmed was a very poor choice as the movie's villain. Despite the poor casting choices, the film's finale was so well done that it made me overlook the poor casting choices and made me love the movie a lot.10/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm a hardcore action movie fan and although this movie is full of CGI, I mean he is a tar looking alien ""parasite"" (sorry venom), I did enjoy the brutalness of the group fights.
 However, this may be a weird statement but I would've preferred the movie to be R rated, for more brutal action scenes and darker humour but that doesn't stop me from loving this movie.

What it is is pure escapism. It's about time a movie was just fun and made to be enjoyed not pyshco analysed and more concerned with diversity than action (don't get me wrong it's good to be diverse but at the sake of content? That's another thought for another review?).I cannot believe the critics lavished praise on Black Panther and The Last Jedi, yet slated this when Venom actually beats both for action and atmosphere. It's a real shame Venom won't be in the MCU, him fighting alongside Hulk would be immense. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom is a masterclass in unhinged volatility and casting choice. Do not believe the pompous critics. Get yourself a ticket, your favourite drink and snacks and go and enjoy Venom. Don't over think it, don't pick holes in it, just let it wash over you for around two hours of guilty pleasure.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie begins with an introduction to Eddie Brock and the nature of his work as a reporter and you know he is ""all in"" where his work is concerned. He will go any lengths to get his scoop, even sneak into his loved ones emails.
Of course, he gets his scoop but along with that he also loses his job, apartment and girlfriend. Yet, there he is right outside a store paying $20 for a newspaper that is free.
Parallely symbiotes have made their way to our planet via the Life Foundation Space Craft. The Craft crash lands in Malaysia and an emergency team reaches the spot to ensure that there aren't too many causalities. The team finds the symbiotes that are captured and an astronaut who is barely alive. But not really... one of the symbiotes escapes and manages to wreak a RIOT. While riot ensues, scream, agony and venom make it to the Life Foundation Lab in San Francisco. As the name suggests symbiotes need a host and LFL begins experiments with animals. The moment there is a spark of success; Drake wants to begin working with human specimens.
Carlton Drake played by Riz Ahmed is the CEO of the Life Foundation. He is a young man who isn't just possessed by the need to succeed but clearly suffers from a severe case of hypermetropia induced by megalomaniacal tendencies. This though has been evident all along. His scientists continue their pursuit of greater good until the experiments begin on humans and it results in a moral dilemma for one of his scientists.
Reporter Eddie Brock finds himself in the LFL at the behest of the whistle blower, only to find himself hosting Venom.
What happens next is a ton of action, a thrilling chase sequence, hot flushes and cold sweat that makes one sit in an aquarium in the middle of a restaurant and eat a live lobster. (It could have been a cray fish, correct me if I'm wrong.) Now, for those with a weak stomach - be warned, there are more such barf inducing scenes from the very beginning of the movie. My friend and I had no problems as we sat eating popcorn and sipping Coke while heads vanished and faces were being licked. *Slurp*.
The movie progresses beautifully and it is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. The movie is fast paced, the story is rushed but if you are attentive, you'll know and understand what's happening. If you have read the comics good for you and like me if you haven't read them, go along with someone who has, like I did.
After watching this movie, one thing is clear, Anti-Heroes are here to stay. Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Jenny Slate, Scott Haze and Reid Scott have all managed to makes us, love, admire, hate, like, hate and amuse throughout the movie.
The movie does have a ""buddy cop"" feel to it with several laughs along the way. Some terrible jokes don't quite make the mark but for the most part the jokes are actually funny. I especially loved Venom-Eddie interaction.
I am now looking forward to the Eddie - Venom - Anne love triangle in the sequel!!! Yes, there is definitely going to be a sequel. For those making plans to watch the movie, stay back for the scene before the credits roll and for the sneak-peak post credits.P.S: Yes, Stan Lee does make an appearance. My Recommendation: Don't go by what the critics have to say, if you really want to sit back and unwind go for this movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It legged out pretty well and is now available on home media for your enjoyment. Even though the movie is quite short, an hour and a half of action plus 20 minutes of credits along with a teaser for the Spider Verse movie, it's still worth the price of a rental. If you grew up reading the Venom solo comic books from the 90s, then you'll enjoy this movie. The Venom in this movie is much better than the Venom that was introduced in Spiderman 3, which was the last great spiderman movie until homecoming brought the magic back. Even though it's rated PG-13, i think it's more between a pg-13 and an r rating since there's crude humor and some wacky stuff going on.

The one thing I know for sure is that you like what you like. The movie can be perfectly shot, have cool cgi but still be boring as hell (most of DC titles, ahem).
Venom is a good movie because it has great acting, good jokes and it's entertaining to watch. I never once wanted to speed things up. The movie is FUN. The story is pretty simple because it's an origin story and we all know those, they're never too original (take ANY first Spider-Man movies except maybe Homecoming).
But Venom is still fun, entertaining and I don't feel like I wasted my time or money. Don't listen to the critics. Go enjoy a good movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I love the MCU, and I give the DCU a chance to redeem themselves. This movie was great as it hit a funny aroua throughout the movie. It is definitely no Deadpool, but after all nothing can top Deadpool. As a movie lover of all types, this was very enjoyable to watch and can easily be better than some of the previous super-hero movies. Hell, I can say this is better than the second Thor and as many might not like this, but easily as good as Ant-Man. Yes it has the typical same villain with the same superpowers, but that's what the story is based from. It is sad that Spidey isn't appearing throughout this Sony universe, but as a stand-alone movie with a sequel and maybe an extended universe, I can see this going pretty well. Anything at this point can beat the DCU, however, Shazam is looking pretty good.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well I can honestly say this film was an example of why you should never rely on other opinions!
It was fantastic! It was every bit of traditional Marvel that it should be!
It was fun, it was funny, it was dramatic, it was suspenseful and it was visually pleasing!
Tom Hardy is someone I barely see on tv or film because maybe he's just in things I don't generally watch but I thought his part in this film was such a refreshing change to the usual type of actor cast for them.
I thought the story was typical of the early day Marvel theme which was a complete credit to the film. The cast were brilliant in general.
Overall I genuinely believe this film deserved more than the reception it's had because it was very entertaining! Loved it!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Luckily, user reviews on sites like Reddit changed my mind.While Venom is far from a masterpiece, and feels downright silly at times, I found it really entertaining. Tom Hardy was by far the highlight - his Venom/Brock scenes completely stole the show. Unfortunatrly, the same cannot be said about the supporting cast, as the villain and love interest are as cookie-cutter as it gets.Another highlight was the Venom suit itself. The CGI was great for the vast majority and when Venom was on the screen (and Riot for that matter) I felt excited just to watch him. The other negatives, such as rather poor fight scenes, atrocious editing (leaving many unanswered questions), and the first half being a bit boring, don't ruin the fun and I recommend checking this one out yourself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

First, the letters are like 3x bigger than normal credit-letters and then they're moving at the same pace of the 3x smaller letters which resulted in credits which took 3 times longer to end than any other credits I've ever seen. So we waited for a very long time just to see the most lame after scene ever? Some weird spiderman-short-story with absolutely 0 content and 0 humor? It looked like a high school project to be honest.Conclusion:
I would've rated this movie a solid 10 but this is the very first time I had to deduct a star for these horrible credits and amateur afterscene. Shame on Marvel for that.9/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's got a horror feel to it, but Venom himself really hits home with his quirkiness. The action was awesome and the chi is good. I'm excited to see where this franchise goes, whether or not Spider-Man becomes a part of it.

Saw this movie in the theater opening weekend and was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Not perfect by any means - but in an era when we are deluged with big budget superhero movies, Venom quickly carved out its own piece of the super-real-estate. It is big, bold, fast-moving, unapologetic, and very very funny.Tom Hardy is all-in and a terrific flawed and relatable character set (as both human Eddie Brock and his symbiote Venom) and Michelle Williams is a sharp-witted and modern partner. In fact, the vast majority of the cast is so remarkably likable (with the noted and obvious exception being the perfectly icky and slimy Carlton Drake (with some scene-munching supplied by Riz Ahmed) that the viewer can't help but enjoy the ride and forgive any cinematic weaknesses.With Venom now available for the home-viewer, this origin story is a no-brained go-to for multiple viewings - and it just gets better every time you see it. Enjoy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Tom hardy is remarkable in the role of Eddie Brock, battling with his dark side to try be good, a must see a favourite villain of mine with not only his own movie but with a great story arc that goes in depth and dives deep.All we need now is Venom and Spider-man to meet once again.

I was expecting this movie to be ""so bad that its good"" or something, but instead I ended up watching a genuinely good movie. Like 90% of what I've heard from critics is just made up. Most of the things I've heard pointed out as being plot holes are explained in the movie or just don't happen? I've heard a lot of people say that the final fight scene is confusing and hard to follow, but its not? If you watch it and are paying attention, its really easy to follow. Some people say that Anne is a bad love interest even though she isn't even the love interest. Someone said that Tom Hardy mumbles all his lines even though he doesn't. I've heard that the villain is really bad. While he isn't the greatest villain ever, his motivations make sense and he's well acted. Pretty much every negative review boils down to someone watched the trailer, made up what they thought would happen in the movie, and then gave the movie a low rating. I will admit though, the trailer looks really bad. The CG on Venom in the movie looks pretty good, but in the trailers it looks horrible. I don't know how that happened.Overall, this is a very entertaining rom-com and I would highly recommend it. The fight scenes are great. The characters are interesting and entertaining. The relationship between Eddie and Venom is nice. I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I strongly believe that this is a good movie, as i enjoyed it even more than other highly acclaimed super-hero films. Yes, anti-heroes are nothing new, but this movie represents one of Marvel most beloved anti-heroes/villains so well.In fact, i would say that the design of Venom for this movie is nothing short of amazing. It is miles away (for the better) than the dissapointing appearance of him in Spiderman-3, and is such a delight to watch. The cgi is done in such a stylish flavour that you can forgive some of the film flaws by how good Venom looks.The story is ok...perhaps a bit cliched. But the action scenes are great, and in my opinion this is the main reason to watch super hero movies.So my title for this review is intented to claim that, what matters in the end, is how much entertainment value you get from the media you consume. Be it films, music, books, videogames, anime, whatever the heck you are into. You should ask yourself: am i having fun? Rather than thinking this or that. Yes, critical thinking matters, but sometimes you just have to lay down your analylitcal thoughts and just enjoy. And i bet that if you give it the chance, this movie will be a fine time for you.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

What was good in this movie was that these monsters are basically bad monsters but venom which parasitized a main character turned into a good monster gradually regardless of that those monsters prefer destructions because a bond between main guy and venom were constructed gradually.
I can recommend this movie with all my heart!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's a mess. It's incoherent. In truth, it's just more fake news from our media outlets. The main reason the media don't like the movie is because of the main cast member's skin color and sex.The story is entertaining, fun and thankfully, reasonably different from most of the super hero movies. It starts out with heavy political correctness, but it's not enough so satisfy the main stream media - let's face it, Tom Hardy isn't a total moron so the media would be outraged.The movie is as violent as many of the Avengers movies. Hardy's performance is solid (possibly making himself too passive to please the main stream media - which didn't work anyway). Williams is likeable, however, she's the chief lawyer, scientist and warrior rolled into one. Hollywood are afraid to have a female protagonist with the slightest of flaws. That's the rules of diversity (which have nothing to do with diversity) and it undermines Williams' credibility. It's not extreme enough to please the feminists and at the same time she is not credible to the other 90% of the population.I was tipped off about this film from on one reliable site where many people upvoted venom continually. When the main stream media tell us one thing and a large group of people say the opposite, you know there's a reason the media are burying this movie. Even if this type of movie is not your taste, looking beyond the media's reality distortion field is worth the price of admission to see why the media universally panned it.If the writers want to make a ""feminist compliant"" sequel, add a female venom. Make her 100x stronger, smarter, faster and intelligent than the male venom. Make the male venom highly stupid. Then throw in a line like ""you can't do that - you're a woman"". The guys won't watch it, but the media will praise it as unique, empowering (meaning like all of the other crap in the box office at the moment) and label it a box office smash.This film is definitely fresh. It's definitely worth the watch. I apologise to the main stream media for failing to toe the party line.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 3's Venom did not stay true to the comic book character, Topher Grace did a terrible job on portraying Eddie Brock, his acting was very poor and didn't even looked like Eddie Brock at all. And Venom was not venom in that movie. He didn't look like venom, he doesn't even sound like venom. So going into this film I was expecting for this film to make up for spider-man 3's venom, and it does make up for that. DO NOT believe the critics, because they don't know what they watch. The chemistry between Tom Hardy and Venom is amazing in this film, both have funny parts in this movie. People have a problem with the cgi in this film, personally, I liked the cgi, I loved how venom looked in this movie. And that's another thing I wanted to say about this movie is that venom is actually venom in this movie. He looked like venom, he sounded like venom, and he acted like he is venom from the comics. I thought the action in this movie was great, the same thing goes for the soundtrack of this movie. My biggest problem with this movie is the villain, he's probably one of the worst villains I've seen in Cinema history, his acting was very poor, he wasn't menacing at all, and he didn't even feel like a villain, he just felt like a generic character.
Conclusion: Venom stayed true to the comic book character, because Venom was Venom in this movie. Every time venom showed up I was having an amazing time, sure it has it's flaws, but it's still a fun time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie was FANTASTIC i enjoyed the entire thing it was completely different than most marvel movies and portrayed venom completely different than in spiderman 3. However...there was alot of lost potential due to the PG-13 rating. Venom is like deadpool...it was NEVER intended to be a family friendly movie or anti hero/vigilante.

I've seen a lot of people complaining about how it should've been an R rated gorefest, full of spine breaking and pancreas eating, but personally I don't believe it would've done as well if it actually was an R rated gorefest.While yes, the story is a bit run-of-the-mill, big bad organization messes with aliens, aliens try to take over, one alien says no and hooray day is saved. Tom Hardy does an amazing job of making Venom stand out from all your other Sci-Fi superhero movies. I reckon the main reason I like it is because it has the perfect blend of 'funny' and 'cool'. I'm a sucker for sci-fi, action, comedy, and superhero movies, and Venom just takes the cake for me.

The elements in the movie, the comedy but dark factor just make it to +5 now... we are at 7/10. Michelle Williams is a PLUS and played her character really well. The Special Effects are A+. I read that the CGI is bad.... well this is no Avengers. No too much color and non-sense atmosphere. It is dark, believable and fun. already at 9/10. I know that the main vilain may not be the cup of tea of everyone.

Venom made enough of an appearance to still look cool, even at the end of the film, without being shown too much that he gets boring and the casting was absolutely perfect as they delivered a perfect enjoyable performance without being cringy in any way. The cgi was on point at all times and there were so many comic book appearances that they managed to cleverly fit in this film.

In fact, The film's 90's Inspired vibe which I saw take direct influence from Sam Raimi films such as Darkman and Evil Dead made the film stand out in the market of superhero films that come out every few months now. There will be purists who will cry and say that because Spider-Man doesn't appear in Venom, the film is already a failure and that right there lies a major problem. I guarantee that fans had no issue when Marvel Studios decided to change the origin of Ultron as a creation of Hank Pym to a creation of Tony Stark. If you took no problem with that, please stfuwith the comic book elitist bsThe way this film managed to tell the story of Eddie Brock/Venom in a new way while honoring the comic roots really impressed me.
Yes it's an origin story but it's a new slant on it from my opinion.

The film starts out a bit slow, but by the second act you're having fun with the action and laughing at Venom quips. Tom Hardy is a perfect foil for Venom's ferocious personality, and the two compliment each other throughout the film with differing opinions and endearing compromises.Without a doubt the Venom character is dark and mysterious, but also opens up and is even self deprecating at times, something that I did not expect. Chemistry between Eddie Brock and Anne is not the best, but it comes around by the end to something enjoyable and relatable.By the end of the film my wife and I were in stitches whenever Venom spoke, and couldn't be more excited for what comes next with this franchise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It definitely has some pacing issues, but otherwise it I liked it very much. The problem with reviews is that some people go watch the movie with their mind already made up, because it has no spiderman it must be bad. In their opinion it is not faithful to it's source material. If you see that in a review the reviewer is definitely biased. The last time I checked Star lord is not Ego's son in the comics and Thor is not a ""idiot"" surfer character. Hardy gives the most commited performance in a comic book movie since Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool. To summarise Venom is a fast paced action movie that is also quite funny (in my opinion it is funnier than ant man and the wasp and that was billed as a comedy). It the second best comic book movie of the year. Only behind deadpool 2. Why? 
Well it is funnier than Ant man 2(again a comedy). Black Panter is massively overrated (just because a MCU movie has a good villain and the movie has a second message does not mean it is the best comic book movie of all time). Avengers:IW is half a movie than will not have lasting stakes (yeah spiderman and Black Panther are definitely dead..and will not come back). Do not misunderstand me all the movies are good but for what a Venom movie should be in my opinion it hits it's targets.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I like this movie. Really. This is a cool film. Let's go in order. I must to say, I compared this movie with Deadpool 2. After the last one I left the cinema in ecstasy, with the thought that I must kick somebody's ass. Graphical effects were cool here, but... If the fights in the middle of the movie would seem to you incredibly cool, then in the final confrontation of two villains it was sometimes difficult to sort out (I hope that the duel between symbiotes is not a spoiler because it was shown in trailers before). Venum here is definitely better than in the last part of Sam Raimi's trilogy about the Spider-Man, so I prefer not to count graphics to the minuses. The Internet is already full of negative feedbacks about the script, as if it is too straightforward, too simple. I don't know about you, but I was going for an entertaining attraction, not a detective or a thriller, so I would not even pay attention to it because I didn't expect nothing surprising. In my opinion, the main thing that makes this film worse than last appearance of his colleague in a red suit from the studio Fox is it's soundtracks. When I was sitting on 2 part of Deadpool, I struggled with myself in order not to launch Shazam on my phone and find the music that was rising me to heaven. It was happening for several times. I still listen to some tracks. After watching Venom, no melody left in my head. Honestly, as soon as I got out of the cinema, I couldn't even remember whether there was any musical support or not. But enough about bad. Because movies are cool. And this especially. The pursuit on a motorcycle shown in a trailer was cool. Extremely. And I formulated it softly. Humor - I really enjoyed it. Here I made a positive parallel with the last part of the ""dead red pool"". I laughed a lot of times and people near me did the same. Well, and the main thing you need to know. If in ""Return of the Dark Knight"" Bane played his role without showing his face completely and often doing it only with his eyes, then he did not have any barriers here. Tom Hardy played his role with great passion. I would say he did the best he could, just an unreally awesome actor. And his constant dialogues with Venom are perhaps the best part of the film. They are built on a remarkable performance of the actor which was always interesting to watch. What can I sum up - the movie is worth watching, it's interesting, fun and dynamic, just what it takes after a hard working week. Therefore, people - hurry up to rest in cinemas with evil symbiosis during yours weekend. It's worth it...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you can score a borefest like Gravity 10 then Venom should be 100! Plus my wife seemed to really enjoy it and didn't have high expectations to begin with with. Tom Hardy has great potential for a second film which I hope he does. I was not bored distracted or questioning anything during the film and was better by miles than I expected from some reviews which can only be a good thing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They use just the right amount of Comedy and serious evil villain to create an amazing movie. Tom Hardy has in my mind never been apart of a movie that was bad and he works great as Eddie Brock working with the sinister villain Venom.

I am not a fan of the comic books and I do not know allot about the character Venom. So I will just tell you what I thought about the movie, in a one off sense.The Venom character, he's certainly a really strong hero/anti hero, he's up there with the most capable of super heroes. The acting, it's good, it is about what you would expect from top actors, when working on a super hero movie.I am already looking forward to the sequel. I would like to see this character grow, then eventually joining to the ""Marvel Universe"", in some capacity at least. I do feel that this Venom guy would make a great TV series. Marvel are doing some great work with their series format. I'm really enjoying their TV shows. Having said that, the Marvel team, I feel, are certainly going to need to go all out, in creating some bad guys for Venom to go up against.I hope Tom Hardy stays on board. He is one of the few ""tough guy"" actors, around, that doesn't leave you with an impression of - some guy who spends all week in a gym, whilst adoring the mirror.If you are a fan of these type of movies, then you'll know not to expect Oscar worthy type stuff. You'll be in it for the same reason as myself ..to be entertained. Ignore the critics, don't expect too much, and I think you'll enjoy it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I try to go into every movie with low expectations, and simply look at them as a case of if it is entertaining - if not why not and if so, What marks it above the rest!VENOM starts as a slow burn in many respects - It teases action from teh start but actually does a lot to build charterer, However once it kicks into High Gear - YOU ARE IN FOR A RIGHT ROYAL ROMP!Would I have preferred to see a Spider-Man / Venom Story - Like the comics - ABSOLUTELY! But we have an Else-world Story that simply DOES WORK!Tom Hardy is BRILLIANT! There is little more that can be said... His performance is 100% on point except a couple of minor issues... But we will get to that....The film is overall Exciting and fun! And the characterisation of Venom is on point!Effects are Excellent - Except a couple of minor issues _ I would say Spoilers but its in the Trailer anyway... One point Eddie is on teh Ground and Venom takes over his body to attack a bad guy - And... WOW! The CGI as Venom covers Eddie Brock's face is POOR - The Rendering of Tom Hardy is SO LIFELESS!!! But thats Minor and it only stuck out to me as I was so invested in the film!Where I do take an issue - SONY YOU ARE COWARDS!!! This film could 100% have been better with a HARD R (18) Certificate. Venom is a BRUTAL Character - and in a solo Movie SHOULD BE HARD R!The film is 100% a Real Romp - Great Fun, Great Action, Great Effects.. and You just know the Sequel is coming and I am looking forward to it!EFFECTS: 8

The action was top notch, and not once did I lose interest in any of the film.

Yes, it has some issues but they weren't enough to bring the movie down. I thought the cast was good especially Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom. Venom was the highlight of this film and stole the show for me. It was one of those moments where every time he appeared, I couldn't keep my eyes off of him and wanted to see more. He looks really good and I liked the chemistry between Eddie and Venom! The only thing missing is that iconic spider symbol on his chest...With all of that being said, the story feels a bit rushed. It's kind of obvious they cut out nearly 30-40 minutes of the film. And the final battle was very weak as well. I'm also wondering as to whether or not they should have gone for the R-rating. But, it is what it is and there's no changing that. Overall, I thought this was a solid start for the character and they proved that they didn't need Spider-Man to do it(though I wouldn't have argued against the idea of having him in it)But, there is a lot of potential here for future films and maybe one day we will have Spider-Man and Venom team up to go against Carnage!! That would be awesome!I think this film is worth seeing in theaters especially if you're a Venom/Spider-Man/comic book fan! I know that this is my opinion and everyone is entitled to have one, but I respectfully disagree with the majority of the critics who slammed this movie. Go see it for yourself and make your own judgement. Be sure to stay for the post-credit scenes! Hope you enjoy it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Rocket explosions and crashes that are spun as ""successful"" due to what has been ""learned"" from needless deaths and destruction, the supposedly ""brilliant visionary"" who will gladly let the world burn, so long as he is lauded. The Elon-villain cares nothing for other people, gleefully murdering them to expand his power and in deference to his utterly misguided ""philosophy."" Who would have thought that it would take the unwanted Twitter acquisition for the rest of us to understand this is who Musk really is? Fantastic film based on a real person.

But walking into this movie after my whole month of hype was shut down after seeing multiple poor reviews was saddening. After I watched the movie, I was satisfied with everything they through in. It had a dark tone when it came to the villains ambitions yet had a very fun and brilliant relationship with Venom and Brock. The only thing that I noticed was the rush of a beginning. I couldn't even keep track of the days and nights. But as soon as the symbiote comes into play it's an exciting and worth seeing movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

These worries were soon put to rest once the film kicks in, mainly thanks to Tom Hardy's fantastic charisma and believable character development of Eddie Brock and the horror theme introducing Venom to finally grace our screens in his own solo outing! I mightely enjoyed this one for the most part; there are a few sequences in particular like the first time Venom is seen in his full form to his manipulation of Brock's body to fight his oppressors that are really fun and just feels so cool to see that this film about such an iconic character has been made. In terms of the story, there are times when the side characters need their screen time and this is when it's in danger of dragging, becoming boring and just doesn't have the pace to keep us interested in these characters. Maybe it's because we just want to see Venom go batcrap crazy more or maybe it's just because the subplots are not as well written. However, this is outweighed by the fact that there is still fun to be had as a whole and it has a good sense of humour running throughout; we did giggle a lot! Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad) and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (Mother!, Black Swan) bring flair and a gothic sensibility to the visuals which is essential in not just the appearance of Venom but the mood. The Jekyll/Hyde dynamic of Brock and Venom is a wonderfully realised element and makes this one all the more worth a trip to the cinema. The standard post credits Marvel scene is also very exciting with a terrific cameo! Massive well done to the visual and sound effects department for creating some great symbiote sounds and also to composer Ludwig Goransson (Black Panther) for a suspenseful score. Also love the Eminem song!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is plenty of fun, good little quips from the Venom character and Tom Hardy's Performance is surprisingly good for the subject matter - by which I mean, given it is another Marvel movie, he gives a surprisingly gripping yet nonchalant performance, which suits the character well in my opinion.It does suffer from, what I am referring to as, 'First Movie Syndrome.' Symptoms include: too much exposition; uncertain characters and too much serendipity. However, again, these consistencies are not the reason for choosing to partake in movies such as Venom.Overall I disagree with the critics vehemently and suggest they get off of their high-artistic horse and watch the film again, this time without analysing and purely for the experience. If they're honest their opinion will change sharply.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action scenes were straight out of the comics, but it shortchanged some very likeable/relatable characters. Instead of 15 minutes of shoot-out in the smoke-filled lobby, we could've had more time with Eddit negotiating with Venom, and winning the alien over to his point of view. Maybe spend some time exploring how Anne adjusts to Venom and/or how Venom relates to Ann. Or maybe spend some of that at the end of the movie. Eddie/Venom save the world. He swims in water with stuff burning for a sec. Then him and Anne are sitting on her stoop chatting.Umm... How did they get there? Why didn't they let us enjoy the fact that the world was safe? Why couldn't they just hold a frame for a damn minute!If firends ask, I will go see it with them. But I'd like to see an extended version","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Despite the pg13 rating the film did a great job of handling Venom and had r rated moments such as heads being bitten off and some blood. Tom Hardy did an amazing job at portraying Eddie Brock and you could tell he was giving this his all. This is Venom done right. Of course the movie wasnt perfect but it's a very enjoyable and fun experience. I hope to see A Venom 2 and further in the Sonyverse as they know what they are doing.

It is cleverly written and starts out looking like Ridley Scott's Alien sci-fi horror before bait-and-switch into an action dark comedy sci-fi film. The dialog between Eddie and Venom is hilarious and it actually makes the story even more believable because oddly, you see the chemistry between the two characters as the bond and becomes one.I'm taking 1 point off because there were some plot elements I thought was not explained thoroughly enough. I mean, they're in there, but just wasn't clearly explained or focused. An example without giving spoilers is what happened to the yellow symbiote. It is in the film, briefly and they never verbally explained it. I felt as though they edited it too much, trying to fit it in a 1 hr 30 min confine.Also it took about 45 mins for the 1st real action sequence, which is 1/2 the movie. So the action sequence wasn't really smoothed out through the film. Basically 1/2 of the film is explaining and building up the background story, which is why perhaps they edited so much to cut it down. The 2nd 1/2 is full on action after action nonstop.But 9/10 ain't bad, right? Fantastic film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

My wife and I saw this last night and we were blown away by how good it was!!! I have been a venom fan since I was little and honestly I was worried about how they would do the story of venom's origin and they did really good with it. They keep most of the same beats, replacing Spider-Man with the Life Foundation with taking Eddie down(on purpose this time) and it really works. This movie can actually get your skin crawling at times especially when Eddie first gets the symbiote and there were times were chills ran down my spine and it gets so much better from thereThe action is tense and you are glued to the screen, the CGI is really good and the relationship between the symbiote and Eddie just makes the movie just by itself, with some tense scenes and surprisingly really solid humor. The best parts of this movie are when venom goes all out on people. Also if you're worried about the brutality of venom since it is pg-13 they get away with a lot of stuff either by shading it or some other form of cut or something(and yes he does bite peoples heads off....several times.) it makes me wonder if they do have a unrated edition what the heck did they cut out if they were able to keep some of the stuff in the movie....gets me pumped honestly. This movie is great even if you read the comics seen the 90's tv show etc it will not let you down and ooh boy you are in for a ride don't listen to critics go see this if you want a fun ""superhero"" movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first 3rd drags on a little bit too much and your just sat waiting for him to become venom proper but other than that it's a great film with some good humour that isn't out of place and sits well in the whole tone and theme. Hopefully marvel and sony ignore the critics and make a 2nd!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

on the bad note the CGI could have been done better.
also the pg 13 rating does feel like a factor in the action sequences, but the movie it self is a lot lighter and humorous than the trailers show, there for it doesn't feel like you were robbed from a blood shed head decapitating rampage logan style.

I loved it, there was enough cleverly choreographed action involving and alien from out of space. That'll do. Put your artistic fanboyish writer/director hats in your back pocket, sit down, shut up and let the symbiote take over.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You may feel first half is boring or feeling lag but try to understand director's Perspective, that he is trying to show you how powerful Symbiotes are, how symbiotes transforms. 
Second half is just thrilling, no words to describe how symbiotes are dealing with every thing and just making Venom as a hero. ( Kindly watch and hear the interaction between Venom and Eddie, you will come to know what Venom really requires from Eddie so that they both have a deal and to continue from there.) 
Don't miss the post credits as that's the only scene where you may expect it's second part. If you have gone through the Old Comics, you might get a good idea, how far Venom goes and so there might be many perspectives for its series.Kindly watch from theatre and just feel the edge.
Thank you","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The plot is fairly straightforward and simple, but there's nothing bad with it. 
The effects could be better, but they are good. 
The jokes are fun, the actors are good. 
If I wanted to make this movie better I'd like to add a little better special effects, remove all the annoying ""wink wink we have special eyes so you who watch will understand, even thought it's quite obvious, that we are bad guys"" effects (they do this in a LOT of movies, and it's equally annoying in all of them). I'd like to add a little more conversations between Venom and Eddie to get more of a feel of who Venom is and as an explanation to why he does what he does. But these are just nit picks. The movie was great, I had a good time. I'll buy it when it comes out. Don't listen to the critics.

Feels like a long time anyway. For a semi-cinema-snob like me this was a guilty pleasure. It's what a scary popcorn movie for teens should be. Most Marvel moofies are an excuse for us middle-aged folk to pinch a genre that belongs to young folk and labour it with heavy themes. This movie is as whacky as Tom Hardy's performance. The serious elements are not subtle but they're only riding on the coat tails of something absurd and funny. There's plenty of CGI but it knows its limits and is inventive within them. I knew I was in the right mood for this Fridi night popcorn movie. I'm glad a decent bunch of other folks were too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Venom's story has always been an interesting one... and this movie/origin story didn't dissapoint. Hardy, as always, and of course in any role he plays... played what I would call an absolutely amazing ""protagonist/antagonist"" as Eric Brock.

I loved every aspect of their relationship and how Tom Hardy portrayed Eddie, and I personally loved all the action sequences because I don't have a blatant hatred for CGI.

They are a dying breed in a society which values audience opinion over any critic. They get paid for good/bad reviews. Go out and see movies for yourselves to formulate an opinion instead of letting a critic form one for you. This movie is on par with any of the origin movies for Iron Man, Captain America, Ant-Man, etc. and in no way do I view that as a bad thing. It's a great starter. I'm excited for what's to come (due to end credits scene)!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sure it's an origin story with the 'Hero' who must save the world and the 'Villain' with a mad quest for power. What makes it unique though is the hero is a down on his luck reporter symbolically bonded with a badass alien life form who just loves to bite people's heads off. What's not to love??? We get a crazy fun duo of Eddie and Venom who have this awesome dynamic, a massively entertaining movie, with plenty of PG-13 beheadings and a romance I am certainly rooting for. I loved it so much that I can't wait for the sequel.

The VENOM in this movie was an otherworldly parasite finding a suitable host and 'he' found one in Eddie Brock which is superbly played by Tom Hardy. The first half of the movie was a bit boring and quite gross but the second half was absolutely outstanding. VENOM is also voiced by Tom Hardy and he has done a phenomenal job.

There weren't too many jokes so the humour was just right and not too overboard like most of the new superhero films are nowadays. The movie also had a serious edge to it giving it the chance to stand out from the typical superhero type of films which we're all used used to. It also had some great acting on behalf of Hardy. Definitely looking forward to seein the second instalment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I came out of the movie theatre sated. All movie suits different tastes. And I was in the mood for a horror/sci-fi/action just before halloween. It was a hero/ villian origin story perfect for the avengers haitus. I was never bored- in fact I didn't want to go to the toilet. Plus it has Tom Hardy, whose magnitism can carry every scene (Kudos on the bike riding skills). Yes, Im a fan girl, for his acting and it was on point( To go from swag to vulnerable to manic is a delight to see. The CGI wasn't bad, so it wasn't distracting. Venom himself was menacing, I kind of wish they had made him even more menacing, but I suppose they had to fit the '15' rating (I'm from the UK), the comic aspects came from the dynamic between Eddie ad Venom, which at times went from intense to whimsical (funny but it took away some of the edge- unless your into that kind of thing). I suppose that is my only critism. His love interest (and her boyfriend) was actually quite helpful, her involvement was crucial in the final act (shame about her wig). At the end of the day, great popcorn munching movie, it's best to go in with medium expectations so you can be mildly surprised it's a decent piece of entertainment. Would recommend.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Comments I was torn. Do I waste my time? Is this going to be another boring Marvel movie? No. If you liked and appreciate the bad-assery of Blade 1, The Punisher ( specifically Dolph Lundgreen version ), Ghost Rider 1 or any darker type Marvel movie, drop what your doing and go see this, in IMAX. ; we watched in 3D, and will be going back to see it in IMAX. We saw it last night, my wife gave it a 7/10, and she is not into these movies at all! I gave it a 8.5/10. Yes it was PG13, and that was ok with me. It was a strong PG-13. If it was R, it might of taken away from the story and who Venom really is. Tom Hardy is awesome, and a solid actor, you feel for him, and get goosebumps. Venom is perfect. Better than I could imagine in my dreams.If you ever played Maximum Carnage on SNES you will go crazy for this movie. Watch until credits are over.We all have Venom inside us, a bad ass who wants to do the right thing. Do the right thing and go watch.Check me out on YouTube, my handle is BigDog","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Could a Venom movie work without Spider-Man? The whole reason the character even exists in the first place is because of Spider-Man. Surprisingly, this movie worked, and it worked well. Yes, the origin story has for the most part been changed, but it still made sense and still worked. Tom Hardy is great in everything he does, and this is no exception. Some of the dialogue is really stupid, and I feel certain scenes could have had more potential, but the stuff that was great was really great. The CGI was terrific, as were the action scenes. The story took a while to get going, but once it did, it really got going. I think this is one of those movies that has enormous potential, but it will never be fully realized, and everything it's setting up will sadly be cancelled. This has happened with ""Cirque Du Freak"", ""Valerian"", and others, and I feel this is going to join the ""Potential franchise ends up being one and done"" club, which is a shame. I want to see more of this!

I think that's why so many people liked this movie, but it's got so few stars.That said, the leads have good chemistry. Enough to create a nice little triangle between Williams, Hardy, and Hardy/Venom. Riz Ahmed also plays a great contemptible hypocritical tech mogul villain. You wonder why they cast hunk Tom hardy as the lead until you realise his range includes extreme bewilderment (thankfully he doesn't mumble as much as he does in his other films.) I also enjoyed Jenny Slate playing an accomplice scientist.Nevertheless, compared to massive ensemble Marvel outings, this film is second-rate. But almost suitably so. Venom is a supporting character in the comics, after all, as is host Eddie Brock. The CGI-slurry boss-fight is almost appropriate considering that symbiotes are essentially blobs.There's a bit of confusion about exactly how hard it is for symbiotes to find good human hosts, and the basis of the emotional bond between Eddie and Venom, but this doesn't get in the way of the fun.Venom doesn't try too hard either to create massive emotional moments, huge fight scenes, or to pop them with well-timed snark. It's the scrappy Sony Marvel movie that could.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For this movie though and for Tom Hardy i felt that is an obligation to write a review because of the critic's bad reviews.Yes, this movie could have been better. Maybe ""Rated R"" better. The critics are caught by the fact that the movie felt boring in the beginning. This movie is not a sequel. It is the first movie about Venom. It is very normal to have a story telling before any action happens. 
They must first cover the following:
I think you need some time to cover those and the movie was not boring at all while covering those points. It was funny in a good way and Tom Hardy was really great.The action started it went on until the end of the film. Eddie was great; Venom was great and all the supporting characters. 
Yes, the story could have been a little bit better in some details and the CGI at some scenes could have been a lot better.
I would have rated this at 7.5/10 but deserves an 8/10 on imdb for the bad/biased critics out there. 
This is definitely a movie to watch at the cinema.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Please don't let ""professional critics"" discourage you from seeing this in the theaters. The movie starts off slow, because it has to introduce you to characters that have not been previously established. Venom doesn't have the advantage of connected-world-building and character development like the MCU movies, so there's no point to comparing It to them. I absolutely loved this movie, and I can't wait to see it again. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Venom should a sequel get the green light. I've been a Venom fan since his first appearance, and I've read all the Venom-related comics up to the most recent. Spider-Man is my all-time favorite character, and although this story doesn't involve Spidey, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and how the story was presented. As much as I liked it, I wouldn't say ""no"" to an extended, R-rated edition down the road. We Are Venom!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In all honestly, we all went in with low expectations due to how many horrible critic reviews there were. We still wound up going because we had purchased advance tickets.
The movie was Perfect. The only complaint maybe would have been the movie wasn't long enough (honestly, I was so into it, it felt under an hour, but it was actually 2.5 hours long almost). The jokes were funny, Venom looked amazing.
If you don't know anything about Venom you might not relate, but it was still enjoyable. Was disappointed before I went because it was not an R rated movie, but in all honesty, for what it is it still delivered. 
I highly recommend you see it for yourself and ignore all the negative reviews you have seen from people who have no idea what they went to watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Im was ready for the worst, but belive me it was insain. I had a blast, it was funny, badass and the acting from the great Tom Hardy was on fire. I mean Tom Hardys peformens was sureal. It was like he was born for this role. It is nearly impossible not to have blast with this. I totaly agree that this should be R rated, but i am surprised how far they took it anyway. Overall stoked about this, you should go and watch it, and without spoiling i can safely say that the sequal will be even more interesting.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However within the first 15 minutes I already found it entertaining it had some good points and built it's story decently well, The only place this movie lowers itself is once we reach the mid point where you can really tell they have cut far too much out of this film.Where once there were these little scenes to really give insight into the background you can sadly really tell where the Sony guys butchered this film down. Still the film has some good points, The Venom dialogues with Eddie are great, The final battle sequence is quite fast faced but a little messy again you feel like this could have been longer, Overall CGI is quite good too. If they make a second movie as their tease would suggest though that highly depends on how well it can do, They really need to work more with Marvel studios guys to hammer out the issues that come from Sony at the moment.All said and done it's a good base movie - it's not great, ground-breaking or amazing.. But neither is it awful as these others have suggested. Frankly it was fun and I had a good time so I would watch again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now I'm coming out of the theatre, and I have to say that characters usages and also their personalities made this even more enjoyable for me. You see Eddie Brock as this arrogantly confident guy, who turns out to be sorta selfish and then is infected with something he knows of, but really does not know its capabilities. Once he starts to interact with the abilities he becomes situationally scared. In retrospect you have the LyfeFoundation dude, who believes in being better than what he believes the human species is. Throughout the movie he is trying to understand what he has found. By humanities standards, he is very cruel and ruthless with his methods. Scientifically, he would be considered groundbreaking by many. A life-form that can use a human as a host, heal the host (or kill the host), and communicate mentally and as an outside form. HmmmmAlso, this is the first time I can remember seeing the hero/anti-hero being 2 separate things that work together as one. Most super hero's are either alien themselves, something crazy made them that way, born with their superpowers. Venom is a living species that talks to Eddie through the film. So yea, I may have went on a text rant, but hey, at least you read it. Venom is a great movie, needs an R-Rated version. *Line of the Film: when the organism dies and Carlton Drake gets upset with his set and says ""How could you just stand there and let the superior species die; how selfish!""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I know the men in underpants movies and Avengers type stuff is what people want these days, maybe its part of the fact im getting old and its nostalgia drawing me in. I see Terminator, Carpenter, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles type influences in this production, crossed with state of the art CGI. I guess youll love it or hate it, bound to disappoint alot of Marvel fans. Not a great movie and the script is one thing they could have improved as alot of people pointed out. Would like to see a directors cut which could definately propel it in to classic sci-fi status","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's no masterpiece of a movie, but as a comic book movie it's terrific, lighthearted, action packed and really doesn't take itself seriously but in the best of ways.
So very cliche but in a good and endearing way.It's a very nice pause from the normal MCU movie universe where we've been fed the same stuff over and over again.Eddie Brock is a weird but fun character and venom fits him perfectly. They're a terrific anti hero couple and not much else is needed to be said because they're the only somewhat fleshed out part of this movie, the rest of the movie is basically happening around them.
Badly written review but not much else is needed really, it's not a movie with deeper meaning or with a message to deliver. You sit down, cram popcorn, laugh and fall in love with the characters and adventures of venom and Brock, a great setup for a sequel that'll hopefully bring us deeper into the world.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Absolutely.The character motivations were apparent, but not ""hit you over the head"" obvious. The personal transition Eddy went through made sense. And something happened I didn't think would ever happen. I came to love that adorable little black slime.It wasn't a perfect movie. Some of the jokes didn't hit.

I thought it was funny, fun, great action scenes, and as a person who loves to see a good CGI fight, it definitely fulfilled satisfaction. Tom Hardy is wonderful in anything he does so there are no complaints from me. Even the soundtrack is great! They got Eminem to do the main song which is really the cherry on top. And I've seen how people say it's too fast paced and has no back story but honestly I liked how it got to the point and didn't drag on. People also should remember that Venom is supposed to be a trilogy, so I'm sure they'll have plenty of time to fill in those empty holes where you might end up with questions. All in all, it's a great movie. My suggestion, grab some popcorn and take your whole family to the theaters and go watch Venom!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a fun movie with great effects and Tom Hardy rocked the character Eddie Brock. I always love Michelle Williams and she and Tom Hardy played well on screen.
Maybe it's because I heard so many negative reviews that I was so pleasantly surprised...but even with rave reviews, and high expectations, I wouldn't have been disappointed.
I'm excited for the sequel and I'm totally on Team Venom! This was a great depiction of the character. He was a fun and funny badass with that do-gooder reject vibe.
I also loved that they kept it PG-13 because I have a not-quite teenager who can watch with us without me feeling like he's being exposed to unnecessary carnage. Heh. Get it? ;) Great movie. Watch it for fun.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

First off, praise be to god for Tom Hardy in this role. No actor is more perfect as him for the Eddie Brock/Venom combo, and is truly the reason this film works so well. I'll be completely honest and say I didn't enjoy this film when I saw it in the theaters the first time around. Maybe I was in a bad mood, maybe I expected something much different, but given the recent slope of Marvel Studios films pitching almost identical ideals- and DC still doing much of the same- something as insane and fun as Venom is something I honestly long to see from more superhero flicks in the future. The action is spectacular and the CGI is perfect. Never have I seen such a perfectly done adaptation of a beloved character onto the bring screen as the look of Venom in this film. I will say this, the film can be a bit predictable at times. It follows a standard formula at times that you can recognize- something very eerie of earlier 2000's superhero flicks and not quite as fresh as it could have been. Its also just kinda stupid at times, and at times I honestly wondered if I was laughing cause the film was funny or because it was so dumb, but nevertheless I enjoyed it and all its ridiculousness with it. In the end, Venom is an underrated little superhero flick that gets too much hate for being something purely entertaining (even from myself apparently). No matter what flaws Venom may held, it makes up for them in spirit and charm, and is easily one of the most entertaining films i've seen in quite some time.My Rating: 8.5/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie is pure cinematic fun. It is great. It is fast, interesting,funny.Great fight scenes.

Venom is not a classic superhero movie where the main character gets abilities and does good things wherever he/she may go. Venom is an alien lifeform that needs a host and since it has gotten to earth it attaches to the best suitable human, which in this case is a guy called Eddy. Eddy becomes incredibly fast and strong but we don't know the parasites intentions. This is what makes things interesting. The parasite has a mind of its own and is quite hostile compared to Eddy. The conflict between these two makes the movie even more interesting.Venom has dark humor and is packed with a lot of action. The story is well written and I can't wait for a sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But honestly, I'm so glad I went to see it. The first half an hour of the movie was a bit of a drag. Slow going, not much happening, I was starting to accept the negative reviews. But once Eddie finally adopts the Venom symbiote, the whole film just turns into a crazy roller coaster of fun. 
OK so the characters & storyline are probably not the best going, quite sublime and unoriginal by all accounts, but once the action starts, you will soon forget about how dull this movie started. 
Not being biast but I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Hardy's performance as Eddie/Venom, and he brings in some decent jokes and comedy along the way, he definitely makes up for some of the more shallow acting in this flick.
So for anyone having doubts about this movie like I did, I urge you to go & see it, not for the story, and maybe not even for the characters, but just to lose yourself in an hour and a half of all out fun and mindless violence.We are Venom 👍","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie has a story line and it has creativity. I wouldn't call myself a Marvel expert but I've seen a lot of Marvel movies and my boyfriend reads the comics and tells me a lot about the MC Universe. (Even he enjoyed the movie) Also,Tom Hardy did a great job in this movie, in my opinion. I felt like he was authentic to the character and did, to his ability, Eddie Brock justice. I will say however that I didn't enjoy Annie at all, I feel like her character wasn't necessary (and if she's in the comics then... I don't know, I feel she brought nothing to the movie's story line but I'm guessing Marvel wanted to appeal to all audiences... so I get it. ""Gotta add a little of everything"")All in all, the movie was really good and entertaining. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time, it had a nice comedic streak, and it made me realize my love for Venom as a villain. It's upsetting that this movie is getting a bad rating but also, I think that no one should let reviews create an opinion before seeing the actual movie. A rating is just a rating. Determine it on your own and watch it, objectively. It's worth it!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The comic moments are fluid and natural, without that fake mood and bad timing from, for example, DC movies. The photograph is dark, probably due to the rendering of the digital art, but nothing disturbing the film; even helps in some moments because of the sobriety of history and theme. The action scenes were well done; it is certain that some actors seem not very comfortable with the story, a dialogue, maybe, but Hardy took the role very well. It's not the Venom as we know, but it has the potential to get there.I really liked and there's room for Marvel to take advantage of multiple points in history to, who knows, insert it in MCU.P.S: Wait for the post-credit scene.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Featuring a creative story played by fabulous actors. This movie had everything including romance, action, and comedy. I was surprised how marvel was able to fit everything together so brilliantly.

I'm not making a dime for writing this review. I'm just a film major, who has seen a great amount of both classic and modern films that have been unfairly dissed and unfortunately disregarded because some pretentious and arrogant European ""director"" was attached to another project that he abhorrently butchered without regard or care, simply because he could; because he was nameless he could fail and no one would notice and he could win and everyone would see: this is the modern day con artist of film. It's been done so many times in both the marvel and dc universes. These lame, money hungry opportunist directors, posing as visionaries, offering less than mediocre ""inside jokes"" for every superhero film imagined, is why the marvel and dc universe franchises are failing miserably. Newsflash, you DF: Thor Ragnarok was horrible. Infinity wars was detestable. You guys suck! And your making millions off of me?! Hell no! but everyone is too politically correct and afraid to say that he ruined and perfectly good film, because he or she (again to be ""politically correct"" aka brainwashed aka dumb, restarted, etc) wanted to win an award and add a million $$ to his or her or its net worth (for liberals who are wanting to be such amazing social justice ambassadors, they sure are missing their targeted audience completely, like everything else they screw up!) please ignore liberal stupidity and forget Obama was ever imagined or created. Approach film the way it was designed to, with even an iota of intelligence and we will take you seriously.

The film is the story of Eddie Brock, who was fired from his job after diving a little too deep into a story about the Life Foundation, an organization run by Carlton Drake, self-made millionaire with the intentions to change the world. When a scientist comes to Eddie with a problem, he investigates it further, where things go south. He becomes Venom and has to fight Riot, another one of the symbiotes found in outer space.
The story did not make me feel like I was watching one of the Marvel movies in regards to the fact that it did not follow the origin story at all, even changing the location that Eddie Brock lived. 
The film made me think about the possibility of adding Venom to the MCU, with Venom being in San Fransisco and not New York, how will he fight his most famous foe.
Written by Jeff Pinkner, Scott Rosenburg and Kelly Marcel then film does a good job showing the evolution of Eddie Brock's and Venom's relationship. The two grow to like and depend on each other and it shows pretty well. At the same time, one of the weakest points of the film for me was the dialogue. It seemed corny and very drier than it should have been.
With Ruben Fleischer in the director's chair, the film did well, from keeping the shot selection different, utilizing Tom Hardy's array of skills and making sure that Venom looked amazing and accurate to the comic book.
Alan Baumgarter did a good job as the editor, wrapping up the film together nicely, with my favorite juxtaposition of scenes being when Venom had escaped the police by jumping in the ocean and swimming away, when he came out of the water he returned to his form as Eddie Brock, with a smooth transition in the air.
Lastly, with Matthew Libatuqie controlling the lighting as the cinematographer, he was able to make the scene darker to show the obviously darker nature of Venom. While it worked through most of the film, certain parts were a bit too dark, making certain characters hard to distinguish from one another.
While the Venom film was good, it could have been great. With the opportunity it had to make the film Rated-R, it would have given them more chance to work with a darker dialogue and more violence. It would have felt more like a Venom movie to me.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film isn't perfect, but it was entertaining. It's better than the incredible hulk and ironman 3. Its also better than the fantastic four movies. Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock.

You've got to understand that this is a spin off storyline outside of the Spiderman universe and for what it is, it was incredible (in my opinion).Tom Hardy is an excellent candidate to play Eddie Brock, and was even more impressive on-screen. There were tie-ins to subplots of The Amazing Spiderman (and others) that made Hardy's portrayal that much more believable. So all in all, here's the thing, if you're a ""tator tot"" Spiderman fan, you're going to hate this film. If you're a hardcore Venom and comic book fan, like myself, this film may be a pleasant surprise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's self contained but does tease with more to come in the credits.
The film ignores the usual marvel formulaic approach and is more akin to deadpool in terms of being different. It's dark but also has some comic moments.
I really enjoyed this and is definitely up there as one of my favourite marvel films.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Ok so you don't like computer animated action shots.. ok you're not keen on Tom Hardy.. Ok the story was far fetched.. Even professional critics get my goat but at least they get paid for it! Remember everyone has different tastes and opinions but to me some of the reviews of this film are from bombastic stuck up ""I know everything "" twits.

Can't wait to see the next part of it. I felt that story is short , if lengthen would be better. Felt like it was only introductory part so story wasn't that strong that can have a grip on audience. But still it was catchy it isn't that bad as review suggest. 
Give a try, it won't disappoints you.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You shouldn't go into this movie expecting to see a creation of the Venom from the comics. They have completely reinvented Venom and made the move an incredible experience. The movie has an over all dark setting, which sets the perfect tone for the story. They do an incredible job setting up Eddie Brocks story, showcasing his life as a reporter and what corrupt power can truely do when you dig your nose where it is not suppose to be. The relationship between Eddie and Venom is hilarious. They continue to go back and forth inside Eddies mind, making for some of the funniest and surprising lines in the movie. Seeing them learn to bond leaves me feeling incredible as the credits rolled.Supporting characters are set very well in which they play off of Eddies situation making the story that much richer. The villain was very well writen seeing as how he starts off seeming like a guy that is wanting to make the world better, but as the movie progresses slowly comes out to being a villain you will love to hate. Overall, I think this was a fantastic movie and was very entertaining. Whether you are already a fan of the character or someone just looking for a great movie to watch with good action and funny dialog with a great story, then check this one out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Michelle Williams did a great job although her hair looks so fake. Best of all for me was the music and the action moving together. In the last few years the music in these films has been so disjointed and jarring that it has really impacted my ability to enjoy these action films. But this film got it all right!

If you don't like Tom hardy or venom you'll hate it, otherwise it's a damn fun time. It is good for what it is in being that they didn't have the rights to add Spider-Man yet, and the story they had to create. It's dope for what they had especially the budget. You also can't take it too seriously being that it's a superhero/anti villain film so you just gotta enjoy it without being super analytical. There are plot holes but not enough to where I feel like it was bothersome. Overall for an original origin story & where it's STARTING, it's great. Idk why everyone was hating on it so hard, probably because it's weird in its own way and people don't like how weird it can get. You have to be open minded.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It presents a very different story where Venom is now an anti-hero for sympathizing with Eddie discovering that the two are not so different. Tom Hardy fits the character very well and Venom's design is spectacular. They designed it just like the one in the comics and it's much better than the Venom desing from Spider-Man 3. This movie did very well in bringing Venom to life and although its story is different, it's still an entertaining and enjoyable movie. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Mixing up a symbiote with a human was a nice idea and the conversation between them just kept us engaged, although it felt a little bit like giving a soul to the Negative/Black-Spiderman (Spiderman 2, I guess) with a positive connotation.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sure it's not perfect and not of the ""Avengers"" quality but it has amazing action scenes and awesome special effects. When I was watching the trailer I couldn't understand what this film wanted to be but when you watch it you understand everything. The humor works and you understand the awkwardness of Venom and some of the lines he has. All the actors were great! Only issue I would have is the lack of technology. In a digital age you would think there would be more social media involved. But overall it works and couldn't be happier with the film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For one thing, it gave the Venom symbiont a personality such as humor and the ability to care compared to the other movies with Venom that only care about feeding and revenge. I also kind of liked the plot but it can be improved. Too add to it, the symbiont-transformation scenes and really any time there was symbionts on screen were well made. And the last thing I would like to add is the movie's genre. In my opinion, action and comedy are the best kinds of genre in which this movie succeeded at adding both to the big-screen. In conclusion, I would watch this movie again and recommend this film to more people.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie has one of the best actor portraying Eddie Brock and Venom. It is amazing how Tom Hardy saved this whole movie with his acting!
The Symbiote looks OK, but their movement is really well made.
When Venom appears he looks OK, especially since Tom Hardy didn't wear anything that would help animate Venom.
Some jokes are good, some are bad. The jokes would have definitely been better if this movie had been R-rated.
Also Did I mention how good Tom Hardy is in this movie?The story was bland. Nothing new. Just some evil things that want to invade earth and destroy it, simple stuff.
Venom is a villain/anti-hero, but in this movie he is more like the hero, since he doesn't have an enemy that is equal to Venom, like Spider-man. I dislike how Venom was advertised as a movie starring a Villain, but it just feels like another Superhero origin story.
Most of the acting is OK at best (excluding Tom Hardy).
Writing is pretty poor as well, although sometimes it can be good, most of the time it doesn't make sense or some character's motivations don't make sense.There is a lot wrong with the movie, but Tom Hardy makes this movie just one of the best movies of the year!
Without Tom Hardy this movie would have been 3/10, but because of him this movie deserves an 8/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What made the movie great not only lay with its dark comedy, but with its genuine characters. What I see are friends and villains being nasty to Eddie Brock (played by Tom Hardy) which blurs the lines of who is good or truly selfish. The critics and much of the inferior likes of them say that everyone is stale and one dimensional because more screen time was given to Venom. But that's the point, the story revolves around our anti hero and not anyone else, whom played very well in their roles. For example, the villain was a scientist with a God complex, and what him a person was his beliefs into making society better with science, which is an understanding ideal if not simple because we all want things to get better. 
Or his girlfriend, whom everyone says is trash and stagmatic, but that was the point to her character, she IS trash because she dumped Eddie and went with a doctor six months during their breakup. She IS stagmatic because her character is the type who does not share her feelings (like a LOT of freaking girls and guys I know alike). Another reason why I think it's good is because of what the story takes from an unoriginal plot line. I won't spoil anything, however I will say that the plot is your stereotypical patient vs the mad scientist, the story is different though. It's about what we do to suppress the demons we deal with inside, while also trying to be good. And that's a genuine thing people go through, for we all go through our inner struggles and try to be the best we can be (if not then they're complete dirt bags). It takes a moral ground foundation, which Hollywood and several of their paid reviewers hate because they don't want to differentiate what's right and wrong (which is stupid considering the fact we have laws that deal with murderers and pedophiles).In conclusion, this movie is both underrated and cool, taking unoriginal concepts and turning it into their own charm. Which is probably why it's getting more money in the box office is because we love it. Screw the critics, they obviously can't tell what a good movie is anymore because they're so focused on politically charged films to be on screen so that the propaganda that they invest in more money on trash films like that instead of genuine stories (which is another thing I loved about this movie). This movie is comedic, dark, light, and doesn't take itself too seriously, much like its character Eddie, or as the symbiote we all love, Venom.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

No, that's not a spoiler cas that was confirmed months ago lol.When Venom fully showed himself I cried tears of joy. Idk, I may be biased as I'm a HUGE Venom fan (have posters all over my man cave, key chains and even an artists painting of venom). But I'm in love with this movie and absolutely cannot wait for the sequel.Please, ignore the critics. My wife is not a huge fan of Venom (does like Marvel though) and she said it was great. Also if at all possible, try seeing it in MX4D. Was an awesome experience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So you know I'm expecting a lot from this movie, that had taken so long to finally make and was trashed in spider man 3's version. And honestly I don't see why people are saying ""worst movie ever"" ""waste of time""... blah blah blah. I enjoyed it. Was it a great move? No. Was it an awesome movie? Maybe if you were in a good mood or visited the dispensary before you went to the theatre. But in my option it was a good enjoyable movie. Like other reviews said yeah it would have been cooler rated R. And Tom Hardy said they took about 30-40 minutes out so hopeful the Blu-ray has that added to it. So if your looking to turn you're brain off and just enjoy some humor and action (and see my awesome city of San Francisco) go see it! I can't wait for the sequel and the mid credit scene sets it up perfectly. Also this is the first time I ever wrote about a movie but I have to defend it cause it is nowhere as bad as people are saying","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wouldn't say that movie is amazing or something fresh and new. I will say however, and I say this with honesty, that this movie was very enjoyable. As a Venom comic book fan I would say I had so much fun with this movie.Sure, it has some of the bad traits of a bad superhero movie, Bad movie soundtrack, first 30 minutes of the movie feeling super choppy like some of it was left on the cutting floor, a bad supervillain that didn't intimidate the audience at all and some bad CGI that makes it look like a 90s movie.But if you can look past that, I can guarantee you'll have a good time. The dynamic between Eddie and Venom had so much chemistry and interesting to see, it was probably the best part of the film in the whole. Just Venom in particular, he honestly passed my expectations of being the symbiote that I knew from the comics.The reason I think the critics are so harsh on this film is because of them getting the 'Superhero Fatigue Syndrome'. Where people start getting tired of seeing the same movie formula used over and over again. As an avid moviegoer, especially for the comic book films, I do not mind the many films of comic books. The critics always want something fresh, something new that doesn't make them bored. Maybe because I actually like the usual movie tropes being used again and again, I enjoyed Venom.I would say Venom as an R rated film would be great to see, but I do not mind it being either as Venom in the comics isn't really known to be so gory and graphic anyways.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the end, we were both very shocked at how much we enjoyed this. First off, I really liked Tom Hardy. He carried this movie very well. I can somewhat relate to this character too which is also a plus. When Venom finally turns up, he had an awesome voice, a cool presence and even some funny banter between him and Tom Hardy, especially the elevator scene. The action scenes were very well done, and the movie never lets up to leave you bored. I had to use the bathroom the entire movie but couldn't find a spot to go.It doesn't mean the film isn't without its problems. Some of the dialogue was a little cheesy, Venom's motives were a little dumb and even his origin story is a head-scratcher, and even the bad guys taking our hero into the woods when they could have shot him in the lab didn't make sense either. I also thought the climax was a little cheesy and reminded me a bit of how Wonder Woman's final confrontation was.However, I thoroughly enjoyed Venom and glad I went to see it. I'm looking forward to the sequel too. This is just another example of critics not being paid off by Sony, so they decided to bash this movie. Critics need to find other work.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Which is why I came out of the movie scratching my head thinking that it lacked a bit of more action sequences and character development between Venom and Symbiote.

This is NOT that Venom although the 'Parasite' (""What did you say!?"") Didn't like the high pitched sounds like THAT Venom, that's pretty much where the similarities end. (Not a big part of the movie) This does have a good story to it, and while some of the action was hard to follow, ultimately the movie was entertaining and had comedy to it as well.

It's different to your typical superhero film, it's the classic anti hero. But, it worked.The fight and chase scenes were very entertaining and enjoyable to watch, Tom Hardy's acting was fantastic and I just overall loved the whole idea of venom.
I also like how it's not linked to the marvel universe. I enjoy all that don't get me wrong, but it's nice watching a marvel film knowing you don't need to have watched every single one prior!
Downsides to this is that it's not long enough! The plot in certain areas felt slightly rushed, just to get to the next part of the film and so on. But I believe this, overall, doesn't take away from the film itself.Overall, i enjoyed this film. It was entertaining, which is what you want for this kind of film. 8/10.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy was fantastic, Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams was good, The source material was handled pretty well, the CGI was pretty well detailed and well used, I liked how both Venom and Riot looked, moved, and fought, The story made sense and didn't need Spider-Man, The MCU, or an R rating to be good. an R rating doesn't automatically equal a good movie, There's a good amount of violence in the movie, I heard a few people gasp at a certain action Venom did after his first transformation.People seemed to Joke about the fact Venom choosing to stay on Earth for reasons such as being a loser, and looking at the San Francisco skyline. which isn't true. On his planet, he was an outcast, and on Earth, he felt special and powerful, which he didn't feel on his planet.overall, Venom is not a bad film at all. It told a story that made sense, it gave us a fantastic representation of both Eddie Brock and Venom, and it gives us a good look at the future of these characters.Rating 8.4/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I think critics are giving this movie too hard of a time, from it's script to the different tones throughout the film. Personally I didn't have a problem with the script and the different tones helped progress the acts of Venom. Also, I thought the CGI was great (besides for at the end for like 10 seconds). This film truly hits home with the comedy (which is intentional, like I don't understand how people think some of the jokes are not intentional). Tom Hardy was on point with the interpretation of Eddie Brock and Venom. The relationship between the two is one of the best, if not the best, highlights of this film. Overall, Venom was a spectacular movie that hits on all cylinders for me. #WeAreVenom","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They also loved The Last Jedi. Anyways, this movie was pure fun. The tone throughout will keep you engage. One moment it might be a thriller, the next an action packed scene and then onto some funny banter between Eddie and Venom. This Venom is inspired by the Lethal Protector book. In the book Venom is trying to protect innocents while still killing and eating the bad dudes. Venom's personality in the book is very cocky, brash, immature, and angry. His portrayal in this movie follows that similar style. It isn't over the top or too much but fits perfectly.

I couldnt make sense of it until I watched it. It is a good movie but its not Avengers big or Justice League big. Even Spiderman is, by its nature more anticipated then the side character like Venom and there Lies the problem, I just think people were expecting another Billion dollar project like Avengers and all the DC movies.And its not even the the budget, even Justice League, who was not received good (rightly so) was still way more anticipated just because of all the characters. In Venom, there is basically one character, Venom and the bad guy (no spoilers).So keeping all of this in mind, Venom is a Good movie. It is not a masterwork but with what it has, its good. Its witty, fun and serious at times.

Rather just check the audience reviews which are honest and genuine. 
Movie is action packed. The relationship between Eddie and venom is the thing you'll see in the movie which is amazing. VFX are really awesome.

I haven't seen a film so great in awhile and it deserves a 7.6/10.Fall In the world of Eddie Brock, whose lost his girl, his show, and life. He is down in the dumps for awhile until a symbiote by the name of Venom appears. The appearances begin slow, but gets progressively fast until you get to see Venom in half of each scene.I love Venom and Eddie's character and they may not be the best duo but they win the medal for the Most Comedic, Venom cracking a variety of jokes in between the calmer moments and Eddie resisting the urge to fight back. And Riot was a hell of a lot scarier than you'll imagine(which is the main villain).It has good acting, good cast, good CGI, and good storyline. Ignore the critics, love much.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's somehwre in between Deadpool and the rest of the marvel franchises; quite dark and violent, but not quite enough for me.It's pretty in keeping with the comics, some of the scenes feel comic like, it's funny in parts, without going as far as the newer Avenger instalments and exciting. Tom Hardy does a good job and there is rapport between him and venom. I think an 18 rating would have bumped it up higher in my estimations, I would have liked to have see the more gorey bits that were kept off camera.Overall, a good movie, kept my attention throughout.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was as advertised with humor and action. The plot was good for a spinoff superhero movie, definitely not on the level of the MCU, but still good enough to not spew boredom. Tom Hardy is the highlight of the movie. Even Riz Ahmed did well as the villain. Not a typical scary badass but someone you'd definitely love to hate. His girlfriend, however, wasn't convincing at all. Kirsten Dunst or Emma Stone would've been much better picks IMO. CGI was ok but got better as the movie progressed. Overall I'd definitely say it lives up to what I expect. But to give a little perspective, I also loved Man Of Steel and critics decimated that movie. Anywho, I'd at least recommend checking out for yourself. Don't let critics deter you.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The flaws in this movie are blown very much out of proportion. I had fun watching this movie and I am very excited to see the sequel (if there is one). Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock is great and the on-screen relationship he has with Venom is tremendous. I saw one critic that said that this film was not as fun as Thor: Ragnarok. That's where I drew the line. This film wasn't trying to be Thor: Ragnarok. Critics can't identify this film with their favorite Marvel film and it makes their brains shortcircuit, so they leave bad reviews. Shameful. Good movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sorry it wasn't the blood and gore you were hoping for, but the whole point of Marvel heros is that it's generally for the teens (like hello, we were those big eyed teens once and wouldn't it have been crap if we couldn't go watch Venom because it was only for adult viewing??). It was everything I hoped it would be and Tom Hardy is the perfect bad boy to love. I can't wait to see how they bring him into the Marvel fold, as there are two more Spiderman movies to go and we need some spice. Stop being Haters, take it for face value and for me, growing up with these heros and Villans I would say the voice was perfect and Tom did this movie justice!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Wtf ... The first thing I wanted to say but ... but it's awesome! I like this movie. Really. This is a cool film. Let's go in order. I must to say, I compared this movie with Deadpool 2. After the last one I left the cinema in ecstasy, with the thought that I must kick somebody's ass. Graphical effects were cool here, but... If the fights in the middle of the movie would seem to you incredibly cool, then in the final confrontation of two villains it was sometimes difficult to sort out (I hope that the duel between symbiotes is not a spoiler because it was shown in trailers before). Venum here is definitely better than in the last part of Sam Raimi's trilogy about the Spider-Man, so I prefer not to count graphics to the minuses. The Internet is already full of negative feedbacks about the script, as if it is too straightforward, too simple. I don't know about you, but I was going for an entertaining attraction, not a detective or a thriller, so I would not even pay attention to it because I didn't expect nothing surprising. In my opinion, the main thing that makes this film worse than last appearance of his colleague in a red suit from the studio Fox is it's soundtracks. When I was sitting on 2 part of Deadpool, I struggled with myself in order not to launch Shazam on my phone and find the music that was rising me to heaven. It was happening for several times. I still listen to some tracks. After watching Venom, no melody left in my head. Honestly, as soon as I got out of the cinema, I couldn't even remember whether there was any musical support or not. But enough about bad. Because movies are cool. And this especially. The pursuit on a motorcycle shown in a trailer was cool. Extremely. And I formulated it softly. Humor - I really enjoyed it. Here I made a positive parallel with the last part of the ""dead red pool"". I laughed a lot of times and people near me did the same. Well, and the main thing you need to know. If in ""Return of the Dark Knight"" Bane played his role without showing his face completely and often doing it only with his eyes, then he did not have any barriers here. Tom Hardy played his role with great passion. I would say he did the best he could, just an unreally awesome actor. And his constant dialogues with Venom are perhaps the best part of the film. They are built on a remarkable performance of the actor which was always interesting to watch. What can I sum up - the movie is worth watching, it's interesting, fun and dynamic, just what it takes after a hard working week. Therefore, people - hurry up to rest in cinemas with evil symbiosis during yours weekend. It's worth it...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Actually. People are bagging on it because who knows why. Probably because they have nothing better to do. And to be honest neither do I that's why I'm writing this.Tom Hardy was hot. Venom was funny. It was action packed. Really the movie did mostly everything it was supposed to. Although there weren't any shirtless scenes. Only thing I didn't like about this movie was the runtime. They couldn't even try to get it to 2 hours. And not counting credits the movie is literally an hour and a half. It feels like it's running on a very tight schedule and you can tell that it was trimmed closely because there's nothing unnecessary. Even though sometimes that's what makes a movie more enjoyable. But other than the runtime and really the lack of flexibility in the editing room, I think this movie was a hit and honestly I'm sure that the box office will agree with me on that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not going to ""spoiler"" this movie for you however consider my points.1. This movie only follows the original Venom extremely loosely. If you're expecting a movie true to the comic's....look elsewhere as that Venom was a villain, this Venom is a anti-hero. 2. This movie does take a Venom character and creates a origin story so you can understand why they are aligning Venom as a hero. They do keep some of his ""characteristics"" like his unique brand of humor, how he isn't bothered by killing, etc. This movie does a great job showing that, while still allowing my 12 year old son to watch and enjoy without me fearing him seeing too much.3. They create this setting as a Yin and Yang between Venom and Eddie Brock, 1 half a good guy, 1 half a bad guy and their ""bond"" to become one. Tom Hardy nails this performance, if you read this...well done!4. The CGI and special effects are good, even great ""most the time"". There is some instances that this suffers some. Didn't distract me, my son didn't even notice and raved about them for the rest of the night.In the age of SJW/White knights and virtue signalling in major movies, this movie did a bang up job ignoring all that and just showing you a movie that will make you laugh multiple times, build up the plot with well defined ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", enjoy multiple action sequences, and walk away feeling happy you bought your movie ticket (well as glad as you can be with the $$$ cost of popcorn lol).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Venom is quite a cool character as well so that really grabbed me.I'll watch pretty much anything Tom Hardy is in, I'm massive fan and with him being involved in this maybe I need to give more marvel films a chance.Better late than never but Venom 2 is next on my list...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story follows journalist Eddie Brock, who after causing conflict between him and the powerful head of the Life Foundation Carlton Drake, Eddie not only loses his job, but the love of his life Anne. After the Life Foundation acquires symbiotic lifeforms that they conduct on human subjects for testing, things turn deadly quick and a employee of the Life Foundation asks Eddie Brock to expose the truth, only when Eddie investigates, he has symbiote known as Venom take control over him with a purpose of his own. When a symbiote known as Riot takes control of Carlton and is set on bringing more symbiotic lifeforms to Earth, it's up to Eddie and his symbiote Venom to save the world from a global invasion. So first off, Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom is the perfect casting for this film and his performance is highly underrated too, bringing us a Eddie Brock/Venom unlike anything portrayal we have seen before. Michelle Williams's Anne is great as well and I loved the chemistry between her and Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock/Venom. Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake/Riot I thought did his best. Sometimes I felt his emotions he should of have in certain scenes with his character especially when he's being sinister wasn't always the best I felt in some scenes, but he managed to do a great job. The stunt choreography and the set work on this movie is great as well as some of the visual effects. Overall, Venom is highly underrated for the type of film it is, bringing us a antihero's story to the screen, in a way unlike any other. Rating 8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Don't go into this thinking you're going to be watching something similar to infinity war or dead pool, because it's neither. Venom is portrayed as the venom that I know and love and it's film centred and focused on the eddie/ venom relationship. So when people are saying that the other characters in the film weren't utilised, I believe this was well and truly their intention. Also I have no idea why people are saying that the tone of the film is confusing.

Tom Hardy does an fantastic job portraying Venom. 
It makes you think he is the perfect guy for the roll. 
Good background score if not great.

It turns out that I was very surprised and enjoyed this movie a lot. Sure its not great, but it's at least good, enjoyable and fun.Many people ranted about how elements such as the relationship between Tom Hardy's character and Michelle William's character was not good, that the first 30-45 minutes were boring, that the villain of this movie was just not intimidating and kind of dumb, and that the plot in general was messy. Either my expectations for this movie were so low or the people reviewing this are exaggerating because1- there is a reason why Eddie Brock and his girlfriend are in a messy relationship in the movie so obviously they don't have chemistry
2- the Carlton Drake villain is just a jerk in general and psychotic with no regard to human life. He reminds me of my boss, which is why i was totally okay with his portrayal because i hate my boss. Why are people even complaining about this character if the movie itself is about a villain called Venom. 
3- unlike most superhero movies where they throw in an action scene in the beginning, the Venom movie uses these ""boring"" first 30 minutes to build the plot. This is how we get to know Eddie Brock who is just as important as a character as Venom.The pacing did not really bother me unlike most people, but that's because I'm the type of person that is not just entertained by cool action scenes. By far this movie should not be compared to anything with the MCU because this movie is not about Spider Man. It is all VENOM.Tom Hardy, even though he is clearly used to playing oscar leading roles in oscar movies, still proves himself worthy to act out the script he has been given. Yes, it seems strange to see an actor like him in a movie like this, but he does his best and i appreciate it. Especially considering that he did this for his son. So good job Tom Hardy. The movie could have definitely been rated R, but even with a PG-13 rating, it worked. Venom is still the brutal /anti-hero we know and love. For a movie that does not involve spider man, i believe VENOM did a good job.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy was excellent as Eddie Brock. Pros: The back and forth between Eddie and Venom. The story line. Cons: Michelle Williams. CGI. The beginning and the end was the worst for me but the middle made it all worth it. The action was intense at some points to where I could not focus on any one thing. It was almost like a blur, unrecognizable and hard to focus. I would rather this movie rated R. And hopefully Tom Hardy will be back to play the role of Eddie Brock... and hopefully Carnage will not look like Ronald Mcdonald!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Does it make it bad, no. The bases of this movie is entertaining. Tom Hardy is entertaining (& better than Topher Grace). They put so much personality in the character of Venom. He's fun, dangerous, cool, funny, and silly! I know some people we're disappointed the movie wasn't as savage with the violence as they were expecting, but I think the tone that they we're going worked, and I enjoyed it.Yes, the story is kinda 1 dimensional, and so is the villain, but again, for what it's worth, if you go into this movie with the expectation that you'll be entertained, you will. Tom Hardy the reason to see this movie. Nothing much more I can say on that.I enjoyed it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When the first information ""leaked"" online, I was already happy that they are going to make a Venom standalone movie. As most viewers know, Venom is an interesting character who first appeared within the Spider-Man comics, but later got his own comic book series, and appeared in other comics and media too.I went to the theater to watch this movie with mediocre expectations. I was sure it won't be an awful movie, but also didn't expect the best movie of all times. What I've noticed right away is that too many people were expecting to see a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. I suppose that's the reason why all these stuck-up critics don't like it - they expected Infinity War or something like that.The movie starts off slow, and most people won't like that part. I did, because it lets us meet Eddie Brock and properly introduces us into his life. After the 40 minute mark, things get going, and the movie becomes really enjoyable. It has its fun and funny moments, it has a love story that isn't shoved down our throats, but seems natural and realistic, and it has a really well made villain. Tom Hardy has proven his worth times and times before, and this time he was really carrying the movie on his back. His fantastic acting and his natural cocky nature reminded me of the Eddie Brock from the comics. He made me believe that he is actually Eddie throughout the movie. This is especially hard to do for actors who have had a role that defined them for a wide audience, like Bane from Batman did define Hardy (similar happened to Johnny Depp with Jack Sparrow - the ""can't unsee"" effect), but he did really well in this one.I feel like someone behind the scenes really wanted this movie to work, and for me it did. It has its flaws, but every movie does. What's important is that the audience, made of people aged 5 to 50, was pleased and had genuine moments of laughter and excitement. That's what matters in the end.I gave Venom the score of 8/10. It's a fun action movie, and it doesn't deserve the bad reviews that critics have given it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes it takes about 20 minutes to get going but once it does it is brilliant. Hardy is superb as Eddie Brock and his some great conversations with Venom inside of his head. The only thing that I thought could of possibly been done better would be what Venom actually looked like. For all the Spider-Man 3 film gets torn apart I prefer the look of that Venom.

I understand that you may not like this movie, but you don't need to be that harsh just because it isn't a masterpiece. I agree that it had some flaws and it really isn't anywhere near a perfect film, but I had my fun watching it. The action was great, and the performances from Tom Hardy etc. were good too, even if the chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams wasn't that great, it still doesn't mean that the whole movie sucks. I guess I can understand if you're not the biggest fan of the story and the villain in general but c'mon its way beyond Catwoman for example. So yeah I enjoyed it, and if you were going in to expect some masterpiece with huge plot twists and moral, well then ask yourself why you went to go see this movie because you shouldn't expect that from it. My expectations were quite low, so I had my fun there. So, do yourself a favor and ignore the critics on that one. Well if you really aren't a friend of those kinda superhero movies and want to see a film with much depth, twists and perfect story, then you probably shouldn't see it, otherwise, I recommend it. And as I said, just don't expect too much and I'm pretty sure you will enjoy it as well!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some of the action scenes are so over the top it's hard not to laugh. That being said, the humor is actually really on point. I suppose that's to be expected from the guy who made Zombieland. Plus you can tell Tom Hardy's having so much fun when he's filming this. It makes the movie a whole lot better. Unfortunately, none of the other characters are near as good as Eddie Brock. Especially Anne. Anne is a dumb character whom Michelle Williams takes all too seriously. To be a fun character in this film, you have to be like Tom Hardy and just have a whole lot of fun. Riz Ahmed does a similar thing, but to a lesser degree. Really the only other decent character was Dr. Dan, who was a likable and nice character, well-played by Reid Scott. This movie also aims to please its audience, and does a good job at it. Certain scenes fall flat, but others are great examples of fan service done right, catering to nerds of all kinds in great ways.

Tom Hardy is good in the role, as is Michelle Williams. But their on screen chemistry is near non-existent.
Whether it was the way he was written, directed or played, Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake was not angry enough, evil enough or even sinister enough to be this villain.
And finally, Venom can't decide whether it's title character is the real villain or the hero, making the line between a moral and an immoral character hard to distinguish, as Venom passes over both.
But overall, I still enjoyed watching the film to a degree. Whether it's just because it's a comic book movie or not, I don't know, I just had fun watching.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
