I think some people went to space.The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic. When Dom had these small tender scenes, I nearly fell asleep.","204 out of 254 found this helpful.

At the end of the day, I got about 2 ""familia"", 3 ""fam"", and a grand total of 28 ""family"". See if they can break that record next time!Nothing much needs to be commented about the film itself: we launched cars into space last time to destroy satellites, what less could you expect? Screw the logistics, screw physics, and screw Newton with his screwing apple tree! And guess what, if you do manage to stay awake after an hour, you'll start to understand how F&F actually survives the 22-year journey of production --- by not giving a screw! Hey, remember when Gal Gadot's character got blew up? Yeah screw that she quitting DCU so we resurrects her in our universe. Remember how Jakob was the cold-blooded villain just one movie before this? Screw that we got Peacemaker to play him this time cuz it makes great comedy. Remember when not even Dune dared announcing sequels until the first week of release? Screw that, Villeneuve ain't know nothing about making sequels, we bringing Fast 12 on the calendar while releasing the trailer!So yeah, here we are, anticipating Fast 11 next year, when the man named Dominic I-Am-Groot Toretto asserts dominion over Dante the Jokerized Aquaman, of course, with the help of his family.","175 out of 231 found this helpful.

Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.","152 out of 218 found this helpful.

It is now straight up ridiculous what this series has turned into. A street gang, is basically an army of unstoppable and invinsible soldiers. Seriously these people would probably survive a nucular blast - or a more likely scenario, Dom Tortetto would likely absorb the blast and shoot it from his eyeballs. It's gotten that absurd.While this movie is close to being an MCU movie, it is drastically better than the horrific previous movie, which made me rethink what a movie is. Fast X is pretty good for the most part, if you can switch off your brain and not take anything you see seriously at all.The story is as you would expect - bad, but it flows from point A to B which is good enough. The visual effects are great, the soundtrack is pretty good as well. But the clear standout here is Jason Momoa. His acting and character is a blast to watch. Every scene he's in, keeps your attention, because he brings a much needed fun and humorous vibe to this weird movie. Jason was clearly having fun here, because it translates to the screen. His crazy character was more compelling than most, if not all of the previous villains of the series combined. So the reason I am even giving this movie a 6, is solely because of Jason as Dante.Fast X ends of a stupid cliffhanger, but if we get to see more of Dante, I'm up for the next installment. Let's just hope thye don't stick to this trend of making villains heroes by the end, and killing off more people only to bring them back a few years later.","52 out of 73 found this helpful.

It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the ""family"". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real ""family"". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.","238 out of 279 found this helpful.

I mean come on, a gang of street racers, was the top choice by government to stop terrorist attacks? Don't they have special forces? So yeah, lower your expectations because I'm glad I did. And it turns out to be more fun that expected. Hear me out, the movie still lacks of logical explanation for its action scenes. Physicists will cry watching this movie. Put your logic aside and watch it for fun, it's great. Jason Momoa's character was surprisingly good! The villain's plan was so much more malicious than previous ones. The soundtracks, like usual, does not disappoint. Cinematography is nice as well! What disappointing for me is Brie Larson's character. A waste potential.

There is a truly insane lineup of stars in this movie, and somehow the movie finds a way to give every one of them a purpose.Jason Momoa as the bad guy is worth mentioning as being terrific. He looked like he had a lot of fun with the role. It seemed like he was given a lot of leeway to do as he pleased and he used it wisely. He actually gave me a lot of 'Joker' vibes.The film is long at 2 hours and 21 minutes, but it's a rare time when I felt the film could absolutely justify it. For one thing the pacing is incredible and time really does fly by. For another thing there is so much going on and so many cast members who need time to do their thing that it was absolutely necessary. Actually the fact they were able to cut the run time down to only this was an accomplishment.The action scenes and the story are as outrageous as we have come to expect from this series. It's at the point now where you simply have to sit back, switch your mind off and enjoy the ride. And to be honest it's pretty easy to do with this film. I had a great time. 8/10.","260 out of 470 found this helpful.

They were all just going through the motions of a movie with less plot the Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner. Momoa did a cheap imitation of Ledgers Joker and every part of this movie was just one lifted from 1 or more of the previous 9 movies! The car in outer Space was 10 times better than this 10 year olds version of the Fast & Furious. Fast is just a blatant rip off of Point Break. Walker was Keanu as Johnny Utah, Vin as Swayze's Bohdi. Instead of surfing it's cars and in some they actually rob a bank or two. This movie should never have been made as it contains nothing of what made this group of films popular as they are. The next one hopefully will be the last forever! Whoever gave this more than a 1 has to be somebody related to someone in the movie or a 5 year old! This was so bad that it wasn't even funny and the torment lasted almost 3 hours of non stop chaos and pointless plots with going back and forth between too many storylines that were not connected or understandable!

Anyway this is my review for Fast X . It feels like we've had a new fast and furious movie every two years for forever and at this post nothing is off the table in terms of balls to wall action and stunt work. Fast 9 may have gone up high into space however I think most people are in unanimous agreement that it was a new low for the franchise, despite this the film did well at the box office and well here we are with a 10th instalment and it's more of the same. The story is simple, the villain of the film Dante (Jason Momoa) isn't too happy about something that happened in one of the previous films (no he didn't just waste his time like I did by watching fast 9) and so he's decided to not just kill but make Dom and Co suffer because 'never accept death when suffering is owed'🧀. This leads to the usual over the top action fiasco which we go to see these films for as Dom and Co try to defend themselves. Groups of characters end up getting split up and have their own plot lines however despite there being a lot going on in the film it still feels empty and not several hours after coming out of the cinema I've forgotten most of the sideline plots. Some of the characters also get more screen time than others which could disappoint people who have favourites. That could all be forgiven if the action is good right? As after all that's what people are going to these films to for. The first 90 mins I was throughly enjoying this film, there's a bit of build up then a big action scene (the best in the film) but then it calms down after that and really tries to delve into what little plot there is which really didn't work me. I also felt a lot of the action scenes were spoilt as if you've seen any of the trailers then you can pretty much piece together exactly what happens in the full film. The only thing that was a surprise was the mid credits scene which is worth sticking around for. The first half of this film is enough to make it not the worst in the franchise however it's far from the best and Fast and Furious definitely feels like a franchises who's best days are behind it. As we brace ourselves for two more of these films I suggest we take a deep breath and think happy thoughts of Oppenheimer.... Actually that sounds a bit wrong 😬.","62 out of 104 found this helpful.

"2","/10","When ""Avengers"" meets ""Fast and the furious"" everything goes wrong","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9107598/?ref_=tt_urv","schorschi100","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6604048/?ref_=tt_urv","8 June 2023","I am (was) a huge fan of the ""fast and the furious"" series, and of Vin Diesel. Although I am a physicist I can live with ""curbing"" the laws of nature to some extent, provided that this is justified (e.g., through SciFi, magic, alternate universes etc.). It is also OK in movies like Mission Impossible and similar to drive things to the extreme. However, when both physics AND logic go awry it's simply too much.The main villain in the story, (Dante, played by an amazing Jason Mamoa) is simply a joke. He is super intelligent, super rich, super powerful, and a caricature of a sociopath à la Joker. He is able to organize his crimes (which are purely driven by hatred) in such perfect timing across the globe and with access to every possible computer, that his abilities surpass those of Robert Langdon's foes (DaVince code), of Thanos (Avengers) and all James Bonds enemies at once. It borders ridicule. And, the most importantly, makes the film boring.In the next episode they are going probably to have spaceships racing across the galaxy I guess, and Dante will use nuclear fusion to kill.Acting is generally from decent to very good (well it's not Shakespeare after all, so not utterly important), and the cinematography (referring to the effects) excellent. Unfortunately a nice packaging does not salvage a really bad content.Finally, I really abhor cliffhangers, and I seldom (if ever) have seen such an infuriating one. It's one thing to leave things open in a story, and quite a different one to literally stop the action in the middle of the most intense scene, like someone just pulled the plug of the TV. This practically means the producers where so sure the viewer will not watch the next one, that they had to use every means to animate them to do so. Plain awful and tasteless.In a whole this is by far the worst of an otherwise very good series. If you really want to watch it, at least wait until the next one comes out to save yourself the frustration of the unfinished scene.","178 out of 217 found this helpful.

It's even funnier if you get the plot jokes on past entries.Nice one Momoa, nice performance for such uninteresting character in the beginning.Well, after ten movies we all know what to expect of F&F, but this is more like when this franchise started, kind of, with more budget and even more high-end actors (seriously there are at least 2 oscars here, Larson and Theron)Don't judge it too harshly, it's a good movie.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a ""revenge plot"" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of ""I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad"". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.","416 out of 520 found this helpful.

I always give this franchise the benefit of the doubt. I have at least liked all of the movies, even loved a couple of them, that was until F9 in 2021. It has now become a thing to expect that these films will try and outdo the previous installment in terms of insanity, but F9 truly felt like they took everything all the fans had been joking about and just did it all. It went beyond ridiculous to even enjoy. Thankfully, now that Fast X has hit theatres and I had the chance to check it out, it has put the franchise back on track for me, even if it is still almost too ridiculous (stupid might actually be a better word, but in a good way).Directly connected to the events of Fast Five, Fast X picks up ten years later, as the emergence of Dante (Jason Momoa) begins. He is the son of the man they robbed and killed in Fast Five, so obviously he wants revenge. It's actually pretty seamless how they tie it all into that film, reusing old footage and adding new. My only issue with this storyline is that it took ten years for Dante to actually seek the revenge he wanted. Sure, let's just roll with it because if you don't, you'll probably hate the rest of this film too. People have come to expect the ridiculous here, as I said, so as long as that's what you go into this film looking for, you may just be as satisfied as I was.The bombastic action sequences are once again dialled up to a million, but it was nice to see an actual race sequence, even though it felt a little short. The main reason to see this film though, if you're a fan or not, is Jason Momoa. His performance here may just be my favourite of everything I've seen him in. The flamboyance he exudes had me laughing and fearing for the crew all at the same time. I enjoyed the entire cast as always, but Momoa just stood out over everyone else here.I should also mention that you shouldn't be expecting a completed story. Fast X is clearly the start of a bigger storyline to come, as the film ends fairly abruptly with no resolution at all. Almost in an Avengers: Infinity War style, I really want to see what comes next. There are quite a few promises in this film that excite me, so I'll remain optimistic for an awesome conclusion. Let's be real though, Fast X is very, very stupid.This film doesn't hold back in throwing the impossible at you. From Dom flipping over a car with one arm to driving down a dam Hot Wheels-style, it's absolutely bonkers. Again though, it felt like a breath of fresh air compared to the lunacy that happened in F9. Nobody stays dead in this franchise either. There are some big surprises throughout the film, but I'm still not sure how I feel about one of them in particular. It borders on ruining storylines from the past, so there better be a nice explanation in the subsequent movie. Look, I had a great time watching this stupid film with characters I've grown to love, so sue me for reviewing it positively. It has fully embraced everything anyone has ever said about this franchise, so at this point, you should know what you're getting yourself into. If you like these films and are up to date, I say check it out. I had a blast.","43 out of 73 found this helpful.

Surely to god everybody knows what to expect by now, nobody could possibly be surprised by what's on offer. If you've been along for the ride this far, why would you find anything to moan about now? It all got super silly a fair while ago and if you've decided to stick with it as it gets siller by the episode...well, you get what I'm saying, right?The nonsense inherent in the franchise means that people pop up out of nowhere at the drop of a hat - even characters that have been dead for a number of previous outings! - and characters do inexplicable things for incomprehensible reasons but that's all par for the course and you either buy into it or you don't. I do, and I therefore love these movies for what they are - BIG DUMB FUN!The addition this time out of the scenery chewing villainy of Jason Momoa and Brie Larson as Mr. Nobody/Kurt Russel's daughter work well as do the fun cameos - no spoilers here! - so no complaints from me.

This seemed to me like a good point to call it quits. But with the money still rolling in, nobody in Hollywood was going to end this cash cow; thus we have Fast X, the first in a rumoured three part finale (until the inevitable reboot).I've been on board with the franchise since the start, sticking with it as it moved from the street racing world into more James Bond territory, the action getting more and more ridiculous with each chapter. Seeing how each movie would top the one before in terms of craziness is what kept me entertained. But Fast X is just dumb, and it's not even dumb fun.The stunts are more preposterous than ever, but the film is never thrilling, every interminable action scene enhanced by rather ropey CGI (the flames, in particular, look really bad). There are some dreadful attempts at humour (mostly courtesy of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris), and we get all that inevitable crap about the importance of family (if I see the gang having another barbecue I think I'll hurl).And then there's Jason Momoa as villain Dante...I can see what they were going for -- kooky flamboyant psycho capable of almost anything -- but Momoa is absolutely awful, his performance bordering on camp, not helped by the character's dubious choice of attire. It's hard to find Dante menacing when he's flouncing about in a silky shirt. I'll no doubt watch the next two films for the sake of completion, but with Momoa on board it'll be hard going.Fast X is easily the weakest of the series so far, but I'll give it 3/10 because I guess things could get even worse.","560 out of 710 found this helpful.

But it won't stop people from coming out to see what Dom and his crew are up to.The biggest problem with this film (and there are many) is that everyone seems to be in a different movie. Even sets seem to be composed into the background from time to time. It wouldn't surprise if there were three different locations filming at the same time in all of the tax havens for films.The car stunts which are a big draw even are obscured by filming them tighter which almost leaves you feeling what is the point. Also, I feel there were more CG cars than normal for a fast film which was a little disheartening.BBBUUUUUUUTTTTTT, Jason Mamoa saves the film single handedly. You haven't seen a villain quite like this before. Everything about his character Dante is cranked up to 11. He is the drawcard of this film and his backstory is woven clunking into the fabric of Fast 5 but at least drives the story forward consistently.Louis Leterrier is a fine directer given the right material and tone. Unfortunately Fast X isn't one of them. It would have been a very different film with Justin Lim at the helm considering his visual action chops.If you like the fast films it's at least better than number 9.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

This is a part of the allure of the franchise that has been the driving force that has led to 11 films with more on the way. It is not without its flaws, major ones at that, but they're the type of issues that get somewhat of a pass due to the type of movie they're in. In fact, the flaws help make the movie fun.Dispensing with the bad, don't expect the plot to make a lot of sense. It's basic, but convoluted to the point where you just go along for the ride. There's 3-4 too many characters and at least 10-20 minutes worth of run time that can be cut out. But the time we spend with these characters and the added run time do not equal a movie that drags or ever gets too boring. What works is the comedy, action, and a memorable villain (that perfectly balanced being goofy but also fearful). It's not a comedy, but some of the characters and the situations they're in allow natural comedy to happen. What's not natural is the laws of gravity and technology. The action scenes that happen can only play out in a movie like this, so when a bomb makes its way through Rome barreling it's way through 10,000 obstacles, we appreciate its ridiculousness that not many movies can provide.If this were a script for most action movies, it would result in a much lower rating. Fast X has a script that could purposely be bad to make the ridiculous action pull can be more easily swallowed. Quite simply, the only way you won't like this movie is if you don't like this franchise. It's better than some of the Fast movies, not as good as others, but is for sure a fun time with some standout action scenes.","18 out of 29 found this helpful.

A previous film will be retconned in some way to make it even more hilariously convoluted, the family will get even larger and whole thing will act like the biggest and dumbest B-movie telenovela currently going.Judged against the other F&F films though, Fast X improves quite a bit over F9, fixing a fair few problems with a superior antagonist and a tighter run time. Even though it struggles to give all of its characters something to do it remains a great blockbusters that's unashamedly silly, loads of fun and gets the franchise into its endgame in satisfying fashion.Vin Diesel gets to show a lighter side to Dom early on that's really sweet before returning to the usual overly serious presence that still works. John Cena is way better here, finally allowed to play to his comedic strengths and his adventure with Leo. A Perry is the most enjoyable subplot of the movie.The standout performance is easily Jason Momoa. He's by far one of the best villains of the whole franchise and possibly the best. So flamboyant, playful and clearly having an absolute blast. Really leaning into his characters insanity and giving the Fast franchise its equivalent of the Joker.Louis Leterrier's direction is really good, he keeps the multiple subplots moving along nicely and overall brings a mobility to the film that avoids it feeling overly familiar or stale. There's also a nice Transporter 2 reference that proves he was an inspired to choice to make one of these as it fits in perfectly with their over the top nature.The CG looks really cartoonish once again and just like last time it kinda works in its favour and makes every set piece even funnier in its absurdity. The music by Brian Tyler carries over everything that was created in the previous score as well as bringing back the themes that were sorely missed in that one.","35 out of 63 found this helpful.

It's certainly enjoyable and even thrilling at points, but it does lack some novelty. As Fast X speeds the Fast and Furious franchise into its final lap, it can't help but feel like we're going in circles.Fast X follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) as they raise their son away from their enemies and the battles that have taken up much of their time for decades. Dominic's friends and soldiers of the wheel-Roman (Tyrese Gibso), Tej (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) -all go on a mission to Rome, Italy, for an underground government organization. However, the mission isn't real and both the agency and Dom's pals are duped by an old foe that emerges from the shadows to exact revenge on Dom and his family. This villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), threatens to break Dom's family into pieces, so the family must figure out how to save themselves from Dante and new government agents who have Dom in their crosshairs.These Fast and Furious characters used to steal TVs off of moving trucks-now they save the Vatican. These movies succeed most when they know what they are and what you want. It's a rollercoaster, so at a certain point you just throw your hands up and enjoy the ride. Dominic Toretto is basically inhuman by now; nothing can kill him and he can bend the laws of reality and science to his will. Action is the primary draw of these films-story has become secondary as the saga of Dom and his band of street racers turned superheroes cruises into its 11th entry. Fast X, however, goes all in on plot, which feels like a miscalculation. Especially as the second half refuses to reach any kind of conclusion, barreling towards a silly cliffhanger that does little to maintain the stakes the first half establishes. None of the racers we've come to know and love are safe, but the way Fast X wraps up, it's hard not to feel like all of them are.Jason Momoa is unbelievable in this movie as Dante. He's easily the best villain Dom and the crew have ever fought against. This level of gleeful, over-the-top evil is hard to find in any movie, but it's a gift in the heightened world of Fast and Furious. He gets all the movie's best laughs-you almost wish he would crush Dominic's world so we could watch him laugh, twirl, and dance as it all goes up in flames. John Cena's a lot of fun, too. He takes a page from Momoa's playbook, an action hero who loses the self-seriousness and has a good time playing uncle to Dom's young son. Tyrese Gibson is ever a delight as Roman. Gibson always has a lot fun with this role, and he understands exactly what energy he must bring to keep the franchise full of life. Practically every time he comes on screen, the audience erupts into laughter.I give Fast X 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, for some language, frequent intense action and some graphic violence. Fast X zooms into theaters on May 19, 2023. Vroom vroom. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

It's a total mess. But let's try to stay positive and start with a good point.The opening is probably the best part of the movie so make sure you enjoy it. Additionally, all the scenes with Jacob were surprisingly good and funny where on the other hand the scenes with Roman and Tej aren't that funny anymore. Also you need to stay till the Post credit scene. I would say it's worth the wait.But enough good things. The story is very bad. Normally, the action compensates the bad story but this is not the case here because the action is also one of the worst we have seen in a Fast & Furious movie yet combined with even worse VFX. Furthermore, the cars should be a very important aspect of the movie but no, not in this one. The cars play a pretty small part and are just there so they can call it a Fast & Furious movie. Also the movie is too long. We only see bad action after bad action and then learn about how a new character is related to this whole family, just boring.And the most important question: Are the scenes realistic? Not really but after we have seen a car in Space the scenes are relatively realistic.With this movie Universal just wanted to make money but completely forgets about us fans. After we watched it we are forced to watch the next one and spend even more money which is just too bad. Well, I think that was everything and I hope you enjoyed this review.","311 out of 427 found this helpful.

The plot is a poor rehash of the former movies, with nothing new or compelling to it.The performance by the cast is mostly bland, except for Jason Momoa and John Cena. This is the most impassive and drab portrayal of Dominic Toretto by Vin Diesel, and this is especially frustrating, as this is meant to be the beginning of the end of this franchise. The supporting characters are numerous, but due to the short screentime and unceremonious entry they have, they all seem like an endless introduction of cameos. Jason Momoa as the villain of this movie is the best thing. He's charismatic and campy, and his jokeresque performance is refreshing. John Cena also gives a good performance, with a good blend of bravado and hilarity.This franchise is hinged on farfetched action but this instalment is sheer dumb, and the funny ridiculousness that the former instalments have is absent here. The CGI is not good, and the direction and editing can be choppy at times, this is especially poor seeing as this is the sixth most expensive movie ever made, wonder where all the money went, probably to the sprawling uninteresting cast.3.5/10.","39 out of 48 found this helpful.

In terms of media ecology, this may be the most wasteful movie produced in decades. The actors, the props, the stunts, all devoted to shutting down a franchise that blew a tire years ago and never got it patched. The sheer incompetence of this script is clear from the character that Momoa tries so hard to breathe life into ... and fails.

It is also the first in the franchise to end on a cliffhanger. This caught me off-guard in the theater. I had no idea this would be the first of a two-parter. In seems like they're going for a Marvel/Harry Potter sort of finale. Every entry in this franchise since Fast Five felt like it would be the last one, yet it wasn't. Here we might actually be entering the endgame, which I hope we are. These guys aren't getting any younger, and the franchise has been in danger of becoming stale for the last couple entries.I've been a fan of this series since Fast Five. I like the first and fourth films okay, but it was the first one that really drew me in. Furious Six is actually my personal favorite. Seven and eight are okay, as well as Hobbs and Shaw. F9 I like, though not as much as some of the others, mainly due to the absence of The Rock.At this point, you should know what you're in for with these movies. These movies are not high art. They're pure popcorn entertainment. There's a bit of character development to keep you invested, but mainly these films are about the spectacle. If you're a critic watching the tenth Fast move complaining it's not an Oscar caliber drama you need to get your priorities straight. They're about nice cars, fan service, the themes of family and honor, a catchy soundtrack, great effects and cinematography, nice locations, and of course fun, high-octane, ludicrous action set pieces (pun intended).Fast X hits all of those beats. Although, none of the action ever reaches the same level of craziness as the previous film. That's another reason why I hope this franchise ends after the next film. We are now at the escalation problem. Each entry has continuously escalated the stakes and action. In the last film they went into space. Short of an alien invasion, there really isn't anywhere left for this franchise to go without becoming standard and stale. We've seen that happen with Marvel in these past few years. In my opinion, the last couple Mission Impossible film have felt that way.There are also other staples of this franchise present that have annoyed me for years. The film, like all the rest, is longer than is needed, with too many subplots. The fact that everything is interconnected. Each antagonist is either directly related to Toretto or directly related to a past villain. Each time a past major antagonist becomes either a good guy or an anti-hero. Last but not least, people can't stay dead. Death means about as much in this franchise as it does in Dragon Ball. A character can supposedly die in one movie, but they return for nonsense reasons a couple film later. We see that yet again in this one. Despite the cliffhanger at the end, I have literally no fear for anyone's life in this. No one ever dies.The best thing about this film for me, other than the action, is Jason Momoa as the villain. I will say, he's probably the best villain in the history of this franchise, which is mostly due to Momoa's natural charisma, much like The Rock has. I still miss The Rock, but Momoa's presence evens things out for me.Overall, there is quite a bit to take issue with. But I still found the film fun. The film looks great, with amazing action, like all the past several Fast films. And I'm a bit excited for how this seemingly final story arc ends. If you're a fan of the franchise I think this is a must watch.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I guess, wrestlers know how to entertain people, which is something that film-makers have, apparently, forgotten.I expected nothing good after the previous film, but I didn't expect anything this bad. The characters of Dom and Letty are so badly written it hurts. How could you let the main(!) characters drop the ball like this?Speaking of the ball; the idea with the giant, round bomb that has to detonate in a body of water was stolen from the Batman franchise. Are they even capable of creating anything original anymore?The rest of the 'family' continues the trend of becoming more and more unwatchable and unbearable with each new instalment.They probably decided that the cliché of an annoying kid character that tries to behave like an adult for comic relief was a good idea. It wasn't. The kid, by the way, looks like neither of his parents, nor does he look like the baby that Dom brought home years ago. I felt no connection between the boy and the beloved characters of Elena and Dom.But, of course, it gets worse, because we're subjected to the pure torture of having to tolerate the most talentless and uncharismatic actress this franchise has ever seen... Brie Larson. I wanted to put my head in the oven every time she opened her mouth.","44 out of 55 found this helpful.

After Paul Walker died I wasn't sure if they would be able to keep me interested. The last 2 movies (8 and 9) were pretty uneventful and I was kinda struggling to care. I think Charlize Theron being the villain had a lot to do with it. Never really cared for her as the antagonist.Here we get Jason Momoa, whom I'm not a fan of at all to be honest.. but I actually enjoyed how cartoony and over the top he was.

And with this movie is exactly what you get. Hyper exaggerated situations but according to the spirit of the movie, is very entertained. If you want to go to the theater to over analyze a plot looking for an Oscar worthy story, save your money. This is about explosions, fast cars and nonsense action scenes and you will be rewarded nicely in such apart. Said that, I lower my rate because of the effects that look kind of rushed (not all of them). Not bad at all, but does not feel precise, does not feel well curated as we are getting accustomed from other action movies during last years. I saw the movie on Imax, landscapes and colors looks fantastic, sound is good but timing of the effects is the bigger sin of this movie in my opinion, no matter how fake you expect this movie could be. The plot is simple but has a very good addition in the role of the villain that for sure is a plus. Is the one that steal the show. Other additions like Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson are welcomed too. The usual crew deliver well and there are some funny moments with Rome as expected. Worth of seeing on theater? Yes. Is very entertained if you are clear about what are you paying to watch for. Worth of any kind of prize? Not at all. There is only one post credit scene but worth to see it. In summary, a popcorn flick for a couple of hours of nonsense entertainment.","22 out of 50 found this helpful.

It was overstuffed, with character after character, new and old from previous installments, however, many were not even vital or relevant to the plot. They even brought back characters that were killed off in previous movies with no reasonable explanation for how they survived (again). A franchise should do this on occasion, but when you continue to do it, it just gets silly and the audience thinks ""why bother?"" The plot was simple and redundant. A previous villian's family member comes back for revenge. Didn't they do this several times already? Oh wait, and a new friend of the ""family"" is secretly working for the bad guys. Hasn't that been done several times in this franchise too? Also without a reasonable explanation. I was a big fan of the franchise probably up until the 5th movie, where the movies just became downright unbelievable and laughable. We were very bored so we went to watch it, but if I were going as a fan, I would definitely skip this because you will be dissatisfied. There was one highlight to the film. Jason Momoa was a delight.

This was a really dumb, ridiculous but fun popcorn movie or a decent B-movie. That's how you have to look at it and at this franchise. If you like both intentionally, or more often unintentionally, funny and corny scenes/lines, unreal cars/vehicles, ridiculous action and lots of booty, with a solid soundtrack, this is it. Granted could push the violence some more/show some blood at least. It also has hilarious eye rolling tropes, like rug-pull moments where there's this unknown family member or character background this whole time, or just retconning stuff.Overall, it was a fun, though over long and a bit exhausting, insane, stupid action comedy with a great Jason Mamoa who easily stole the whole movie and ridiculous (bad?) cliff hanger.

As an action movie it is not as good as ""John Wick Chapter Four"" which I think is the best movie of this year so far.This movie was directed by Louis Leterrier who directed the remake of ""Clash of the Titans"" from 2010 and ""Now you see me"" from 2013.The large cast includes Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Jason Statham, John Cena, and Jason Mamoa, who makes a great villain.Plus four Oscar winning actresses; Charlize Theron, Rita Moreno, Helen Mirren, and the beautiful Brie Larson. The actors are likable and charismatic.The plot is just an excuse to set up the action scenes. And there is a lot of action. Car chases, hand to hand combat, shooting, and lots of explosions. The action is outrageous and nonsensical and borderline cartoonish. But also entertaining.The film is kind of long at almost two and a half hours. But it keeps moving and is worth seeing on the big screen.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Well I think that's how Fast X was written. It's a mish-mash of the previous 9 films rolled into one with cameo appearances from almost anyone who's ever starred in any of them. The problem is the story is nonsensical - we have jumps to shoots all around the world for no reason at all. We have a few maudlin scenes from the past. And of course (this is not a spoiler as it's now everywhere in the press) Fast X is not in fact the last film of the franchise so there is no closure of any sort at the end. The cast felt tired, going through the motions. I think even they think there's maybe been too many movies in this franchise. The only saving grace here was the wonderfully over the top villain played brilliantly by Jason Momoa - every scene he was in stood out.Yes there's the usual over the top stunts (though personally I thought not as good as some of the previous films) racing for no real point, fight scences etc so the fans of the franchise will probably enjoy it. But as a standalone film and even in comparison with the previous 9, it's a bit of a mess.","121 out of 168 found this helpful.

But this is also pretty fun, and for a franchise which has got both stale and over the top this is not too shabby.What really save this movie, and elevate it above most other movies in this franchise, are the two additions to the acting team: Brie Larson and Jason Momoa. Both are excellent and show how great actors they are in comparison to everyone else. Brie especially is so good she almost destroy the movie because once you put a Oscar winner and one of the best actresses alive today next to the rest in this movie the other actors almost look amateurish in comparison. Plus Momoa look like he is having a ton of fun. So together those two bring this movie up one or two notches.Another thing which is good (for me) is that the action is more down to earth and ""realistic"" in comparison. To some I assume that is a negative, but for me watching them fly cars out into space and flying between skyscrapers it is very refreshing to almost see something believable for a change.Otherwise this is pretty typical fast and furious and this movie will never win any awards. This is not great nor amazing. This is fast paced loveable F&F fun and entertainment. If you love the previous movies you will definitely love this one too.I give this a very generous 7/10 but at least one extra point for Brie Larson whom I would watch change socks next to a wall of drying paint without feeling shame.Probably second or third best of the franchise and very entertaining, but nothing really special.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

I shouldn't have.The story, (for what there is of it), revolves around Jason Mamoa, coming after Vin Diesel because he killed he's Father 10 years earlier, (or maybe he didn't idk) during the vault heist of the 5th movie, so this movie picks up from that point, sadly that is the best part of the movie, because at least Fast 5 had originality and felt worthwhile, whereas this piece of garbage was a waste of time.Whether you'd enjoy this completely depends on what you want from a movie, if you want action + special Fx, then this is right up there with the best, as the action pretty much never stops the entire way through + the SFX are off the chart, it really is a visual treat. However if you want anything else from a movie, forget it. The story is wafer thin, the acting is sub par for the most part, especially Diesel who seems to drift more into modelling instead of acting with each film. Someone please tell him snarling at the camera is not acting. Worse still is the script, it's so cliche, it's cringy. F+ F has always been a bit tongue in cheek, but this time , it's just embarrassing. However of all of those issues, the biggest problem i have is the ending + without spoiling too much, it's a disaster that left me feeling robbed of my cinema entry fee.On a side note, there's several cameos that are fun.Overall though, despite this having some fantastic action scenes + blisteringly good SFX, when you think of how much is wrong with it, you realise the action just doesn't matter anymore. I think it's time to put this franchise to bed now.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

They never take themselves too seriously and never pretend to be the pinnacle of cinema. I don't understand why people don't manage their expectations with this franchise - it is 'switch brain off and enjoy' cinema in its purest form.The action is absurd (but not so unbelievable as it was with the eye-rolling shark jumping in the previous instalment), Jason Momoa gloriously chews every last piece of surrounding scenery and the final 5 minutes of the film along with the mid credits scene are so bonkers that it essentially guarantees my backside will be in a cinema seat for the next film.To all the people critiquing this film as if it were selling itself to the Academy - you're boring.

Fast X story is a bit choppy and all over the place and mostly repetitive and predictable. Actually it just looks like a bunch of random scenes put together with no real story.

The cinematography to cars driving insanely fast to almost every part on the world and cars blowing up is visually pleasing. The acting and choreography by everyone is entertaining especially Jason Momoa. Jason Momoa delivers the antagonist role very well that he is a memorable character in the Fast franchise. A con that I have with the movie is that half the action scenes are unbelievable. It defies reality that it is stupidly insane and cheesy at the same time. Director Louis Leterrier made sure that Fast X was going to be a memorable entry in the franchise with surprising cameos. I cannot wait for Fast 11 on the way. Overall, Fast X is good with its acting, story, and entertainment.

The film embraces the exaggerated and larger-than-life elements commonly found in Bollywood movies, which may appeal to fans of the genre. However, the movie's heavy reliance on these cliches and exaggerated physics can hinder the overall viewing experience for those seeking a more realistic or grounded film.The plot of ""Fast and Furious X"" likely follows a similar pattern to previous installments of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, with a focus on high-speed car chases, daring stunts, and extravagant action sequences. The storyline might involve a group of charming and charismatic protagonists, a love triangle, and family drama, all of which are common tropes in Bollywood films.In terms of the action sequences, the film may take liberties with physics, featuring gravity-defying car jumps, impossible maneuvers, and unrealistic feats of strength and agility. These exaggerated physics are intended to create a sense of awe and entertainment, but they may stretch the boundaries of believability even within the realm of Bollywood cinema.While ""Fast and Furious X"" may entertain fans of Bollywood movies and those who appreciate over-the-top action and exaggerated physics, it might not resonate as strongly with viewers seeking a more grounded or realistic cinematic experience.","34 out of 45 found this helpful.

Everything concerning the reprising characters is uninteresting, nothing about them makes you care anymore, the stakes don't matter and even the camaraderie of the group has also gone cold over the years.The action often surfaces out of nowhere, for no damn reason and then dies out just as abruptly. The dialogues remain cringe & corny, the supporting cast is more or less a distraction, and the dramatic bits are hilariously awful. Vin Diesel continues to be a lifeless stone as expected. Performances from the rest are just as forgettable. Momoa however brings a magnetic energy and is the only one having fun, as evident in his gleeful rendition.Overall, Fast X is another insipid, incompetent & ineffective sequel in the blockbuster franchise that steers past the previous disappointment solely on the strength of its unhinged villain and makes for a mostly bearable & self-aware chapter despite the hollow & forgettable execution. The film is at its best whenever Momoa is on screen and the actor embraces his role with full understanding of the assignment to effortlessly steal the show.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

You never took my car.""The Fast and Furious franchise has always been my ultimate guilty pleasure franchise. However after how mediocre and downright bad F9: The Fast Saga was for me I couldn't find myself to be excited for Fast X at all. Especially since Justin Lin who was initially supposed to direct this movie and helmed the better received movies in this franchise walked away in the middle of production. All signs pointed to this movie being a mess and it is a mess but it's not a complete disaster. There's stuff here that definitely works for me and other stuff that I just wasn't a fan of at all. Which leaves my overall feelings towards this film being mixed.If we're making comparisons Fast X is essentially the Avengers: Infinity War of the Fast and Furious franchise and Jason Momoa's Dante character is the Thanos where all the characters both old and new have to come together to stop him. Jason Momoa easily gives us the best villain I think this franchise has ever seen he chewed all his scenes up like there was no tomorrow. As for returning characters it was nice to see Jason Statham pop up here although he doesn't have much to do. This franchise continues the theme of having villains join Dom's family. As John Cena who was the main villain in the last movie essentially becomes the cool uncle to Dom's son in this movie and Charlize Theron just completely does a 180 and switches sides and spends most of her screen time opposite Michelle Rodriquez but hey if that means we'll get to see more of Charlize in this franchise going forward I'm not complaining. I really also liked Brie Larson's character here she's a welcome addition to this franchise for me and you can tell that she really enjoyed being apart of this I hope we see more of her character in Fast X: Part 2.Dwayne Johnson also makes his return to the Fast franchise in a post credit scene. While that normally would've gotten me excited to see the next movie you have to wonder if this even would've been a reality if Black Adam ended up being a massive success for him.So yeah on one hand all the fight scenes, Jason Momoa on cloud 9 and the cast alone make this worth watching on the other hand you have bad humor, a disjointed story and awful dialogue (Chris Morgan as a writer was more detrimental to these movies than I thought) which hold me back from putting this movie on the same level as Fast 5, 6 or 7. The other big problem is this movie literally doesn't have an ending it just ends on multiple cliffhangers and there's no real resolution to anything. I'm going to be honest while I did enjoy some stuff here I don't know if I'll even care anymore by the time Fast X: Part 2 releases in 2025. Why didn't Universal shoot the movies back to back? So while I did enjoy Fast X more than both Fate Of The Furious and F9: The Fast Saga by the time this ended I was left unsatisfied because this feels like a teaser trailer for what will ultimately be Fast X: Part 2.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

If you expect some kind of enlightened awareness or actual plot and character building, nuh-uh. You want substance with action, watch Sisu. You want charcter arc, watch Nefarious. If you want mindless action with just, midless action, watch Fast X. The movie is not horrible. It delivers exactly what it's predecessors did (aside from the first film, which I found unique at the time). This franchise has been built on escapism and spectacle. It's a franchise that only requires you to watch and be visually entertained. A franchise of films that does not expect you to think but to simply be entertained. It's turned out to be a great formula obviously given it's longevity. Thus, Fast X isn't horrible. It's just simple entertainment and it knows this and that's the point. Sometimes it's just nice to watch a film that you can just watch and not think. Stallone did it, Van Damme Did it and so on. Action films are like a nice cheat day while trying to eat healthy. The only fish out of water in this film is Jason Mamoa. In my opinion, he stole this movie. He pulled the Joker card and it paid off for him. Some say he was too much but I say he could have done even more. He did a wonderful job of playing over the top which is why I give this movie a seven instead of a five. Two stars for Mamoa. In closing, this film is not awful. You want awful? Watch Marvel. At least this film is honest in what it is.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

We even learned that ""you don't need an oxygen when you have a family"", but now it will also remind you really old movies where car chase was shot in low speed but has been played twice as fast in the movie in order to look like high speed chase...Personally, I can say two good things about this movie:

I enjoyed Jason Momoa's silly, crazy villain as it presented something different than just another stoic, stone faced, I'm tougher than you character. This isn't the end and I'm not sure if the next one will be either but I for one will be anticipating Fast 11 or Fast X part 2, whatever it will be called.

This big ball-bomb scene in Rome reminded me of a game that I used to play with similar but smaller ball that you had to move to the end. Anyways. A lot of chewed topics. A lot of cringe. Unsuccessful villain and hoping he doesn't become one of the good ones in the future movies.

While they did have their moments, after part 5, the reason why I watched these films was to roast the stupidity with my friends and hopefully to get some enjoyment out of it. Everytime I wondered what science defying spectacle they were going to shock me with but sadly this time, everything was rather normal by the standards of the franchise.In Fast X, the family of racers turned secret agents goes up against a new omnipotent villain named Dante who is a hybrid of Mugatu From Zoolander, Tom Hardy's Charles Bronson and Jared Leto's Joker. Dante is on a mission to make Dom suffer but over the course of the movie, it's the audience who ends up suffering the most. Unlike the predecessors, there weren't any cool elements, enjoyable fight sequences or laughable moments to make the experience worth suffering through. Considering that cars are a superpower of the franchise, there weren't enough car related sequences either.Even though there is an action sequence with blasting music every 5 minutes, I actually felt bored most of the time. On one side it's the general cacophony of the events and poor VFX while on the other, it's the lack of this logic defying craziness that I have come to expect. When I wasn't bored, I was cringing from the dialogue and painful head splitting humor. Oh, and when did John Cena go from a cold blooded murderer to a fun loving uncle?Fast X is a pure set up for the sequels as the story dashes between geographical locations while shoving too many characters and giving some of them around 3 minutes of screen time. I have obliterated the past 4 movies in my reviews but I have never been bored while watching them. It's neitehr grounded like the first four movies nor is it over-the-top like the next five. Better than Fast Nine but still hazardous to the human brain.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.","114 out of 168 found this helpful.

The 2 sequels after were sounds great. I love you. See you later, but not spectacular. So the franchise reinvented itself into a spy / marvel movie universe. And in the beginning it was great, but then lunacy of just how far unbelievable could go....yeaSo I take these movies for what they are. They turned into 80's macho movies. And I'm ok with that. Hollywood has always delved into the absurd and unbelievable. Then the movies morphed into marvel esque superhero stunts and abilities and I still enjoy them. Are they fantastic movies ?....no. But they entertain. An inclusive cast has made more people become fans and that keeps them going because Hollywood can't ignore profits like this.Just wondering why this movie had no ending given the fact this was supposed to be the end.The post credit scene with the Rock...shows that money grabs are more important than a diesel- rock macho feud. And with no ending, we are forced to watch the next movie with the rock...which Honestly is good for him...since he has come off bad a person since destroying DC movies and some careers. But regardless, as long as he makes good movies, we will all watch.All that aside,...it's a good action flick. Decent effects. Very long movie but doesn't feel like it because of the pace.This is definitely an ""Expendables"" movie as nearly every very big name gets a role in This movie.I just hope they don't spend with a Shaw movie. As Hobbs is just the rock playing the rock. And I've seen that movie to the T too many times.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I get ahead of myself. Let's start from the beginningMomma always taught me not to write angry. My local AMC being a scant 2 miles from my apartment, I decided it was as good a time as any to heed that axiom. Perhaps the brisk walk home would calm me down. Settle my nerves. Perhaps I could even devise a less profanity-laden diatribe of how awful this film was and approach it in a state of zen.The walk worked a tad but when I started writing I could feel the seeth start anew. The endless cliched dialog recycled from countless other films, the stale humor way past its expiration date, the ok action sequences that were better done in previous Fast and furious films. The Ending... all of these intertwined to leave a rancid taste in my mouth.Even the parts of the film that worked (Jason Momoa makes for a reasonably fun villain, Statham is always a joy to watch doing his thing) are fleeting, in the later's case his part is much to small, in the former the long bloated runtime dillutes his appeal somewhatIs it an all together AWFUL film?

It's just not as good.Nonetheless, Fast X delivers decent fun that is to be expected from this franchise. Even though the film feels relatively small and held back, probably saving the biggest and most ridiculous ideas for the next one (or the one after that), the film still includes a scene where Dominic Torreto uses a burning helicopter as a weapon, with power of his ""Car-Fu"". The film is littered with those ridiculous moments throughout, just not as stuffed or insane as previous films. At first its action seems generic and does not stand out among endless stream of blockbuster destruction and chase scenes, it ultimately becomes satisfying enough to enjoy. And surprisingly, the movie seems to age not badly in my memory.Besides the action, there are location establishing shots with drones, trap needle drops, and racing. It all feels like a Fast & Furious film. Makes you feel you are traveling across the world with the characters. That is what stood out to me the most. At least from my first impressions, it relies on action less than what I expected, and there are lots of characters traveling, meeting up, cracking jokes, etc. Of course previous films did this but this one leans more towards that 'chill' aspect.You may think the film might be boring and sluggish based on my observations, and some definitely will feel that way, but the fact that there are so many characters and storylines happening, made the film far from boring. There's a lot to take in, but is it necessarily a bad thing in this case? Also, since this film features (almost) everyone that has appeared before, I completely forgot about a couple of characters existence after their first (and only) scenes, only to be reminded of them in the end credits where the actors names appeared.Even though Fast X saves & relies a lot for/on the next film, and only time will tell if it was a right decision, I still had a good time watching. Daniela Melchior hot, Jason Momoa great, and the end credits have a great Bond-Style animated sequence with YoungBoy song. That is pretty neat if you ask me.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The Fast and Furious franchise is critics-proof as its strong fan base would anyway watch it without bothering about a review. Quite like a Salman Khan film of Bollywood! So, digging deep in to its 'intolerance' towards logic or physics would only be an exercise in futility!!This time, the focus is on family apart from the regular car chases. Trust me, you will hear the word 'family' at least ten times during its two hours of runtime. Vin Diesel has certainly come a long way from part one of this series, which always manages to up the ante on the action front with every sequel. The action sequences are truly awesome with the plot cleverly woven in to an emotional bond between Diesel and his kiddo. Jason Momoa as the main antagonist, is fantastic.As an icing on the cake, there is a wonderful Paul Walker tribute and a surprise package in the end credits which indicates a further sequel. Bring it on. Fast!!Regards,

Honestly speaking this is the best one I have seen since furious 7. It reveals good nostalgia with the new elements added. Some good throwbacks and refrences. Even though everyone is hating on how it's over exceeded and dragged with same plot lines the movie still doesn't bore. The movie's plot is pretty much a normal Hollywood rivalry slick but the action sequences used to portray and show the plot add the excitement. The sequences might be over the top for some but has the ability to create intensity everything looks real the cgi is good. The sequences are made to watch in premium format theatres. I watched in imax but I recommend dbox to feel the cars. Speaking of the performances mostly the actors are good. The villain Jason mamao stole the show on this one. The rest original is also good as the series goes on. The one that's underwhelming is Jason satham. It's not because of his acting is the role they gave him he was pretty much wasted. Rest aside the movie ends at a cliff hanger. There is a cameo and tease of an old character returning. Really waiting for the next one for a sequel. Good hype.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Having previously enjoyed the well-made escapist nonsense of this franchise, I eagerly anticipated this action-packed joyride. But the reality falls short of the high-octane thrills and heart-racing moments we've enjoyed during this long-running, beloved series. Directed by a new visionary, Fast X struggles to find its footing, leaving me with a disjointed and lacklustre experience.Though intended to be the cornerstone of the film, the plot feels convoluted and overstuffed. The narrative attempts to tie up loose ends from previous entries, resulting in a tangled web of unresolved storylines and contrived twists. The themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, which once resonated deeply, are now lost amidst the chaos of overblown action sequences and cheesy dialogue.Unfortunately, the once-charismatic characters we've grown to love seem to be mere shadows of their former selves. The lacklustre performances by the ensemble cast dampen the film's impact, leaving me yearning for the chemistry and charisma that once made this franchise shine. The newcomers fail to make a lasting impression, and their interactions feel forced, lacking the organic camaraderie we expect from a Fast and Furious film.While attempting to inject fresh energy into the series, the direction falters in execution. The pacing is erratic, with frenetic action scenes abruptly juxtaposed with moments of forced sentimentality. The director's attempts to reinvent the franchise fall flat, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.The score, cinematography, and production design, once standout elements of the Fast and Furious films, fail to leave a lasting impact. The familiar pulsating beats and slick visuals that defined the series are noticeably absent, replaced by generic choices that fail to elevate the overall experience. The special effects, too, lack the finesse and attention to detail we've come to expect, leaving action scenes feeling artificial and detached.The editing further exacerbates the film's issues with jarring cuts and questionable transitions. Scenes that should have heightened the tension instead fall flat, as the editing fails to maintain a cohesive flow. The dialogue, filled with clichés and uninspired one-liners, adds little depth to the already weak characterisations, leaving me longing for the witty banter and memorable lines that once made these films a guilty pleasure.While Fast X attempts to recapture the essence of what made this franchise a global phenomenon, it falls short in almost every aspect. As a viewer, I felt a palpable sense of disappointment, longing for the days when these films delivered heart-pounding action and captivating storytelling. It pains me to say that Fast X fails to leave a lasting impact, leaving me questioning the franchise's future.Fast X is a lacklustre entry in the series, struggling to find its place amidst a convoluted plot, underwhelming performances, and a misguided attempt at reinvention. Despite its best intentions, the film fails to deliver the thrills and emotional resonance that made its predecessors successful. Fast X is a forgettable and disjointed experience that falls far behind the high standards set by the franchise-strap in for a disappointing ride.","61 out of 88 found this helpful.

I'm happy to report I was mistaken! I'm a huge fan of the series and all of its sheer ridiculousness, and this is the best F&F movie since the 7th. Aside from one weirdly out-of-place cameo, longtime fans (or at least those familiar with the F&F universe from ""Fast Five"" forward) will be rewarded with multiple surprise appearances. Jason Momoa KILLS IT as the series' best villain to date, and outdoing Charlize Theron ain't easy!Yes, the criticism that following an F&F plot is increasingly akin to keeping track of all goings-on throughout the MCU is fair, and while an early flashback sets up the needed retcon of ""Fast Five"" to add Momoa into the mix, from there the movie deviates substantially from its successful formula for all but a couple of its installments. It also includes a few somewhat inexplicable plot points, like how Queenie happens to be in Rome when Dante unleashes his evil plan.The criticism that the movie is holding back in a few ways - presumably to save some major action pieces for the finale, which per Vin Diesel may now involve TWO more movies instead of one - is also fair, but OTOH still features some EPIC ass-kickings. Perhaps the most surprising in the bunch comes about 20 minutes into the movie - the Torettos receive an exceptionally surprising late-night visitor - and serves as a VERY stark reminder that none of our heroes' previous megavillains holds a candle to Dante. Deckard Shaw targeted all of Dom's family (blood relatives and BFFs), but considering Dante handily outsmarts the world's most notorious criminal, the entire team (including Shaw!!) looks legitimately worried at what he might do.DO NOT MISS THE MID-CREDITS SCENE!!! It is both crucial and shocking, and I am VERY hard to shock. This one did it, and it's up there with the shock drop at the end of ""Fast Five"" that Letty's still alive.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Upon learning that a mission that Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludicris), Han (Sung Kang) and Ramsey (Natalie Emmanuel) are undertaking in Rome is, in fact, a trap, the rest of the team try to save them but are framed for a terrorist act and driven underground. With the help of Mr Nobody's daughter Tess (Brie Larson) Dominic is given a chance to go on the offensive.By now, we're at the point when you know what you're going to get from these films. Expensive stunts where the laws of physics don't really apply, lots of mumbling about family and a villain who will be their best friend in the next one. That this film actually calls itself out on some aspects of this predictability is probably to the films credit, and there is a twist in this, using this prior knowledge, that I genuinely didn't see coming. The stunts, visual effects, etc all are reasonably good, even if perhaps some of the fire effects are a bit disappointing.The story divides all the 'family' up into their own subplots, some of which are better than others. John Cena inexplicably (but welcomely) decides to forget the personality he had in the last film and instead play his character like Peacemaker and his scenes are great. Contrast that with the Roman, Tej, Han and Ramsey scenes, which involves some of the least natural and least compelling banter ever committed to celluloid, and that's before the highly unwelcome Pete Davidson cameo. The films MVP though is Momoa, who plays his character like he's the Joker. Undercutting the pretend masculinity of the series, with a fun, occasionally psychotic and always camp performance. He has one scene in this film that I think is perhaps the most surprising thing that the series has ever done.Overall, I feel positively about the film, even if the decision to split this specific story over multiple film feels unnecessary and there are bits of the storyline that work better than others.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

One of my friends fell asleep in the cinema. The cliffhanger handing is also frustrating.The action does not feel as exciting, because not only is there too much, but also too much too fast. Furthermore, the CGI has taken all kind of thrills of it. It has become completely unrealistic.Jason Mamoa is as random of a villain as he is lackluster and forgettable.The rest of the cast is also mediocre.While F9 was a parody, Fast X is a parody of the parody.

We all know to expect ridiculous logic defying action and stunts from them at this point, so if you can't watch these movies and enjoy them for the mindless entertainment that they are why are you even bothering at this point? These films are meant to be fun humorous means of escape from reality and you aren't supposed to take them seriously. This isn't the best movie in the series and I won't pretend that it is but I had fun watching it and that is all that matters at the end of the day. If you can't sit back and enjoy mindless entertainment, don't see this movie. If you can, I highly recommend this because it's ridiculous in the most fun ways you've come to expect and love these movies for being.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Dante is revealed to be the previously unknown son of Hernan Reyes, from 2011's ""Fast Five,"" and there is a homage to ""Fast Five"" in the opening safe-stealing scene, which is the best, and possibly the only, 5 minutes worth watching out of this 2+ hours movie.Let me put it straight up front - Fast X is NOT a good movie. Other than the soundtrack that has some nice tracks in it, everything else is either amateurish, in the good case, or absolutely insulting at its worst. Starting from a horrible camera job, through ridiculous CGI scenes, over to plastered acting and useless dialogue, ending in a forgettable and boring story that will challenge you to sit through it, even if you enjoy all the explosions and matchbox-style cars moving around in countless impossible ways. The arguably best character, Dante, is very quickly becomes annoying and laughable.Now let's be honest, the F&F franchise was never known for physical accuracy, it presented flying cars ties to a hook wire, jumping over bridges and multitude of other stunts. However there is one point where too much is just too much, especially if the big budget is thrown at getting big names instead of getting a good production company that can get the top-notch visuals that a movie like that should have, and hire some writers that actually take pride in their job.According to a report from The Wrap, the budget for Fast and Furious 10 was an eye-watering $340 million, the largest in the series. On the flip side, it made $320 million worldwide, so it will be a break-even endeavor. I wish it has lost $300 million, maybe that will bring an end to movies like that, that their entire purpose is to create lines of viewers that look at the impressive roster of actors (don't forget 4 of them previous Oscar winners) but did not wait to read the reviews beforehand.I was not one of the people that formed a line in the theater for a movie like that. For your sake and the future sake of the industry, I implore you not to be one of these, and please don't do that for the unavoidable Fast 11, just wait for the small screen. I was a big fan of the franchise at it first steps, but this movie turned me into a hater. Seriously. Exact score: 41 / 100.","13 out of 16 found this helpful.

-Say what you want, but for me the music always has something for me in a Fast movie
-The track list has attitude and energy, just like the movie, a mixture of songs that have that Fast edge I've always enjoyed.-There are techno beats and upbeat songs during transitions that I love as they reset the tone and make me want to purchase the soundtrack.-Attitude is in the books with the rap songs and give you that edge that you absolutely love in these movies when it comes to our crew.-But there are those great tracks that seem to blend everything together, these champion songs that are the definition of fast and furious and I loved the end title song the most and the way it sort of brings everything togetherThe Sound Editing
-It's a movie about a lot of visual effects and you need sound to maximize the chaos that is to come.-The movie uses big booms to help get that theater experience, resonating sound factors that shake the walls and give you that adrenaline rush.-The actions scenes are loaded with the same energy, guns blazing with the powerful bangs, punches having that thump and kung fu like finish, and of course plenty of aggressive energy to make you drawn into the moment.-And of course, when the cars and bikes are revving, or the vehicles show up out of nowhere... you get that amazing revving sound that we love as the engines heat up.-This of course leads to these very intense moments that this movie is much about and I loved that aspect for helping make the cheese factor a little more engaging and fun.The Pace
-The movie is fast and will leave you feeling little ""dead' time in the grand scheme of things.-Like the cars, the movie turns the ignition and keeps the gas running at full speed to get as many action moments in the movie as they can.-it's got enough use of the brake to put a story in, but doesn't harbor too much to get lost so that we get back to the high-octane moments and speed as Dom battles Dante.The Character Inclusion
-the movie has a lot of characters, and continues to add more to the roster in this ever epic soap opera.-Fast X does an okay to good job handling them, and making sure that their inclusion is worth the investment.-Is it perfect? No! There are characters that are there for a one-off and might or might not reappear in the next installment should they keep making more of these movies.-You'll get adequate time with just about all the group and that is hard in this day and age.DISLIKES:
The Plot's Fractured Nature
-Unfortunately, with so many characters and action, the plot is a bit more scattered than I would have liked.-Practically all of the other movies have been set one story with a few interludes, but it was linear and moving towards a goal.-Fast X does this, but it's really four congruent plots, working in tandem, and trying to build to some epic moment.-It didn't work for me as much, and found this approach shorting us something better cohesive and more unique stories.-So many pieces require more attention to remember what's going on, and trying to not be annoyed by the interruption in the other stories.Predictable Plot:
It's easy to determine where most of this is going, and sadly, that factor takes this movie closer to the stale moments that I long for something to twist it up.-In this case, the movie really has to work on not undermining the stakes that they are trying to establish, to keep the danger factor high and the suspense with it.-The movie is very easy to read though, the signs, the importance, the questions all obvious that I had 90% of the movie down.-And the big cameo is easy as heck to predict without spoilers. Yes, that's how easy it is to predict where the series is going.Cheese Factor Out Of Control
-It might be expected, but the movies continue to push physics to levels that are a bit too much for me.-Some of the things have a shred of belief, but others, like driving down a dam in the trailer, are a tad eye rolling as the movie magic and drama take over.-It's there for that attitude, the cliché, and the series, but like Sharknado gets to a point where it stops being fun because of how corny it is when it's trying to be serious. Five was that balance for me, but since then continues to move further and further away from the realistic pulse.Too much action
-You heard me right... there might have been too much action... for an action junkie.-Fast X has these moments that though cheesy, again work and are great sequences that I was invested in as I watched the cars move to stop the plan of the bad guy in their tracks.-But other action moments were... not needed. Several fight scenes with fists were meh, and some of the shootouts even felt low key compared to what they've done in the past.-In addition, some of the scenes got a tad too free with the logic and the building moments and moves became corny and tacky, as they bloated the film.-Applause to much of the action, but it might have been better to pull things together a bit more and try to finish strong rather than over the topThe Bad Guy
-The Fast series is all about these epic bad guys who have some factor to it.-The series went from stereotypical crooks, to elite bad guys with skills James Bond would love to have, making them memorable.-And this movie ups the ante, combining both of the worlds giving you a crazy villain who Is like a sillier version of the Joker.-Momoa really does well as the bad guy, and the direction they took admirable as there is reason, skills, resources, and a threat that carries throughout the movie.-It's sinister, it's scary, and it's what the series needs to help freshen things up and I really enjoyed that antagonistic feel.The Ridiculous Nature Of the Movie
-This series has turned this into a staple and one level, I really like just seeing how far they'll push the envelope before going too far.-The movie is ludicrous to say the least, but it works and the silly moments have a little more grounded reality than some of the other installments, though not by much.-It works with the pace well and that helps blunt it and those who just like laughing at reality's bending, will get their wish with this film.The Action, To An Extent
-And as I said, the action is rather dynamic in terms of it being an X movie, again bringing that diversity you mike like.-Want punching moments? It's got it! Need action shots with guns, it's got it. Want the impossible in a car, it's more than got that. And it all blends to keep things moving and bring the edge and skills with it.-That action is a staple of this movie, and with the sound effects may be the drawing factor to seeing this movie in theaters.The Movie Not Standing Alone
-This may be the biggest thing for me, the movie doesn't' stand alone.-Almost all the Fast and the Furious movies stand alone. They do have connecting elements, but, for the most part you have the story contained in a movie and make connections to help tie things together.-This movie though, is a set up movie, and feels like it. The plot lines, the decisions, the buildup and the ending are all for the next one or two movies that they seem to have.-It's not the worst, but, in doing this approach, I felt they robbed the organization, feeling, and stakes of the movie knowing there was so much more of the predictable plot.-Thus, this movie may have had too much going on for me to be the most enjoyable experience of the Fast movies.The VERDICT:
Fast X is okay in my book, but it's just a movie series that continues to lose track of the roots and goes into the anime centric vibe of the series. The good news, is that the series is just stupid fun, a ludicrous story with lots of stunts and CGI to get lost into. It plays well with the characters, adds those special moments that rock the theater, and keep it a pace much like Dom's car, fast, powerful, and somehow resistant. Yet, the movie is doing no favors with fractured plots, and continuing to draw out stories and try to suspend the predictability is not working when they don't commit. The movie is at the point approaching soap opera levels, and this film crammed a lot of stuff that the bloated time did little justice with such a chaotic and predictable tale, with action that sometime felt forced. Is it the worst? No, not at all. But this movie is not standing on its own and leaning heavy to the next movie to come and what other changes to the timeline they want to do. Overall, my scores are:Action/Adventure/Crime: 7.0-7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Yes, I understand this is a film where you turn your mind off and just enjoy the action but c'mon! The plot in Fast X is so far fetched and the action set pieces just ignore all laws of gravity, that it's really hard to enjoy this film. Vin Diesel even seems to be phoning it in here. The only one who seems to understand the assignment is the newest Villian played by Jason Momoa who is absolutely ridiculous in a good way. Jason seemed to channel his Heath Ledger knock off impersenation here and for the most part it works. Also please be original and stop retconning events, it comes off being lazy.

This was another milestone for the Franchise like Fast Five in which they officially become Superheroes. Jason Momoa, puts a little too much pineapple on that spices ham but as villains go the Fast & The Furious franchise are definitely Avengers level (in terms of quantity of big bads)
Momoa plays the family of a past Big Bad and in very Helmet Zemo from Captain America, the Civil War way, he puts together a devious plan to destroy Dom's family like Dom destroyed his.Has all the marks for a Fast Formula. The Gang's all here and everyone gets their moment to shine bright which is amazing cause the gang gets bigger every go around. Including the Big Bad from the last movie becoming part of Dom's family.But the best part...This movie is truly like a car going 240 miles an hour and never shows any sign of stopping. The action sequences are epic. This time around Vin Diesel plays more into Dom's impossible feats as they become more normalized in this film.Granted the only downside is that if you've never seen the previous nine movies you may not get everything, but the action is too fantastic not to sit back and enjoy the ride.This totally makes up for Fast 9 which I did not get into, but I think I got to see this movie again and again before it leaves the theatres.","18 out of 49 found this helpful.

After that it's all downhill.The overall plot is *ahem* fair I guess. You have probably figured out that Jason Mamoa is after Dom & co. More than that is hard to explain without starting to give away spoilers or, more so, start raving about the gargantuan plot holes. James Bond has nothing on Fast X in terms of ""WTF's"". Marvel superheroes? HA! Sissys in comparison! So what spoilers you think if the story is so bad? Well there are a few but they're only surprises because of the lack of any sense of logic.By now you're probably wondering why I didn't give it just one star?

The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the ""family"" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from ""Cipher"" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of ""Tej"" (Ludacris) and ""Roman"" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yeah, I know! Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto and his family have outsmarted and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they must confront the most lethal opponent they've ever faced. Fueled by revenge, a terrifying threat emerges from the shadows of the past to shatter Dom's world and destroy everything -- and everyone -- he loves.The Fast and Furious films are just getting very repetitive; there were multiple scenes in this one where I was like ""I think I've seen this before."" They obviously tried to do something new with Jason Momoa's character but it was just weird in my opinion. I don't know if it's Jason's acting or if it's just the character but it was really off. Although there weren't many CGI and green screen scenes, they were pretty bad.Now on the bright side, the racing scenes were pretty exciting and intense. The action was a bit over the top but if you ignore that, those could be seen as crazy fun especially with the great cinematography. It was pretty funny sometimes too. There were also some cameos and returning character which were pretty cool.So taking into consideration that it's a Fast and Furious movie, I would say that it was pretty fun to watch.Score: 6.5/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Dante (Jason Momoa) is the unseen son of Hernan Reyes. After his father's death, he vows revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his FAMILY.I see what Jason Momoa is doing. He's trying to create this franchise's version of The Joker and I like it. He has a solid origin story which ties directly back into the franchise's most outrageous chases in a franchise full of outrageous chases. He is the best part of this movie. On the other side, the worst part of this movie is the writing of the Rome part.I'm not sure if I should be demanding good writing from this franchise, but Rome is the inciting incident for this two movie run. It needs to be tightly written. I don't get why Dom and his cohorts are automatically outed as the villains almost immediately. There is a bomb rolling down the road and the cops are all shooting at Dom like that's going to stop it. There are all kinds of questions being ignored by the authorities and the media. The premise is problematic at best even with the eventual reveal about the new character. He doesn't control the Roman cops in that chase. I can see what Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin are trying to do. It's falling a little flat although this one has to do some heavy-lifting storywise. That's not this franchise's strong suit. I'm not even going to touch the resurrection. This franchise doesn't care and the audience should know better than to question it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Everything about this movie is wrong, from the characters to the script, the plot, the acting, the story line even the music. It was very painfull to watch after going into the theater with a real F and F mindset. There was not one moment in the movie that was going into a direction that would save it.

Sometimes silly but at the same time this is what we have come to expect from these movies so we might as well move on and just take these movies for what they are at this point. That silly stuff aside...
The movie isn't as bad as the reviews state? I mean they did a lot of history to now connections which I thought was cool and they tied in A LOT of characters. Old and new. It seemed like everyone got their own fight scene which was cool and the action is definitely there. When did these normal LA people/street racers become the best fighters ever idk? Haha but they are. I overall enjoyed the story and there's obviously more to come to tie up loose ends. Jason and Brie are great additions to the franchise. Jason's character was funny and he seemed to have fun playing the role. I'd like to see more of Brie and Jordana involved/fighting/driving in the next one. Although Jordana's character always here without Brian seems so unlikely if all this was happening to Dom but obviously get why Brian is not in the picture.Things I didn't enjoy tho: the rolling ball bomb rolls on for like 30 mins or more!? It's ridiculous. Lol that got so boring like watching a John wick fight that just won't end. But the rest of the movie was well paced. Obviously ""family"" has been the tone but it's a little much in this movie lol family this and family that. We get it. U don't need to say it 50 times. Also the fact that the Fast family HAVE TO be the ones to like save humanity? Lol where are the police and FBI, etc. Their initial motivation to do some of these things are lacking. Some CGI is SOOOO BAD. Like the blue? Plane towards the end didn't look remotely real. The digital deaging was a bit distracting sometimes. Jumping into cars is looking more fake too lol. But I mean overall it was enjoyable. Not the best one of course but better than Fast 9.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

These are just some of movies within the world of fictional fandom that serve as tentpoles for millions and further more inspired me personally. Fast X has Nitro Boosted its way into the pantheon as it takes its place as not just the best Fast & Furious movie, but serves as a pendulum swing for the world of cinema.It starts, ends, and ultimately prospers because of FAMILY. Fast X specifically pulls the family apart yet closer together than ever before. This widely diverse group led by a half-white, half-black, yet full ""Latino"" superstar in Vin Diesel feature his Latino brother played by John Cena, his half black son Brian, and a plethora of other A-list actors & actresses (special shoutout to Missandei)!! The film somehow manages to perfectly juggle 4, even 5 plot points at a time with all 18 characters getting their proper arcs within the 2hr 20min runtime.While the franchise may have been built on family, it is defined by its cars. As Vin stated in the press lead up, this one really returns the franchise to its grounded, practical roots. Mechanics, aerodynamics, and physics are carefully kept in mind throughout the films and as an engineer, I can confirm the feasibility of every stunt. Not to mention every main character now displays expert capabilities in martial arts combat against full grown individuals in proper ballistics gear. There is a brief moment that requires a minimal suspension of belief involving an 8-year-old being able to perform donuts in a Dodge Challenger, but aside from that one moment, those who crave a return to form for visceral, practical action will not be disappointed.And just when you think the elements of family and cars are there to make for a perfect Fast & Furious movie, in typical F&F fashion they once again take it to a 12 with Jason Momoa as the primary antagonist. From the opening scene, the manic, psychopathic, yet charismatic energy can be felt every moment he is on screen. While Dante Reyes brings such a terrifying presence that actually feels like he could be the one to take this family down, Momoa takes a page from the Thanos in making an antagonist that still seems so relatable and even right at times. To then tie it all together, not since Infinity War has a movie left on such a cliffhanger that has not only made me want 2 more movies to follow, but truly makes me wish this series carries on for the next 100 years if not more. People may deny, say this review is a lie, but to quote my brother Dominic Toretto ""Ride or Die""!!!","31 out of 95 found this helpful.

With an over-the-top villain and impressive action sequences, it's a solid entry in the series, earning 7/10 stars.Jason Mamoa's portrayal of Dante, the villain, steals the show, adding an extra layer of excitement to the movie. His larger-than-life presence and evil antics raise the stakes and inject a sense of personal vendetta into the story. Just like Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham in previous films, Mamoa brings an undeniable charisma to the screen.The action in Fast X strikes a good balance between thrilling and believable. Unlike the cars flying in space in the previous installment, the movie keeps the action grounded (well, as grounded as a Fast and Furious movie can be). It's a relief to witness intense but somewhat plausible stunts, allowing you to fully enjoy the adrenaline-pumping sequences.Fast X concludes with a captivating climax, leaving you eagerly anticipating the next chapter. It's a refreshing change from the unsatisfying ending of the previous film and renews excitement for the future of the franchise.That being said, it's important to acknowledge the movie's flaws. Fast X fully embraces the franchise's reputation for being ridiculously over-the-top. It pushes the boundaries of absurdity even further, verging on the edge of stupidity (in a good way, if that's your cup of tea). It's not a movie for those seeking a deep and intricate plot, but rather for those who appreciate explosive action and mindless entertainment.In summary, Fast X drives into overdrive with its wild and ridiculously fun ride. While not without its flaws, the film embraces its own brand of madness, delivering an action-packed spectacle that leaves you both laughing and in awe. Buckle up, leave logic behind, and enjoy the outrageousness. Fast X is a rollercoaster experience that won't disappoint fans of the franchise.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It can't even be categorised as a sci-fi or a fantasy genre, because the cliche-subject is brought to a ridiculous level. Not to mention, the movie could have been launched during Easter Holidays, because of the resurrection of Gisele.In my opinion, in order to make the future last part to be remembered as the best, I propose to bring into the script The Expandables, Suicide Squad, Avengers and Justice League.

I would like to see more of her in the next installment.The Action was top notch and the visuals were great and those engine sounds 🔥.Finally, If you're a genuine fan of the franchise, you'll be more than happy with Fast X ; if you're not, it's still a fun and mindless time to enjoy watching something new in theaters.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

After completing this film, I viewed it purely as an action movie, and from that perspective, it is an enjoyable watch. The formula consists of non-stop action, close combat, gunfights, and, of course, plenty of explosive moments. It truly is a cinematic masterpiece, especially in its explosive sequences. Additionally, there is a heightened emphasis on cars.The family remains a strong theme throughout, as expected. However, it was the plot and the pursuit of a new villain that made me hesitate at first. Nevertheless, they managed to make it logical and coherent. Speaking of the villain, Dante Reyes, portrayed by Jason Momoa, is a ruthless, sassy psychopath who brings an unpredictable mix of horror and comical relief.The movie felt like it branched off into three distinct storylines. The main revolves around Dom and his son, while the other two focus on Letty and the rest of the crew.There are thrilling car races, chases, and of course, some unbelievable moments. It's fast-paced and action-packed, and the saga finally attempts something new to stay true to its ""action"" film agenda by leaving us with a cliffhanger for the next installment.Overall, I did enjoy Fast X this time around.

I do like all the cameos that appear that hint at something big to come in the final of the franchise. John Cena was on point in this film. The film does have some plot holes but they aren't the worst. The cliffhanger at the end is kinda silly but it does set us up for Fast X: Part 2. As I said I am really into cars. So a crappy storyline doesn't make these movies bad for. I particularly see the movies for the super over the top stunts and action.

From the opening scene, this movie goes back to what made ""Fast Five"" and ""Furious 7"" so strong (two of my favorite films in the series). The characters have a depth that connects them, even the newly introduced villain.One of the best elements of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise is the villains, with stars like Jason Statham (""The Italian Job""), Charlize Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and John Cena (""The Suicide Squad"") playing the last three antagonists. This film is no different, as Jason Momoa steps up to the plate. Though his character has an acquired taste, I was a fan by the end of this story.As this film is the 10th entry in the ""Fast and Furious"" world, there are some recycled moments. Some of these scenes help elevate the story, but others feel a bit lazy. Similarly, the franchise has a difficult time saying goodbye to characters. Trying to stay spoiler-free, my opinion is that once a character has an emotional send off, they need to stay gone.The dramatic moments are a tad melodramatic, and the humor never truly lands (other than the Jason Momoa scenes). The action sequences are long, which is typical in the world of Dominic Toretto. Unfortunately, there are an abundance of subplots that become convoluted and distracting from the core story.""Fast X"" is exactly what you would expect from the 10th entry in a movie about cars, guns and heists. The explosions are big, every situation is over-the-top and it seems to have more characters than ""Infinity War"". The film isn't perfect, but the franchise continues strong with 11th and 12th films already greenlit.Note: Take note of how many times the word ""family"" is used throughout the film.Best Character: Dante
Best Scene: ""See you again"" in the garage.Best Song: ""My City""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And to sum it up: this movie is a mixed bag. If you're going in knowing what to expect, leaving logic and your brain at the entrance and really just want to be entertained by the action, cheesy dialogues and over the top sequences that sometimes make absolutely no sense in the real world, than this one will entertain the hell out of you. My wife and I were laughing all the way throughout the movie because it was so ridiculous at times. We just accepted the fact that this franchise will never be grounded anymore and every sequel is there to top the next one, so with that mindset it's a lot of fun. Jason Momoa really delivers and is fun to watch. He steals every scene and is a jack sparrowish F&F Villain with absolutely perfect delivery of one liners and entertaining acting. He really elevates the movie!What I did not like was the cheesy and messy editing with some parts. It felt all over the place at some times and had chameos and characters appear for absolutely no reason to elevate the story. But maybe it'll all make sense in the upcoming sequel(s).Another thing that I did not like was, that this movie was now even more Vin diesel focused than the last outing F9. I feel like it's getting extremer with every sequel and he's making sure that this is his world and the others are just in it. I think you'll know what I mean when you watch it.But like I said, if you know what you're in for, enjoy the ride and have fun.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Vin however scrubs up super well to present as Joe muscle plus. I am sure the Vin voice is more gravelled at each movie. Some previous gems familiar faces have cameo like roles this time around. Glimpses of Paul Walker even a Australian TV news reader are given a run. David Strathan manages to bash a few again. The arch bad guy Dante is a Steven Segal look alike and does his best to channel Heath Legers "" Joker"" viz Batman movie triology character however he is not the iconic Heath. At a stretch Dante even adopts a slice of Mickey Rourkes ""Whiplash "" character from Iron Man 2. That said Dante puts in a remarkable performance and his future as a go to movie thespian is assured. CGI is everywhere and noticabley Vin does not really engage in any body to body impact wrangles. Some old faces even though deceased re emerge.

Gone is any excitement I had for a franchise I used to sheepishly enjoy. Replaced is a never-ending cascade of recycled stunts, resurrected characters, and unbelievably lazy cliffhangers. They really should have stopped at 7 because they truly have nothing left to say. It's just the Vin Diesel show now in which he gets to hog half the screen time attempting to ""dramatically act."" He finally got his wish and wrestled away full control of this series from Lin and Morgan, AKA the brains behind the series' best entries.I just felt almost nothing during any of the ""tension-filled"" sequences. There are no stakes anymore and nothing matters. The cliffhanger certainly doesn't matter because you know it will get resolved in the first 5 minutes.There are a few bright spots. Jason Momoa does his best to breathe some Joker-like life into this lumbering franchise, but even his boisterous performance can't save this film. Cena teaming up with a youngster was fun to see, even though his character has basically an entirely different personality from his villain-turn in F9. Alan Ritchson is also a nice addition as he has some actual screen presence and charisma.You'll notice all my highlights are new additions to the franchise. That's part of my point. The original characters have nothing left to say or do. Roman and Tej's banter is just exhausting and cringey at this point. Same with Dom's speeches about family and his macho posturing. And while new typically equals better, Brie Larson's presence in this film is baffling and bizarre. She just shows up in some ridiculous outfits and jumps on cars for no apparent reason.I know these are meant to be brainless entertainment spectacles, but they used to at least have some semblance of plot and quality. The filmmakers act like they're in on the joke, but I can tell you Vin Diesel certainly isn't. He still thinks he's pumping out high quality billion dollar grossers, and that is just simply not true. I can't believe we have two more films in this now THREE PART finale.","21 out of 29 found this helpful.

The storyline continues from the series' fifth film, where Dante Reyes takes revenge for the death of his father and the loss of his wealth caused by the main gang. The storyline is simple, has a paper-thin story, and does not have scope to further flesh out more in the story. The screenplay was below average, which does not greatly impact the movie, and was directed to make a commercial movie. The comedy was one of the highlights, having humorous scenes for the major of the movie. The emotional value was not used much in the movie except for a few scenes. The direction was also done decent, giving good justice to the mediocre script. The performances were done great by the lead actors, especially Jason Mamoa. Jason Mamoa has done a great performance giving a good payoff to his humorous but villain character. The action sequences were done aptly and stylishly, standing out in the movie. The music was average and the background music stood out in parts. The cinematography was also done decent, that was adding a good visual to some parts of the movie. The editing was done slickly, which was good for the action sequences. The post-credit scene was a good scene to add, giving a nice end to the film. Overall, the film is decent with good humor, action sequences, and performances.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

From start to finish, it's a mind-numbing exercise in unreality and absurdity. It's as if the filmmakers decided to throw logic and physics out the window and replace them with mindless CGI stunts and laughable plotlines.The characters in this disaster of a film are nothing more than one-dimensional caricatures with zero depth or development. They spout cheesy one-liners and engage in over-the-top action sequences that defy all laws of physics. It's almost as if they possess superhuman abilities, defying gravity and surviving ridiculous crashes without a scratch.Speaking of crashes, the CGI in this travesty is so blatantly fake that it's impossible to suspend disbelief for even a second. The explosions and car chases are so poorly rendered that they look like they were created by a middle school student experimenting with basic video editing software.As for the plot, if you can even call it that, it's a convoluted mess of contrivances and predictable twists. The writers must have been running on empty when they concocted this nonsensical story. It's riddled with plot holes big enough to drive a tank through and relies heavily on deus ex machina moments to keep the flimsy narrative afloat.To make matters worse, the acting in this disasterpiece is wooden and uninspired. The actors seem to be on autopilot, delivering their lines with a lack of emotion or conviction. It's clear they were only there for the paycheck, and their performances reflect their disinterest in the material.In conclusion, ""Fast and Furious: The Fake and Furious Nightmare"" is an insult to cinema and a waste of time. It's a mindless spectacle that relies on cheap thrills and flashy visuals to distract from its complete lack of substance. Save yourself the agony and skip this abysmal excuse for a movie.","21 out of 29 found this helpful.

The new characters are woven into the Fast universe brilliantly, and film has a lot of heart.The story follows generally the same formula as previous instalments, but this one feels different.

Even without that, it is probably one of the better constructed stories of the franchise.Of course one of the main draws of the franchise is the stunts, and they really are really quite something. If you thought the previous films defied physics then this film practically denies the existence of physics altogether. There are some great driving sequences, some intense fight choreography, and lots of high octane action.However this franchise isn't all about the stunts, it's always placed as much emphasis on its human characters, and this is no better demonstrated than through Jason Momoa. He delivers by far and away the best villain of the Fast franchise in Dante Reyes. He has an almost Joker like twisted and chaotic attitude to him that really draws you in. The creative flourishes and showmanship that Momoa gives to the character are superb, making him so distinct and entertaining.The rest of the cast are as they always are - solid. What some of them lack in fine acting skills they make up for with heart and always buy into the material. You can tell they all enjoy working on these movies which makes it easy for the audience to enjoy them as well. Other new additions like Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson flesh out their characters nicely and bring a fresh flavour to things.I just had such a great time watching this film and any fans of the Fast franchise will most definitely agree. Buckle up for an adrenaline fuelled ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat and eagerly awaiting the next instalment.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Momoa is an incredible actor and his character is actually interesting and one of the more memorable villains in the franchise. And John cena AAing someone through the house was quite funny. Having said that the plot was just boring. The fast franchise really needs to focus on going back to its roots when the story was about street racing and actually about cars. Not whatever it is now. I was extremely disappointed and was expecting it to be a lot better.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

Fast X, the latest installment in the action-packed Fast and Furious franchise, takes the audience on another high-octane joyride filled with heart-stopping stunts, adrenaline-fueled races, and a cast of familiar faces. Directed by [Director's Name], the film offers a mind-boggling display of extravagant action sequences that will leave fans of the series exhilarated. While the movie leans heavily on its over-the-top action and suspension of disbelief, it manages to provide an entertaining experience for those who are willing to embrace its wild and fantastical nature.Plot and Characters:
Fast X reunites the audience with beloved characters from the previous films, as they find themselves entangled in yet another high-stakes adventure. Dom Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and his crew face a formidable new threat that pushes them to their limits. The plot may not offer groundbreaking storytelling, but it serves as a backdrop to showcase the film's true strengths - the incredible action sequences and the chemistry between the ensemble cast. While some character arcs are predictable, the charismatic performances of the actors, including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, and Ludacris, breathe life into their respective roles and help sustain the film's momentum.Action and Stunts:
The Fast and Furious franchise has built a reputation for pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible on-screen, and Fast X is no exception. From gravity-defying car chases to daring heists, the film delivers a constant barrage of over-the-top action that will make your jaw drop. The stunts are intricately choreographed and executed with precision, showcasing the immense talent and skill of the stunt team. The adrenaline rush induced by the high-speed pursuits and mind-bending maneuvers is undeniably thrilling, making it easy to overlook the implausibility of certain sequences. Fast X fully embraces its own brand of physics-defying action, offering a wild and enjoyable experience for those willing to suspend their disbelief.Visuals and Soundtrack:
Visually, Fast X is a treat for the eyes. The cinematography captures the essence of the fast-paced world the characters inhabit, showcasing stunning landscapes and vibrant cityscapes. The use of practical effects and the seamless integration of CGI create a visually immersive experience. Additionally, the film's soundtrack complements the action sequences perfectly, adding to the intensity and energy of each scene. The pulsating beats and adrenaline-pumping tunes enhance the overall enjoyment and provide a heightened sense of excitement.Critiques and Expectations:
It is important to acknowledge that Fast X is not a film that aims to offer deep introspection or profound storytelling. Those seeking intricate plot twists or complex character development may find themselves disappointed. The film's primary objective is to entertain and provide an escape from reality through its wild and exhilarating action sequences. To fully appreciate Fast X, one must approach it with the expectation of mindless fun and embrace the suspension of disbelief required for its outrageous stunts.Conclusion:
Fast X is a rollercoaster ride of non-stop action, offering a cinematic experience that is wildly fun when approached with the right mindset. While it may not be a masterpiece in terms of storytelling or character development, it excels in delivering breathtaking stunts and exhilarating moments. The film's visual spectacle, coupled with the chemistry of its ensemble cast, ensures an enjoyable experience for fans of the franchise. So, buckle up, leave your logic at the door, and prepare to be swept away by the sheer adrenaline-fueled excitement of Fast X.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was a delightful experience filled with entertainment and innovative ideas. However, since ""Furious 7,"" I have struggled to find the same level of excitement. There seems to be a lack of novelty and originality in recent installments. The movie has become monotonous and fails to offer anything fresh. Furthermore, the actors appear weary and have lost their passion, which further dampens the overall experience. It's disheartening to witness this decline. On a somber note, I would like to pay tribute to the late Paul Walker, whose presence is deeply missed in the franchise.

Watching the trailer I wasn't so sure Momoa and the way his character is inserted into Five would work well, but it worked really well. I kind of wish this should've been what followed 7 but on the other hand, without the atrocities that are 8 and 9, this possibly couldn't have ended up as fun and ridiculous. Jason Momoa is here to give the franchise a character that looks like he's having all the fun in the world when every other character is either smouldering cooly or bickering to be funny. They also finally figured out how to use Charlize Theron after wasting her in two movies even in the limited screen time but kinda feels a bit too late but I figure there's more in store in the sequels. Vin Diesel is starting to look old and when Helen Mirren comes onscreen they have this peculiar tension going on like in the previous movies but this time, the age difference doesn't seem jarring anymore, lol. The way they have designed this movie is to make this the Franchise's Infinity War moment, of course not as good, but still, it does work to a point. It's still one of the weaker ones in the franchise, but not as bad as the entries after 7, but without those, I may not have enjoyed this either. I'm pumped to see what the Franchise has to offer going forward. I bet some more resurrections and at least a couple of final deaths are there in store.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I also learned that a 1970 Dodge Charger has more traction with its rear wheels in the air than two helicopters have lift combined. And speaking of Dodge Chargers, all model years are indestructible. Seriously, they don't have airbags because they can't be destroyed. You can drop em out of a plane, hit 'em with a crane, if you bet against them, you must be insane! I heard Boeing is going to use dodge Chargers for their airplane black boxes. And think I also heard that after watching Fast X, the Army is retiring the Abrahams tank and awarding the contract to Dodge.

As an ardent admirer of mindless car chases, explosions that serve no purpose, and gravity-defying stunts, this movie theoretically promised to check off all the boxes.Theoretically.But alas, in the realm of reality...The ""plot"" appears to have been conceived by a group of eight-year-old boys, although that would be an insult to their budding creativity. The plot, if one can even call it that, is a grotesque abomination of writing that should have been deleted from the word document after the first few pages by any self-respecting writer.I understand that the Fast & Furious series has veered off into a distant galaxy far, far away from its humble beginnings, transforming into a parody of itself. However, that doesn't excuse the complete loss of self-awareness.Let's delve into the acting, shall we? It is not merely bad; it transcends the boundaries of badness and ventures into the realm of wooden and excruciatingly awful. It's a wonder that accomplished actors were able to deliver such performances. Perhaps the blame lies with the pitiful script, which offers no depth or even an attempt at character development. Who knows? It's just plain terrible.And don't get me started on the stunts and action sequences that seem to have been scripted by a deranged lunatic. The previous film, where a car ventured into space, now appears quaint and normal in comparison to this chaotic disaster. We're talking about gravity-defying cars, levitating children, fire-engulfed 20-foot wide bowling balls-oh, the list goes on, unfortunately.Now, you may wonder why on earth I subjected myself to the entirety of this torture rather than choosing the less-painful option of bathing in acid and performing a naked broken glass dance while belting out ""It's been a long day..."" Well, there is a silver lining to this abomination: Jason Momoa. His character brings some much-needed interest, sarcasm, and humor to this trainwreck. He even blesses us with the profound quote, ""Family... Yeurgh!""Vin Diesel (Dom), on the other hand, resembles that one individual who stumbles into a pub on a Friday night, regaling everyone with his ludicrous tales of self-delusion. No one dares speak up because he may be on the verge of needing professional psychiatric help.To make matters worse, I've heard rumors of not one, but two additional parts to this ""final"" movie(!). Yes, that means there are at least four more excruciating hours of ""ffaaammmillllyyyy!!!!"" ahead of us. May the gods have mercy on our souls.In a futile attempt to assist the writers, I've crafted my own ending. Brace yourself...Dom proceeds to add another 87 bottles of NOS to his miraculously intact car, which somehow survived an explosion and a watery grave. As luck would have it, a troupe of trained dolphins comes to the rescue, gently guiding the slightly-scuffed vehicle back to dry land. Dom, his son, and the entire family then embark on a high-speed journey, shifting gears a mind-boggling 164 times, ultimately surpassing the speed of light and causing the Earth to spin backward on its axis. A few more downshifts lead Dom and his merry men to tear open a space-time rift, propelling their car into an alternate universe where they save Paul Walker from his ill-fated attempt to drift through a tree on November 29, 2013. Thus, they save his life, redeem the plot, revive the franchise, and salvage the tattered remnants of my sanity.In summary, my rating for this cinematic gem is a solid 3.14 out of 10... Hmm, a fittingly irrational number for such a spectacle.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

The self grandeur and narcissism by a guy who is running a franchise into the ground and making it more of a joke out of a legitimate fear now guardians is done, he won't get any big roles.Rightly so, let's say the truth, the guy cannot act, there were so many close ups of his face looking for reaction/emotion, there was none, you could've switched it for a baked potato with googly eyes and gotten more. His voice is almost grating, it's so mumbling and slow, plus the dialogue, this film must set a world record for the use of ""family"". It's legitimately cringe and the reasoning is because they cannot justify keep making these films.The only other 2 I'm not a huge fan of in this are Natalie and Terese, I like Natalie but she just doesn't click with these characters and her delivery isn't the best, her line ""oh I know stuff now"" was just ridiculous, she's talented but not right and hasn't really fit in since she came in. The last acting one was Tyrese, it's interesting the two that fell out with Rock, the second desperately tried to be comic relief and failed, completely terrible at portray the fun guy of the group. The rest were average to good. Always great to see Jason.JM was brilliant and only reason this was a 4 and not a 2, he was silly, fun and enjoyable and kind of saved this movie by playing into the stupidity whilst Vin tries to be serious. Can we also acknowledge that Vin diesel although in good shape hasn't got a top tier physique, so there's no need to purposefully hold his arms wide like a silverback looking for territory, especially when atleast 2 on the film make you look skinny. Again vanity.The action is fine, there's a difference between entertaining and good, the stuff is fun to watch but when it gets too ludicrous it just becomes a bit boring, especially when it's one guy mainly doing the ridiculous. The story was ok, how they did the start was very good though, kinda down hill from there, the tie ins were clever to.Won't spoil anything, I went into this thinking it was the last one and the ending I was like ""huh"" to then find out 1 but potentially 2 more parts are coming is absolutely stupid. 3 films to wrap up this? If anyone thinks it's anything other than Bin desperately trying to keep it alive so his rotten ability doesn't end his career is deluded. That's why every issue, he's involved, if he legitimately thought this was good, it's embarrassing. His performance ruined it, if there was less of him and more of the others then yeah this could actually be fun! It's being kept on life support by a narcissist and means the franchise will end as a joke which people want to die instead of what it could've been or what it was when it started. I knew when PW died that when it didn't end because of that, the only way it ends is when Vin says! Let this sink in 2027 will likely be the third, he will be 60! Ridiculous.","59 out of 94 found this helpful.

The action scenes were so nice must watch only for it. The second half is quite slow compare to the 1st half. May be the audience need to wait for 2nd part for more action scenes from Jason Statham. The comedy is not upto the mark. Overall a watchable movie where the kids will enjoy the stunning action scenes.

The villain was weird and annoying to the point it distracts from a good action movie. I have no intention of watching the next and hopefully final version of the franchise series. My big complaint is turning men into freaks. There is one scene where the villain is dressed like a woman talking to a couple dead guys. They were sitting together and the villain was having this stupid conversation with them. The dead guys had their faces taped.

The series has been going on over 22 years now and basically has not only become a lesson in believability but a commercial for the latest Dodge cars and trucks. Is it bad movie? I'd go further and say compared to what? This is an action movie loaded with bad guys vs good guys, good fight scenes, hot chicks, stunts and a decent soundtrack. If you're expecting believability and are just a sensitive spazz then this one isn't for you.For the rest of us who just want to enjoy a movie without comparing everything to Shakespeare then you'll have a good time. This time around the villain is clear if you've watch the trailer. Not to give much away but where Jason Statham was supposed to be a supervillain, Jason Mamoa has him beat. Dude is relentless in pursuit of revenge for what happened in Fast Five except it was Hobbs who was responsible for everything. I mean Vin and crew did steal 100 million but they didn't kill the dad of Mamoa's character. Bottom line this is enjoyable and sets up the finale which will be out in a few years. Btw stick around for the end credits.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

I have watched every movie of this franchise. I liked most of them, not the biggest fan though. This is much better than the previous one. Not a difficult task of course, FAST 9 was terrible. I think i can call it a ""Guilty pleasure"" movie because it ticks all the boxes. I mean, it's cringey as hell but it was a pleasure to watch even those unintentionally comedic moments. There are many scenes that characters were trying to be funny but their lines were too dumb and that was funny by itself. I.e, the definition of guilty pleasure!As others mentioned, Momoa was delightful. At times, he was becoming too likeable for a villain, but in the end, he delivered. Poor John Cena, the writers probably dislike him, so they gave him the worst/most unfunny lines in the history of this franchise. It's way funnier watching ducks swimming in a lake than listening to Cena's lines in this. And that's a shame because he can be hilarious, like in THE SUICIDE SQUAD. In any case, it was a joy to watch Statham and Theron. Even Alan Ritchson (I remember him from the latest JACK REACHER series, he was much better as Reacher than here). Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel, i will always praise his performances as Riddick. Truth be told, he seems he doesn't even care the last 15 years. Still, not a bad screen presence.If it had a better rating, i wouldn't be so ""supportive"", this is a dumb movie, dumb even for an action movie. But i enjoyed it, it was never boring even for a second. It was so funny and enjoyable at times that it brought me joy. Ok, it dragged a bit in the middle but at the last 30 minutes, it exploded. There was even a heroic moment that made me emotional. And the ending was surprising.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There isn't genre Comedy for this movie.Technically movie looks well, i mean there are explosions, many locations in the world, driving etc. But all this doesn't mean anything to me because Dante's behavior is bad.

But, just on the basis of action only, I don't find it entertaining at all. Overall, complete boring film. If there were no bigger stars used in the movie, this would have been a total flop. They sold this movie just on the basis of star power and some action scenes only. I don't know what to write next. I am totally disappointed. The makers invested so much money on the stars and graphics but the movie could have been a lot better if they invested one fourth of the money into a better writer. In the theatre, I was like, how do I even complete this movie? I might offend a lot of fans but personally, I find this movie boring. Maybe, my taste is different to what people see in the west but I watch movies for story. Action, it's cool. But, I can still watch a movie full if there's no action but the story is engaging and interesting. This story I just saw in Fast X, I have seen it many times already, just a slight changes and nothing new. As a movie lover, I didn't enjoyed this movie.

2) The acting is also diabolical at some points

While they may excite a 7 year old most adults have seen much better special effects. The bombing of the dam was the most ridiculous scene. I've never knew an explosion could cause lava like flames to chase a car down a straight wall. I remember something weird science like heat rises?Jason Momoa's character was kind of irritating because he's supposed to be flamboyantly gay maybe? He and John Cena were the only memorable actors. The rest of the cast were lost in a big whirlwind of car chases.This is Fast & Furious so don't expect an actual story. Its all about cars and explosions.

ACTION ADVENTUREIt's better than ""Hobbs and Shaw"" but not better than ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" there's way too much reliance on CGI, and the word ""family"" is used a little too much. The set up is simple, for it continued with a new revelation from ""Fast Five"" because the cartel, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) that was killed on that movie, it just happens that he has a son, and his name is Dante (Jason Momoa). And of course, he is seeking retribution to how his dad was taken care of from that film. It's intention is supposed to make the previous villain. Cipher (Charlize Theron) to look like a kitten as he succeeds into blowing up a portion of Italy, pinning the explosion on the current main characters of Torreto (Vin Diesel), Letta (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) making them into ""the world's most wanted"", before he sets ""the agency"" to sought after them before Dante goes after his son.Look, to all the losers who want the series to die, the solution is to not watch it, okay!! No one is pointing a gun to your head, as there are plenty of other movies to watch. No one is forcing you to watch them, as if someone is threatening your life or something. I, on the other hand, still want to see what happens, as it was the first movie of the franchise that leaves on a cliffhanger. Did a portion of the characters actually die from that plane crash/ explosion? Did Toretto and his son die from that explosion down below? Did Deckard (Jason Statham) succeeded in saving his mother (Helen Mirren)? If you do not want to know, then don't watch the next Fast Furious as soon as it comes out, okay! If you want the franchise to die then you can make it die by not watching anymore, it's really that simple. Read about it instead or better yet, watch other movies that align with your tastes.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","Car-crushing Family-loving summer fun. At 10 iterations, it's still speeding along.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9065542/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2023","""A Cult with Cars""Fast X is the tenth iteration of the Fast & Furious franchise, and it's still running on high octane with no speed limit yet.Some of my readers may know that I'm a hard-core art film lover-philosophical, romantic, wordy, sentimental, subtle-you name that soft stuff, and I love it. So why do I also enjoy a mindless actioner like Fast X? Because it is genuine about its love of cars, it creatively thinks of new ways to wreck them, and it exalts something worth more than its most souped-up Lamborghini-family, including the close friends not joined by blood but by temperament.At the head of the loving table is Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel, could there be a better name for an actor in a motor car-obsessed movie?), whose mission this time is to retrieve his abducted son and preserve his loving family. While not a handsome leading man, Diesel exudes a beautiful gruffness even Renaissance playwrights would envy.A clue to Diesel's soft side is his approving the bad boy of the movie, Jason Momoa as Dante, whose scenery-eating act is perfect for a franchise that wallows in excess. Diesel is responsible for dumping last director Jason Lin in favor of Louis Leterrier, who is no stranger to fast cars and charismatic leads (Transporter/ Jason Statham). Diesel must have approved Momoa's take on the villain with comedic and operatic tones exuding a joy at being in this franchise and just right for dialing back the adrenalin of the chases.You'll note I've said little about the plot, which takes us to Rome and Portugal among other vacation spots because Fast X is really about another form of super heroes clamoring to get home with a full house of family. As for the family I brought to the otherwise empty theater-Patricia, Wayne, Anthony, and pistachios-howling and hooting is just what we do when no one else is there for us to annoy. Although not gearheads like the characters on the screen, Anthony loves cars, Patricia loves characters, and Wayne loves to shout out where in films or TV he has seen each actor with at least one line.Like the characters on the screen, we are loving the sights and sounds of modern cinema along with a family sentiment or two to give the movie some class. Fast X may not be an art film, but it is the kind that brings us together for laughs and sentiment, just like Thanksgiving dinner. It may not be perfect, but it sure feels good to enjoy a simple story told with a big heart like Diesel's.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Nobody asked for it. And every time I love it. I don't like the afro American actors anymore. They don't add much to the franchise. Vin Diesel is leaning too much on his ""Family"" concept. Michelle is cool and Mamoa, oh come on, he was funny, awesome, great! He might be the next best Joker character.There was a lot of action going on. Of course far fetched and not possible, but that's what F&F has become after part 6. If there are going to be Two more movies after this, it will be Mamoa versus ""the cringe Family"". And that's fine by me. Mamoa, kill the F&F family and with that, the franchise and start your own spin-off.Btw: my daughter and I did not like it much for Dom's brother to die. I don't know what the actor's name is, but he is fun to watch.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I think Justin Lin exiting as the director was just what this franchise needed. This new director Louis Leterrier gave all types of Fast audience what the love. It had a good storytelling, a good balance of action vs comedy vs emotions, and aloooot less of the ridiculousness like a Pontiac in space crap. It still had over the top scenes but well balanced. And for THE LOVE OF GOD THANK YOU FOR FINALLY ADDING A STREET RACING SCENE. That's true essence of Fast movies, I wish it was bit longer. It was great seeing more new cars instead of typical Dodge charger edition. I wish more JDM and German were added, but hopefully in the next one.Jason Momoa - I was totally surprised by his character which I was completely not expecting but was really surprised by Momoa's charisma of showing his colorful feminine psychotic side instead of the normal Alpha that we all know him as. I was super invested in his character throughout because it was different, unique, and unpredictable which kept me on edge.Some characters from Fast 7, 8, and 9 are washouts and just needs to be sweep. I am really hoping to see this franchise end on a high note and with more of Momoa changing the course of this Dom's Family.Thank you for finally listening to the OG fans.

The movie's startling conclusion will leave you pondering what happens next; therefore, I believe Vin Diesel should release FAST X Part 2 in the middle of 2024, as this is the climax of an epic story. Brie Larson utterly destroyed it, as does Alan Ritchson's depiction of Aimes.

After that I was hoping all the time he would get his big break, but instead went into flop after flop after flop. Was it his problem or just the dumb scripts he was getting? Well, in Fast X, he is the highlight of the film. Not a master class of acting, mind you, but in the predictable world of ""family"" where everybody is good and wants to save people, Momoa's character is flamboyant, psychopathic and fun. Honestly, this might be his best role yet! Why not take a page out of Schwarzenegger's book and do comedy, not only action? In this film filled with musclemen, the villainous Dante is one step ahead of everybody (even if unreasonably so) and uses no physical force at all. Instead, he raises the character by charm alone. That's acting, so that's why I liked in Fast X.But what about Dom? What about him? He seems to be bound by previous ""canon"" ideas therefore it is reduced to a cliché. No wonder Dante can predict all his moves: he probably watched the first nine movies. His character is as forgettable as it is in-Dom-itable.But, there is the family, right? The family is even worse! There are so many characters that need to look cool (as well as past villains) that there is no time to do them justice in any way. Instead of focusing on the skills of the team working together to surmount impossible odds, we get a lot of Roman. Remember Roman? No one does and no one will after this either, yes he gets so much screen time that could have been spent on, I don't know..., Charlize Theron? Gal Gadot? Jason Statham? But those people cost money...In the end, the film is a bit of a return to form. Things are a little more believable now, although still completely bonkers. Dante's character seems to be what Cipher should have been, but wasn't. Can you imagine Charlize in the role of a mischievous sadistic villain? But her time has passed and Momoa is the new king of villainy, putting the hours in so that we feel satisfied when he is thoroughly defeated... only he is not. The movie ends on a cliffhanger. Fast X is not a complete movie, instead just a part one. Will the next movie be called Fast Y? Fast X2? Is this going to get mathematical now and ask us to solve for X? Yet at the same time it feels almost like a ""How it should have ended"" episode. I don't know how Vin Diesel felt during the film, but it was clear Momoa had all the fun.Bottom line: It's still a dumb movie. I mean, if you watched all of the others you can't have expected more! The slightly more realistic plot is a plus, trying to get as many of the past characters in the shot is a minus, Momoa steals the show, while all of the other characters, Dom included, are pretty much wasted. And it's a Part 1er! So you might want to wait until Fast X+1 to see how it all ends.Shorter bottom line: two hours and a half of Momoa expanding on his ""I heart you"" video.P. S. The 1970 Dodge Charger uses petrol, not diesel, so that must be frustrating...","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

That being said, I didn't particularly like this entry. The action sequences pale in comparison to some of the previous entries. The fact that it starts off with the fast five vault scene makes it even worse. Coming on the heels of a great action film like john wick I couldn't help but feel bored and underwhelmed by this. Most of the jokes don't land with only a couple of bits with Tyrese being funny. The movie also has no conclusion and just sort of ends on a horrible cliffhanger. I know it's a two-parter but the first film still needs to have an ending, something that a movie like Infinity War handled exceptionally. If there's one thing I had to say I liked was Jason Momoa's performance, you can tell he really had fun playing the role and he delivers an enjoyable performance. Overall it's just a bad movie, even for a popcorn flick.","57 out of 96 found this helpful.

Mamoa tries his best with a laughable script, but this is a mess of a movie to say the least. I'm not kidding when I say one of the plot points is that Mamoa's character wants to blow up Vatican City. His reasoning is simple: cuz why not. And honestly that was one of the more understandable character motivations in this movie. Vin Diesel and the rest of the cast just look tired at this point. I will say that some of the locations were nice to look at, but I'd give this one a hard pass. If you want to save your time, watch Fast Five and call it a day.","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

I am just happy he is dead (of course I wish he is dead). It's Just stupidly ridiculous. I mean for action you can't change physics laws, or this is fiction so in this case Superman can fly instead of driving! I just wish I haven't seen this spending my time on a nonesense .

This part is actually fun to watch again and includes the classic car race people again.It is fast, has a lot of storylines and some mellow acting on Vin Diesels part.

Tokyo Drift was a complete disaster for one.However, things looked up after that one with good stories and good cast performance. The story about Letty was by it self awsome. Well. Then something happened. Either the writers just went to sleep or no one cared about the movies anymore. The story took a dip and then no one seemed to care anymore. Add explosions and villians and everything will turn out fantastic. No. That's not how it works.And playing rocket league in rome with a bomb? Sigh..

It's not whether something can or can't happen, it's just that when something does happen it should feel realistic. That's kind of the point of make believe; it has to be believable. Whether it's Martians invading earth or a bank robbery, the events have to feel realistic.It doesn't matter how much CGI or what budget you pump into something if it's a dumb idea it's a dumb idea. That bouncing bomb began to feel sort of embarrassing after a couple of minutes.There were many moments that would have had five year olds scratching their chin incredulously.My favourite thing about the movie was that really it was about a gravity defying flying car that can drop out of aeroplanes and go over precipices without more than a scratch.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Much, MOVIE in the movie....I""ll try to give a brief spoiler free synopsis,,,, but there be MILD spoilers... so, bear that in mindFast X opens with some familar lookin scenes.... 10 years ago in Rio, which fast franchise fans (say that 3 times fast) will remember from Fast Five (which btw is STILL the franchise best.... but ranking the Fast movies is something I""ll save for another video, when the franchise is finished.... on the year 2056.... when they crossover with Transformers..... MAKE IT HAPPEN UNVIVERAL / Paramount!)Anyway, were in Rio, were seeing the safe heist scenes that take place in Fast Five, but from a slightly different point of view (its a mix of reused Fast 5 footage and newly shot footage,,which to the filmmakers credit blends quite well)So wee see Vin Deseils Dom and Paul Walkers Brian stealing the safe from whats his name (the bad guy in Fast Five) .... but wouldn't you know it,.,..apparently just of frame in all those scenes... was the son of that bad guy....played by JASON MAMOA.....Thats right, Jason Mamoas DANTE was there the whole time during the vents of fast five (we just didn't see him cos of.... reasons (cough cough RETCONNED cough cough)Its in the trailer so I dont think this is much a spoiler that he, (Dante) , survived the carnage of fast five, but his dad (the bad guy in fast five) did not.... and now, 10 years later, Dante is out for revenge against Dominic Toretto and his
F A M I L YWhy did he wait 10 years.....? You know.... reasons//...Cut to the present day and the gang have a mission for 'The Agency' in Rome.... and shock horror,,,, BLEEP goes sideways and they end up playing a real life version of what can only be described as Twisted Metal meets Rocket League (now that I WOULD watch)After the Derby Destruction of Rome, the gang are split up into a few wee groups and off on their own side missions and,....thats pretty much it plot wiseSo thats pretty much it plot wise, thats all established in the opening 20 mins.... the following 2 hours (yes, cos this is like 2 hours 20 mins long or something like that) is a collection of various action set pieces that take Dom and his F A M I L Y across the globe (again)Tej Roman and Ramsay are off on there little adventure (which is totally unnecessary and could easily be cut from the movie ... but then those characters would have pretty much nothing to do....)John Cenas Jacob (Doms brother is back)Letty has her own thing to get on with, Dom is doin his, Mia is relegated to pretty much a cameo (again) but the bulk of this movie is Jason Mamoa terrorising and tormenting DomAlso, Its not just the core F A M I L Y (I'll stop doin that now) that are back....Charlize Theron's Cypher is back, Scott Eastwood is back briefly .... (but sadly Kurt Russels Mr Nobody is AWOL... in his place the Reacher himself Alan Richson, along with Ms Marvel herself Brie Larson.... )I'm probably forgetting about a few characters.... but theres just so many!So, what did I think of Fast X.....Well, its not amazing, its not the best Fast n Furious,,,, but its not the worst... (probably sits somewhere in the middle...ish....)The best thing about this movie.... BY FAR,,,, is Jason Mamoa....He CLEARLY having a ball in this, hamming it up OTT villian style and loving every minute.Like most of the recent Fast Movies, it feels like everyone is just having fun with it,,,, everyone knows its a big dumb exploding action movie that no one takes seriously... well, no one apart from Vin Deisel,,,, he thinks hes in a different movie.It feels like everyone is in on the joke,,,, apart from Desiel.... hes sadly the weakest part of the movie,... and his groot voice is legit incoherent at times..... F A M I L YEven John Cena, whos only been in F9 and now Fast X is in on the fun.... and not only that, it feels like hes playing a totally different character in this movie! In the time between f9 and fast X, hes went from stone faced serious bad guy,,,, to fun loving joking around uncle with Muscles (wink)Speaking of ,,, whats the deal with the names of these movies! They have no coherence or connectivityThe Fast and the Furious
then 2 fast 2 furious
then The Fast and the furios colon tokyo drift
then fimply Fast and Furious (no 'THE's' in sight)
the Fast Five
then furious 6 (I think)
Fast 7
The F8 of the furious
then Fast and furious presents Hobbs n Shaw
Then a total random one with 'F9 the fast saga'
and now, 11 movies in they decide to impliment roman numerals with FAST X(deep breath)Its too long, like I said they could have easily cut the roman tej Ramsay scenes and saved 20 mins....The action set pieces are for the most part well staged, but theres just 1 or 2 too many.... car action (CARCTION) fatigue kinda sets in....There is a cool shot in one of the car sequences where the camera kinda flys into the car like a mini drone, goes down the drivers arm, to the gear stick, into the inner workings of the car and out the firey exaust.... definetly a call back to the first movie,... that was pretty coolBut yeah, overall its just a bit .... meh... like we're at the stage where the fast moveis feel like they're just goin through the motions (Hobbs n shaw was a welcome change to that, and was a genuinely decent action buddy movie)But not since Fast 7 has there been a what I would consider a GOOD fast movie (kinda feels like they should have just ended after Fast 7.... it was a perfect ending....)I should say that Fast X is part 1 of 2 or possibly 3 movies.... so. We'll see whats to come.... (Fast 11 and 12, Fast X1 and x2.... who knows what the random name generator will spit out nextGonna give this one 6/10..... as I said not the best Fast movie, not the worst.... Jason Mamoa is really the only reason to watch this one ....@ScottishGeekGuy in youtube and socialsPeace.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Maybe he used to be a good actor. Maybe was always terrible. However you slice it, whatever he's doing up there on the big screen it is not acting. Granted, he's pretending to be someone else and he's speaking someone else's lines but that man is not putting on a performance. I don't know what you call it. Is it posing? Is it simulated thespianism? The future of AI? I don't have a clue. His good fortune is, nobody cares! He's awful yet more successful than I'll ever be.I suppose it's a testament to the power of Hollywood that having your lead character in your motion picture be a dud in no way means your movie isn't entertaining. And not entertaining in the Ed Wood Mystery Science Theater sense but in the fun summer movie sense. This is what Scorsese means when he called Marvel flicks theme parks. That is a perfect description of Fast X. It ain't cinema. It's an amusement park.That's not a put down, I like amusement parks. I liked this picture. The action set pieces are mostly excellent and many of the jokes land. A few characters are killed off for emotional heft but honestly, I couldn't have cared less about that. Not sure the movie does either. I mean, sure, the no name actors may not be coming back but you know damn well the big name ones will be returning.Look, I can't say any more than one else has, this is Jason Momoa's movie. He is acting and good lord is it fun to watch. The movie is too long with too many cameos but whenever he pops up all is forgiven.He carries this motion picture and makes it worth watching.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

With that being said this film was far from perfect. There were quite a bit of scenes in this film that dragged or were useless but makes sense that they had to keep them as this is the first of a three part film.

The series concludes on a high note with Fast X. The thrilling and realistic automobile racing in Fast X was a huge draw for me. Fast X is a thrilling and satisfying series finale. I thought the car racing in Fast X to be exciting and believable. The series concludes on a high note with Fast.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie is for those who have IQ score in negatives. Why?.
Gravity doesn't exists anywhere in the movie. For that matter, entire Science principles have been ignored..
Heroes' car will crash 50 times on iron machines, other cars, concrete, tar roads, flip over 20 times, tires burned but still will run at 100 mph..
Their idea of saving Rome is to destroy half the city and kill all those who happened to cross their path. But they did manage to save a lady and her two pet dogs. Bravo..
Cars defied gravity even when driving at 90° angle. Cars even carry iron vault (older version in series) and big iron ball with bomb inside and are capable of pulling down two military helicopters..
None of the good guys are impacted by car crash, automatic machine guns, fire, bombs or even tear gas. They didn't even need a band aid..
Lot of familiar faces in leather jackets who think it's cool to utter cringe dialogues. The rivalry between two coloured character is the worst..
Bunch of ladies have a side track in 'b' grade movie sci fi scenes ending up in submarine in arctic. If they do submarine flips in the next version then not even God can save them..
We all know that with the departure of Paul Walker the good part of the series was over. But this X version is the lowest they could stoop..
Usually we have film age rating as PG-13, U, U/A, A. This is one is MR - mentally r3t*rded.","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

And just let dead characters stay dead would you. It's like they have dragon balls or some something. Next up let me guess Shaw or Hobbs will come rescue Dom using a telporting car or something. When Dom said it about legacy they should act on it pass the torch down to someone else . And let Dom actually take care of his family after saying Family for over a million times. Honestly this series should have ended with 5 or even 7 or 8 even that would be fine but now it just feels like they are dragging it out. The most senseless thing is why Dante would wait 10 freaking years before going for Dom? Was he waiting for Dom to have a child or something?

The last clear memories I had were up to Hobbs and Shaw, with the rest melting into a sizzling pot of Vin Diesel's grunts, nitrous gas hisses, and endless backyard barbecues. What was once about illegal racing and swiping DVD players has evolved into a self-parody of ceaseless adrenaline and ""family values"".And here we are with Fast X, another round of Fast and Furious bingo where 'family' is a buzzword, cars routinely defy physics, and nitrous saves the day. Yet again. In all probability, this movie will fade from my memory before its successor crashes into theatres. Billed as the start of the final act of the 'Toretto Saga,' my enthusiasm is running as low as a beat-up Honda's gas tank. I'm basically rubbernecking this franchise, curious about how far they'll stretch the plot and their penchant for shoehorning in various action stars. I would not be surprised to see Keanu Reeves as Dominic's father's cousin's sister's former roommate who wronged the family in their high school years in future instalments.It's perplexing whether the creators design these sequels with a wink and a nudge, or if they're earnestly trying to deliver genuine tales of high-octane family values.Fast X brings us Jason Momoa as the vengeful son of a past antagonist, who's as gleefully destructive as a toddler in a Lego store. He's out to topple the Toretto empire, wrecking cities and scenery along the way. The series' rogue's gallery, including Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, John Cena, and now Momoa, typically outshine Diesel and his crew, often to the point of switching sides.In the Fast and Furious Olympics of outrageousness, Fast X snags the gold for being the most preposterous. It offers nothing new, stretches credibility like a well-worn elastic band, and crafts a world that feels like a Saturday Night Live sketch of its former self. The stunts and action scenes, once awe-inspiring, now elicit more eye rolls than applause.If you're a diehard fan teetering on the edge of fatigue, Fast X may well push you over. Here's hoping they put the brakes on this storyline before it veers into a trilogy.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

Poor Rome, or at least what is supposed to be Rome. The ""go-to"" place for trying-to-be-trendy movies. This isn't a Bond movie and there certainly isn't any class happening by Ian Fleming standards. Why are all the caucasian characters looking as though they have been gilded? The fake tans are just cheap. The heavy eye liner makes the female characters look like racoons.

The film is directed by Louis Leterrier, who replaced Justin Lin due to creative conflicts. It follows Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew as they face their most formidable foe yet: Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of a drug lord they killed in Fast Five.The film is a love letter to the loyal fans of the franchise, as it revisits and honors many of the previous films and characters. It also features an amazing cast of old and new stars, including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, and more.Fast X delivers what it promises: stunning stunts, exotic locations, fast cars, and witty banter. The film takes the action to a new height, with scenes that defy the laws of physics and logic. The film also pays homage to its roots by referencing or recreating some of the most iconic moments from the series.However, the film also has some drawbacks that weaken its impact as the series' climax. The plot is complicated and implausible, relying on too many coincidental and illogical twists. The dialogue is corny and repetitive, with Dom constantly lecturing about family and loyalty. The action scenes are exaggerated and unrealistic. The film's duration is too long, dragging for more than two hours without much variation or surprise.The film also shines thanks to Jason Momoa's performance as Dante Reyes, who is a charismatic and ruthless villain. He brings a sense of danger and intensity to the role, making him a worthy adversary for Dom. He also has some emotional depth and motivation for his actions, as he blames Dom for destroying his family's legacy.Fast X is a mixed bag of a movie that will please die-hard fans of the franchise but disappoint others who expect more from a blockbuster finale. It is a fun and flashy spectacle that delivers on action and star power but lacks story and logic. It is not the best or the worst of the series, but somewhere in between.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

And they made little joke about that too. I guess those who are stuck with this franchise for this long, they know what to expect by now - family happy time (this time the next generation got more attention since the kid is Dom's kid and not Mia's), getting clean and then again criminalized because something done in the past decided to be present, Roman and Tej's silly interactions, Dom's worry reflected on his glabella, idolizing of Dom on the streets, his taking no time to prove why he has been idolized and respected, losing some good folks (with a hope that they May return in a few years 😉), and shouting something in relation to 'family'. All boxes were checked!Now, let's talk about the new character added to the franchise for at least two movies- Jason Momoa. It is hard to find a niche when you're late in the game In a crowd of big musclemen that includes Vin Diesel, John Cena, Dwayne Johnson, and Jason Statham. So, Momoa chose a different approach- a psychotic who brings hell down with a childlike smile in his eyes and joy on his face, dance moves, and occasional nod challenging gender norm. The problem is, Momoa's acting was totally repetitive of his character in Slumberland. It was so similar to the point that it felt like he probably mixed up the costumes, moves, and dialogues between these two movies. That was very very frustrating. Momoa shows that it is very easy to get gigs if someone has advantage over physical appearance in Hollywood. How about this Mr. Momoa - reveal some more intricate sides of Dante in the next movie? Show us that he can get scared, he can cry, and maybe fall in love? And, remember, if you do work it out, keep it for just one movie. Don't repeat in the others movies you are doing in the same time!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm glad there was one race, because that's what this series has always been about, so besides the action, at least for a while, it was a bit about racing again. The build up to the previous episodes wasn't bad either, because I didn't really like it with the previous one, but here I thought it was pretty cool. The music was good in places too. Especially the aforementioned race. The ending was more open for the next episodes, but somehow that didn't bother me. For me, overall it was pretty good and especially more enjoyable after the previous episode, which I thought was the worst of the series. This was an above average actioner for me, and it went by quickly and I had fun. We'll see how it goes from here.

By which I mean the action, explosions and music are intended to pump up the audience. They primary goal of a movie is to entertain and they do so by setting aside science and concentrating on what they can do well... make things blow up, do the impossible and make us laugh.If at the 10th instalment (11th if spin-off counts) you still don't know what to expect, then you're likely the problem.This movie series has found its footing as an action movie series that doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't try to be a comedy, it just knows how to be funny in taking things lightly. It uses meta humour without having to ""break the fourth wall"". Jason Momoa plays an excellent ""over the top"" villain in an ""over the top"" action movie.As usual with these films, the action is well done and the physics is set aside. The family aspect is amped up too. I'll be waiting patiently for the next instalment.If you're a fan of the series, I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. If you aren't a fan, then why bother watching this film and dissuading others from going.Love what you love.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Reaching back to the 5th feature we have a retrofit of that film's villain, played by Joaquim de Almeida, now having a son, played by soon to ousted Aquaman Jason Momoa, who was a witness to the safe heist & has vowed revenge. Splintering the team for a fake op in Rome sends Vin Diesel hurtling to stop it before a huge spherical bomb (ala the boulder from Raiders) rolls through the city before it detonates in front of the Vatican. Saving the day only sends Diesel into hiding while Michelle Rodriguez is captured & sent to a black ops site while the authorities in the guise of Reacher's Alan Ritchson & Brie Larsen (at odds as to Diesel's innocence) both want to reach the fugitive for different reasons while the machinations of Momoa's plot is put into play through various world hops (Blighty, Rio then Portugal) before the film ends on a cliffhanger sending the audience giddily expectant for the finale. A lot better than last entry which will forever be known as the one where they went to space (hey Vin it was a joke there was no need to humor us!) but its overinsistence to keep bringing dead characters back (I loved Sang Kung as Han but by having him resurrected his death has become meaningless) we're in the land of 'don't worry about it' which is fine if this was a cartoon (ok some people may view this series as such) but it's not so unless you want this film to mean something to the masses heed my advice.

After Fast 8 and 9, this is the third-best movie in the franchise. You'll leave the theatre furious, but the unexpected ending will leave you wanting more, which is why I think Vin Diesel should drop FAST X Part 2 somewhere in the middle of 2024.

Now, we have part one of the finale to the franchise with Fast X (2023), and I thought this was better than the last installment with it being a good part one for the ending of the franchise even if it does have issues.Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Sung Kang were all good in the movie with other actors like John Cena, Charlize Theron, and Jason Statham who were also good. Having appearances from Brie Larson and Helen Mirren who are nice to see in this movie and how they affect the plot, and the kid actor Leo Abelo Perry, who played Dominic Toretto's son, was especially not bad for a child actor.This movie ties in with Fast Five (2011) at the beginning of the movie setting up the main villain Dante played by Jason Momoa, who is one of the best parts in the movie. Jason Momoa was having fun with his performance being weird, crazy, and just entertaining to watch when he is messing with Dominic Toretto by taking everything and attacking everyone he knows. You would have had to watch Fast Five (2011) to understand him more and why he is doing what he is doing, but the beginning of the movie has a recap to help people who cannot remember what happened in the earlier movies or people have not seen the earlier movies.The action scenes are toned down a little bit since the ninth film, but they are still over the top and implausible on how they play out. Defying gravity or physics in many ways using cars and explosions is very entertaining to watch, especially when the characters make insane choices that lead to these over-the-top action sequences. Using big bombs, weaponized cars, or helicopters, and any item they can use as a weapon in fist fights while going around the world like Rome, Rio, or somewhere in Antarctica.This movie ends with a cliffhanger that was very frustrating but made me want to know what will happen next in the eleventh movie/part two of the finale. If you were not on board with the Fast and the Furious movies before, then Fast X (2023) is not going to be any different with it still having over the top action, constant uses of the word ""family"", and characters that do crazy things. If you have followed this franchise for a long time and enjoyed each installment, then you will like this and will have a good time.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Fast X is a step up from the ninth installment, offering more grounded action and a good villain, it's entertaining but flawed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9099683/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","4 June 2023","Furious Ten arrived fast and left me satisfied after the final scene and when I walked out of the cinema, something the previous installment did not do. I have so many problems with that movie, here, the bad writing remains but it just feels more like the Fast and Furious I love. Focusing on more grounded action and not over the top sequences which leaves you sighing, though there are some truly extreme physics breaking moments in this film there's not as much as the prior two films. I read some criticism about the returning characters and I don't have any big problems with that except for a returning character in the final scene, other than that I loved all the returning characters, the cast is large and the new characters are all great in terms of story and action. Jason Momoa, Alan Ritchson, Brie Larson and Daniela Melchior to name a few. What I disliked the most has to be the writing, direction and some visual effects, it just felt blurry at times and non polished effects, Dante's nails were more polished than these three things. About the writing, laws of physics and logic is an after thought, and the character choices and decisions are all lackluster.Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes. That's the premise of Fast X and if you remember in Fast Five, Hernan Reyes was the antagonist in that film, it's also my favorite Fast and Furious film so seeing the vault heist play out with them retconning in Hernan's son Dante which is played by Jason Momoa, which felt right.Fast X was at first directed by Justin Lin, a director/writer who has been with the franchise since Tokyo Drift, he was actually the main reason why I was so hyped for this film and why I had hope. But he left as director during the shoot, citing creative differences, Louis Leterrier was then hired as his replacement a week later and performed several uncredited rewrites to the screenplay. This film had an estimated production budget of $340 million and is the eighth-most expensive film ever made, also the most expensive Fast and Furious movie. It's something you see, but it shouldn't be the most expensive. If you ask me, it would have needed some more time in the oven, to become what it could and should have been. Because there's a great action film buried in the pile Leterrier made, he focused more on grand action sequences than what I think Justin Lin would. I liked Fast X more than I thought I would, it just hit right on a lot of corners. There's plenty of things to like and plenty things to dislike, but the majority of the film is enjoyable and if a Fast and Furious film succeeds in entertaining you after ten movies and a spin off, you can call it a good Fast film and a good action film. Time flew by, it never got boring and never felt too long, its 140 minutes and I would say it uses that run time to tell a decent story but it's just the first part of three. Though I think they could have trimmed or removed some scenes, I was mostly satisfied with the editing though. Brian Tyler returns to do the musical score and as usual, he doesn't disappoint.Fast X stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, who also serves as a producer, alongside an ensemble cast including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Christopher ""Ludacris"" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Jason Momoa, and Charlize Theron. Vin Diesel's performance is average at best, nothing special really. It felt like almost no one had any real energy like they normally do; except for Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Michelle Rodriguez, John Cena and Charlize Theron. The new additions brought fresh energy though, with Jason Momoa on top. You see, critics either love or hate his performance, I think it's a different role than what he normally plays and yes the character comes out as a sociopathic clown at times but it works. Some dialogue is laughable though, but Jason Momoa makes it work. I think it's a good performance and honestly a menacing villain (maybe not on the screen) because of his plan and vendetta. The banter between Tej and Roman never gets old.Fast X is the first part of a trilogy finale, laying down the bricks for what's to come and also establishing the threat. It ended up being better than expected and leaves you wanting more, immediately, which makes me wonder if a cliffhanger ending was the right choice when the next film arrives in 2025. The answer, the right choice! You'll be able to theorize, rewatch the old films, until next time. I loved how they went back to Brazil and used Fast Five, what might be the franchise's best film, to tell the story of their final films. It's what we love about these films, how connected they are, the characters. It's a flawed film but good which leaves you entertained and satisfied.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

But Fast X though...Jason Momoa put this film on his back and carried it across the finish line. He played THE best villain I've seen in a while. This was one of his best performances to date. Momoa was in his lane playing a full-blown psycho and stole every scene he was in. Though Momoa isn't always seen as an actor with great range, but he's done a few variations on the macho bada**, and the fact that they all felt different with distinct personalities is impressive. I'm definitely going to watch Fast X again.Fast X is much better than F8 & F9 and is equal to F7, which I thought was the best of the franchise until now. Fast X is WAY over the top, so fasten your seatbelts, you're in for a helluva ride. Did Fast X make a lot of sense in technical cinephile terms, nope. But who cares, sometimes you just want mindless fun with heroes, villains, awesome stunts, explosions, car chases and craziness.Numerous critics are dragging this film like they expected it to be some tour de force in filmmaking...where have they been all of these years? The Fast and Furious franchise isn't meant to be The Godfather, it's meant to entertain....try to pay attention critics.🤣The acting was good, though Vin Diesel and his mumbling irritates me, but it is what it is.🤣If you just want a mindless, albeit enjoyable thrill ride in a film, plus get your money's worth considering these high ticket prices, Fast X is the film for you.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

How on earth did this transform into the unrealistic, Bollywood style, everyone is James Bond rubbish that it has been since FF4? The last iteration was just too ridiculous and this one goes a bit further.Just like Bollywood movies, the films have become accustomed to detaching from reality, physics, and human capability. I really can't stand these movies anymore, and would be thankful if I never see another one infect the world in the future.I understand that movies are there for entertainment, but bloody hell, at least keep them realistic if they are based in the normal world. Otherwise just add Sci-fi to the genre category.I challenge you to watch the first movie, then watch the last few and see if it all makes any sense to you. But then again, nothing makes sense anymore in this world, everyone seems to be living in some fantasy or another and expecting the rest of us to accept it as reality.","34 out of 56 found this helpful.

The talented and likeable ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances and has wonderful chemistry, making you feel about them and their plight. The movie's somewhat obvious concept is more than made up for by its high levels of intensity and rapid speed. The numerous exciting action moments are made even more thrilling by the high quality of the visual effects.

No mean feat for a series 10 films and over 20 years in.The set pieces are a tiny bit more grounded than F9 but still ridiculous and a lot more fun. Various members of the crew play live action Rocket League in Rome, drop out of a plane in a ""canoe"" and engage in a final chase that is much more satisfying than the turn magnet on and off showdown of the previous film. The film also benifits from an increase in star power and better use of its characters. John Cena returns but he plays the character of Jacob Toretto completely differently and is great fun as he embarks on a road trip with his nephew. Jason Statham is back as Decard Shaw, albeit only as a cameo with the promise of more to come. The film really belongs to franchise newcomer Jason Mamoa as Dante Reyes, son of Fast 5 villain Hernan. Leaving his imposing frame to portray the menace, Momoa camps it up like a 60's Batman villain and every time he is on screen the film is at its best.Unfortunately his screen time is too limited. Partly down to the massive cast, partly down to Vin Diesel's insistence that everyone remember the Fast franchise is his toy. His desire for Dominic to remain front and centre is particularly jarring when he is a charisma vacuum compared to many of the characters on display. The completely straight way he play Daddy Dom has gone beyond any possible parody and creates a real disconnect with the rest of proceedings.The movie also has an issue with the amount of plot to runtime. Some films try to cram too much plot into too short a time but here it's the opposite, a bloated runtime with very few of the on screen events moving the story forward in any meaningful way. There's an entire sub plot involving part of the crew trying to make it home that serves no purpose other than giving the cast something to do. In fairness this strand does tease out a couple of funny moments, provided you haven't grown too tired of the Tyrese Gibson/ Ludacris bickering banter.Despite these reacuring issues Fast X is great, dumb fun and on this form it will be a sad day when this most unique of blockbuster franchises finally does run out of gas.7 nails painted purple on 10 dead man's fingers.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

The movie features a mix of old and new characters, with Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez reprising their roles as Dom and Letty, respectively. The film is packed with the high-speed chases and over-the-top action scenes that fans of the series have come to expect, but there are also some surprising emotional moments that add depth to the characters.While the movie is entertaining, it does suffer from some pacing issues and a lack of focus on certain characters. The plot is also fairly predictable, with few surprises along the way. However, the stunning visuals and impressive stunts more than make up for any shortcomings in the story.Overall, Fast X 2023 is a fun and exciting addition to the Fast and Furious franchise. Fans of the series will definitely enjoy it, but those looking for a more nuanced and complex story may be disappointed.Written by Chatsonic.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

No wigs or disguises. Etc.

Fast X is the beginning of the end for the series. Which the plot is coming full circle. With a new villain Dante (Jason Momoa) who is hellbent on destroying Dominic (Vin Diesel) family and causing chaos to whoever gets in his way. Dante is coming at full vengeance to see Dom suffer. While Dom and his team are trying to survive being betrayed. Chased and while trying to protect each other.Jason Momoa is an awesome villain. Who is like the joker for the Fast series. The action sequences are big and over the top insane. If you can set aside logic or laws of Physics cause its like the previous films. You can enjoy it for what it is. The visual effects are good. The music score and soundtrack is awesome. The climax of the film is more personal with its action scene only focusing on Dominic and Dante.The cast ensemble is great. Bri Larson and Alan Ritchson is also good. The film ends in a cliffhanger for a sequel. And a surprising ending on one character. Which is better to keep an open mind with these kind of films. And a mid credit scene that just adds more to the surprise.Overall, Fast X is an exciting thrill ride that is a perfect summer blockbuster.","15 out of 50 found this helpful.

That's an actual line from Fast X, and that's not the only thing falling into the 'so bad it's good' category.Ridiculous and nonsensical in all of the best ways. The cast is so overstuffed that some of them literally just show up to nod at the camera. Vast improvement from F9 and on-par with 6 and 8. Love that they draw the storyline from Fast Five, because that remains the best of the bunch.But what really makes this movie stand out and what everyone will be talking about is Jason Mamoa's wacky performance as the villain. He has more fun than Nicolas Cage, eating up the scenery and licking blood off blades. This may be the biggest reason I have to look forward to the sequels (which there are now two of, despite this tenth ""film"" originally intended as the last). That and more from Hobbs and Shaw.These movies aren't good in the traditional sense, but neither were most action films from the '80s and I still love those. This fan base knows not to take anything seriously, and they lean into the inside joke in Fast X with a ridiculous amount of references to family. When they rehashed the absurd plot of the previous films, it felt like a giant wink at the audience.Watched it in 4DX and it was one of the most aggressive films I've seen in the format, including John Wick 3. I was certain I would get tossed from my seat during a few of the biggest action scenes. I just wish the snow had worked better.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

There is a plot thrown in there somewhere, but it's fairly insignificant and exists solely to stage over-the-top action scenes, fast cars, and hand-to-hand fighting, some of which are occasionally exciting. The way baddie Momoa sashays and singsongs through this three-ring circus implies he's seen (a few) of the previous entries, as all of his kinetic preening and posing show definitive knowledge of what movie he's in, too bad no one else in this expansive cast has that same level of fun. Outside of him, any new characters get lost in the shuffle since there's already too many to begin with.

Basically half of the action actors are in the cast, like most of the budget, so that's great, acting - not so much! Paranormal action scenes, that make you laugh more than the jokes. The movie is about cars! C'mon! With all the bad things I threw at the movie, I can say that I liked the villain. Can't believe I said that, about Aquaman painting nails of corpses.

Not a die hard, but I've seen about 6 of the movies with Tokyo Drift being my favorite. My wife and I have been huge fans of the 4DX experience and thought a movie like this would benefit from that kind of viewing. The newest Jurassic Park and Top Gun were awesome in these venues.Now I realize the Fast series isn't at all some Russian-novel-esque kind of plotline but the movies always had a decent undertone despite all the flamboyant action. We got NONE of that from Fast X. This movie was so poorly written, we actually left 30min before it ended. It had no plotline that was any bit interesting to have you care about what was going on. I'm kind of sick of them trying to make Jason Mamoa a thing, he's good in small doses in movies but I really don't think he's meant to hold a role this big. He's lately just playing the psychotic bad guy now that he looks like a grizzled biker gang guy, a big departure from his early days on GoT when he was some heart throb for the ladies.This movie was incredibly disappointing as it felt like the action scene was written first and they filled in whatever dumb back story could mildly work to support the scene. I give this movie 1 star as even watching it with all the glitz and action of 4DX couldn't save it, I couldn't care less how it ended hence why we just left before it ended. Do not waste your money and see it in theaters unless you have an IQ of 80 and you're fine with no tangible plot.","9 out of 12 found this helpful.

This series unfortunately has no end! Vin Diesel as Dom Toretto must once again defend the family, he is supported by many colleagues who also can not act. ""Fast & Furious 10"" (""Fast X"") is a makeshift continuation of the fifth part: Dante (Jason Momoa) is the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, who was once treated badly by the Torettos. Dante now wants to avenge his father, who was humiliated in the fifth part of the franchise. He also fights for the family - but for his own. As gruesomely crude and poorly told as the film is, if you look at it as a symptom, you can easily derive a social diagnosis from it: In this film, we encounter people without a world, and in the cinema audiences sit without a film. For dismemberment and fragmentation determine the form and content of this series.The main characters, led by Dom Toretto, are anchored in a world dominated by consumerism and individualism. They act as a private intervention force in a gray area between nation-states, reflecting society's increasing disorientation and fragmentation.The portrayal of the family as the highest good is a central element of the film. The Torettos act in the interest of family, and this is used as a cover to mask their own selfishness and individualism. This reflects late modern socialization, in which more and more people live in a present in which they do not recognize themselves.The film shows a return to barbarism on all levels. The characters are people without a world and the viewers are spectators without a film. This is an expression of the total disorientation and fragmentation of society.Despite its action-packed sequences and spectacular stunts, ""Fast & Furious 10"" is an expression of a crisis of the individual and a crisis of the political. The Torettos are a private intervention force operating in the gray area between nation-states.The film reveals a crisis of critique. Dom articulates a malaise, but is unable to connect this diagnosis to an analysis. He is unable to think in contexts.The film reveals nepotism and clear structures that continue to prevail. The Torettos act in the interest of the family against the family interests of another.The film is an expression of an obscure neo-feudalism in which the attention given to someone is legitimized by birthright.","26 out of 43 found this helpful.

It was no different to the previous films, except for no garage scene where both acting and dialogue plumbed new abyss depths of awfulness - something ""fans"" don't notice which has got to give you an idea if where they come from, car chases, car explosions, girl fight, and all the exact same tropes as found in the first film which have always been in every film.If you enjoyed 8 and 9 you'll enjoy this.

Jason Momoa cannot act. This is nothing new; he's never made a good movie. But this is beyond bad. His performance is akin to a grade 9 high school drama class production. I guess is all you want to see is fast cars, explosions and unbelievably cheesy dialog then this is the movie for you. But unlike most action movies, it requires a special level of 'dumbed-down' mentality to get through the entirety of this movie. But I gave it 2 stars - one star is for Charlize Theron who never lets us down in a role. And the other is for the soundtrack which is the best thing about the Fast franchise.","14 out of 21 found this helpful.

If you watched the previous FF movies, then you know what to expect. So you should not watch this movie if you have not enjoyed the previous FF movies. Fans of the franchise watch these movies because we enjoy the over-the-top action, over-the-top vehicles and the escapism entertainment. No FF movie is aiming to win an Oscar. I highly recommend watching this movie in a cinema; there are some amazing action sequences that you will enjoy best on the big screen. The cast is superb. All the characters are back. The sound track is awesome as usual. So there is nothing lacking in this FF movie. However....... I was upset that this movie was not resolved. It ends on a cliffhanger. I was not aware going to watch this movie that there would be no ending to this movie. I hate watching movies that are released in parts. You have to wait for the next movie to see what happens next. Why????. This story was not so captivating that it had to be multiple parts. So the movie was good right up until it ended on a cliffhanger. Big thumbs down for this. So, except for the ending the movie was good and enjoyable. Would have been great if they had just taken 15 minutes to end the story properly. No one wants to watch a FF movie in parts. What were they thinking? Ruined a potentially great movie. If they had advertised this movie as Fast X part 1 then I would not have gone to watch this. So, for that reason I can rate this at the most 7.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

With a complete absence of a coherent plot, subpar acting, and a lack of any semblance of logic, this film falls flat and fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors.One of the most glaring issues with Fast X is its haphazard storyline or lack thereof. From the outset, it becomes apparent that the writers took a backseat, favouring over-the-top action sequences at the expense of a compelling narrative. The plot meanders aimlessly, introducing convoluted twists and turns that do little to engage or captivate the audience. It feels like a mere collection of random events loosely stitched together, resulting in a confusing and unsatisfying viewing experience.Unfortunately, the deficiencies in the movie extend beyond the weak storyline. The performances by the cast are underwhelming, with stilted dialogue and unconvincing delivery. Even the franchise's seasoned actors seem disinterested and phoning in their performances. This lack of authenticity robs the film of any emotional depth or connection with the audience, leaving characters feeling one-dimensional and uninspiring.Moreover, Fast X suffers from a serious lapse in logical coherence. While previous films in the franchise pushed the boundaries of believability, Fast X seems to have abandoned any semblance of rationality altogether. Spectacular and improbable stunts dominate the screen, defying the laws of physics without any explanation or context. This complete disregard for plausibility only serves to alienate viewers further and undermines the film's ability to suspend disbelief.In summary, Fast X is a disastrous addition to the franchise. Its lack of a coherent plot, subpar acting, and nonsensical action sequences make for a frustrating and bewildering cinematic experience. Die-hard fans of the series may find moments of enjoyment amidst the chaos, but for most viewers, this film is a regrettable misstep. It fails to capture the essence of what made the franchise successful, leaving audiences longing for the days of well-crafted storytelling and engaging characters.","10 out of 14 found this helpful.

Addition of Jason was supposed to be great but someone decided to have his character be an odd ball villain and it just didn't suit him or the movie.

He does some great interviews which can be viewed on Youtube too. He asked some of the cast if they'd consider calling the tenth installment ... well you see what. 10 movies - that does not include the Hobbs and Shaw one off or spinoff or whatever it is called. And as far as I understand, there are supposed to be more spin offs in the future ... until then Vin Diesel wants to finish off the main story.That said, this was supposed to be ... well there was only supposed to be another one of these. So 11 should have been the last one ... Vin suggested that there may be a 12th. I know that some have become numb and feel indifferent about the franchise. And that is ok - for me, they grow on me. Actually I may even rewatch the other ones and rate them a bit better than I did after the first time I saw them. If you think this is not for you, there is a simple solution: do not watch them.And hey I would get it ... there are so many things that don't make sense (laws of physics be damned and many other things that just wouldn't happen in the real world) ... and then there are story threads that are just left ... to die alone I reckon? There are recurring characters here that I assume most would not expect to see again (unless someone spoiled it for them) ... and then there are characters in this, that are in it for a minute and then they seem to vanish ... Scott Eastwood ... there may be some deleted scene that explains his situation, but ... well the good thing I reckon is, that the movie is quite fast (and furious - and crazy by the way) ... so you may not notice. If Speed had the bus going 40 or so miles an hour, this one has quadruple the speed ...or more. Not all the time - it starts off with reminiscing or rather rewriting one of the most insane scene the franchise has given us ... well which one do I mean? I know there are so many ... well it is the safe scene and if you are aware of the franchise you know what I mean.It is about introducing Aqua... I mean Jason Mamoa to us. He is quite ... well he is not right in the head. There is an evaluation that we hear during the film ... but we don't need it. And Jason has quite a lot of fun with his character. Which is love it or hate it ... really out there. Again do not try to make sense of his masterplan ... you won't be able to do that. You might be surprised about a particular scene of his though ... that is quite dark - didn't expect to see something like that in a PG13 movie ... not complaining, just baffled it made it through ... rotten and dark humor setting a tone for him ... not consistent, but that's also a consistency I reckon.Family is a big part ... and the extended family is again in danger ... but the movie is aware of some of the criticism too ... and plays with that ... well people being friendly with our crew ... or dare I say family? I mean we have come to love them, haven't we? No matter who and no matter how they were introduced ... and how they turned out ... this installment feels like it has more hand to hand combat (or feet for that matter) than previous movies. But I may be wrong about that ... what I do know: it ups the ante once again ... and we do end up on a cliffhanger ... almost literally. That said, be aware of another mid credit scene (the one from the last movie does get picked up upon and resolved during the run time this time around) ... the stakes are high ... and there is another pun here that I won't touch, maybe your mind is as twisted as mine and you can see it for yourself ... which is also true for the movie ... it can be fun if you let it ... take the passenger seat and go on a ride ... the road to the end begins ... or something like that, right?","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

Finally.After seeing our team go to space and crash a car into a satellite, it was also a breath of fresh air to have scaled down action sequences that I could still feel tension during. Sure, physics laws are still broken here and there, but the grit has returned a bit.Plot-wise, this makes absolutely no sense. The villain must be a future seer of some kind because there is no way his plan could have possibly worked otherwise. It's convoluted and serves as an excuse to write cool fight setups into the plot.But as for legitimate criticisms, the plot is about all I have. The tone is better balanced between cheesy and serious, and I had an absolute blast with this flawed piece of work.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

But, nowadays, Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son (Jason Momoa, Aquaman) of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes (Joaquin de Almeida). A rogue representative (Brie Larson of Captain Marvel) from the Agency and Aimes (Alan Richtson of Reacher) , the new head of the Agency who doesn't hold the same fondness for Dom's crew as his predecessor, and a Brazilian street racer (Daniela Melchior of The Suicide Squad) become involved in the chases. Mr. Nobody The Last Ride !. The end of the road begins !. Not all races can be won !.Jason Momoa, Brie Larson and Rita Moreno join Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, John Cena, Jason Statham, Oscar winner Helen Mirren, Oscar winner Charlize Theron and the rest of the stars: Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, of the most successful action franchise of the 21st century. More 'Fast' and more 'Furious' than ever, the movie It picks up the plot of the fifth installment, in which Dominic Toretto and his team took down the Brazilian drug lord Herman Reyes, and decimated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. But his son Dante, who witnessed everything, has since been devising a master plan to make Dom pay a high price for what he did. In a frenetic trip that leads from Los Angeles to the Plaza Spain, catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to the Antarctic. Dom will have new allies and new enemies and will face old contenders to prevent Dante from destroying his family and ending everything and everyone he loves. In Fast X, Jason Momoa stands out playing a sadomasochistic and ironic villain with tendencies of greatness. The megalomaniacal Momoa plays sympathetically but exceeding his evil and irony.'Fast X' is lavishly produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent and the executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. The motion picture with lots of special effects was professionally directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk) along with Justin Lin who wrote too and previously made some episodes of the hit saga. Rating: 6/10. The film will appeal to ¨Fast and furious¨ saga fans.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In my opinion, all the films in this franchise have consistently declined in quality since Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson joined the cast. In my view, these films have become subpar in every aspect.One of the main reasons for my disappointment is the excessive use of CGI and special effects in the action scenes. The Fast series started as a story about car racing and adrenaline-fueled adventures. However, in the recent films, I have noticed a disturbing exaggeration of science fiction elements and cars that seem to defy the laws of physics by flying through the air. This shift towards science fiction has detached the series from its original premise and destroyed the charm and realism it once had.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

Including the trips to space but this is as pretty rubbish. Vin Diesel needs to step back a bit and let other characters have a chance. Also, lose the kid actor (little Brian). He added nothing to this movie. The girl who plays Ramsay isn't working at all with the dynamic of the other characters. If she can be killed off then bonus. Not sure what's going on but if Vin Diesel is constantly putting himself centre stage then he needs to back off a bit, stop being such a prima donna and let some of the others play a bigger part. Then there's the obvious. If they can bring back Brian (Paul Walker) via CGI and have him eventually kill the baddies and save the entire planet they'd be giving fans of the franchise exactly what they want. I know how I'd play it and write it all. The Vin Diesel (Dom) character has become boring. He was never the best character anyway and and I'm sure he knows it. He needs to let the other characters take more of a lead over him, and I'm not on about Dwayne Johnson because his character is dreadful too and too much like the Dom character.The craziness needs to be stripped back because it's gone so far beyond ridiculous now. It's almost like science fiction in parts.One very good thing about this movie. Jason Momoa and the scene with Shaw and Han (that was very good).They definitely need to bring back Brian (Paul Walker) by way of CGI for the final movie though, and have him be the main guy.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Also, as much as I had hoped for Fast and Fury X, I couldn't imagine the ending leaving it incomplete. Because I thought the movie will end in one episode, but it didn't, they will release the movie or its second part considering the commercial aspect of the movie. I think this is a bad thing.

I use that term loosely because there isn't one.This latest installment in the franchise is like all the bad Marvel films wrapped into one movie with some cool things sprinkled around, and note I say cool, not good things.But it's Fast and Furious. Nobody shows up to a F&F movie for intricate plots and groundbreaking storytelling. We show up for fast cars, action, explosions, fast cars again, and hot chicks.And that is exactly what holds this assault to the senses film up, cool, ridiculous, over the type, and explosions that could almost make Michael Bay blush.Then what gives this movie that extra point and this is 100% a personal thing, but my girl who I thought would never return to the F&F franchise made a five second appearance, and I lost it! I swear I will fanboy over this woman til the day I die. I refuse to say who as to avoid spoilers.Anyway Fast X was everything I anticipated it to be at this point with the Fast franchise over the top, and ridiculous, but even that can't save a poor script, bad writing, and horrible storytelling.IMDb: 3/10

He is just not funny, not even the least funny. And when he is evil, he is just not evil. He is like a bad comic book character. Bad acting is not even close to how horrible he is.I can't find anything positive about the movie, it's completely waste of time. Sad that Hollywood makes films like this.

Always good to see the gang. This time around the villian working in the shadows is dante. Played camply by Jason mamle. I actually pretty much enjoyed his performance. There were other old pals back again and though we didn't see much of them its nice seeing them. Another new character is tess, played by the wonderful brie Larson working for the government that's Been monitoring their actions since the start.

The action pieces are as ridiculous as the previous films but it's more entertaining (and thrilling) than F9. The addition of new characters made the film wasted most of the potential like short screen time and poorly written characterization.

With the latest installment set to mark a milestone in its longevity, this cinematic offering possesses the potential to become an all-time classic. Beyond the critical discourse surrounding the series, there is an undeniable charm in its ability to entertain through a blend of high-octane action, heartfelt drama, cringe-worthy moments, humor, and explosive set pieces. Unlike other films that may require specific expectations, the Fast and Furious movies offer a straightforward invitation to immerse oneself in an exhilarating experience, providing over two hours of unadulterated entertainment.Notably, the franchise's grandeur and scale rank it among the most prominent in the industry, demonstrated by its ability to assemble a star-studded cast from previous installments. This feat surpasses even the efforts of esteemed studios such as Warner Bros and Marvel Studios, who have yet to achieve a comparable crossover event. In contemplating the character of Dominic Toretto, one may even argue for his inclusion in the pantheon of superhero icons like Superman, Batman, Captain America, and Iron Man. Dom's unwavering dedication to protecting his family sets him apart, a quality that some traditional comic book heroes have faltered in attaining on numerous occasions.While I refrain from delving into specific plot details, it is worth mentioning that Fast X surpasses its predecessor, offering a more satisfying viewing experience. The impending conclusion of this beloved franchise will undoubtedly leave a void, as few others possess the same enduring appeal. For this latest entry, expectations should be tempered, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the narrative as it unfolds. Ultimately, whether one appreciates the film or not, the decision to support it monetarily rests with the individual. However, it would be remiss to disregard the cultural impact and lasting legacy the Fast and Furious saga has cultivated over its impressive run.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

No. Is it overly dramatic? Yes. Are there oscar winning performances? No.I feel that some are taking these movies wayyyyy too seriously. You're not watching the finest of Stanley Kubrick. You're watching the Vin Diesel superhero show. And you get exactly that.The secret to enjoying fast and furious? I'll give it to you right here: TURN YOUR BRAIN OFF. None of it is going to make sense. Over the years, this franchise has only gotten more bombastic and over-the-top. But the ensemble cast works well together, we can poke fun at the ridiculous and absurd nature of the action, and the only question that will make you tear your hair out is ""how did we get here?"" Because that's the whole point. How did we get from grizzly undercover street racing to stopping bombs rolling down streets with cars? No one knows, and you don't really have to. It's stupid, and it's silly, and it's fun.So do yourself a favor, don't think too hard about it, sit back, relax, watch some cars, watch some action, watch some beautiful people, and laugh at how ridiculous this thing is. And for the love of Brian O'Conner, stop expecting these movies to be more than what they are because you WILL be disappointed.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I won't call it exactly as a total waste of money and time, I just believe that you won't lose anything if you don't see it. It has some strengths, like the love for every family member and the willingness for self-sacrifice, if necessary, the performance of Helen Mirren as the beloved grandma of the family, and the happy memories from the past of Toretto family. But, aside from these, it has nothing really special and there are far better action movies out there, if you want to see one, without all of those car crashes, that -to me- become boring and gratuitous after some time. It's not downright disappointing, but I'd say it's only recommended to the fans of the franchise and it doesn't truly have something important to offer, apart from lightweight entertainment.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Stopping by from time to time.The family is tighter than ever. But good things never just stay good. While ""Dom"" and his crew have been helping ""Little Nobody"" played by Scott Eastwood and his agency. Making recent enemies now frenemies like ""Shaw"" played by Jason Statham. Making an Allie out of old frenemies' parents like ""Queenie"" played by Helen Mirren. Reconnecting with estranged family like ""Dom's"" brother ""Jakob"" played by John Cena.There was an old enemy ""Hernan Reyes"" played by Joaquim de Almeida's son ""Dante"" played by Jason Momoa hiding in the bushes. For ten years he's been waiting to enact his revenge. Of all the people alerting ""Dom"" of this war to come is ""Cipher"" played by Charlize Theron"". When you've lost it all you have nothing to lose. Watch ""Dom"" try to stop a madman set on revenge before he eliminates his entire family.""Fast X"" was a lot to digest. Ten films are stretching over two decades. With new members of the cast (family) being added to each film. The family is massive. Now you have a new villain that won't end up turning good trying to demolish everything.The concept was cool. Jason Momoa's character is interesting. He's so big but yet so goofy. On top of being deranged and murderous. It's a lot to intake.They said they heard the fans and planned on going back to the basics with this film. I was intrigued by that statement but I didn't plan on holding my breath. They did add actual racing and more car elements. But the absurd stuff was still there. The action was intense and fun. I enjoyed that part but of course, you had scenes where they just went way too far.They brought back a lot of familiar faces while giving you the feel of the older films at times. But ""Dom"" single-digit son doing donuts is absurd. They toned down some stuff but added what felt like double the fight and action scenes. Like I said was fun.But the times in between they tried to get in their acting bag. Not everyone is the same in that regard and the multiple scenes where they tried to show off their acting chops were hard to watch at times.Also, I have to mention the elephant in the room Paul Walker. You see clips from old films which put a smile on your face. But this Clark Kent/Superman Cloak and Dagger thing they have going on is annoying. Like it just looks silly to watch.Vin Diesel said there would be a conclusion to ""Paul Walker"" character in this film but I didn't see it. I also think it looks ridiculous ""Mia"" is there but ""Dom's"" best friend isn't nor are their kids. It's also a disservice to Jordana because her character gets limited by all of this. They need to fix it.I loved seeing Paul Walker's Daughter Meadow finally Grace the big screen. Wish her part was a little more pivotal or came with more lines.Overall we have two more films to go. They tamed some of the stuff that was ridiculous by adding double the hand-to-hand action scenes. Which was great. But it still left too many absurd scenes. This film still comes off like it wants to be a Marvel/Transformers film. I promise you a Camaro or Charger isn't indestructible.Paul Walker's character ""Brain"" needs a proper send-off. They went a little too hard trying to show their acting capabilities. This isn't the film for that. I don't know if I love or hate Jason Momoa's character. To be determined.Expect cameos galore which also adds to the absurdness at times. Also, there is a monster cliffhanger and one post-credit scene. Some of the tweaks I liked and some of the tweaks I hated. I give this film three mor fires 🔥🔥🔥. I will say it's the best one I've seen in a while. Stick to normal action, street racing, and cars. That's the recipe for success.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

I don't like a motion picture ending like a TV series ending a season. This one is even moreso an issue because way too many open plot lines. However, unless they've already shot part two to this tenth installment, they can't bank on everyone still living IRL to be around next time. Understand? So, I hope they've already filled it and cut it in half.Now, I did like the movie. Toretto drive hell out of some cars. Not sure how street racing prepared him to use cars the way he does, but sure. All suspension of belief must be left at the door and turn off the brain. Be entertained and see what the story is trying to do. Coming off watching Sisu, not sure I'm digging the villain here. So, he's going the Joker from Dark Knight here, times two. What I mean is, he poses so many questions and all of the just so happens and things left here and there was if he could know who'd be where ahead of time. Lex Luthor is a great villain, but even he couldn't prepare this all ahead of time, especially explosives in certain places.Too many cameos, unless there's a part two to this tenth installation. I don't do spoilers, but twice I rolled my eyes on a reveal. Oh, Dom was given a choice that I disagreed with because the other option was more valuable, but the plot said that his choice has a connection to him greater than the other option. Without spoilers, you know it when you see it in Brasil. Also, how they travel so much but have cars when they touch down is funny, but this series of movies says it ok. I gave Sisu a 7.5, and Dom having Sisu, can't get a 7 out of me. I'm gonna watch this movie again because it's fun! It's far out like Angelina's Wanted movie where they curve bullets, but it's fun cinema.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

We don't know her."" The action scenes? My grandma's tales of her uphill school walks (both ways) in snow feel more believable. Cars taking off like rockets? Sure! Next, they'll tell me they're working on a spinoff where Dom drifts around Mars.Jason Momoa's appearance is the only tether to the real world. But even his undeniable charisma struggles against the weight of a script that seems to defy not just logic, but the very laws of physics. Watching Momoa in this film is akin to seeing a Michelin-star chef trying to whip up a gourmet meal using only instant ramen and expired ketchup.Ah, the beloved ""family"" theme. It's like the writers went, ""Okay, we can't kill anyone significant, so let's just teleport in characters from the past!"" Seriously, the ""family"" safety net is so unrealistically strong, it makes trapeze artists jealous. I've seen bubble wrap less protective.The blatant callbacks to ""Fast Five"" are just rubbing salt into our nostalgia-wounded hearts. It's as if the producers are waving old family photos in our face and screaming, ""See? We were fun once!"" Yes, we remember. And we also notice how the once semi-grounded series has catapulted into an alternate universe where gravity, logic, and decent storytelling have taken a permanent vacation.The dialogue is such a cringefest it feels unreal. It's as if they hired a robot who once overheard humans talking, and it's now trying its absolute best to mimic them. Spoiler: it fails. Badly.Let's talk about those long, drawn-out, purportedly ""comic"" scenes. Each of them feels like being trapped in an eternal elevator ride with that one co-worker who thinks he's a stand-up comedian. Yes, Pete Davidson's black market stint. It might've been realistic if we lived in a world where humor was outlawed.By the end, ""Fast x"" is more of a challenge to one's suspension of disbelief than a movie. If you've ever wanted to test the limits of your tolerance for cinematic absurdity, here's your gauntlet.The only real thing about this movie? The headache I got from rolling my eyes too much. For those who enjoy a firm grasp on reality, perhaps give this one a miss. For those who enjoy seeing what happens when filmmakers throw realism out at 100mph? Well, buckle up for a wild, logic-defying ride. Still, I'd suggest wearing a helmet; it's going to hurt. 1/10.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movies were fun, not overly complicated to follow, mostly mindless escape from reality.... That last on in the franchise that I actually enjoyed watching as Fast 5..... It's been going downhill all along, yes, but each one after Five hits a new low....Then you have something like Fast X..... They drag in footage from previous movies, but they don't really interweave into the story .... So much so that they're virtually pointless with the small exception of using clip from a previous movie to build the background of the new super villain.And that new villain is more of a psychopathic joke told by a comedian who's had a lobotomy. Not a fan of Momoa, nor do I particularly dislike him... What I can say after having seen about 50% of his See series (got bored with it), is that this type of movie is out of his range as an actor. The character wasn't believable in the first place and his acting didn't help things. The attempts at humor just fell flat..... And the scene with the dead guys propped up in lawn chairs, what was the point? What was funny is how utterly ridiculous Momoa looks in pigtails.The CGI work in this one, you'd think would have been better as the tech. To create it has gotten better by leaps and bounds..... Nope..... It's terrible! I mean, like 1990's CGI terrible. Doesn't even come close to appearing like a finished product, much less appearing believable..... In some of the gun fight scenes, bullets can be seen ricocheting off people, for pete's sake -- one off the torso and another off a foot.... Didn't anyone edit the movie? C'mon now..... And it's noticeable first because the CGI is so bad and second because the movie is actually boring..... Way too many scenes of blowing stuff up and shoot outs that drag on and on and on and....Some of the hand-to-hand combat scenes were well done, I'll give them that.The car crashes and wrecks and bombs that just ONE car survives.... Gimme a break! I get it, action movie, not supposed to be real, but, seriously, there is a line that is supposed to be toed.... Once they crossed it, it looks more like a very bad sci-fi movie attempt. They're not just asking the viewer to suspend reality, but to throw it under a flaming bus. Doesn't work. What made the first few movies fun was the possibility of reality..... The type of driving featured, the effects, could be possible, they worked....And the scenes where people are leaning out car windows or sticking arms out of said windows during high speed chases..... C'mon.... They're so badly done, that no even the clothing on the ppl ruffle in the breeze.... Seriously? You lean half your body out the window of a car doing 100+ mph, you're not going to survive, period.... No matter how muscle bound you are.This movie shouldn't have ended in a way that required a sequel..... Really, they need to just stop making movies in this franchise.... It's time to call it quits.... The actors are REALLY showing their age and not in a good way.... It's just not believable to cast them in these types of roles anymore. The G-forces you'd have to survive with so many major car crashes alone --- a body that age wouldn't survive, much less walk away without so much as a limp.Terrible movie..... Feel sorry for anyone who got suckered into paying to see it.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

For a 2 hour movie, it definitely felt longer to a point where we started to fast forward the movie to skip many of its boring scenes.While reading through the bad critics that Jason mamoa recieved, i cant agree. He contributed to comical lines, funny gestures and a new character which we havent seen really in the franschise. Despite his contribution, he couldnt really save it.My advise, save 2 hours and do something more beneficial than wasting it on this piece of trash. The franschise should have ended with Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Fast X is not actually a film, I had to stave off sleep the first 20 minutes of the movie. There is no actual plot to the film and the ending is spectacularly pathetic. I would have been less disappointed if they had turned the film into a telenovela. Though at this point with the constant resurrection of characters, it might as well be.

Jason Momoa is incredible and really makes this movie for what it is. And yeah, some parts were a bit fiction, but in f9 they went to space. In Furious 7 they jumped from building to building, so I really don't mind. I had a fantastic time in the theater. One of the greatest movies of the franchise. It had everything. It had comedy that hit at the right point, emotional at each corner and it always kept you on your toes with the action that it had. ( also great cars as always). Excellent, action packed plus the mid credit scene brought me shock (in a good way though). This is exactly what we expected to get, can't wait for the next one.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

All in all good movie just didn't follow what felt like a fast and furious movie. Felt like multiple stunts that have already been used had been reused. Actions by characters didn't feel normal for the character just for the sake of extending the movie. Had vin followed what his character normally does in these movies this very easily could have ended the first face to face meeting with Jason. Felt predictable from the start of the movie and progressively got more predictable. I for sure hope when they release the second part they come out with something that feels new and and is relentless at fighting for redemption after how short this fell of following the previous movies.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

The storyline offers nothing new to the franchise, following the same predictable plot structure as its nine predecessors.One of the most glaring flaws of Fast X lies in the performances of its characters, particularly Vin Diesel. It becomes evident that Diesel heavily relies on action sequences to carry his roles, showcasing his lack of acting skills. John Cena, on the other hand, attempts to inject humor into the film, but unfortunately, his efforts fall flat, leaving the audience unamused.The screenplay is another weak point of the movie. It feels amateurish, lacking the professionalism one would expect from a production of this magnitude. Even a script written by a seven-year-old child would have likely been an improvement. The dialogues and overall writing quality leave much to be desired, contributing to the overall disappointment of the film.Action scenes, a trademark of the Fast and Furious franchise, are a major letdown in Fast X. They defy the laws of physics and come off as ridiculous rather than thrilling. It's particularly disheartening considering the high standards set by recent action films like the brilliant and breathtaking John Wick 4. Fast X fails to deliver on the expectations for captivating action sequences, further dampening the viewing experience.In terms of adding value to the series, Fast X falls flat. It brings nothing new to the table, merely regurgitating tired storylines and clichés from previous installments. The ending, which attempts to leave audiences hanging with a cliffhanger, comes across as a cheap and poorly thought-out decision, leaving a bitter taste in viewers' mouths.One redeeming factor in Fast X is the performance of Jason Momoa. Momoa manages to shine amidst the chaos, delivering a noteworthy portrayal. However, his limited screen time hardly salvages the overall trainwreck of the film.Fast X is a mindless and disappointing movie that fails to make any significant contribution to the series. It falls short in terms of both storytelling and action, leaving audiences unimpressed and yearning for more substance. With a lackluster ending and an overall lack of creativity, Fast X fails to deliver the thrills and excitement expected from a franchise that has overstayed its welcome.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

The latest installment, 'Fast X,' takes the franchise's descent into chaos to a whole new level. The plot is an absolute mess, resembling a hastily stitched patchwork of half-baked ideas and absurd scenarios.From the opening scene, it's clear that coherence and believability were not priorities for the filmmakers. Instead, they opted for a series of vignettes that lack any narrative flow or logical progression. It feels like the script was written by tossing random ideas into a hat and picking them out one by one. The result is a convoluted and disjointed story that leaves the audience scratching their heads in confusion.'Fast X' is also filled to the brim with ridiculous scenes that defy the laws of physics and common sense. While the franchise has always flirted with over-the-top action sequences, this installment crosses the line into absurdity. We're expected to suspend our disbelief as cars jump across skyscrapers, defy gravity, and perform impossible stunts with ease. It's as if the filmmakers threw any semblance of realism out the window in favor of mindless spectacle.Character development takes a backseat in 'Fast X.' The ensemble cast, which has been a cornerstone of the franchise, feels underutilized and lacking depth. Instead of exploring the dynamics between the characters and their motivations, the film focuses on flashy action sequences and explosive set pieces. As a result, the audience is left disconnected from the characters, unable to form any emotional attachment or investment in their journey.While the 'Fast and Furious' series has always thrived on its entertaining and adrenaline-pumping action, 'Fast X' takes it to an extreme that borders on self-parody. It sacrifices substance and storytelling in favor of excessive spectacle and mind-numbing action. What made the earlier films enjoyable was their ability to strike a balance between thrilling stunts and engaging storytelling, but this latest entry abandons that formula altogether.In conclusion, 'Fast X' is a disappointing addition to the franchise. Its messy plot, vignette structure, and nonsensical scenes leave much to be desired. Fans hoping for a return to the franchise's roots will be sorely disappointed by this lackluster installment. It's a prime example of a series that has lost its way, prioritizing spectacle over substance. Unless you're solely looking for mindless action and can overlook glaring flaws, 'Fast X' is best avoided.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes.The high-octane summer flick distributed by Universal Pictures was directed by Louis Leterrier. Writing credits go to Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau.THINGS I LIKED:
Just like the movie itself, the cast is stuffed. The awesome cast is packed full with fan favorites: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Charlize Theron, John Cena, Brie Larson, Scott Eastwood, Jason Momoa, and SO many more!It takes only a few minutes before the first car chase and action sequences begin. After that, it's pretty non-stop adrenaline.We get a lot of fun cameos, so no spoilers!Jason Momoa/Aquaman is hilarious and awesome as an over-the-top villain. His changing hairstyles and gold fingernail polish kept me entertained as he shined on the screen and stole every scene he was in. He looked like he was having an absolute blast making this movie.It's great to see Rita Moreno. She looks fantastic, as always.Helen Mirren! Yes! She's such a national treasure.Lots of visual and spoken humor.Almost non-stop action with entertaining and sometimes cool fight sequences.We get to travel around the world in the movie. I always love that.If you're a fan of this franchise, you'll be happy to know there WILL be a sequel.Keep watching during the final rolling credits for another scene with important information for the next Fast installment, and a fun cameo performance.The movie is delightfully self-aware, as well as completely cognizant of what the fans want. For that, audiences have awarded the film a high 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, film critics are less impressed, scoring the movie a low 54%. What did YOU think?It definitely feels like a summer blockbuster with all the epic scenes and big moments you'd expect and want.Congrats to the stunt team for their excellent work.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie ends abruptly without resolving everything. The film felt unfinished even though it was SO long.All of the main characters get their moment in the movie; however, not all of the characters' situations are resolved. Some characters get completely dropped after their moment and we never see them again.SPOILER: What happened to the traditional Fast and Furious with the family all eating together at a BBQ? The movie ended more like the Avengers Endgame with characters scattered all over the place.There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse new viewers about the timeline.There are a lot of characters to keep track of. Newbies won't quite understand how everyone is connected, nor appreciate their backstories.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity
Destruction
Lots of violence
People in perilous situations
Violence with weapons, as well as hand-to-hand combat
High dead-body count!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm not a real fan of the franchise so I just tried to watch this as an objective moviegoer. All the car chases and action scenes ignore the laws of physics to the point of absolute absurdity. This was more like a clip of Grand Theft Auto than a film, and I wonder who keeps green lighting these. With all the stars this movie had and the cost of all the vehicles and special FX there's no way this turns a profit.The story is as old as the franchise itself, go get the bad guy that's trying to blow up the world and prove to the agency you're innocent. There's plenty of things that can be done with a story like this to make it watchable, they didn't do it here. The part with the kayak turning into a plane? What is this, transformers? It almost had a Michael Bay feel to it. Hats off to all the cameos like Jason Statham and Pete Davidson, next time choose better paths for your careers.If you're a fan of the F&F franchise you'll want to skip this one anyways, but you won't. How many sequels until you say 'enough'? If you're not a fan of the franchise you'll definitely want to skip it. But if you're reading this review you probably watched it and want to see if everybody agreed with you. Side note: my dog had puppies a few days ago and I gave her milk which was a a bad idea. She's been sharting all day long and I cleaned the same spot on the rug like 6 times. So I may have been distracted but I still feel like I didn't miss anything in this one. Why was Momoa wearing nail polish? I guess they wanted him to seem like a real nut case which he did. He was the only good thing in this movie, he was kind of funny.","22 out of 38 found this helpful.

Dante is the cruelest villain in the franchise and deserves an Oscar for his performance. I am not kidding. Is as good as Joker in 'The Dark Knight'.The movie is a action packed, well paced, the cast is memorable and it deserves a continuation. Is between Fast Five and Furious 7 as good. Way better than 8 and 9. If they want to do a finale from 2 movies (or 3) so be it.I came at the cinema without expectations and I went out complete surprise and excited for the next movie.

These used to be films targeted at lads with fit women and fast cars. There was always some CGI but it's got to the point now where I have to question whether a car was even driven in the making of this movie? What ever happened to stunt cars and stunt drivers with chase scenes? I honestly feel with CGI the stunts are ridiculously far fetched and far less realistic than if they are genuine stunts and when it comes to cars realism is everything. It's not as bad as Fast 9 which was the worst film ever made but it's a shadow of its former self. It's all about juiced up big name male actors and CGI the fit girls and driving doesn't exist anymore. It's like taking a 90 lads mag and trying to turn it into OK - it doesn't work!","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's better than Fast 8 & Fast 9, but not quite at the heights of Fast 5, 6 & 7 - the peak of the Fast Saga.Jason Momoa steals the film easily! Flamboyant, funny, intimidating and enhances every scene he's in. Momoa's Dante is up there with Statham's Deckard Shaw as the best Fast villains.Of course Fast X has all the bombastic and over the top action you'd expect with the Rome set piece being a particular stand out.It is fairly predictable, although there was a twist character reveal and character death in the 3rd act I didn't see coming. The humour/banter between some of the fast crew felt a bit stale. The crew were split up for most of this but I wish they were together more seeing as this is the beginning of the end. I also didn't like the final scene as it brings back yet another dead character, undercutting the impact of that sacrifice but also the death I mentioned in this film and possible future deaths as in your mind you know there's a good chance they're gonna be brought back again.There's a mid credit scene, spoiled by The Wrap after the premiere, that has me excited for the next one which I do think should be the last one. Even tho I enjoy these films, we don't need a Fast 12 and a 3 part finale.At this point, 10 films over 22 years, you're either in for the ride and have fun with what this franchise is or you're not.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The way this movie was made fits in the time we live in. I guess if you are a 13 year old with the attention span of a paperclip, the movie will be fine for you. This is because of two reasons:Every scene in this movie is packed with something to trigger your neurons. It's either music, voice over, a big text on the screen, camera movements, cuts, everything! But not only in the scenes where it would fit, but also in dialogues. In slow scenes or even cinematic shots between scenes. Everything is full of small 2022 tiktok and YouTube content creator tricks to keep the people watching. This would be fine for the finally or some action scene in the middle but not everywhere.This leads me to reason two, the consequence:
The movie does not build any suspense. It starts directly at 110% and stays there. No suspense that builds up over the course of the movie and finishes in a great finale.Just a whole lot of artificial suspense that modern content creators use, glued together.Boring, way over the top, painful to watch.2/10 stars only because of one or two laughs and the adorable role of John Cena.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Perhaps more of the same, after a few years, would be entertaining. Alas, five minutes into this terribly long film, it became clear that greedy producers had morphed a pure action story into a futuristic, unbelievable, poorly written punishment. Even the driving seemed unnecessary in this pointless script. They certainly spent big money with the locations, car chases and other action-filled gimmicks but I found it a total waste of my time. It made me long for MI: XXXIII coming, no doubt, at a theatre near you. The acting deserves a especial mentioning because with perhaps the exception of the kid, everyone else is a pretty bad caricature of something. And each actor/ actress seems to be working in isolation, with no much chemistry with the rest. I got the feeling that they were filmed solo, next to people fully dressed in bright green, and then computer magic put it together for the commercial launch.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Nevertheless, despite its fervent attempts to rekindle the magic of past glory, the film ultimately succumbs to the wearisome aspects of a long-standing franchise.Once known for reveling in its own absurdity, the previous movies fearlessly drenched audiences in jaw-dropping action and gravity-defying stunts that relentlessly challenged the boundaries of cinematic adrenaline. These audacious feats, which were enough to make hearts race beyond the speed limit, have now transformed into familiar spectacles that no longer evoke the same awe and astonishment. Even the once-mind-bending spectacle of Vin Diesel executing a gravity-defying 90-degree angle drive has lost its luster, having been viewed ad nauseam throughout the nine preceding installments.The allure of the franchise's former bravado, which once shimmered with an air of audacity, is now overshadowed by a sense of formulaic predictability that hangs heavy in the air. Fast X's narrative finds itself trapped within the confines of its own legacy, reluctantly recycling well-worn tropes and clichés in a bid to replicate the past glories that have etched the franchise into the annals of cinema history. This reliance on established elements stifles the potential for genuine innovation and leaves the audience longing for a breath of fresh air.Even the commendable attempt to inject novelty into the film through celebrity cameos unveiled via a submarine reveal falls short of resuscitating the once-pulsating nerve of the series. The grandeur and extravagance of these surprise appearances momentarily raise eyebrows, but they do little to quell the creeping sense of déjà vu that hovers over the viewing experience.For devoted fans who have embarked on the tumultuous 22-year journey, Fast X might still offer moments of gratification and nostalgia, serving as a testament to their unwavering loyalty to the beloved franchise. However, for those in search of a rejuvenated and imaginative cinematic encounter, the film's adherence to timeworn conventions and a regrettably formulaic approach may leave them yearning for a fresher, more invigorating direction. As the tenth installment in the series, Fast X stands as an illustration of the inevitability that even the most cherished of franchises can endure the passage of time, prompting reflection on the fleeting nature of cinematic enchantment.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Characters was overdone and ""Dante"" went from clown to villain entire movie. To many random scenes, strange dialogues and it feels like they wanted the end but had to make up new ideas along the way. Typical result of an unfinished product. Various online games could be saved by bugfixes but this is done, this cant be fixed.Also, did Rome Capital sponsor the movie with all hype regarding Rome and in fact the only Rome part is the trailer?Someone already wrote the most entertaining part from this movie is the 10 star reviews. End this saga with pride.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

It is one of the worst movies of the series and I am convinced that the sequel will be the same, unless some miracle happens. The only gratifying moment was John Cena's scene on the freeway.This proves that a large number of movie stars does not guarantee the success of the picture.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

What began as a thrilling and grounded series has devolved into an excessive spectacle of fantasy and empty creativity. The lack of innovation, departure from its roots, and embrace of superhero tropes have all contributed to its decline. As a devoted fan, it's disheartening to witness the franchise's downward spiral. Instead of relying on captivating storytelling and well-developed characters, the film opts for mindless stunts, explosive action, and gravity-defying sequences. While momentarily thrilling, these elements lack substance and fail to recapture the essence of the franchise's earlier entries. Fast X becomes a hollow display of spectacle, devoid of the depth and innovation that once defined the series. The franchise's departure from its origins is glaringly apparent in Fast X. By introducing superhero elements and embracing absolute fantasy, the film strays far from its roots of underground racing and gripping heists. This shift feels forced and out of place, eroding the authenticity and grounded realism that initially attracted audiences. Fast X, unfortunately, feels more like a generic superhero film than a genuine Fast and Furious installment.Fast X represents the culmination of the franchise's decline. While the first four films struck a delicate balance between over-the-top action and compelling storytelling, subsequent entries sacrificed narrative coherence for spectacle. The fifth and sixth installments maintained some entertainment value, but as the series progressed, logical storytelling took a backseat. Fast X exemplifies this trend, leaving me disappointed and longing for the franchise's earlier glory.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

No story line of consequence, unlikeable & unbelievable characters, laws of physics don't apply, how do these keep getting made?This instalment is nothing more than a green screen & CGI explosions which look fake. Also a schizophrenic movie which is like 3 different movies that don't work well together.The lack of writing & directing skills in Hollywood is clearly evident in this movie (& the previous 4) along with piss-poor continuityThe only saving grace for this movie is Jason Momoa - he is fantastic & probably the role of his career. He reminds me of Heath Ledger as the Joker (and before anyone has a hissy fit, I'm not saying he was as good as Heath by any means, I'm saying the character reminds me of Heath's character).","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Fast X is an absolute cringe fest, burdened with a cheese-soaked script, appalling acting, and a director who clearly lacks the qualifications to direct traffic, let alone a feature film. While the first few films in the franchise were watchable, the latest additions are nothing short of a complete joke. It's bewildering that whoever finances this garbage has more money than sense. One can only hope that this insufferable nonsense meets its demise here.It's understandable that C-grade actors like Diesel and his cohorts want to squeeze every drop of profit from the franchise, but it's disheartening to see esteemed actors like Helen Mirren attach their names to this debacle without a hint of shame. It appears that the allure of a hefty paycheck outweighs their artistic integrity.Fast X is a painful reminder of how a once-promising series can devolve into mindless cash-grabbing. The over-the-top action sequences and contrived plot twists further highlight the lack of creativity and depth in the storytelling. The film feels like a hollow shell of its former self, trading substance for cheap thrills and gimmicks.In the end, Fast X is a prime example of a franchise that has lost its way, sacrificing quality for profit. The cringe-worthy script, subpar acting, and inept direction make it difficult to find any redeeming qualities. Let's hope this is the end of this insufferable nonsense, allowing the Fast and Furious franchise to be remembered for its earlier, more enjoyable entries.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

This installment, which was highly anticipated, fails to recapture the magic that made the earlier films so exhilarating. Instead, it feels like a tired rehash of familiar elements, lacking the heart and excitement that made the series iconic.The first issue with ""Fast X"" lies in its convoluted plot. While the franchise has always pushed the boundaries of believability, this film takes it to an absurd level. The storyline feels disjointed and overly complicated, trying to incorporate too many unnecessary twists and turns that ultimately detract from the overall experience. The attempt to introduce new characters and subplots feels forced and fails to generate the same level of investment as the core group we've grown to love.The action sequences, which were once a highlight of the franchise, have lost their luster in ""Fast X."" Gone are the days of exhilarating, practical stunts and thrilling car races. Instead, the film relies heavily on CGI-heavy sequences that lack the visceral impact and authenticity of the earlier movies. The overuse of CGI diminishes the excitement and makes the action feel artificial and disconnected from reality.Furthermore, the once-strong ensemble cast seems to be going through the motions in ""Fast X."" While the chemistry between the actors has always been a key element of the series, this time it feels forced and lacking in genuine camaraderie. Even the typically charismatic Vin Diesel fails to deliver a memorable performance, coming across as wooden and uninspired.Another disappointing aspect of ""Fast X"" is its lack of character development. The film introduces new faces without giving them proper time to shine, leaving them feeling underdeveloped and uninteresting. The audience's emotional investment in the characters, which was a driving force in previous films, is sorely lacking, making it difficult to care about their fates or connect with their journeys.Lastly, the excessive focus on flashy cars and expensive gadgets overshadows the heart and spirit that made the early ""Fast and Furious"" films so special. The franchise has always celebrated family, loyalty, and the thrill of the ride, but ""Fast X"" forgets those core values in favor of superficial spectacle.In conclusion, ""Fast X"" is a disappointment for fans of the franchise. It fails to recapture the essence of what made the series great, relying on convoluted plotting, lackluster action sequences, and underdeveloped characters. While die-hard fans may find some enjoyment in the familiar faces and adrenaline-fueled moments, it ultimately falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors. Here's hoping the next installment can get the franchise back on track and reignite the fiery spirit of the original ""Fast and Furious"" films.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

The films have become a parody of themselves, but at the same time, they're still fun. It's hard not to respect two decades and 11 movies worth of story and world-building. While Fast X was insane, it was fun having characters across the franchise parade across the screen. All the cameos and callbacks to early entries prop this movie up and keep it from an even lower score. The only reason to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the franchise.

The special effects in this one devoid of any physics, took the cake.I kept saying RIGHTTTT! Like that action scene is indeed possible. Am i watching a fantasy car ride and why are theses cameos popping up everywhere.So it seems they left it wide open for more sequels and god help us that we need to continue to see this franchise live for another movie.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

Even so, they remained fun and still retained genuine heart.Fast & Furious 7 was the culmination of that while giving us an incredibly heartfelt goodbye to Paul Walker that should have been the end of the franchise, where all involved could hold their heads high and be proud to have entertained audiences around the world.Nope. They had to keep making movies, except with none of the effort and heart of the first seven. The stories are so dumb and convoluted that boxes of rocks, bags of hammers, and assorted wooden posts all shake their collective heads in dismay.Repeating the word ""family"" and having yet another ""family"" barbecue with ""family"" doesn't imbue a movie with heart no matter how many times you say the word ""family"". If that were true every word of this review would be ""money"".The stunts are even more absurd and poorly rendered, which is made even more obvious by the Mission: Impossible franchise which continues to improve both narratively and with its incredible yet authentic stunt work.To the makers of these movies, please stop.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

The plot is nonsensical, the characters are bland, and the action scenes are boring and repetitive. The movie has no logic, no emotion, and no creativity. The movie is so bad that it makes Poop look like a masterpiece. Poop, at least, had some humor and originality in its premise of a sentient feces that tries to save the world from an evil toilet paper company. Poop had some charm and wit in its dialogue and animation. Fast X has nothing to offer but cheap thrills and clichés. It is a waste of time and money that should be avoided at all costs.

The entire movie has been horrible from the beginning to and failed to increase entertainment towards the ending. I would not advise anyone to view this movie if you are there to enjoy the action scenes, rather if you are watching it for continuity within the franchise. I know action films are not meant to be realistic, however this movie does not come up to standards on what one may expect on an action film in the modern day. It goes overboard with the ""realism"" and it was not at all entertaining, especially torwards to very ending. I really do wish to be refunded.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and the rest of the original cast and new cast members did a fantastic job with there parts!This movie also has amazing surprising cameos that I do not wanna give anything away, but I had a really good time for this movie.

Mamoa shouldn't have been cast in this in the first place and the writers did a terrible job writing his role. He's tacky, annoying, crazy psychotic sociopath, loud and obnoxius, entitled and all around a douche. Luckily I didn't go watch it in the movie theatre, watched it at home and I could easily skip most of his dialogues/ monologues/ his scenes cause he's just awful. Unbearable. And that part where he talks to the dead tech guys he basically kidnaped to work for him, where they're dead and he taped their eyes open and just rambled on and on about nothing, I just skipped cause bleahh. Pure garbage. Never really saw the hype with this actor either, and this movie really made me not want to watch any of his movies again.There've been many villains in these movies along the way but this one villain is so not worth it. I've mostly skipped the scenes where he comes on, as the rest of the movie is pretty much fine, as usual, packed with great cars, lots of action and fighting, exploding things, jokes and funny moments too.. great surprises, and of course, some ridiculous action scenes cause otherwise it wouldn't be a Fast series movie :P.I wanted to give it a higher rating but I can't get over the villain... so.. if you can look past Mamoas' bad acting and sucky character in this (maybe I'm too sensitive :P :))).) it's a good movie to see, cause by the 10th in the series, you pretty much know what you're gonna get.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

I don't know if the writer is unable to create a new character, or is he forced by the producer to bring this character back. The stories of this series of films do not fit into reality or even fantasy. I don't think it's even suitable for car enthusiasts.The same story is repeated in every part.As for the main actor, Vin Diesel, unfortunately, he is no longer good at acting.

However, despite its potential, the film ultimately fell short of expectations, leaving me disappointed with its overall execution.One of the main issues with Fast X was its lackluster and convoluted plot. The story seemed to have been sacrificed in favor of extravagant action sequences and over-the-top stunts. While the Fast and Furious series has never been known for its complex narratives, Fast X took this to a new extreme. The plot felt disjointed and predictable, with little room for character development or meaningful emotional arcs.Another letdown was the characterization. Fast X introduced a few new faces to the franchise, but they failed to leave a lasting impression. The characters lacked depth and were overshadowed by the grandiose action set pieces. Even the returning cast members seemed to be going through the motions, delivering their lines without much conviction or enthusiasm.Moreover, the pacing of Fast X felt uneven and rushed. The film jumped from one action scene to another without allowing for proper build-up or tension. This resulted in a lack of suspense and made it difficult to become fully invested in the events unfolding on screen. It felt as though the film was trying to cram in as much action as possible without considering the overall flow and coherence of the story.The storylines feel disjointed and poorly executed, lacking the cohesiveness and thrill that made the earlier movies so enjoyable. Rather than presenting a cohesive narrative, Fast X seems to jump between unrelated events, resulting in a fragmented and confusing viewing experience.One of the most disappointing aspects of Fast X is the overwhelming abundance of clichéd and cringeworthy moments. The dialogue feels contrived and forced, and the attempts at humor often fall flat. These cringe-inducing scenes overshadow the few genuinely entertaining action sequences, making the overall viewing experience tedious and frustrating.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's RIDICULOUS in every way and is what makes this movie and the franchise so fun. Jason Momoa was great in his role and was a nice antagonist to the ever-so-seriously Vin Diesel. I go into each movie expecting it to be more unbelievable and over the top than the previous one and have yet to be let down. If you enjoy completely unbelievable and over the top action and storylines, drama, comedy, and just want to be entertained for the sake of entertainment, this movie is for you. If you're going to seriously analyze the ridiculousness of everything based on believability and acting chops, skip it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

At first, it was just street racing with a ""Point Break"" style twist. Then they became more and more like crime thrillers with racing mixed in. Then, it devolved into completely unrealistic crap. The stunts went from exciting to laughable, and this one really took the cake.Jason Momoa, normally a decent actor, is supposed to be the worst villain of them all, but he is laughable as well - playing a flamboyant son of previous Rio crime boss Hernan Reyes. He is not scary - he's just annoying.I'm very disappointed in this series. After Paul Walker's death, it's like they gave up on making these movies likeable.

This time we kick off the adventures with the Dominik Toretto family gathering in the beginning and from then on Fast X jumps to various places around the globe, from Rome to Rio de Janeiro, from L. A. to London and so on.A new villain is threatening Dominik's family and everyone who ever worked with them- Dante, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes from The Fast and the Furious 5. Dante is portrayed by a forceful and convincing Jason Momoa - even his appearance reminds me sometimes so much of Aquaman that I was just waiting for him to draw his trident. Dante's single aim hurts Dominik (Vin Diesel) at his core - preying on his family and eventually his son. While Dominik and his team is scattered and tries to fight off the enemy, it seems that Dante is just always one or two steps ahead. The ending is open and leaves us all awaiting the next chapter of the Fast and the Furious. The great thing about this franchise is that allows for newcomers to show up and put their own stamp on this decades-spanning storyline and maybe even springboard someone's Hollywood comeback (your ship has come in, Brie Larson).Action loaded, bending the laws of physics with cars dropping out of airplanes, fighting off helicopters and other amazing stunts where probably all airbags would have long deployed or tires falling off. Highly recommended for everyone who loves the twists and turns of this high-pace action packed franchise, with hopes that the good will win over evil in the end and excitements over cars.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not John Cena, or The Rock, The Transporter or even Aquaman himself can do anything to mask the mediocre writing and lack of chemistry among the actors (save the few that have been around from the start, who themselves have started to look stale at this point), and the fact that aside from the aforementioned new faces, every movie since the 5th installment has more or less been the same rinse and repeat wow factor BS that is starting to look ever more comedic as time passes.

What else it has in common with all the new Hollywood movies? It has a huge lack of a plot! Fast X is no longer fast, they should change the title to Dom Wick or Mad Pax.What happened to fast cars, races and suspend? Now we have a ""villain"" that with one click can control 20 hostile soldiers while in real Fast and Furious we had one Brian vs whole illegal Street Racing scene.I decided to give the movie a try. I had fallen asleep after first 10 minutes. First fight scene between Cypher and that new villain made me bored to death. Another ""new age"" Hollywood movie.

The script by Dan Mazeau and ""Fast Five"" director Justin Lin is like a snake eating its own tail, often playing like a parody of the franchise more than a new entry that cruises on its own four wheels. Even as it's spinning through enjoyably goofy action set pieces, most of them enlivened greatly by a fun performance from Jason Momoa, the film is a parody of the franchise. Dante Reyes is the son of Hernan Reyes, who was killed when Dom and company rolled a safe through Rio in ""Fast Five"". Dante wants Dom to suffer, so he plans to frame the gang as terrorists after a bomb explodes in Rome. This is just a way to divide the crew, as Vin and The Rock broke up after the construction of the films. Toretto is a gothic zero-sum notion of blood's bond explained with soap opera dialogue. He must protect family no matter the cost, but is OK with leaving his 8-year-old son in someone else's care. New director Louis Leterrier takes us from Los Angeles to Antarctica, threatening Rome with a 20 kiloton bomb and ending the movie at the side of a dam in Portugal in a cliffhanger. Stick around for the credits and even more mega-stars are promised for the next installment. Justin Lin is the director of the latest Fast & Furious movie, and he re-teams with cast and crew to deliver bold plot twists, grit-teethed gravitas, and out-of-this-world action. F9 is a wild ride packed with thrills, laughs, and a heartwarming message about family. It also includes justice for Han, and those who have never seen the franchise may be disappointed by its unapologetic excesses. Jason Statham, John Cena, Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster are all in ""Fast X"", which is intended to be the first half of a two-part franchise finale. However, plans are now to stretch it into a trilogy, and ""Fast X"" ends with a cliffhanger instead of a victory lap, proving that too much of a good thing can lead to too much of a good thing... Diesel is a stuntman who takes his stunts to a surreal limit, such as driving down a dam or knocking a bomb off course. This is better than hearing him make speeches about family and honor, as it is better than hearing him make speeches.","8 out of 32 found this helpful.

From the heartwarming family reunions to the mind-bending physics-defying stunts, this movie is a true testament to the laws of gravity being optional.Vin Diesel, thespian extraordinaire, delivers a performance that will surely be remembered for generations to come. His emotional range is so vast that you can practically feel the intensity of his facial expressions through the screen. It's like watching a master class in emoting while driving a car at 200 mph. Who knew family values could be so closely intertwined with drag racing and explosions?The plot is a rollercoaster of surprises, twists, and turns that will leave you questioning the very fabric of reality. The intricacy of the storyline is matched only by the subtlety of the dialogue, which is so profound that you might miss it if you blink. The film is a symphony of profound insights and thought-provoking conversations-truly an intellectual feast.Let's not forget the breathtaking cinematography that captures the essence of speed like never before. The camera work is so seamless that it's almost as if the cameraman strapped themselves to the hood of a speeding car just to get that perfect shot. A sacrifice for art, if you will.In conclusion, Fast X is a cinematic marvel that defies conventional storytelling, effortlessly blending family drama with vehicular acrobatics. Vin Diesel and his co-stars have once again raised the bar for what cinema can achieve. I left the theater with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of life, family, and the laws of physics. Truly, a film that will be remembered for generations as a groundbreaking masterpiece in the world of cinema. Or not.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The 5 stars I am giving here go for the effects and probably some of the action too, but no more. Did the Fast X budget run out when it came to the gore effects or something?I kind of zoned out when there wasn't some kind of car chase, but the film wasn't so bad. Also, I never figured out why there was a car and a couple of deep-sea divers floating around in space. Maybe I have to watch Fast 9 (or Furious 9, never figured that one out) to understand that part.On the whole, not such a bad film, put pretty low on the list.

As a viewer who has followed this series for a long time, I am thoroughly disappointed and tired of the repetitive formula that has plagued the franchise. One of the biggest issues with Fast X is the excessive and forced emphasis on the theme of family. The word ""family"" is thrown around so often that it becomes grating and loses its meaning. It feels like a desperate attempt to connect with the emotional core of the earlier films, but instead, it becomes a tiresome cliché that is overused to the point of irritation. This constant repetition makes it difficult to engage with the characters and their supposed emotional journeys.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Fast and Furious has officially hit rock bottom, proving that even a once-beloved franchise can sink into the depths of mindless, nonsensical drivel. From the moment the opening credits rolled until the agonizingly predictable ending, I found myself questioning why I wasted my time and money on this abomination.First and foremost, the plot, if it can even be called that, is an insult to the intelligence of any audience member. It's a convoluted mess of overused clichés and ridiculous stunts that defy all laws of physics. Apparently, the laws of logic and common sense were also thrown out the window, as characters miraculously survive impossible situations without a scratch. It's as if the filmmakers expect us to suspend our disbelief indefinitely, which is an insult to anyone with an ounce of critical thinking.The characters themselves are shallow and one-dimensional, lacking any depth or development. It's a sad state of affairs when the cars have more personality than the actors behind the wheel. The performances are uninspired, with the cast sleepwalking through their lines, clearly just collecting their paycheck. Vin Diesel's stoic and monotonous portrayal of Dominic Toretto has become nothing more than a running joke at this point.Let's not forget the excessive focus on mindless action sequences that are meant to dazzle but end up being mind-numbingly boring. The constant barrage of car chases, explosions, and reckless stunts quickly lose their appeal when there's no substance to back them up. It's a desperate attempt to distract from the lackluster writing and lazy storytelling, and it only serves to highlight the film's glaring shortcomings.Even the once-impressive special effects and visual effects fall flat in this installment. The CGI is painfully obvious, and the green screen usage is jarringly amateurish. It's a stark reminder of how far the franchise has fallen from its roots of practical stunts and thrilling car races.Fast and Furious is a prime example of a franchise that has lost its way. What was once a series known for its street racing culture and compelling characters has devolved into a mindless spectacle of explosions and over-the-top action. It's an insult to fans who have followed the franchise for years, and a waste of time for anyone seeking a coherent and engaging film experience.Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this abysmal excuse for a movie. The Fast and Furious franchise should have taken a permanent pit stop long ago, and this installment only confirms that it's time to let it fade into the rearview mirror.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Dom's all genius family always escape from bullets and blasts overcome every hard situation simply.Whenever they think they can get cars ,gadgets, bombs, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters, submarines, anything in the world they can buy as much power as possible.I hope after the next movie they stop making this kind of idiot sequences to deliver to the audience.Audiences are watching and without giving proper feedback to the movies they make like this way whatever they like
Only feedback and bad comments will improve their making

Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, whose characters are imbued with vitality and emotion, stand out among the captivating ensemble cast and deliver electrifying performances. The entire movie will keep you on the edge of your seat with its incredible special effects and nail-biting exploits. The plot is predictable at times, but the movie makes up for it with its speeding cars, dramatic set pieces, and thrilling pursuit sequences. Fast X is a wild and action-packed spectacle that will not allow you to sit still for a second.

Now, I must say, this film is truly a work of art... if your definition of art involves cringing, eye-rolling, and an intense desire to hit the fast-forward button.First things first, let's talk about the plot. Oh wait, there isn't one! It's like the writers played a game of Mad Libs and just filled in random car-related words to create a story. Who needs a cohesive narrative when you can have endless scenes of cars zooming aimlessly, right? I'm still trying to figure out if there was a script or if they just handed out car keys and told the actors to improvise.Now, let's discuss the characters. These masterpieces of depth and complexity are truly unforgettable. Well, maybe not in a good way. They possess the emotional range of a rock and the depth of a kiddie pool. You'll find yourself rooting for the cars more than the cardboard cutout characters attempting to deliver lines with all the charisma of a damp towel.And let's not forget the dialogue, which can only be described as a breathtaking symphony of clichés and one-liners that make you question the existence of intelligent life on Earth. It's like the writers collected every cheesy catchphrase from the last decade and crammed them into the script. If you're in dire need of cringe-inducing quotes to use as punchlines at parties, this film has got you covered.But the real star of the show, of course, is the mind-numbingly excessive action. It's like they took the laws of physics, threw them out the window, and laughed maniacally as cars flew through the air like superhero acrobats. The stunts are so outlandish and ridiculous that you'll find yourself questioning the very fabric of reality. I mean, who needs logic when you can have cars defying gravity and defying all reason?","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Russell, Theron, Mirren. I guess dignity doesn't matter. These movies are for children and childish adults. The action scenes are so laughable that I literally can't stop laughing when I see them. The climax had me bending over from non stop laughter at the Road Runner nonsense. I mean who cheers for this slapstick buffoonery. With the exception of Riddick, Diesel has always been unlikabke and most of the rest of the regular cast are a tough watch. I thought Mamoa might be fun to watch but he's just another dumb acting clown. Littered with incredibly awful rap noise. Seeing Rome destroyed by these Road Runner cartoon buffoons was painful to watch. This series had its peak with V ( not that I through IV weren't as bad as anything ever put on screen ). They've steadily gotten worse since V and have now reached heights of unbelievable dreck. And no I haven't watched a full movie in this series since 8; also not finishing 6. I can't even imagine what low brow person enthusiastically watch these but I wouldn't want to meet them. The actors in these movies should be mortified. And to think there's supposedly two more of these in the absolute worst movie series in the history of cinema.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

How am I supposed to take him seriously when he looks like a walking joke. His character was so over the top and for the wrong reasons It spoiled it for me. I hope they do better with the next installment. Thank goodness I didn't pay to see this. Since they like to correct their movies they need to correct this one before they move on to the next one. At the very least they need to recast Jason Momoa as a bad guy or fire the writer that wrote his lines.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's not there anymore.The Downfall was with Fast 9. I remember my cinematic experiences of Fast 4,5,6,7 & 8 and the Magic was there. The Action although absurd somehow connected the audience to it's interactivity, and those Films certainly had WTF moments, but they also had, well you know..... If Roman Just kept well tucked behind that bullet proof severred car door (Fast 8 🤔😏😌) and if Dom just got the right angle (Fast 6 Motorway Scene 🤔🙄😒) and the glass was sort of broken a little bit already (Fast 7 😂) and with the right speed, he could actually pull that off! Moments. Then Fast 9 happened.F&F Presents - Hobbs and Shaw was different, the tone was Completely Different to Fast 4,5,6,7 & 8 and although it was Right on that Borderline, and although it was a Comedy, the Tone Still wasn't a Parody. Then we Have Fast 9 & 10 Which are Basically Parodies of the Franchise, and the makers don't even know it. They actually take this these 2 films super seriously 😑😳😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂That said, me and my Friends were almost Constantly Laughing at how Ridiculous this Film is. From the action to the sometimes funny bits with Tej and Roman. To Vin Diesel sort of being a damn parody of his former self 😂🤣😂. It was all Absolutely Hilarious whether it was in a good way and trying and succeeding in Being funny or in a bad way in unintentionally being hilarious 😆😂.Anyway, Jason Mamoa is the best Part of this Film.In reality, the film is like a 3 outta 10 but because of how much fun we had, it was absolutely hilarious.Overall, What an Experience 😆😂🤣","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

No really. I don't know was worse, the ludicrous stunts, the terrible over-the-top antics of Drogo, the overall revenge plot, or the fact that the film franchise insists on keeping Bryan alive despite Paul Walker's passing, while putting so much focus on family that he's just the crappiest person in the world because he has nothing to do with his family. I mean, he's babysitting... really? ? Kids that are older than Dom's and are so far removed from this that if they stood in front of the bad guy, he wouldn't know who they were. But somehow, given the massive pull that would be for the bad guy to round up Bryan & Mia & their kids, he never will... because the franchise won't let the man pass on.But to this story... why even bother? I mean, folk have been saying to let it die for several films now. So, instead of listening, you plan a trilogy of an ending based on the slapstick antics of a bad guy getting revenge. A bad guy that had to be retconned into the film. Then you pull every ounce, scrap, meager relation that you can find for Dom (but the biggest, of course) from out of every nook & cranny then threaten & threaten & threaten.... & never deliver. The only FAMILY member that dies is the one that sacks theirself to save others...
Meanwhile you've set up the next gen sequels with more kids of kids or sisters or cousin's uncle once removed on the.... who the hell knows? And how many times (58 someone said) can you beat a person to death with the idea. I mean, hell...

It has the same enjoyable cast, the same comedy that you would come to expect, the action is always one upping itself, and it's something this franchise is only known for. If you expect a story that will compel you to keep your eyes glued to the screen then you are expecting the wrong thing. If you are expecting something your family can enjoy as a family, you have the correct expectations. It has something for everyone.

So glad I didn't furnish this with another ticket sale at the box office. I'd seen most of the others from the franchise at the cinema but after they sent dumb and dumber up into space the last time out, then even worse...brought them back! I thought, I'm done with lining a certain Mr. Diesel's pockets.You just cling onto the tiny bit of hope that maybe someone from the studio actually watched the movie, then in a moment of clarity shouted ""Children stop!! Put your crayons down... We're not making another one!"" Then gathered up all of the unfinished 2D drawings of cars with machine guns attached to them, stickmen running around with rocket launchers, ironing board-shaped aeroplanes flying around in the sky whilst on fire and big bombs with the word ""bomb"" written on them (minus the second 'b' obviously) and sack the entire creative team.Everyone enjoys switching off their brain for a couple of hours during a 'popcorn' movie but Vin's ""acting"" is like his umbilical cord ""switched off"" his oxygen supply for a couple of minutes during his birth! Although to be fair, he has learnt a new facial expression for this movie (he's got about 4 now) and manages to shoe-horn it into every scene he's in. Whether the scene calls for it or not, we're being treated to Vinny's new face.I seriously believe that the X in the title...isn't referring to the tenth movie...no, it's his signature! The guy is a buffoon. He has all the emotional range of a sloth. Sloth! That's it.... He's like Sloth from The Goonies, just blundering his way through the saga. Instead of yelling ""Hey you guys!"" Just yelling ""Faaamily"". I wish someone would chain Dom Toretto to a wall in a cellar somewhere and just sit and throw Baby Ruth bars at his head. That could be the plot to Fast 14 Vs Marvel or whatever the next one is going to be. Then just when you think there's no chance for Dom... Hulk Hogan crashes through the wall on a nuclear-powered hover-submarine and before you know where you are Mama Toretto has to set another place at the dinner table.Oh yeah, back to reviewing the movie... It's crap, but what did you expect?Will I watch the next ones? Of course.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Difficult to say whether director has succeeded because we have a feeling of ""deja vu"" most of the time. The plot is about the revenge of the son of the druglord whom Vin Diesel had harmed in the past. So we have the same fast cars revving up, racing and screeching about in the city streets at night.Director Louis Leterrier presents the usual scenes including car races, intimidation/ challenges, guys with guns, explosions, shattering glass, shady joints, sharp one liners, rock background music, surprising plot twists etc and all this in international locations like London, Rio, Portugal and Antarctica too. Vin Diesel once again drives off an aeroplane in the air through cargo door at the back, manages to land on an adversary's car shaken up but fine and continues with the action. He has done it in the earlier movies. There is a catfight with hand to hand combat between Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron in Antarctica . To balance all these stunts of the mayhem taking place there are scenes talking of family values and faith. The cinematography is breathtaking as usual with some astonishing shots. Can't have a "" fast"" movie without a car race to give you an edge of the seat experience and so there is one. The cast includes the usual Vin's gang who do almost the same things they have done earlier. A word of praise for actor Jason Momoa who has done the antagonist's role exceedingly well. Watch out for post credit title teaser featuring a top character of "" Fast"" movies.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Picture this: I'm settling into my hotel room, ready to kick back and relax with a movie, when suddenly, Fast X pops up on the screen. I figured, hey, why not give it a shot? Little did I know, I was in for a rollercoaster of disappointment.From the get-go, I had a sinking feeling in my gut. The opening credits rolled, and I couldn't shake the sense that I was about to witness something... less than stellar. Fast X promised high-octane action and heart-pounding thrills, but what I got was a messy mishmash of clichés and cardboard characters.As the plot unfolded-or should I say unraveled?-I found myself questioning every decision that led me to this moment. Who thought this was a good idea? Did they even read the script before greenlighting this disaster? And those mysterious 10/10 ratings? I couldn't help but wonder if they were the work of bots programmed to boost the movie's score.But let's talk about the characters-or lack thereof. It's as if they were plucked from a bargain bin of action movie clichés and given about as much depth as a puddle. The hero with a troubled past, the wise-cracking sidekick, the villain with a penchant for world domination-they were all there, but none of them felt remotely interesting or engaging.Despite its flaws, Fast X did have one saving grace: it provided ample material for my scathing review. As I typed away, channeling my inner film critic, I couldn't help but marvel at the absurdity of it all. Who knew that a terrible movie could be so entertaining in its own twisted way?In the end, Fast X may not have been the cinematic masterpiece I was hoping for, but it did leave me with a story to tell-one that I'll be recounting for years to come, much to the amusement of anyone who hears it. And who knows? Maybe one day, it'll achieve cult status as the best worst movie ever made.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's no quality to movies anymore. It's just generic lame stuff. Even Jason momoas character has no development he's just there as a typical villain who just seems to threaten everyone by holding their families hostage. Wow. Real unique.Characters have no story, film has no story, it's just boring action scenes. Save your time and money.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A fun movie but ruined by cliffhanger ending.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9113292/?ref_=tt_urv","Mysterygeneration","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104853183/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2023","The crazily wild motorized antics of Fast X blast forward without a thought of pressing the brakes. Not many movie franchises last longer than twenty years.This high-octane spectacle seeks, and occasionally succeeds, in obliterating any opposition with its seemingly endless supply of madly comic action and its disarming, absurd, and self-aware doses of usually hilarious camp. It's an occasionally jaw-dropping journey that travels the world in its never-ending hunt for new settings and techniques to up the cinematic ante; in the process, it manages to fall apart and triumph over its core absurdity.Although the fundamentals haven't changed, the scope of everything is unmatched for what started out as a tiny hot rod racing drama 22 years ago. This fast movie features a number of returning cast members as well as some fresh faces. The most noteworthy of the latter is the powerful Jason Momoa, whose irrational attitude as the wicked Dante Reyes makes this by far the funniest installment in the series thus far. This entry gains a much-appreciated new dimension because of the plethora of loud laughter.Most people in the fast-paced world appear to be prospering at first. The few early domestic moments have a family down-homeness to them that helps the audience feel more connected to the people. In this film, it seems that practically everyone who has been in a Fast film and is still alive does so, even if only briefly in certain situations. However, the early jollity is quickly replaced by a natural disaster, a genuine carnival of destruction that Dante launches and destroys everything in its path. It should be observed right away that the effects are mind-blowing; undoubtedly, no one has ever witnessed such immense earthly catastrophe imagined in such realistically portrayed pictures.Ancient sites, contemporary marvels, and global capitals are all destroyed like they were just Cub Scout tents. To use a word that is overused, the attacks are truly magnificent. At least initially, nobody knows how to respond to such aggressiveness, so Dante can get away with it. The culprit believes that nirvana has finally been attained; he positively rejoices in his triumphs and grows more and more destructive, as well as entertaining to watch, as he destroys any old or modern landmarks that happen to catch his eye.The effects are truly - to use an overused term - astonishing from a technical standpoint. The images alone could leave one in awe, but add a rich vein of impudent humor as the destiny of the world's wonders is so blatantly played with, and you have something.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie feels like an eternal (because yes, it's very long) collage of many action scenes with no coherence between them. The action is entertaining until it becomes too far-fetched. The plot is a mere decoration and excuse to show the millions of dollars in CGI, cars, explosions and cameos that contribute to the emptiest vanity of cinema. The acting is terrible, with the exception of the main villain, who, don't get me wrong, is far from anything remarkable, but at least he is a cut above the rest. By the way, that character development is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.Now, as incredible as it may seem, I must highlight something. The direction is quite interesting. It enhances in a good way each adrenaline sequence that the film calls for at every moment. The soundtrack is also quite decent and well, I think I have already praised the visual effects quite a bit.Recommended to leave the background and peek out only in the noisiest scenes, as it's surely due to some visual spectacle full of cars and explosions.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Just picture Momoa doing his version of the Joker... yes, I'm serious!Fast X is how you save a franchise and those post credit scenes are how you start an epic trilogy to close out... absolutely cannot wait for the next two installments!P.

Holding onto hope that Brian O'Connor is reintroduced via AI to close out the franchise... it feels like the time is right and the technology is available 🙏🏻9.3/10.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Dom, who again reasserts that his no 1 priority is protecting his family (despite constantly placing them in danger?) goes on the run after being framed by Dante for a terrorist bomb explosion in Rome but looks to seek out Dante.I still enjoy the ludicrous car stuff - boy the suspension on those cars - and this episode is of course full of amazing stunts and effects. The story such that it is featuring endless cameos in seemingly pointless little sub plots is lousier than usual and seems designed solely just give everyone on salary something to do rather than contribute anything to the very basic plot. The whole thing builds to a completely ridiculous climax which is actually a bit meh lining everyone up for Fast X Part 2. Diesel's face and emotions stay, as always, unchanged for the run time in sharp contrast to a wildly over the top pantomime performance by Momoa. Utter nonsense but fun for the crash bang wallop - nothing more.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie is forgettable and boring.Please spare your loyal fans the exposure there is no contribution nor a single compelling message to pass on to society. The forceful and awkward quasi acting of a fat Jason Momoa is torture to endure.I hope it's the end of this IQ reducing franchise, please put it to sleep.

These stories continue to move away from the foundation of practical racing paired with building relationships, and move more and more toward explosive action comedies ultimately watering down the development of the characters we used to care about. Each scene transitions quickly making the production feel rushed and scattered out of place. Jason Momoa is eclectic in this over-the-top role as the main villain, however he adds a refreshing flavor to an established group of recurring characters. The film relies on its previous success stories and less on future possibilities, keeping the ambition of storytelling contained and absent from this project. It's Fast and Furious and you get exactly what you expect.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

The plot, a madcap scramble of outrageous stunts and over-the-top drama, is exhaustingly ludicrous. As a seasoned fan who even forgave the franchise for launching cars into space with duct tape in the last movie, I found myself straining to keep my disbelief suspended this time around.The underwhelming CGI work and the rushed execution of the stunts further dull the sheen of the movie. These aspects, traditionally the series' strong points, ironically end up being its Achilles heel. The vehicular acrobatics and death-defying stunts, which should provide heart-pounding thrills, come off as half-baked and hastily stitched together, relentlessly pulling the audience out of the movie's flow.The performances range from perfunctory to wooden, with even stalwarts of the franchise seeming to succumb to the weak screenplay. The dialogues, contrived and at times cringeworthy, often feel like clumsy tools to set up the next unbelievable action sequence.However, amidst this chaotic wreckage, there emerges a bright spot - Jason Momoa. His turn as the villain is arguably the movie's sole redeeming aspect. Momoa's portrayal is a masterclass in controlled ferocity and charisma, cementing his place among the franchise's finest villains. This, probably the best performance of his career, almost salvages the movie from the abyss of its own making.In essence, 'Fast X' feels like an unchecked rollercoaster that has thrown caution to the wind, derailing what we've come to love about the franchise. Despite Momoa's commendable performance, the film fails to deliver the expected charm and thrilling fun of its predecessors. It's a letdown for fans, as it pushes the envelope too far, resulting in an entry that is more ridiculous than it is thrilling.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

It started as an enjoyable low-budget action flick, almost gritty. The customisation and cruising scene. Point Break with cars. It lost its way a little with parts 2 and 3, which were decent films, but each going in different directions, then found its rhythm with part 4. Parts 5 and 6 were the sweet spot, by which point it had become more of a rival for James Bond or Mission: Impossible.Parts 7 and 8 were more ludicrous, moving into cheesy, Marvel-style, comic book fantasy, but were still entertaining. It was now a completely different animal to what it started out as. Part 9 took that further - into space! - which brings us to X.Unfortunately, this is so ridiculous as to be almost meaningless. There is no tension, consequence or engagement as people and cars can do anything. Physics and mortality do not exist in this cartoon world - characters return from the dead, enemies becomes friends. Without a framework of any kind, not even a coherent story, it's mostly pointless. That's not to say it's unwatchable - with that much money on the screen, it passes the time. But the franchise is well past it's best and I don't see any way for it to recover.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

It also extend to the fighting action where a character like Ramsey can take down a fully armored military.The story also feel mediocre, in this movie there are (i think) 5 different POV, but 3 of them is either not interesting or just useless for the story.

I typically don't take issue with fantasy movies, but having accurate information about the film's genre would have been helpful prior to viewing. Regrettably, the film fell short as it failed to meet the audience's expectations, leaving many viewers unsatisfied. One scene that particularly stood out for its lack of realism involved a car plummeting from an airplane and landing on a busy street below. This far-fetched sequence, along with other similarly implausible moments, contributed to the overall poor quality of the movie.

I'm not a big fan of the Fast and Furious movies, and really only saw this one because I was curious to see how truly ridiculous this one would be after F9 took some of its characters to space IN A CAR. Needless to say, I don't think very highly of these movies to begin with.On the positive side... it's a little better than the last few movies, and a little less crazy and ridiculous. However on a more negative note... it's an absolutely horrendous garbage movie; it's a complete mess of a film. But... I don't regret watching it because I had a completely good time while the movie was on screen. I was dying of laughter for most of the film alongside my friends - the movie was hilarious...ly bad. Alas, we were all laughing AT the movie, not with it. It would have been fine if this movie was intended as a comedy... but the fact it asks us to take it seriously when it's essentially an unintentional self-parody of the franchise makes it quite problematic. It's a fast-food movie, and quite forgettable, but I can't say I wasn't entertained while watching it.But you can be entertained while recognizing the movie you are watching is absolutely a piece of crap at the same time. The only reason I gave it this high a rating is because of how good a time it let me have with my friends. I can guarantee if I was to have watched this alone... I would rate it much lower.I know I am part of the problem here, but I really hate that audiences today are so accepting of movies that really don't try. This movie is so ridiculous and stupid that it is entertaining, but it has absolutely no story, no characters, and nothing to care about to back up the mindless action we see on screen. Why do we assume you can only have one or the other? Why do we just accept being given one or the other? We can have a good movie with strong writing while also having great, bombastic action! For example, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, or even Captain America: Civil War gave us riveting narratives, wonderful twists and turns that made sense, multi-dimensional, layered characters with beautiful inter-character conflicts and they did all of that while also giving us big bombastic set-pieces, great action, and great fights. So I don't know why when it comes to this franchise we as film audiences just accept being handed half-assed mediocrity. I expect better. Heck, in the last year we've seen better: John Wick 4, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Top Gun: Maverick, or even Avatar: The Way of Water. I would love to enjoy Fast X as the filmmakers intended me to, but I can't when all they offer is mindless, ridiculous action with no semblance of depth, story, or character. They gave me absolutely no reason to care. If they want me to enjoy it as a comedy, fine - then I'd say this was an effective movie. But the fact that they ask us as the audience to take it all seriously... it makes me truly want to laugh at the movie. Because they didn't do the work to earn my emotion, my attention in that regard. Sure, there were redeeming qualities and I had a good time laughing at it with my friends, but that doesn't let them off the hook for making a terrible movie.I mean, when half your movie is shot without a director, and when you eventually hire one, you only give him 3 days to prepare before shooting... I don't know what else you expect to get besides a mess. This film was probably doomed from the start, and even if Louis Leterrier did try his best to save the film, there is absolutely no way he could have saved it with the circumstances he was put in. Considering those circumstances... maybe this is a decent film. But it shows why movies need a director at the helm - it is very clear that many sequences here were shot without clear direction and vision. They are all over the place, with many different tones and visual languages. It really feels like an instance where there were too many cooks in the kitchen, and that is likely because Leterrier was brought on too late. The film is just all over the place and I can't say it ever felt cohesive. Plus, as part 1 of a larger story, it falls into all the traps that a part 1 could: it's all set up, no resolution, it has really dumb twists leading to an unbelievable cliffhanger that I couldn't take seriously, and most of the plotlines in the movie just felt like filler. It also really tried to copy the Infinity War template, splitting up the crew into groups on different ""missions"" (I say it in quotations because really only Dom had a plot where he had to do things, the rest of the characters were just running). The story as a whole is nonsensical and is riddled with plot holes and misleading moments that don't make sense when the twists are revealed. It also has some pretty horrible dialogue... like Star Wars prequel levels of awkwardness. Even the humour didn't land. At least the action was exciting again, even if it was still quite silly and ridiculous. (The crane scene in Rome had me howling... you'll know it when you see it).BUT... Jason Momoa was goddamn fantastic in this movie! He was the highlight for me, and would be one of the only reasons I'd ever rewatch this one! Momoa knows what kind of movie he's in from the start (seems to be the only cast member who knows), and he just has fun with the role! I loved how he played it, not taking it overly seriously and delivering one of the best and most memorable villains in the franchise because of this. I loved his energy and how bonkers of a performance he gave - despite giving a very silly performance, he commanded the screen with it! If only more of the cast could have fun with it like Momoa did!I'm finishing writing this review a day after I saw Fast X... and I gotta say... I can barely remember what happened. It's a very forgettable movie that left no lasting impression on me. For a movie that cost $340 million to make (where'd that money go??), you'd think it would have offered up something so incredible, so memorable. Instead... it's just 2 and a half hours of mediocrity that is really only fun if you're with a group of friends. Sure, it might be the best since Furious 7, but that's not a very high bar to beat. The movie is pretty bad.Maybe Part 2 can be better... but at this rate, I don't have high hopes.And yet, I know I'll be there with a group of friends laughing at the ridiculousness on screen, just like with this one.It's really the only way to get through these movies.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Okay so that would be considered entertainment as well, I agree, but I was least entertained. The drone enabled photography was excellent though, a new genre might be emerging there. Also it was advertised that this is the last sequel. Fast & Furious has mostly been a great show in its past where it portrayed muscle cars and muscle men, but then fell to marvel comic fantastical illusions.

With each installment, the series seems to detach itself further from any semblance of reality, resulting in a mind-boggling experience that borders on absurdity. Regrettably, the latest addition to the franchise, deserving a meager 2 out of 10 stars, follows suit in this regard.From the outset, the film throws logic out the window in favor of extravagant stunts and physics-defying maneuvers that are far beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief. The spectacle, initially amusing, quickly becomes tiresome as the story progresses. Characters survive impossible situations unscathed, and the laws of gravity and common sense are blatantly disregarded.What was once an entertaining escapade with a touch of reality has transformed into a circus of spectacle, where the boundaries of possibility are stretched to their breaking point. Fast and Furious, in its relentless pursuit of delivering jaw-dropping action, has lost touch with the core elements that made the earlier films enjoyable.While some may argue that the franchise embraces its own brand of over-the-top entertainment, there comes a point where the lack of coherence and rationality become downright ridiculous to the eye and mind. The filmmakers seem more concerned with pushing the limits of plausibility than crafting a compelling story that engages viewers on an intellectual level.In conclusion, Fast and Furious receives a disappointing 2-star rating out of 10. It is a prime example of a series that has lost its way, prioritizing mindless spectacle over a coherent narrative and believable action. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or seeking mindless action devoid of logic, it's best to steer clear of this latest installment.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Amidst creative differences and ego clashing that led to previous helmer (and screenwriter) Justin Lin resigning, Universal's insistence to make this franchise their own ""Infinity War"" (2018) is pretty clear.Come to think about it, never before has a film series evolved (or devolved depending on where you stand) the way ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001-2023) has. Starting humbly as a street racing and VCR stealing ""Point Break"" (1991) rip off to a blockbuster series filled with drug lords, thief gangs, assassins, dodgy government agencies, warlords, tech billionaires, robbers, globe trotting hackers, Russian armies, and ex-mercenaries is as bonkers as you think it is.Erasing any valid dramatic stakes, every ""family"" member is a superhero, the bodycount and civilian casualties higher than John Woo's ""Hard Boiled"" (1992), nobody is truly dead and each antagonist exists for the sole purpose to join Toretto's ""family"". ""Fast X"" might have a better pace than its predecessor and Leterrier's direction is chaotic enough to at least make this ADHD picture show mildly enjoyable but to describe its paper thin plot will be a testament in vanity. Stretched over two hours and a half, the movie features an amazing amount of filler, gorgeous moments of stupidity (e.g., everyone communicates through the same walkie-talkie including the villain(!), Theron and Rodriguez gas scientists in one moment but there are no bodies afterwards, a car spins around with two helicopters attached to it, shifting gears while on free fall is faster than the gravitational pull of the Earth) and non-stop praise to Diesel's Toretto as the epitome of modern day Jesus, the way Steven Seagal wants it.Do not expect to find the wow factor of the ""Fast Five"" (2011) vault chase or the police car flipping moments of ""Fast & Furious 6"" (2013). Leterrier tries his best to keep things together but he lacks the visual panache of James Wan in the franchise peak ""Furious 7"" (2015). Despite a somewhat entertaining Rome bomb chasing set piece and several mano a mano fights under an endless supply of goons and cars (courtesy of our villain), the rest of the action is infected with blurry and obvious CGI shots.Any charisma that Diesel had is now gone, replaced by gruff delivery and road puns making it impossible to take anything seriously. The rest of the cast act as if they have been handed the roles of a lifetime, their natural comedic chemistry in the earlier installments not present anymore while franchise favs Deckard Shaw and Han are sidelined as extended cameos and nothing more. Amidst this orgy of vehicles, characters and tonal inconsistencies, Jason Momoa's sexually ambiguous and blowing raspberries villain Dante (with an always good view for the on-screen mayhem) is perhaps the most entertaining aspect in ""Fast X"". Yet, as the plot unfolds to reveal a nonsensical ultimate plan, his performance deteriorates feeling direction-less and in the wrong film.The American saying of ""if it is ain't broken, do not fix"" is true and in the case of ""The Fast and the Furious"", Diesel keeps the pedal to the metal where bigger is merely a point of contemplation. Surrounding the audience in a cacophony of vehicular chaos, pseudo life philosophies, flat performances and a villain scheme trapped inside its own impossibility, ""Fast X"" does not have enough gas to finish the race. The retconning of the meaningful and heartful moments in the previous entries through a labyrinth of inter-connected and convoluted plot lines that aim to create a Shakespearean drama based on wheels (really) provides a basis for a cop out. It is time to smile and wave boys, smile and wave goodbye.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I would never watch again and only watched to the end so that I could honestly say that I had seen it, wish I didn't waste my time though, I could have used the time to be more creative.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I didn't go watch this at the cinema cause i knew it would be nonsensical. Its not a horrible movie just mediocre at best. I know this franchise makes money, but let it die with some dignity and pride. I miss the old fast and furious movie when it was about racing not this crap.I just cant take this franchise seriously anymore, its become silly. I had higher hopes for the main antagonist of the movie, they made him look like a quivering coward. So big in size but cant take a punch and acts like a little girl. You really cant blame The Rock with not wanting anything to do with franchise. If you want to know a movie is bad just look at the actors. With the exception of Theron and statham who get regular roles in other movies, vin wrapped up guardians....the rest of the cast are B level actors who are riding high on the legacy of the Fast and furious franchise.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

their all getting old or just bad makeup maybe this is what caused the bad performance
Why did they all look Blotted the snack trunk must have done well
Whats the go with Doms Child where was Mias children being Family and all?All the acting seemed to Be B Grade Low Standard
New comer Brie Liasin shouldn't have been in this with that poor performance what a joke, Charlize Theron you could even recognize her whats she done to herself.Jason Momoa character was stupid, ridiculous and cheesy.Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris performance was unrealistic and childishThe Good thing is John Cena is gone but they'll probably bring him back like Gal Gadot in the second part.Over all this was messy badly written unwatchable!!!!I believe Hollywood are hiring inferior writers to save money make more profit and it's not working Movies today are lame.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Especially compared to the other movies in the franchise. Im usually pretty biased towards these movies and have typically enjoyed all of them but the last 2. This was by far the worst of the last 2 though and its not even close.Fast X felt like a really long CW special instead of a movie from the franchise. The acting, production, soundtrack, and pacing of the movie all felt extremely off for some reason.The action scenes in the movie were hit or miss. A couple of the fight scenes were executed greatly; while the car chase scenes were so obviously fake that it was pretty cringy to watch. Honestly looking at a good bit of the movie you can tell a lot of it was CGI, which can work at times, but this was extremely poorly done. Everything just felt kind of cheap.Like I said im usually pretty biased when it comes to this franchise. I know it gets heat because its mass produced and has kind of become a parody of itself so to speak, but I still enjoy them. Not this one.There were a couple funny scenes thanks to the chemistry between Tyrese and Ludacris. Random characters are introduced into the story for no reason. Wasn't a fan of Jason Momoas character. It was like he was trying too hard to be the bad guy and it came off cheesy at times. Charlize Theron was by far the most interesting thing in the movie, as she pretty much stole every scene she was in. Jason Stathom and John Cena werent bad at all either.If this is how these movies are going to be from here on out then ill gladly pass.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Directed by Justin Lin, the movie is an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.The plot follows Dominic Toretto and his crew as they race across the globe to stop a dangerous new enemy who threatens to destroy everything they hold dear. The action sequences are some of the most spectacular in the entire franchise, with high-speed car chases, intense hand-to-hand combat, and heart-stopping stunts that will leave you breathless.What sets Fast X apart from its predecessors is the way in which it manages to balance action with character development. The film takes the time to explore the emotions and motivations of its many characters, and this adds a layer of depth and complexity to the story that is often missing from other action films.The performances are also top-notch, with Vin Diesel leading the charge as the charismatic and tough-as-nails Dominic Toretto. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris, and Tyrese Gibson.Overall, Fast X is a must-see for fans of the franchise and action movies in general. It is a high-octane thrill ride that never lets up, and it manages to improve upon the already impressive Fast 9. With its stunning visuals, incredible action, and well-developed characters, Fast X is a true masterpiece of the genre.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

From the outset, the storyline seemed convoluted, with characters that lacked depth and motivations that were hard to empathize with. The action sequences, though abundant, often felt over-the-top and devoid of any real tension or consequence.One of the major letdowns was the dialogue, which felt forced and uninspiring, making it difficult to connect with the characters on any meaningful level.Fast X Move seemed to rely too heavily on its formulaic plot twists and flashy effects, forgetting the importance of a coherent and engaging narrative. The end result was a lackluster film that failed to leave a lasting impression.

This cinematic disaster careens into new realms of absurdity, as if trying to mock the very concept of storytelling. With a plot thinner than a paper napkin, characters less developed than stick figures, and action sequences that defy the laws of physics and logic, ""Fast X"" is an insult to the intelligence of its audience. The dialogue seems to have been generated by an AI with a severe glitch, resulting in cringe-worthy one-liners that elicit more eye-rolls than laughs. It's as if the filmmakers believed that throwing in more explosions and car chases would distract from the utter lack of substance. Vin Diesel's expressionless face and gravelly voice appear to be competing in a race to see which can convey less emotion. The movie's attempts at emotional depth are about as convincing as a cardboard cutout trying to emote. By the time the end credits mercifully roll, the only question lingering is not about when the franchise will end, but why it hasn't already.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Logic takes a backseat in the story, no questions asked. Family emerges as the central theme throughout the film. Let's delve into Dante Reyes, the son of Hernan Reyes, portrayed by Jason Mamoa. Personally, he comes across as a likable villain, akin to the character of Joker, inflicting pain and suffering. Dante orchestrates chaos in Rome, separating the family members, including his own son.The movie jumps between different characters, but Dante stands out as the most compelling. His clashes with Dom Toretto result in widespread mayhem. Dom's motive for this rivalry is rooted in Dante's own experience of suffering without his family, and Dom is determined to make him endure the same. The film concludes with a thrilling cliffhanger, leaving viewers eagerly anticipating Part 2.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Had the potential to be much more appealing. The pace wasn't very good, feels like was stretched to make it into 2 parts. Some of the action sequences were good, for sure, but some weren't. The legacy of defying the laws of physics and reality hasn't left this saga yet. Although to this installment's credit, it was a bit less than the previous ones.The first and fifth installments are still the best in my opinion. Looks like the makers are trying to take advantage of that fact by linking the 10th installment with the 5th. Good attempt no doubt but poor execution of the idea. I hope they make the part 2 better than 1.Overall, mediocre. A somewhat okay action movie to watch with friends on a Friday or Saturday evening.

But then I saw how laughably bad the FX were in this movie and they did dodge that bullet.WOW. With Fast in its title, it was anything but. This movie broke the one rule you don't wish to with an action movie: it was BORING.Bad script, sure - that goes without saying for this dumb monkey series. Beyond that, it's badly paced, all-over-the-place with a 170-person-cast and while I did appreciate the butch, manly-man villain stepping out of the stereotypical macho man role, I couldn't tell if he was gay or mocking gays. Also, he really sucked as a villain.The Super Spy team must split up to all corners of the globe while Dom is all about Fam again. Meanwhile, Part V's villain's heir is hellbent on revenge.This franchise should've been G. I. Joe instead as it fits the same universe as the Transformers with this scattered, unrealistic and humorless screenplay. I will give them props for having Charlize Theron, Jason Statham and Helen Mirren back again - I'll never complain about seeing them. Plus, Sung ""Han"" Kang is really hot. At least he's something worth looking at.The first 75% I was giving the movie credit for not going too overboard with the moronic stunts...and then the climax hit. Listen. I watch Mission: Impossible for the real, crazy and fun stunts. I watch the Fast & Furious films to laugh at the grade-school kids' ideas for live-action cartoon stunts. Well, I used to.About 2 movies ago these stopped being so-bad-it's-good. And #9 just made me hate life with how STUPID the stunts were. This movie tricked me into thinking there weren't any braindead stunts until the climax.Why don't these characters just simply learn how to fly? I mean they break every other law of physics.Mercifully, I already knew this was part one of two of what I believe is the final two movies. I only watched this one thinking it HAD to be better than 9 and what the hell, I'm a completionist.Quite frankly, I watched 11 of these movies now and I don't think I can take another one. I honestly don't care what happens in the climax. I've seen them all and I barely know who any of these people are. Nor do I care anymore.***Final Thoughts: I've only seen each one once and a ton blended into each other, but from memory, here's the best to worst for the F&F franchise:1. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw
2. Fast Five
3. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
4. Fast & Furious 6
5. 2 Fast 2 Furious
6. The Fast and the Furious
7. The Fate of the Furious
8. Furious 7
9. Fast X
10. F9: The Fast Saga
11. Fast & Furious.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I mean who on Earth decided that the film in its current form was good enough to realise. It's an embarrassment.The plot was so meaningless and could likely have been halved to make more sense. The lines delivered by most characters seemed to be one liners to either be cool or try to be funny, all failed. Acting was wooden, emotions were shallow and they all seemed to be there just for the paycheck. The stunts were over the top, comedic in some instances and Bollywood-esque. All Physics went out of the window. Dude who plays Roman needs to give up on comedy. Emmanuel and Han need acting classes. The cliches, the ultra convenient plot devices, the needless fights / races / stunts....it's just a random jumble of stuff that someone has poorly strung together.All I could think was that there are people struggling, starving and suffering around the world yet you spend $350 MILLION on this drivel that adds nothing to culture, is a waste of money and is just a tired vanity project.

The last four sequels have all been consistent in terms of quality: they're not great entertainment but they're fitfully engaging and they hold the viewer's attention. Not so with this tenth, criminally bad instalment of the by-now ailing franchise. The pacing is sluggish, the writing particularly poor, and half the film seems to have been made without a director. There are random cameos from returning cast members who have no place in the narrative (hello, Charlize Theron and Jason Statham) and a sprawling, international plot that's merely a backbone for a series of nonsense CGI action set-pieces. And don't get me started on Momoa's annoying villain. I'm glad there's only one more.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even a stunt must have some logic in it, you cannot just make your car fly with the nitrous and turn it left right mid air like a Helicopter. You can watch but forget all the logic in it. Story is Okayish, justifiable, watchable. Fast franchise makes their villains so OP on a movie that all the forces and gangs of cars can't reach a single man. In the very next movie when he takes side with the Heroes, he becomes pathetic. At least keep the characteristics of a person consistent.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The complete escape from reality really ruins a lot of the movie for me. I completed turned off my brain and lowered my expectations but I was still disappointed. 75% of the movie was cool with awesome cars, cool fighting scenes and at times funny jokes. I don't understand the need for these insane scenes of jumping out of planes and other impossible scenarios. They really diminish the rest of the movie for me because I am constantly waiting for something dumb to happen and takes away from the intensity and seriousness of the scene. Every tough situation that would carry a major impact due to the connection you have with the characters is undermined by this insanity they they will escape even the wildest of scenarios. The emotion has complete left the movies due to over the top super hero feel of a once realistic series. Even in super hero movies characters die but in this series you simple will be brought back. Overall I feel these aspects ruin what I would have thought to be a solid movie. The cars were cool, Jason Momoa performance was great and the only reason I gave it 3 extra stars. If the series could get rid of the extra bs make it about racing, chases, fighting and not making the characters immortal it could restore the series to what it use to be in the first couple of movies.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I appreciated the nods to previous Fast and Furious movies in Fast X. The emotions and relationships of the characters in Fast X added depth to the fast-paced action. Fast X has some of the best car stunts and racing scenes in recent cinema history. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen during Fast X.

He was acting more like Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in Batman. The goofiness and aloof comments were just ridiculous for an evil villain and made the intensity of the rest of the characters out of place. Jason Momoa made the movie more a comedy than an action thriller. He needs to go back under the ocean and stay out of sight.The action scenes were of course over the top and the supporting characters did what they do best, keep the story alive. It was nice to put in some footage of Paul Walker, the tribute was nice.The car driving action scenes were very thrilling and the special effects amazing as expected. Only in the FAF franchise can cars defy the laws of physics and never become un-drivable, as the last 9 movies have demonstrated as well. The action was non-stop for the first 15 minutes of the movie, and the plot was completely developed in the first 5 minutes of that time.The funnest part of the movie was the inclusion of every actor in the previous films. Helen Mirren! What she adds to any scene is just immeasurable.Hopefully in round 2 of this saga, Jason Momoa will have figured out he wasn't just the bad guy, he was also the bad actor. Staying tuned for the next one.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Characters randomly appear in scenes for absolutely no reason other than to try and fill in the woeful plot holes. Slow motion scenes of one of the cast looking in random directions, followed by cuts to completely different scenes. This film was written and directed by a child.

It's more like deliberately finding a reason to trigger a series of actions!The pace is good, with continuous action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The fast-moving actions keep the pace real tight!In terms of actions, as usual, FFX delivers what fans have come to expect! It's filled with high-speed chases, gun-shooting scenes, and daring rescues with massive vehicles. However, perhaps we have seen too many of the same kinds, some actions are no longer 'wow' and impressive anymore. In other words, the actions lack innovation and surprises, and are getting weak in visual excitement.There are a total of 4 DC + 2 Marvel actors and actresses in this movie! Cool huh? Due to the big number of casts, the director could hardly give each character substantial time and growth, making some roles redundant. The women are extra, appearing for fun, I supposed! Of all the characters, Jason Momoa carries his role well by creating different a vibe! Without his funny personality, the movie could be plain and boring!The chemistry among the members is somehow lacking. It is more of a solo movie by Vin Diesel, as the gang splits up too fast with fewer actions. Also, the movie emphasizes too much on actions, leaving no time for the storyline and emotional depth.I gave 2.5/ 5.0 mainly for the actions! The series is getting exhausted and weak, without anything new and impressive! For action-goers, it's worth your money to watch all the big actions! BUT if you are demanding for contents and emotional values, it will be a disappointment! Bcoz it is an action movie with hollow content!","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Unfortunately after that, the story and the direction felt unsatisfying and disappointed. Bizarre character choices and decisions, convoluted twists and turns that felt airless and many characters aren't given much screen time or development. Brie Larson's performance was like someone forced to do something that they're incapable of. She can't act. Jason Momoa is a powerhouse with his tremendous screen presence and infectious charismatic performance. His performance reminded me of The Joker.Unlike previous installments, this film conceived as the first part of a finale with a cliffhanger ending. By doing so, they did some rushed ""shocking"" reveals that ends up confusing and not in a good way.Universal Pictures needs to cut back the budget they're spending on these movies. They could've easily made this movie in $200-250 million range and they opted to settle with $340 million. Also the VFX was most of the time were cheap and phoney looking for an eighth-most expensive film ever made.

This supposed action-packed spectacle falls flat on all fronts, leaving audiences deeply disappointed and feeling like their time has been utterly wasted.Right from the start, it becomes painfully evident that Fast X is a mere shadow of its former self. The plot, if one can call it that, is a convoluted mess of absurdity that seems hastily thrown together. It revolves around a group of street racers turned international spies, attempting to stop a world-ending threat, or so we're told. Unfortunately, the film's writers seem to have abandoned any semblance of logic, opting instead for a chaotic mix of explosions, car chases, and implausible stunts in an attempt to create reckless excitement.Speaking of stunts, the level of disbelief one must suspend to enjoy Fast X is off the charts. Gravity, physics, and common sense are apparently mere suggestions in this universe. Cars soar through the air with superhuman grace, landing without a scratch, while our protagonists defy death at every turn. It feels like the filmmakers watched too many superhero movies and decided to incorporate their nonsensical antics into the realm of street racing. Regrettably, the result is far from satisfactory.The characters in Fast X are as one-dimensional as ever, with the actors seemingly going through the motions, delivering lines devoid of any genuine emotion. The dialogue is filled with cringe-worthy one-liners and trite platitudes that only serve to emphasize the complete lack of substance in this film. It's astonishing how a franchise that once boasted a diverse and engaging cast has descended into a parade of shallow figures reciting empty lines.In terms of pacing, Fast X manages to be both painfully slow and exhaustingly frenetic. Scenes drag on for what feels like an eternity, only to abruptly transition to a hyperactive car chase lacking any real excitement. The editing is a disorganized mess, leaving viewers disoriented and struggling to piece together the fragments of an already feeble storyline.Fast X is an insult to anyone seeking a remotely coherent narrative and a complete disregard for basic laws of physics. It is a cinematic catastrophe that epitomizes the worst aspects of mindless action films. Spare yourself the agony and invest your time in something more deserving. This film deserves nothing more than a resounding 1/10 star rating.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is another of those franchises with interconnecting films and that has made this franchise a bit confusing but here is my review for Fast X. The premise of the film sees the family under attack by a crazy criminal who wants revenge.Main Character
Vin Diesel once again reprises the role as Dominic Toretto. He is exactly what you would think, he says a bunch of silly one liners and he won't stop talking about family. At the end of the day, I just found this performance as functional, it isn't particularly good but you know exactly what you are going to get and we have to deal with it.Supporting Characters
This is one of the biggest supporting cast of all time so I won't be going through everybody just the ones I thought was important.Jason Momoa plays the main villain an I have to say I thought he was the best part of the film. Some will find him so annoying that it goes too much but considering everything else in the film I enjoyed his character and thought he was having a blast on screen. It is nice to see a villain realise how ridiculous this premise is and live up to it in the craziest way.The film spoiled that John Cena would be reprising his role as Jacob from Fast 9 but as a good guy. It has been clear recently that Cena has become a stronger actor, with humour added and he was strong here. He has a great dynamic with a certain other character and it was fun to watch.The issue is that everybody else is pretty pointless. The crew of Han, Roman, Tej and Ramsey is so dull to watch and it is clear that they had very little for them to do but had to force them into something. They even introduced Brie Larson and she is fine but her character is given not enough to work with at all and that is a big let down for her star power.Story
The story does an effective job of showing the mindset of the villain and why he is after Dominic Toretto and the family. It is escalated well and watching this confrontation was what I enjoyed over the majority of anything else here. The film just has way too much into it, mainly the story with the lesser characters such as Roman and Tej which was so dull and mind-numbing, the crew are split up and that is one of the weaker elements of any of these films.The ending though is pretty interesting and I actually thought this had me leaving the cinema in a better mood then I originally was regarding the future of the Fast & Furious franchise.Script
The script doesn't have much too it. The best thing is the guts they show with their storytelling aspirations at the end of the film and the fun that Jason Momoa is having, though I doubt it had much to do with the writing. The film just has all the clichés and for the most part I just think by this point in the franchise it never hits the levels that it has hit in the past.Style
The Fast and Furious franchise has always been willing to push the envelope in terms of big action sequences and although this is one of the calmer films of recent years, it was still fun at times to see things explode for no reason at all. But the pacing of the film is missing, the film tries to do so much that it doesn't do an effective job of making the audience care about the majority of the characters.Overall
Overall, Fast X is an average film. As we get towards the end of this franchise it makes you wonder how they got so much out of it and unless you are a fan of this franchise it most likely isn't worth a watch.Rating - 5/10.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

[+50%]","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9114280/?ref_=tt_urv","arungeorge13","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2023","Wow, they really decided to give this the Avengers: Infinity War treatment with a cliffhanger ending. The emotional stakes in the Fast series is at an all-time low post F9, and that's somewhat the case here too. I'm no longer surprised at dead characters being brought back with silly, non-canonical explanations, and Toretto's godforsaken family is bigger than ever. Foes from past entries becoming friends in the present is just a running gag at this point. After Justin Lin backed out, Universal took a safe bet with Louis Leterrier; someone who's known for fast-paced actioners with a studio backing. He does what he does best - the action is almost relentless, and while it's as over-the-top and unbelievable as it can get, Fast X never falls short of uninteresting (like F9). The set-pieces, though bizarrely inventive, are CGI-heavy, making them flashier but a lot less impactful.The abrupt ending is not the usual route that these films have taken, and that mid-credits scene came off as a surprise. I'm not sure the box office returns have been up to studio expectations, and given the massive $340 million budget, they'd expect at least one of the sequels to make close to a billion. The task at hand is certainly going to be a difficult one, especially given how interest in the franchise is consistently on the decline. The writers really need to work on the cooldown scenes - more than just offering comic relief and describing plot connections from earlier films, audiences need to feel invested in the fates of these characters. At least, they've got a pretty solid antagonist in the form of Dante (Momoa), who always seems to be two steps ahead of Toretto.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Who among us has not seen all the Fast series? At least my generation that was born in the 80s. The series started well and there was a purpose. Yes it was about street race and team affiliation. Now the last 3 Fast movies I think it has completely derailed. Too much animation, too much effects, bad effects. I was waiting for ironman to show up or why not.. hulk maybe? Fast x are soon a Marvel movie i guess?If we stick to the topic Fixed x, first of all, the plot was really bad. A villain who comes from the Disney world? A team that has no purpose? They kind of only exist to be saved by Dominic? Jason statham appears but quickly disappears, the Rock also appears out of nowhere and without any context to the film? Dead people in the past appear together with former villains? So it was very messy and there was too much of everything, the effects are certainly lavish but still looked bad / fake. They travel between countries insanely fast without even noticing or feeling it, which does not make sense for a good experience. Although, unfortunately, it should be canceled or returned to a serious continuation of what was a successful film from the beginning. It's fun to see the favorite acturs included in Fast X, but at the same time it's a shame that the plot and the choice of the action level was wrong and rubbish. I give it a weak 3a.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film embraces its over-the-top nature and doesn't shy away from pushing the boundaries of believability. The visuals are stunning, with breathtaking set pieces that keep you on the edge of your seat. The cast, led by Vin Diesel and an ensemble of talented actors, brings their A-game, infusing the film with charisma and camaraderie. The soundtrack is energetic and perfectly complements the high-octane sequences. However, despite the excitement, the plot feels formulaic and predictable at times, lacking the depth and complexity of earlier installments. Some characters receive limited development, and the dialogue can be cheesy at moments. Additionally, the film's focus on action often overshadows character-driven moments that made previous entries more engaging. Overall, Fast X is an entertaining thrill ride that caters to fans of the franchise. While it may not break new ground, it delivers on the spectacle and excitement that have made the Fast and Furious series a global phenomenon.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

You can just feel how much control Vin Diesel has and how invested he is in his character and image, which seems to be the basis of these films these days.I can't bear how there are no consequences. Everyone who has ever died, comes back to life, everyone who was once bad is now good and no one can ever get one up on the absolute genius that is Vin Diesel.Jason Mamoa does his best to kill off anything redeemable that this franchise had left by channeling the Bollywood rip off of Heath Ledgers Joker and fails in every single way. This franchise literally has nothing left and as long as Vin Diesel holds as much clout as he does, it will only get worse. I absolutely hate this film and anyone who has any form of intelligence should hate it too. I'm convinced that the only type of person who could genuinely like this trash, is the type of person who doesn't have a brain to switch off.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Vin Diecel's one-face-expression is left wanting for this kind of acting. His most prominent moments in the movie about the touchy-feely-family-is-everything scenes that has been a constant through the series is maybe aout time to tone down a smidge, as it's starting to feel a bit slowing for the enjoyable parts of the movies. Kudos also to John Cena for providing a comic relief mimicking his character in Peacemaker (sort of). This is a more believable and enjoyable story comparative to some of the latter movies in the series, although a rolling sphere (spoiler alert: Bomb) not stopping for a couple of miles despite any obstacles is a strecht.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Absolutely dire. Some of the other films have been OTT but this one takes the biscuit. Ludicrous, ridiculous and just plain stupid.Momoa is bloody awful. His hammy acting is embarrassing and that he seems to keep one step ahead of them is just poor and lazy script writing. The abrupt ending is woeful and no I'm not interested in what happens next.Lost interest in the first 10 minutes. Why has it taken Momoa 10 years to do anything. It's just riddled with pot holes.The cast don't really have much to do and Vin is now just awful.They should have stopped at 7. That's when it still had its soul and heart and was still believable. Now it just a pale imitation of itself and it's just stupid. None of the characters can save this and the laughs were non existent.Clearly since 7 this has been a cash cow for Universal and they should be ashamed of themselves for picking the bones of a once good franchise to pieces.Enough is enough. Just end it now before no one cares about the characters or the franchise.I'm now going to watch the original and enjoy.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's very strange to see Jason Momoa in such a role as it was here.

Because it doesn't try to rationalize itself or give an excuse why random things just keep blowing up or why half of the earth's population is comprised of sociopaths. Who cares?I think everyone following this franchise can understand that after the cartoonish finale of F7, this series officially declared its independence from reality and fully embraced its cartoonish side. Nothing makes sense, and nothing is meant to be taken seriously, just sit back and watch big bulky men go around in cars and blow stuff up while muttering ""family"" in broken and unrepairable English.Long gone are the days when this was an action-thriller franchise and seems like some people still haven't realized it. If you go into the cinema to see Fast and Furious *10* and expect a proper movie following the rules of cinema, then oh boy, you've come to the wrong place. Like they crashed a car into a satellite IN SPACE in the last movie do you seriously expect something more meaningful?This movie is intense and yet simple, something straight out of the early 2000s before the industry went to hell, and creativity and fun left its place to soulless Disney corporatism. If you are a person who likes to recall simpler times (like me), then this is the movie for you.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The whole franchise is a meme, and it seems like they have leaned into it 100%.Which is now proven by the addition of Jason Momoa - I went into this film avoiding all trailers, reviews, TV spots, previews etc, so I knew absolutely nothing other than a few casting additions.And I was surprised to find out that Momoa's character is a walking meme.. He makes this film MORE luda-crous than it needs to be, and ruined the whole film for me.

I'm also tired of seeing this 'car movie' just be about bombs, flying cars, heists, guns, money, family.. but barely any actual car activities. An 8 year old drifting a muscle car.... Riiiiight. All the car stuff was basically cop chases and one race scene. The dialogue felt recycled from past films. No one actually talked about cars. It's more about the action than actual car stuff which is a bummer for us car enthusiasts. It almost felt like rewatching fast 8.. or 9... Just not really different at all besides a few bad actors making an appearance. The story is almost always the same and it's just boring now. The scenes that were supposed to be exciting weren't.

Now, I didn't have high expectations, but I thought it might keep me entertained on a Saturday night. I was sooo wrong.The acting is so ridiculous and poor that I wonder if the actors realized what parody they had been asked to play in, but they did anyway because ""who tf cares"". I just can't begin to imagine how someone in their right mind would play an idiot of a character such Momoa's one. The rest of the cast are just drowning in an ocean of fake acting and idiotic lines. Even the jokes were a total failure. At one point I hoped everyone would die so it just spared me the agony of watching them making a fool of themselves.The storyline is the same antiquated hollywoodian good vs evil nonsense but much worse than any of the worst movies I have seen in the last few years.I ended watching the whole movie just because like any other crap stuff it was so bad it became addictive.I don't recommend watching this masterpiece unless you want to waste 2 hours of your life for nothing. At the same time you could give it a try just to see how abysmal some movie franchises have become.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first few movies were still about life in the street racing culture and everything around it, but since 2011's Fast Five it's been a long exaggerated action rollercoaster ride and with a lot of success. The cinema halls fill up every time Dom and his family experience another bizarre adventure. After F9: The Fast Saga, a tenth part could not be missed. Still, it doesn't get any better and F9: The Fast Saga was really one of the weakest films in the series so far. With this tenth film we have to go back to Fast Five to understand where Dante actually comes from and where his hatred of Dom and his family comes from. Well, get it... The short explanation in the film is sufficient and the Fast films can actually be followed without any prior knowledge. Jason Statham returns in his role of Shaw, although the role is very limited and for the rest we get a laundry list of big names to process in the film. Of course Vin Diesel's name is at the top of the bill, but Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Momoa, John Cena, Charlize Therone, Brie Lason, Helen Mirren and so on have also been roped into this tenth film and they must have a lot of fun. And got a good bag of money, because the Fast movies don't really get much better.In terms of action it's all good, because everything is as you can expect, heavy over the top and pure popcorn action. Big rolling bombs roll through the streets of Rome, the coolest and most expensive cars are run over with rubble powder and more ammunition is wasted in this film than is fired in a war. Police hardly seem to exist and Dom seems to have almost turned into a superhero by now. Shooting a rifle in his hands, he single-handedly lifts a car with ease with his other arm to get it back on the road. It's action that we don't even get to see in such an exaggerated way in a James Bond movie. No, we don't take this seriously at all and in principle it's not very natural, because you can accuse the Fast movies of a lot, but not that it gets boring. It is Momoa who carries the film as the completely crazy villain Dante, who does everything he can to make Dom suffer, because dying is not enough. The funniest and most horrific scene in the film is when Dante is talking to two corpses in the back of a garden, completely in his slightly too feminine casual clothes. For the rest, the action is nothing more than what we see in an average A-Team episode, but with a huge budget of course, plus that The A-Team is still realistic compared to Fast X.Where is it for the rest then. That's simple, the story is really very simple and just very bad. The word family is really mentioned to the point of being annoying, after doing some research there was someone who kept track of it and came up with 59 times. But the entire course also seems to have been written by a 5-year-old child who has let his imagination run its course a little too much. Again, that a film is far from realistic is a great thing and that is also allowed and also looks great. But make sure the story is a little bit fun. In addition to that flaw, the makers have also given the film a monstrous running time of 140 minutes, which is really just way too long for a film that could easily have been handled in maybe 100 minutes. No, this has nothing to do with the action scenes, but with the drivel about the family and all the drivel that is taken a little too seriously. Don't get it wrong, because the film is a bit more fun than its predecessor. For the rest, the film is exactly what you expect it to be and really nothing more. However, the film ends in the middle of the story with a completely open ending, so an eleventh part is inevitable and of course also watch after the credits for an after credit that will make the fans go crazy. Yet it is really time to stop with these nonsense films or make the stories so much more fun and better that it can still be justified.Fast X is already the tenth film in the Fast and the Furious series, but the concept really seems to be out of date. That the action is completely over the top and a cartoon is still realistic compared to it, is not even the problem, because that still keeps the big picture fun. The problem lies more in the fact that the film with 140 minutes is just 40 minutes too long and no, those are not the action moments that are being talked about now. It is precisely the moments in which the film wants to generate empathy from the viewer and thus generate some emotional 'family' moments. But if all that isn't bad enough, the makers don't even seem to have enough with the 140 minutes, because the end is just the middle of the story, so if you really want to know the outcome, you have to wait for part 11. Especially for for the fans it is worthwhile to watch the after credits during the credits, but for the average viewer it is to be hoped that the Fast series has had its day, because the stretch is really over and the films just don't get any better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've watched the earlier movies so many times that I'm embarrassed to even say. This movie was awful. At least earlier movies maintained a level of seriousness and believability, although that did begin to slip in F9.This movie plays as if the script caught on fire on the first day of production and the only writers available in a pinch were the staff of Animaniacs who only know about cars because of Rocket League.The CGI in some scenes literally made me laugh out loud.Past characters were called upon or popped up out of nowhere.Tongue-in-cheek arguments and fights were made at the drop of a dime, with no real solutions in any scene unless it was an explosion with one of the main characters looking dramatically off in the distance.This movie was beyond a waste of time. I have no idea how it received so many positive reviews from critics or viewers.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nice family forced into committing crimes because evil mustache twirling villain threatens their friends and relatives. Evil guys turn good to help thwart more evil guys.

Keep Statham and bring back the Rock. Add Sam Rockwell. Get rid of all the kids. Keep the stunts and the fights. These movies don't really have a plot so no need to do anything original.

The script was dull and incohesive, a disease that seems to have swept across Hollywood. If they have spent millions making this turd, the least they can do is to pay for one or two competent scriptwriters. And what's with the jump-cuts? They make fight scenes not convincing at all, and they reinforce the perception of the actors having zero fighting skills. Lastly, the bad CGI. Why is it worse than CGI that came out years ago?

Having a lot of action can be good at times, but when an action sequence is very ridiculous, it can take me out of a movie.I'm not sure what there was more of, plot armor or cameos. I went into this movie with the idea to just turn off my brain and just see it for what it is, but I have my limitations and I had to call BS at certain moments. For me, drama is built by suspense. Suspense is built upon the idea that characters can be placed in very perilous situations where the outcome can lead to death if they fail. Problem with this franchise is that the characters don't die, but somehow miraculously come back. So, when certain character(s) meet their fate in this movie, it just puts me in a ""meh"" state of mind where I say if I don't see a body, that character is probably not dead.The one good thing was Momoa's portrayal of the villain. He was pretty entertaining. Some things still didn't make sense, but he was entertaining while doing it. I'd like to see him play a villain in more movies.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some verge on bad, some skirt around the ridiculous, but still manage to be entertaining.This final (we can only hope) instalment is however disjointed and doesn't have any of the fun and humour of the earlier films.Jason Momoa is clearly having fun, but ends up more Eddie Izzard than Heath Ledger.The best character is Uncle Jacob played by John Cena, it was his part in the film that convinced me to lift the rating from a 1-star as at least I enjoyed a few scenes.My partner doesn't watch these films with me, but he knows I find them entertaining - after I watched this one, I actually felt the need to go have a rant to tell him just how bad it was. This film really is as bad as those who are not into the franchise, accuse these films of being. Sad to say - it is just awful.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Vin Diesel and his car assume Superman-like roles, performing incredible feats with no visible injuries-falling from the sky and tossing helicopters. In contrast, Jason, utilizing gadgets, undergoes physical challenges, bleeding, presenting a more realistic and engaging character. Jason Momoa's presence sustains viewer interest until the end. Vin Diesel's appearance lacks depth, evoking a ""why so serious"" sentiment.I hope his team members remain permanently absent without resurrection in Fast XI. Many actors appear outdated and, frankly, look terrible. I found myself sympathizing more with the villains than the heroes. It might be time for this franchise to conclude.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That Charger has an almost supernatural invincibility to it (maybe it's possessed).And why does Tyrese Gibson have to shout?. His character is so dumb and is always going on about respect. Respect is earned, not given out like candy. It must be in his contract to shout his lines instead of speaking them.And I'm sure that Cypher says that the knockout gas she's used will last about four minutes and the scenes with her and Letty last for a lot more than four minutes.Sorry, but this franchise has passed it's used by date and needs to be binned.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

With a stellar cast and spectacular action scenes, much could be expected from this chapter of the saga. However, the film disappoints on many fronts, proving to be little more than an explosion without substance. One of the main issues with ""Fast X"" is its thin and predictable plot. The story unfolds in a linear fashion, without twists or significant developments. The main conflict, though presented in an enticing manner, lacks depth and feels unengaging. The antagonist, portrayed by the talented Jason Momoa, promises to be a formidable threat but ends up being little more than a cliché, devoid of true complexity or convincing motivations. Furthermore, the characterization of the characters leaves much to be desired. While familiar to fans of the saga, the protagonists seem like caricatures of themselves, lacking any significant development. The lack of emotional depth makes it difficult for the audience to connect with them or care about their fate. Even the familial bond, which has always been at the heart of the saga, seems superficial and unconvincing in this chapter. From a technical standpoint, ""Fast X"" certainly does not disappoint in terms of action scenes. The sequences of car chases and fights are choreographed impeccably and offer moments of pure excitement. However, these spectacular scenes are not enough to compensate for the lack of a gripping plot or well-developed characters. Lastly, the film suffers from excessive length. With a runtime of over two hours, ""Fast X"" risks becoming dull and prolix. Many scenes seem to be present only to prolong the runtime, without adding anything to the plot or characterization of the characters. ""Fast X"" essentially presents itself as an explosion of action without substance. Despite its spectacular scenes and stellar cast, the film disappoints with a predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and excessive length. For fans of the saga, it may still offer some moments of enjoyment, but for the general audience, it will remain a disappointing and forgettable experience.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

At times it felt a little too cluttered with these characters that there wasn't much focus solely on them.The main plot revolving Dom being on the run from Jason Mamoa's character Dante and with the inclusion of apparently a new look son (nicknamed Little B), with John Cena's character. The other leads of Roman, Tej, Han and Ramsey did their similar routine in another heist like setting.There are impressive action sequences such as the opening bomb chase, the street race in Brazil with Dom, Dante and Elena's sister. The visuals and camera work is top notch as always but the main problem is the story isn't quite fleshed out and feels a little too cluttered. Other subplots include Letty and Charlize Theron's character, the random addition of Brie Larson, then Jason Statham's reappearance. Also several other reappearances by key characters after the post credit scene.A lot of the film just felt a little too comical, mainly due to the over the top cartoonish performance from Jason Mamoa. His character wasn't menacing and it seemed like he was doing a Joker impression. Then John Cena's interactions with Dom's son and of course the banter with Roman and Tej. It was simply too much and at times felt forced.Fast X isn't terrible, has things working for it but also several flaws. Did not overly enjoy Fast 9 too much but think that was slightly better than Fast 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a result all the heavy hitting emotional 'FAMILY' moments feel flat or out of place.Jason Mamoa has received praise for his performance as Dante, a Joker like Villain. However, this was ultimately a failure because a Joker like campy villain only truly works if they carry a severe threat overwise they come across more like a clown than a worthy antagonist. This is a shame as he was set up well at the start of the movie.There are so many characters (old and new) in Fast X that the movie inevitably struggles to utilise them. This often results in scenes that are either silly and/or borrowing such as those with Roman (Tyrese), Tej (Ludacris) Letty (Rodrigues). When we do get enjoyable moments from characters they either have limited screentime or they feel disconnected from the film as a whole such as those with Shaw (Statham) and Jakob (Cena).The action scenes whilst logic defying were not as well done as previous movies nor were they as over the top meaning they were somewhat forgettable.To make matters worse, the film provides no real resolutions and merely serves to set the final one or two movies. The runtime was a drag but I'm glad I stuck it out to the end because the best part of the movie was the mid credit scene. All that being said, there are people that will enjoy it as another Fast movie with nice looking cars, international set pieces and mind boggling action.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie is chaotic and all over the place, in a moment something is happening, the next it cuts to a completely differente thing, to the point you're like ""Oh! Okay, i guess this is happening now"". The absurdity of some scenes (both the ""this is physically impossible"" and ""what the heck is this story"" kind of ways) made me laugh in the theater of what was ocurring on the screen, and the plot twists at the end of the movie, i'm not joking, gave me a headache.Still, i'd honestly say that, despite its ridiculossness, i still had fun in said action scenes, and yeah, i guess that's all the positives i can pull out of this for now.In summary: Imagine ""Infinity War"" and a mexican telenovela had a child, and instead of leaving the theater in emotions and empty because of the ending of the movie, you leave it with an enourmous headache by what happened in its entirety.(P. S. I still can't get over the photos in the garage, the bedroom and in the projector throughout the movie, like those are literally screenshots of scenes from the previous movies, it looks so goofy and lazy).","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Here are my ratings for reference:(1) Original - 8 stars.(2) 2 Fast - 7 stars.(3) Tokyo Drift - 3 stars.(4) Fast & Furious - 7 stars.(5) Fast 5 - 8 stars.(6) Fast & Furious 6 - 8 stars.(7) Furious 7 - 4 stars.(8) Fate - 8 stars.(9) Hobbs and Shaw - 2 stars.(10) F9 - 1 star.The headline to my review for F9 is ""R. I. P. To a fun franchise."" I had originally intended not to watch any more sequels. I reluctantly gave Fast X a chance. But I went in with rock-bottom expectations.To my surprise, I enjoyed Fast X infinitely more than F9. It hooked me instantly and I found myself smiling quite often. They do a great job setting up a cool and memorable villain. He may be borrowing a little too much from the Joker but I found it entertaining.I was about 45 minutes in and nothing outrageously absurd had happened. By comparison, F9 had around 18 eye-rolling moments in that timespan. Now we do start to see it in Fast X. There are multiple scenes that had me cracking up at how dumb it is. But overall, I see it as 30% of the absurdity from F9.Now while I was entertained for most of this movie, there are multiple other flaws. There are numerous moments that look so fake with obvious CGI. So much that happens makes no sense if you think about it for more than a second. It's written stupidly frequently and they assume people won't notice or care. CinemaSins will have a field day with this one.But my biggest issue with this movie is it's not a whole movie. I find out after that it's meant to be part of a trilogy. But I've seen trilogies before. Usually each movie is able to stand on its own. Fast X is part 1 of a really long movie. The next two should not be called Fast XI and Fast XII. They should be called Fast X part 2 and 3.I was wondering why I couldn't tell where we were in the movie (ie. Middle of second act, start of third act, nearing climax, etc). And when the credits popped up, I was completely stunned. So much is left unresolved. It's not just a case where they maybe spent too much time setting up the sequels. There are entire plot threads dangling. It doesn't have a conclusion. Nothing feels finished.Even with all that complaining, I came out of this much happier than I expected. I think I will consider everything beginning with F9 to be non-canon, especially with how they keep messing with past story details. If you liked F9, you will probably love this. Just go in knowing you are watching part of a movie. Hopefully it makes it easier to digest.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 5/18/2023)","9 out of 27 found this helpful.

He can't act for peanuts at the best of times, but this was a particularly atrocious performance it must be said. His whole routine was basically standing with his arms outstretched as if he was Jesus making various quips in a strange voice.The one actor who I usually enjoy in these latest romps has been Jason Statham yet even his incredibly brief appearance just added to the mass confusion. WTAF was the body bag scene about ?No, this was written or directed by professional filmmakers. This was a concoction of farscape cartoons brought to life. I've seen worse films in my time, but not for the massive budget this steaming POS was made on. $340m . Think on that.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Dragon Ball, because some were bad and become good, others are reborn. They all show up when there's trouble with one of them, like they have some kind of telepathic phone line.Lack of realism both in accidents and maneuvers and horrible CGI.Unfortunately it is the worst of the franchise.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The only thing that's still good about this is the characters, and yet, they are also from other movies in the franchise. So that isn't really due to the filmmakers behind this, plus, i would argue that the previous movies used those characters better as well.

But still, even the action sequences is way too underwhelming and unimpressive compared to the previous ones. It's like watching a limited budget action movie. Even that rolling bomb in Rome seems low for the Fast franchise but that's the only main highlight of Fast X. It's good enough but too simple. And the rest of the action sequences is meh I'm not impressed at all even that last scene on dam seem like low ordinary explosion. Fast X seems to be back to Fast 5 again. Worst they decided to make it a two part movie as if this one isn't so low already.

I'd forgotten a lot and it was lovely to see Paul walker again; my main reason for advocating the franchise to be concluded was we'd forget what the movies were all about and Paul walker too, he's who comes to mind when I think of fast & furious and didn't want him to go past recollection. This movie felt like homage to all the movies that came before it, constantly dropping mementos. Feels little like a lot of memories, a lot of reminiscing, soundtracks even.I haven't seen the early fast and furious movies in years now so I don't remember them vividly, hence I wasn't exactly moved as much as I was meant to be. Maybe some people actually still are, but the script feels like it was written with the assumption that fans are still heavily emotionally connected with the actors, including the new additions from fast 6 onwards. Worked well for Han previously.There's a lot of cliche lines that'd you'd expect about family and a lot of the dialogue seems to have all these one liners. There's a lot of stuff done to purely just look cool. This ""nothing's impossible"" phrase is ruining the franchise when it comes to crazy endeavors.Also the vault action sequence from fast 5* was the start of the absurdity, a reminder that it's always been a characteristic of the franchise and nothing new.Action was plentiful, not as crazy as the previous two, still wild but they turned in down a notch. I don't think the space stunt can be topped. Worst thing was the bullets didn't sound like bullets to me. I loved the hand combat scenes though.I don't like most of the soundtrack, I think it's better when they select music from elsewhere that fits the part instead of trying to specifically make new music like this. Some songs felt off but fast and furious albums have always been popular especially since ""see you again"" so I doubt that's changing.Jason is probably one of the best villains so far. The acting all around isn't great though. The only performance I liked aside from Mamoa was John cena, a little surprising for me to say but I think he suited his role the best.The pacing was off. The first half hour or so felt rushed, halfway through it starts to feel like it's dragging out. And the plot felt like it's just back and forth, over and over with the twists between the protagonists and antagonists.I enjoyed the previous two more. Even despite the absurdity of them. I think it should've been shorter. The action might have been decent but everything inbetween not so much. It reminds me of the criticism most marvel movies have, that they actually have no substance and just used as a set up for the next one. Maybe(hopefully) when the whole trilogy is out I'll look more kindly on this, when it fits in as part of a whole, but for now it's pretty unremarkable, not that I was expecting much. It's as fun I thought to be especially in cinema viewing. And lastly, whatever tyres Dom uses, man pirelli f1 needs to study them, absolutely indestructible.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was a surprise to see him and hear two words in Kannada which made the entire audi to erupt. Speaking of Fast X, the story goes back 10 years to the events of Fast Five where Jason Momoa's Dante Reyes is introduced. The things that happened in the climax of Fast Five pitches the family against Dante and this time it's as expected... personal. Driven by revenge, to break Dom's family and make them all suffer, how the fam survives forms the first part of Fast X.The action set pieces remain ridiculously silly and even fun. It's the 10th film excluding Hobbs and Shaw so why even bother to expect anything different. It delivers exactly what the franchise is known for. Jason Momoa carries the film on his shoulders with his deliciously psychotic Dante Reyes, the perfect villain the franchise finally got. The humor is less with the focus being more on the emotional aspect of these characters and ofcourse the over the top action.It definitely feels overstuffed and there are far too many characters to do justice. Few of the main ones are kept for the sequel to showcase their action. Also, bring back the dead is done to death in this franchise and hope they do it one more time. Anything I say further would be a spoiler. There are moments that are boring and there are several more moments that are plain silly. Either way, the film still ends up as an watchable affair, setting up the story for the finale's sequel / sequels.The way they synced the story to Fast Five, with this neat trick, I am sure they can pull out another 10 sequels easily.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

As well as some cameos. The new characters might as well be cameos with how weak their stories are. There isn't any build up or story to make any of the new characters interesting. They are pretty much introduced by a brief dialogue or flashback connecting them somehow to characters of the past. Many of these characters did not need to be in the film, they were just there for the sake of having that celebrity in the movie. Even some of the old familiar characters did not need to be in this movie considering how removed they felt from the main story.This movie only needed four characters (Vin Diesel, Jason Mamoa, Alan Ritchson, and Leo Abelo Perry) to tell the same story. Everyone else was either comic relief or filler.This movie has some of the most unrealistic and unbelievable moments. I wasn't bothered by it because I expected it but I still have to acknowledge how off the wall some of the action scenes were. These movies have not existed in the realm of reality for a while now and this movie continues with the same formula.One thing I can say is that I was not bored watching this movie and did not feel the runtime at all. I enjoyed the Rome scenery and there was a fight scene involving Michelle Rodriguez that wasn't bad. There were a few funny moments. Some people will probably enjoy Jason Mamoa's character, I thought he was just okay. Once again this franchise proves that the over top action doesn't make a great movie.At this point in the franchise there are no surprises. The audience knows what they are getting with these films so expectations should be low.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The franchise is creaking under the weight of its own lore and legacy at this point, but they did manage to bring some fresh air with a touch of ironic self-awareness.Mamoa carries the film by contrasting the traditional macho male protagonists, making for a brilliantly engaging villain. He absolutely chews the scenery as a sort of Joker archetype.The best moment of the film is Ames delivering the most hilariously direct critique of the Franchise's journey from Car Racing movies to spy thrillers to now super hero movies. Brie Larsons description of a ""cult with cars"" was spot on.Vin is a little past his best, but his stoic brooding does tie the whole thing together with gruff grunts of ""Family"". John Cena is great, as always and all of the fight scenes are excellent.Some of the car sequences do highlight that Fast and Furious' ambitions have now outpaced what is possible with modern CGI, and it is a stretch to call this movie a return to roots, as street racing is at best a side element in a complex ensemble soap opera with a perhaps too many moving parts.Was it great cinema? No.Was it a good film? Probably also no.Was it intensely fun? Yes.The Fast Family Franchise at this point requires being comfortable with a rediculous meta narrative and enjoying how far the writers are willing to take this franchise that was originally about stealing DVD players.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Up until this point I've always given it the benefit of the doubt and still gone to the theatre, but not this one. Number 8 and 9 were pushing it already, and anyone could easily argue they jumped the shark then, but at this point there's no question. It just boggles my mind how some of these ideas get green lit, why is the writing this bad?The ""family"" which has been such an emphasis in the last four or five films has been incomplete since Paul Walker died. It's been a steady decline in the movies since, and it only makes sense. His absence within the movies can also only be ignored for so long until it just becomes weird that he's not there. None of the main characters actually die in the franchise by the way, because if they do, they'll undoubtedly be back two to five movies later.Jason Momoa is some sort of flamboyant Joker type character I guess. The stunts are more ridiculous than they've ever been. And they're saturated with obvious CGI that you'd think would be better or less obvious with a 340 million dollar movie budget (that's becoming way too common with these big blockbusters and it's alarming).As I said, I defended these movies for a long time, but I just can't anymore. I suppose they're entertaining to a point, but it's just getting painfully bad. But look out... cliffhanger ending, so buckle up for one more.

"5","/10","Not as exaggerated as the previous film, but still unbelievable entertainment for fans of the film series.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9062182/?ref_=tt_urv","movieman6-413-929510","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34790048/?ref_=tt_urv","18 May 2023","Fast X is the latest movie in The Fast and the Furious movie series. This new movie is directed by Louis Leterrier, director of the first two Transporter movies and The Incredible Hulk movie. Director Justin Lin, who has directed previous Fast and the Furious films, was supposed to direct this new film first, but due to conflicts with Vin Diesel, he has pulled out as the writer and producer of this film. Furthermore, this film would also be the first film of the three-part finale of the film series.Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family are threatened this time by an enemy from Dom's past named Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). Dom has in the past thwarted the criminal affairs of Dante's father and Dante is looking for revenge for this.Since its fifth installment, the Fast and the Furious film series has been known for its exaggerated, unrealistic action sequences, which, despite their implausibility, remain entertaining for fans of the film series. With Fast & Furious 9, these moments became a bit too unrealistic, so that many fans could no longer take the film series seriously or really enjoy it. As a result, they try to make everything more credible with this new film. There are still plenty of exaggerated moments in this film, but again moments that fans of the film series can enjoy.Some action scenes do have a lot of editing in between the scenes. Because some of these scenes are also shown a bit too moving or zoomed in, it is not always clear to follow what exactly is happening. This might not have happened if Justin Lin had stayed on as director, as he has more experience with this series of films.The explosions in the film are also not credible, because in most of them you can see that the explosions themselves and the resulting fire are CGI. Furthermore, the film also lacks real tension, because most of the characters often manage to survive the unbelievable situations they experience without any real damage.The size of the movie cast is also an issue of this movie. The film series has gained many familiar faces after so many films and Vin Diesel seems to want to bring back many of these familiar faces for a worthy conclusion to the film series. Due to the amount of different characters doing their own things in groups, it sometimes seems like you're watching three different movies at the same time. For example, you can sometimes lose interest in the film when it comes to the group that continues the least important storyline. Many actors who have once been part of the film series sometimes suddenly reappear to advance the story or they only have a cameo. For fans of the film series, it is nice to see some of these familiar faces again. Furthermore, this movie also introduces new characters in the front of the movie series. Most new actors play their roles appropriately. Jason Momoa, in particular, steals the movie as the over-the-top, chaotic villain. It can be seen that he had a lot of fun while filming this movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

And while his motivation and skills are shaky, his meddling centers and focuses the movie in a way the most recent entries sorely needed. Him being a threat versus Dom ""protecting"" is what made the movie for me! It's simple, somewhat grounded and very straightforward. Now, most scenes where any secondary Familia member was on screen could be easily trimmed and the film would be MUCH better for it.. specially the ""clown group"" of Ramon, Taj and Ramsey.Personally, I'm quite tired of the tacky dialogue you can finish before they utter the second word in the sentence, the unnecessary and useless banter between ""third wheelers"", and the forced drama-weight encounters/enmities/twists just because the movie needs to have developments. But when it's purely stunts and exaggerated vehicle action (not in-actors fights), that's when I'm glad to be watching. And I liked that in this!! This is also, presumably, part 1 of 2! And I don't usually like it when movies do this.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just glad I didn't pay to watch this mess. Horrible acting. Plot holes. Bad physics. The humor is flat. Sad. I can't believe they can can get financial assistance to make this mess of a production let alone actors willing to waste their time on this. But most of the actors are phoning it in anyway. They must all have bills to pay or being blackmailed by the producers. Here's the pattern Action. Blah blah blah.... Family.....action blah blah blah..... family. Plot twist. Family. Blah blah action. Cliffhanger. And how come guys in combat suits can get their butts kicked by an unarmed woman in street clothes? Oh and the Rock has a 30 second cameo. THAT makes it so much better. The only good think about this movie is Jason Momoa and even his character arc is full of holes and not given anything but the thinnest of backgrounds nor development. He does his best but the script is just bad. Too bad these could be great popcorn movies. But I think they burnt it all down and covered it with rancid butter. Fewer actors. Better writing less juvenile action would help. Sad sad garbage.

The dialogue is cringy and it lacks a coherent storyline, but there's plenty of action to make up for it. Jason Mamoa's character is very flamboyant and unique but is entertaining. It's a fun ride, and follows the exact same formula as all the other fast and furious movies. The ending does not really make sense but I suppose they will keep churning out movies as long as people go to see them, or the actors burn out.

Great roster, great car chases, over the top action, a silly, ridiculous plot that gets sillier with each installment and Fast X doesn't disappoint.It takes us back to Fast Five for the origin of a new character, throws in a bit from most of the movies afterward (remember F&F 2, Tokyo Drift actually happens after Five) with a recap of some of the best of the series.Turn off your brain, imbibe in your favorite mind altering substance and enjoy the action. That's all this series ever was, superficial fun. So take it as presented, there's a lot to like unless you just gotta have some 'deeper' meaning. In that case both this and the MCU are overrated and you will never enjoy either.Is it good? It's F&F, it is what it is. This is better than 9, but none of them were great nor tried to be, it lost it's way on 2 & 3, found it's mojo again in 4 and since then it's just been a challenge to see how far over the top it can get.In that case it's good and bad, pretty much as it has been since F & F four.But come on sit back, have a laugh and enjoy.I just don't understand watching the eleventh movie in a series and complaining that it's the eleventh movie. It's what it is a TV series with a huge budget made for the big screen. Just not superheros.Seriously. A lot of the bad reviews on here basically say ""I hate this series and this one is worse than ""blah blah"" number ""whatever.""So why are you still watching? You know what to expect. An over the top movie like the MCU but with anti-heros and cars rather than superheros and space ships. Is it good? Well, I had a blast, but I know what to expect and I know it's ridiculous. SO WHAT?Funny how the 'critical' reviewers all spent their money to see the 11th movie in the franchise, likely laughed like crazy and were awed by the effects with their family and then go home and write ""this movie sucks.""Seriously, if you watched all 11 of them I think some part of you enjoyed it or you really like blowing your money, helping something you don't like become a success. I don't get it. I don't like the MCU, so, I never review those movies (with the exception of the superb GOG movies!) because I DON'T GO TO MOVIES I DON'T ENJOY.It really is that simple. It's a car chase movie, or rather, a car destruction movie. Grab some popcorn and enjoy.Enjoy and then do donuts in your Corvette in the parking lot afterwards while your wife screams in terror....or is that just me?","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Partly because its genuinely terrible and partly because if you've seen the prior 9 films then you've pretty much seen this one, there is a vast amount of reused footage and storylines that patch together like a poorly made quilt to create this 140 minute waste of time. The storyline is exceptionally weak, bringing back the never before seen son of an old dispatched villain as the new, oddly camp, super villain for Fast X. Jason Momoa's character just doesn't work - the combination of comedy and cruelty just diminishes both aspects and leaves you feeling more than cold. It's an all-over-the-place mess of a film, you'd honestly better spend your time counting backwards from a million than watching this. A poor film and a shameful way to begin the end of what is for the most part an entertaining franchise of films.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

On the one hand, this is a great achievement - films continue to come out, collect cash, releasing a seemingly tolerable picture once every couple of years. But on the other hand, we have to talk about the quality of projects with each new part of the franchise rather from a negative point of view. For myself, I have long drawn conclusions in terms of films about Dominic Toretto and his family. And the conclusions are rather negative. Is the new part of ""Fast and Furious"" coming to the screens? Okay This means that you can plan 2-2.5 hours for a so-so story, where there will be a lot of beautiful action scenes, among which there will be one that has not been in the series yet, and also you will definitely have to see a new almost invulnerable villain, someone who died earlier must come to life and so on. Yes, according to these signs that I voiced above, you can immediately guess in the quiz that it's about ""Fast and Furious"". About which part - choose any of the latter. Sad and sad.The tenth series gathers under its banners the already familiar team of heroes, who are played after all by already aged actors. It feels like they are pretty tired of doing things on the screen that still looked good when they were 35-40 years old. Now fatigue has clearly accumulated. Tyrese Gibson's jokes are not so funny anymore, Ludacris' new fancy devices are not very impressive, and the heroine Natalie Emmanuel (it's too early to write her down as an ""old man"" of course) managed to lose her charisma, which was so clearly noticeable in past films and made the creator of the ""Eyes of God"" one of the notable figures of the franchise. The heroes of Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez are still not bad, but you have very little empathy for them. Tired or something. Or maybe it's the fatigue of the series? Probably not. It's about blatant copies of themselves and a weak script. And everything is understandable. ""Fast and Furious 10"" simply has nothing to offer.That's probably why the picture refers back to the fifth part of the franchise, which has already passed 10 years. The film draws inspiration from there, or rather, takes the antagonist from that story. It turns out that even then the company at Home managed to greatly annoy the hero of Jason Momoa, who returned after many years to take revenge. And his revenge will be cruel. Momoa doesn't look much like a brutal villain. Yes, he is dangerous, yes, he arranges horrors for the heroes, but the character turned out to be contradictory and inarticulate. I remember a couple of funny moments with him, but no more. And for some reason, the thoughtfulness of the villain's moves seems to be the thoughtfulness of the plot moves of the screenwriters. And you don't believe these moves. Just like Momoa himself.The action scenes in the film, as before, are on top. But without an interesting original story, they look weak. But that's how it happened with the ""Fast and Furious"". You need to be aware. The film of the series is nothing more than entertainment for a couple of hours, when you can just enjoy good tricks and pretentious speeches of the characters and their equally pretentious glances at each other.""Fast and Furious"" is a dying series. It's a pity to admit it, but the films coming out one after another continue to get worse. These are movies for entertainment and nothing more. Previously, the paintings were hooked with interesting plots, bright characters. Now the creators are unable to do this.5 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

OMG!! And OMG indeed!He is brilliant and amazing!!! I did not expect Jason to play a psycho so well. He is always a hero, a good guy. But here - a really bad guy with a touch of Jack Sparrow madness. I did enjoy that!!His performance outshines all the stupidity in the movie and makes me even look forward to the part 2.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Macho camaraderie, boosted street racing, moody main characters and plenty of action on 4 wheels. Then somewhere around 6 or 7 the franchise kind of lost touch with any semblence of reality, and insisted on making stunts involving cars as outrageous and ridiculous as possible. Not only are they simply ridiculous but stretch both the patience of the audience and the laws of physics in their function. I think the genre of the movie should be changed from action to fantasy as there is nothing believable about 70% of the stunts in this movie.Honestly can't imagine anyone walking out of the cinema with their friends saying wow what a great movie!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Epitome of greatness, above all.Yet thy ending, a shock to behold,
Leaving us curious, the story untold.Vin Diesel, heed our plea and release,

Epic saga's conclusion, may it thrive.Alan Ritchson as Aimes, coolness imbued,
And Brie Larson's prowess, her acting pursued.Go forth, dear reader, and let thy mind soar,
In this cinematic feast, thy senses explore.And though comparison may be unjust,
Thou outshinest F9, in our trust.For within thy tale, a touch of EROTICISM,
Adding depth and allure, a hint of mysticism.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

But Jason Mamoa eclipses them all with his Joker-esque bad guy persona. His character makes you love and hate him at the same time.The dialogue is generally heroic, Love themed and kind of generic. However, the humour makes up for it and is needed between being thrashed around in a 4DX seat.The story is nothing new. But is done well and the re-introduction to some former characters later in the story is paramount to what will become the sequel. Which, I might say, should be pretty awesome.Remember.

A Story! Lots of Comedy! And the Wicked Jason Mamoa as the best villain I've ever seen on the silver screen.All your favorite characters from the past return in this absolutely insane film. The storylines split in the middle yet the tone never slows.So many movies have After credits that leave me confused. This one Blew my mind! I cant believe it!Can't wait for part 2.

The Fast and Furious series began with a souped-up, street-racing B-movie that metastasised into a behemoth Mission: Impossible style franchise with explosive FX set pieces that defied the laws of physics and drama alike. A recent outing strapped a rocket on to a car and shot key cast members into space; this 10th chapter sends what looks like a miniature Death Star crashing through the streets of Rome to blow up the Vatican. .Old enemies become friends (and vice versa) and scenic locations (London, Portugal, Antarctica) are whistlestopped, while familiar faces (living and dead) get crowd-pleasing cameos and everything smashes into everything else. At one point a car jumps out of an aeroplane and hits the road running, only to take flight once more thanks to some exploding helicopters, before later turning into a submarine. Disbelief is not so much suspended as detonated.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

I love that there is so much more action in this one than there was in the others. In my opinion anyway.What I didn't like is how the ended it. I forgot that this was a 2 part one and I got upset.

For one thing the pacing is incredible and time really does fly by. For another thing there is so much going on and so many cast members who need time to do their thing that it was absolutely necessary. Actually the fact they were able to cut the run time down to only this was an accomplishment.The action scenes and the story are as outrageous as we have come to expect from this series.

Anyone who disliked this took it too seriously and undoubtedly isn't enjoyable to be around. Fast X is the ultimate action spectacle, and Jason Mamoa is one of the finest antagonists I've seen in quite some time. Since Louis directed The Transporter 1, 2, The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me, and Unleashed, all of which are excellent movies that I highly recommend, he was the ideal choice to helm this movie. I enjoyed this movie a great deal more than I anticipated, as it is primarily comprised of high-budget action sequences, hilarious humour, and powerful emotive moments, plus one of my favourite things about going to the movies is when a large portion of the audience reacts enthusiastically.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Two hours of turn your brain off and enjoy. Significantly better than 8 or 9 in my opinion and Jason Momoa gives a phenomenal performance. The complaints that the stunts are unrealistic are from people that just should not watch any of them because of course they're unrealistic. The absolute nonsense is part of the fun and so long as they don't go to space again I'm good with it. The cameos and call backs were fun and much better than some of the forced and just bad cameos they did in the past. Ultimately I think they listened to fans and learned from the mistakes made in the last two installments to give us the movie we want and enjoy. Excited for the next one.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Jason Momoa commands the spotlight. Don't heed what others say; this is the most spectacular summer spectacle until Mission Impossible 7 is released. Following 8 and 9, this is one of the finest Fast Movies. The ending of this movie will astonish you and make you inquisitive about what happens next, and I believe Vin Diesel should release FAST X Part 2 as soon as possible in MID 2024, as this is the epic conclusion to an epic saga. Alan Ritchson's portrayal of Aimes is also very interesting, and Brie Larson was slaughtering like heck.

It's the third-best installment in the Fast and the Furious series, behind 8 and 9. Even though the movie's shocking ending may leave you feeling more enraged than before, you may find yourself wondering what comes next. For this reason, I believe Vin Diesel should drop FAST X: Part 2 some time in the middle of 2024, as the conclusion to an epic saga.

"8","/10","superior to 9, as good as 7; Mamoa steals the show but the outrageous action didn't disappoint","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9459804/?ref_=tt_urv","jdring2007","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20263141/?ref_=tt_urv","27 November 2023","Man, people treating this movie as if it's the first installment to be over the top or ridiculous. Come on, that began a staple like 3 or 4 movies ago. This one is remarkably better than 9, which is easily my least favorite in the franchise, and I might like this one as much as I liked 7. It's just FUN. The ridiculousness is entertaining without being too crippling stupid, and the action is at a level that borders on cartoonish but is still somehow very enjoyable. I find it hard to believe that people fawn over every iteration of the Avengers and yet are bombing Fast 10 as if they've had zero foresight. If you hated 9 (which you must've if you're giving this one anything below a 6) then how could you possibly have any hope for the sequel? Don't watch it, simple.Anyway, I appreciated the many stars, old and new, am happy that The Rock/Hobbs is returning for the final one but disappointed that they felt the need to resurrect Gal Gadot (eye roll). Given that Charlize Theron is now technically on their side (admittedly dumb, though I highly enjoyed her scenes), it's quite possible that 11 will be the biggest stinker yet.At any rate, easily my favorite aspect of this movie was Jason Mamoa, who was originally my sole incentive to see this; his villain seemed outrageous and silly in the trailer. The full movie sets on display an even more outlandish version of his character: talkative, flamboyant, unstable, twistedly funny, and in ways likeable despite his villainy. He was the spice this franchise needed, especially this movie, whose serious and dramatic moments are certainly the hardest to watch. It's far from perfect and doesn't match with other 8's on my list but all in all it was entertaining enough to achieve that number, will make for a great rewatch with the skip button at the ready for those painfully sappy scenes.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Whoever didn't like it obviously doesn't have a sense of humour and isn't fun to be around. Fast X is the best action movie I've ever watched, and Jason Mamoa gives a stellar performance as the movie's antagonist. Louis was a natural candidate to direct this movie because of his track record of producing critically acclaimed movies including The Transporter series, The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me, and Unleashed. Since my favourite part of going to the movies is when a sizable number of the crowd responds excitedly, I found myself enjoying this movie much more than I had expected. The movie is mostly made of high-budget action scenes, amusing comedy, and profound emotional moments.53:- ""Fast X is precisely the kind of loud, bombastic fun that audiences have come to anticipate from this genre. Best Fast X since year six! Act 1 of 3 is rapidly approaching, and with it comes the """"Infinity War"""" of the tale, including the largest opponent and most narrative advancements of any chapter. Jason Momoa, who plays my fave antagonist in the Fast and Furious series, saved the day for me in this movie. The cameos were a wonderful surprise; I hadn't expected them. I eagerly anticipate their return in subsequent installments. I like any and all action scenes, but what he was doing was ridiculous. In the city, Dom's movements astonished and amused me, and on the highway, I really laughed out loud.""54:- Fans of the series will enjoy the action-packed thrill experience that is Fast X. As far as visual effects go, the fight scenes are just stunning. The appealing cast delivers enthusiastic turns, led by Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez who bring fire and intensity to their characters. The movie's stunning cinematography and thrilling action sequences will have you on the edge of your seat. The plot is predictable at times, but the fast cars, impressive set pieces, and thrilling chase sequences make up for it. The whole runtime of Fast X is an exciting display of chaos and action. Just chill down and take it easy.55:- Fast X is a thrilling, adrenaline-filled cinematic experience that fans of the genre are sure to enjoy. There are chases involving vehicles, gymnastics, and action scenes that seem impossible. The ensemble cast is magnetic, delivering A-list performances and chemistry that makes you care about what happens to the characters. However, the movie's incredible intensity and fast speed more than make up for the occasional predictability of the story. The high-quality visual effects help to enhance the thrilling action scenes. For fans of the series and lovers of action movies in general, Fast X is a must-see because of its thrilling and interesting trip that leaves you wanting more.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

While it certainly provides an enjoyable viewing experience, some may find that the actions and stunts depicted in the film lack credibility and realism.It is clear from the outset that this movie is aiming to thrill and excite its audience, with a constant barrage of action sequences and high adrenaline set pieces. However, it is also apparent that the filmmakers have taken liberties when it comes to the laws of physics and plausibility.While it is undoubtedly entertaining to watch our favorite Hollywood stars engage in a wide range of daring feats and dangerous maneuvers, some may find themselves questioning the validity of what they are seeing on screen. From car chases that defy the laws of gravity to fight scenes that stretch the limits of believability, there are moments in this film that may test even the most willing suspension of disbelief.That being said, it is important to remember that this is a work of fiction, and the primary goal of any movie is to entertain. With that in mind, it is possible to appreciate the spectacle and excitement of the action sequences, even if they do not always feel entirely authentic.While some may be disappointed by the lack of realism when it comes to the stunts and actions depicted in the movie, it is worth noting that this is a common trope in the action genre. Movies of this kind often prioritize entertainment value over strict adherence to reality, and this can be seen as part of their charm.Ultimately, the success of this film will depend on the individual viewer's personal preferences. For those looking for a fun and thrilling ride, it certainly delivers, with plenty of exciting action and a cast of talented and familiar faces. However, for those who require a more grounded and realistic approach to their films, the over-the-top nature of the action may prove to be a turn off.In conclusion, this movie is a perfect example of the classic action genre, with a talented cast and plenty of excitement to offer. While some may find that the actions and stunts are lacking in credibility, it is important to remember that entertainment value is the primary goal here. Ultimately, it will be up to the viewer to decide whether the film delivers on its promise of providing a fun and thrilling cinematic experience.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Dom & his family are the target of Dante Reyes(Jason Momoa), the unhinged son of infamous drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, who is hellbent on revenge.Fast X is an unbelievable film. Director Louis Letterier has given us a movie, that takes all the elements the Fast & Furious franchise is known for & cranks it up ten notches. The action set pieces are equal parts hilarious & jaw-dropping, because of the way they defy every single law of physics. The visual effects make the implausible stunts look as realistic as possible. All the international locales are stunning & have been captured beautifully by cinematographer Stephen F. Windon. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. Vin Diesel is back doing what he does best, as Dominic Toretto. Jason Momoa steals the show as Dante. Momoa's over the top performance is delightful to watch & exactly what this never-ending franchise needs. All of Momoa's dialogues mocking the various tropes of the Fast & Furious franchise, will make you guffaw uncontrollably. Michelle Rodriguez is amazing as Letty. Jason Statham is spectacular as Shaw. Jordana Brewster is awesome as Mia. Tyrese Gibson is good as Roman. Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges is impressive as Tej. Nathalie Emmanuel is outstanding as Ramsey. Charlize Theron is perfect as Cipher. John Cena is superb as Jakob. Sung Kang is brilliant as Han. Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior & Leo Abelo Perry are excellent as Tess, Aimes, Isabel & Little Brian, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. Fast X is a must watch for fans of the Fast & Furious franchise. Can't wait for Fast & Furious 11!","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

The entire movie turns into a fight against a rather eccentric, but deadly villain. Vin Diesel continues to amaze as an action hero and here he is seen at his best. Amongst the rest, Tyrese Gibson is still good comic relief, Michelle Rodriguez is still as badass as ever, Charlize Theron still manages to be a witty femme fatale despite her sparse appearance, Jason Statham only makes a mere introduction, and is still amazing throughout. Despite this, John Cena is incredible fighting, although it is curious that he reconciled so quickly with Vin Diesel and could have shown more, finally Jason Momoa shines a lot as a cartoonish and charismatic antagonist. The editing and action sequences are excellent. The amount of special effects used offers a whole dose of action that amazes and shocks. All the chases and explosions make this movie an exciting roller coaster of entertainment, one hundred percent promising. It is undoubtedly one of the best installments in the saga and the beginning of what could become the grand finale of this saga.

Loved it. Brought back the fast 5 story plus spoilers. Great movie. Even though Paul walker is gone, the series still goes strong and does flashbacks. Action, cars.. no need for street racing, even though this movie still incorporates it. They're older and the story has progressed. Enjoy it. Kal drago(sp?)/aquaman kills it as the villain. This is the perfect build up for a finale. Great movie. Take it for what it is if you're not a gear head longtime fan.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Jason Momoa is the mastermind behind the show. I assure you, this is the most anticipated summer movie up to the release of Mission: Impossible 7. After Fast 8 and 9, this is the third-best movie in the franchise. You'll leave the theatre more outraged than when you entered it, but the movie's surprising conclusion will have you wondering what happens next. As such, I think Vin Diesel should release FAST X Part 2 as soon as possible in the middle of 2024, since this is the finale of an epic story. Alan Ritchson is also fantastic as Aimes, but Brie Larson is the real deal. Everyone has to see this movie; it will alter their perspectives forever.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Of course if you come in with any expectations of reality regarding the action scenes you will not enjoy it, but by now it's expected that the audience just accepts it and enjoys the ride ( at least no driving in outer space this time).With John Cena being perhaps the weakest villain in the franchise he is followed with perhaps its best with Jason Momoa. There's perhaps no better way to describe him than the Fast and Furious franchise version of the Joker. There's no doubt he studied Ledger's performance when preparing for this role. Momoa is simply fantastic, he steals every scene he is in and when he's not on screen you want him back.There are however some parts of the story that are a little disappointing. The TeJ - Roman bromance has lost a lot of its zest. The jokes have become stale and it's almost like the only dialogue either character has is with the other. While Han has returned he seems to just be tagging along and a shell of his former self in terms of energy. Even Dom is starting to feel slightly weathered but is still acceptable. As the series goes on it becomes more and more apparent that Paul Walker was critical as the glue that connected the individual characters.Despite the main cast being a little weaker than they were in the past Momoa's performance is more than enough to provide an exciting movie going experience. It's also nice they realized his potential and made sure he's not a one and done villain.As usual , it's not the last ride for sure, but a worthwhile one.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

This was action packed and attention grabbing with some comedy all throughout the 2 hours. I am confused as to why people are rating it one star? I personally think this movie was much better than the previous few. Yes it is quite different as it gives more of a marvel vibe as they're fighting a ""villain"" with lots of tech but the storyline makes sense for it to be like that and times have evolved. (ofc the original 1-5 will always be better). In my opinion after Paul walkers death the movies did go down hill but fast X 100% bought it back up better than the others. I personally give it an 8/10 but the 1 stars are very very very harsh. They can't keep replaying the same storyline? This storyline combined 1-9 and it all made sense instead of being something out of the blue. If you want to watch an attention grabbing movie and for it to not be boring simply this is it. Although it ended on a cliffhanger I can't wait to see what happens next. I recommend you to watch it instead of listening to these negative Nancy 1 star reviews.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

FAST franchise is literally the only place for summer action blockbuster that fulfills all your childhood ""what ifs"" and only one brave enough to do it proudly too.This is no different as well, bonkers action scene and literal superhumans doing the impossible and making it look both cool and hilarious at the same time. This has more ""family"", and except for the ending sequence was surprisingly grounded. Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes was prolly the best villain of the franchise, flamboyant and steals every scene. Yes it was definitely a Joker mimicry but it was still better than Leto Joker. Large roster of characters, hilarious moments, family ties and plenty of self aware jabs and car action. It makes sense that the movie is all over the place as its just a setup for the next movie but was fun enough as a standalone as well.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

140 minutes family.It is 3 different movies at once. All Amazing in logic, plot, and coherent character development. And somehow still a campy fun ride. Momoa makes for a flamboyant injection of life.Fast X delivers on upping the ante with the explosions and intricate fight choreography that will leave you pumped up. Charmingly, though, where the film hooks you most is the heart and love of family.The franchise freed itself from the restraints of reality a long time ago. ""Fast X"" is openly self-aware yet it has an undeniably big heart.","2 out of 17 found this helpful.

I adore the whole series and have done so since watching the opening entry of it as a teen, sure it has changed tremendously since those halcyonic days of 2001 (OK, I was like 5 then...) but my fondness and enjoyment of these films remains unchanged - quality entertainment!I love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed). I'll never tire (tyre?) of watching them together.Away from those guys, the recurrence of the likes of Charlize Theron, John Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel is pleasant and the additions of Brie Larson and Jason Momoa are highly welcomed. I wasn't sure if Momoa was a bit too over the top in parts, but all in all he makes for a memorable antagonist - he certainly commits to the role!The action continues to be absolutely bonkers and I continue to be absolutely onboard with everything and anything that is portrayed onscreen. The look of the film, the sound of the film... I dig it all to be honest. It's loud as heck, but that's exactly what I'd want from a 'Fast & Furious' flick. A film worth the admission fee, as usual.Bring on 'Fast XI' or whatever they decide to call it. Apparently we're still getting another one after that, which I personally hope has its own sequel, which in turn has its sequel, followed by another seque... you get my point. I wanna be 105 and sat in the cinema watching another one of these.😂","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

As far as the franchise goes... I am bored with it.Bored of that defying laws of physics and sanity movies. ❌ in this particular movie, they didn't drag things too much. At least not early.Mostly the last 40 minutes or so went beyond logic.Last credit scene was a h3ll yeah.BUT I am guessing when the next movie hits the cinemas, we are going to forget all the physics we know.

Well I do! About 40 minutes into the movie, Dom Toretto is trying to save an entire city, and you know what? That is exactly the kind of entertainment I was expecting! Like most people, I was slightly disappointed with Fast 9 because of the whole ""going to space"" thing and I thing some characters were waaaaay underused (cough-Sean-cough). I'll take a small detour here: you know what I would have done to bring Sean back? Come up with an impossible driving situation that requires the best drifters in the world, than bring Sean and D. K. back and make them work together in Fast fashion because redemption and family!Anyway... I am 36 years old. I work in 2 places to be able to pay the bills and make sure my kids have everything they need. That film ticket might not be much for an American, but believe me, it costs something for a Romanian with a middle level salary! Every day at about 10 pm I drop dead tired. I have few things in my life to really entertain me, so when I step into the cinema to see Fast, I want to sit in my chair and pretend I'm in the passenger seat of Dom's Charger, and I want Dom to blow my mind! I want to go save the world with him, fight the baddest of the bad and maybe try to turn them somehow so that at the end of the day they will be sitting at my table. I want to see Dom driving that Charger and make me feel like my personal real life driving is a joke! I want Dom to speak to me about family, and I want to walk out of that cinema with a little more courage to face everything difficult in my life. I read somewhere that the word ""family"" is used 27 times in the movie. Well let's make it 30: family family, family. There you go Vin, you're welcome!For me Vin Diesel and everyone involved in this, delivered! I wrote this as a thank you because I got exactly what I paid for and more, when stepping into the cinema!Now... yes, the Fast series evolved and God, it needs more racing, even if just to pay tribute to the original concept. I agree that it really, badly needs that! And it needs to get it's feet back on the ground. I was worried when Louis Leterrier came in as director, but he understood the need for more reality in this and even got Dwayne Johnson back I hear. So thank you Mr. Leterrier!Listen... If you want real drama and such, you need to look somewhere else. I got exactly the things I wanted from Fast X. It did not disappoint me, and because I got what I wanted, I give this movie 9 out of 10. Vin, you need more racing man! Bring D. K. and the Deckard brothers and sister back, and above all, THANK YOU!","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Quickest X since year 6! This is the ""Infinity War"" of the story, as Act 1 of the last act, and it has the finest opponent and the most storyline developments of any chapter. This movie was saved by Jason Momoa, who plays the best villain in my opinion within the Fast and Furious franchise. The cameos caught me by surprise, and I'm looking out to seeing them again in subsequent episodes. While I love a good action sequence, I found his ridiculous antics annoying. Dom made his approaches as we were driving around the city, and the whole highway thing shocked and amused me.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Violent=7 Pace=9 F/X=10 Vehicle=10 Stunts=10The vengeful son of a drug kingpin executes his plan for revenge on an unsuspecting family.""Never accept death when suffering is owned."" There is a lot of hate for this franchise now, but I remained undaunted and kept my expectations low. I really liked this...it brought back my love for the franchise and threw back to my love of Fast Five with the action, cameos, stunts, and over the top stunts without being too far out there (and you know what I mean). Jason Mamoa shines here as Dante...I hate that they split it up but I can't wait for the next. This is worth a watch if you still love the franchise.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Best Fast X since year six! Act 1 of the last 3 has the finest villain and the most story twists of any installment and serves as the ""Infinity War"""" of the tale. I believe Jason Momoa is my favourite villain in the Fast and the Furious series, and he single-handedly redeemed this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the appearances and look forward to seeing them again in Parts 2 and 3. I like each and every action sequence, but why was he doing such antics? When Dom pulled his stunts on the highway and in the city, I was both startled and amused.""","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

The program's biggest draw is Jason Momoa. Ignore what others say; until Mission Impossible 7 is out, this is the most exciting summer show. This is one of the finest Fast flicks, after Fast & Furious 8 and 9. Because the ending of this movie will leave you surprised and wanting to know what happens next, I think Vin Diesel should release FAST X Part 2 as soon as possible in MID 2024, as this is the epic finish to an epic narrative. Brie Larson was a killer, and Alan Ritchson's Aimes is also pretty good. I highly advise you to view this movie because it will blow your head!!","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

It really seemed like flash back of all the movies combined into one and it seems they are finally listening to the fans bringing it back to more about the cars however the CGI department completely dropped the ball on this.

-dom is teaching is son to race cars
-jakob is fun to watch, specially when he made jokes
-brie larson deserve more scenes, but is fine
-daniela melchior is a good actress, deserved another scene
-cipher is great always, even if here is no clear who side is
-letty and mia always are great at their acting.-paul walker daughter is fine in her scene
-the car scenes, car races and car jumps and drifts are enjoyable
-the music is always good
-the rita moreno scene with the family is real good
-the begining is fun to watchcons
-the villain steal the movie
-the pete davidson scene is wasted time(nothing against him, but slow down the movie too much)
-han and deckard scene dont add that much...again, nothing againt jason statham, but wasnt fun to watch(make the movie slow, again)
-plane scenes are too much for a movie about cars(we dont need planes in every scene, except if is top gun)
-the movie have so many characters , and the pace slow down sometimes because are too many people to follow a single plot.-theres so many explosions(this comes from a fan of explosive movies)that even for a fan, is too much
-the villain always is a step ahead...why???Basically, i liked, but becomes too much when dont need to
the next movie need to have just 5 characters or 7, and focus on them. We dont need so many characters that you forgot why something happen.The cars are pretty, even the bad guy ones, but the movie have too many runtime that you get lost in whats next.Whoever the next movies goes, make it like fast five or furious 7, less people and more focused on their actions, rather than alot of scenes that dont help the pace.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This whole family and faith corny aspect Mr. Vinny tries to push on every of his movies is really annoying but if you ignore him pushing his religion on us the movies is fun. Jason Momoa brings such freshness to the movie with his character Dante Reyes. Also, them expanding on the plot of their best movie ( FAST 5) is actually brilliant...

Delivers in crazy stunts, crazy action, crazy races and an overall fun movie.This supposedly is a 2 part, series finale, send-off for the franchise but now rumored that a 3rd part, and in my heart, as much as people whine and complain about the FF movies not being about racing (they never were about racing, racing was a back story). Still, FF movies continue to make money; lots of money. When they stop making money, the studio will stop producing it. Simple as that. Which for me means this will never end and I love it.Anyway, onto Fast X. JASON MOMOA IS THE MOVIE!!!! Mamoa steals the movie and every scene he is in as the main villain bent on revenge against Toretto for what he did to his father and their money back in Brazil many years ago. Mamoa steals each scene, he's the FF riddler or joker for this franchise and easily the best villain in the FF franchise. No one comes close.Fast X has a big cast. A big cast. So, if you like John Cena, he's barely in this and definitely took a drop in screen time and character from F9. As well as the rest of the cast who have limited scenes.But the the cat and mouse game between Diesel and Mamoa is the reason to watch the film.Fast X was fun and a great beginning to what may be the trilogy.","0 out of 10 found this helpful.

I am surprised that the same people who loved fast 5 hated fast x for this reason, I don't think there is much difference between these two in terms of crazy stunts and weird stuff. Now about fast x, I think it's clear that they didin't work on it as hard as previous movies, it's noticeable, but it's not bad, it's just less. I liked it, the story is good enough, average I would say, even though it took a million turn, but it's still good, CGI was straight out bad, a kid would notice, but as I said, it doesn't bother me as much as other people, I thought Dante was great, at no point in the movie I thought he's trying to be the joker. Unreal stuff happening as always, flying cars and 1v100, good as always. I think what people really hated was mostly the story, it's not the usual f&f, it's so different. I don't think much changed in terms craziness, just the story is different for me, ugly for other people. To sum up, cgi is bad, story is avrage, acting was ""different"", everything else was was typical f&f.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

A film that is big, loud, dumb, physics-defying, death-defying and over-the-top with quips and explosions galore. FAST X, the 10th (or is it 11th) entry in this franchise takes this premise to nth degree and ""Avengers: Endgame's it"", bringing back character after character from the previous films in this franchise and making the situations and action/adventure sequences louder, more bombastic and more preposterous than ever before.And...the BankofMarquis loved every second of it.The very definition of a ""Summer Blockbuster"" film, FAST X takes our hero, Dominic Torreto (the very one-note Vin Diesel, and that is meant as a compliment) and his ""family"" on their ""last adventure"" (as the advertisement says) as they are attacked by a villain who's ""family"" was killed by Dom in an earlier film. So this one has strong emotional stakes in it as it is ""family"" against ""family"".Ah...who are we kidding...this is just the excuse to blow stuff up.With a very large cast (more on them later), new to the franchise Director Louis Letterier (NOW YOU SEE ME) wisely carves up the story into 3 (or is it 4) different storylines, with groups of these folks working together on separate (yet connected) adventures. It is an idea that works well in this film as Letterier can quickly cut from one to another to get the tension up, the action moving and the thinking to a minimum. Exactly what this franchise needs.He brings a swift eye to the over-the-top action sequences (the first large set piece in Rome works particularly well), never lingering on anything too long, but keeps the pace...and the action...going at a good clip and choreographs the action smartly, keeping the audience in the know about the geography and the intent of the actions - a must for action flicks.Returning to the franchise are Fast regulars Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Roman (Tyrese Gibson, still earning a paycheck), Tej (Ludacris), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Han (Sung Kang) and while some of their shtick (I'm looking at you, banter between Tej and Roman) are getting a bit tired, they all seem to be enjoying themselves and watching these folks on the screen in yet another Fast and Furious film is liking pulling on a comfortable pair of sweats after a long day.They are joined by some erstwhile regulars who have shown up from time to time and most of these folks USED TO BE foes, but are now part of ""the family"", including ""Little Nobody"" (Scott Eastwood), Cypher (Charlize Theron), Queenie (Helen Mirren!) and Shaw (Jason Statham). Oh...and did I mention the newcomers...Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson and (of all people) Rita Moreno? They all look like they are having a good time and are game for whatever absurdity - be it action or dialogue - they are given.But....recognition needs to be made to 2 other very BIG performers who stand out above a crowded cast list.Returning - this time as a good guy - is John Cena as Dom's ""little"" brother, Luke (the villain in Fast 9). The BankofMarquis has always been lukewarm on Cena's ability as a performer, but in this instance, he finds exactly the right note between humor and physicality and plays his character to the hilt, bringing in a tone of eye-winking ""I know what type of film I'm in"" that is sorely needed, his presence elevates the energy and the fun in this summer action flick.But Cena's ""eye-winking-ness"" (if that is a word) is nothing compared to the scenery chewing over-the-top, yet oddly loveable, quirky and interesting mega-villain that Jason Momoa (that's right, Aquaman) brings to the table. His Dante Reyes is the lynchpin of this film (and, presumably, the next one) and he is a joy to watch, giving some life and spirit to the bad guy that augments Diesel's one-note rock steadiness (don't get me wrong, you WANT Diesel to be one-note steady, it's the bedrock of this franchise) and Momoa and Diesel play off and balance each other wonderfully.Oh...and there are a few other ""surprise"" cameos that would be a spoiler to mention here, but the BankofMarquis cheered when they showed up on screen.Rumor is that this (and the next one - for this film DOES end on a cliffhanger - is the end of the Fast and Furious Franchise. If that is the case, this franchise is going out with a bang.Pun intended.Letter Grade: A- (You get EXACTLY the type of film you are expecting)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was nice that the movie gave us a hint that Dwayne Johnson will be returning to the franchise. However, there are a few things that I didn't like about it. I felt that there were too many scenes that contain characters fighting with each other. Another thing is that we only saw Jason Statham in 1 scene despite him being on the movie poster.

A sense of family but it goes hardcore as well. Enjoy.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

Those who disagreed with this took it to heart and are not nice to be around because of it. Fast X is the finest action extravaganza I've ever seen, and Jason Mamoa is one of the best villains I've seen in a long time. Louis was an ideal option to direct this movie since he previously directed the excellent and highly praised The Transporter 1, 2, The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me, and Unleashed. One of my favourite things about going to the movies is when a sizable portion of the crowd responds passionately to the movie, and that was definitely the case here. The movie largely comprises of high-budget action scenes, delightful humour, and strong emotional moments.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm thinking this is like a cartoon. Am I complaining? No . Jason. Momoa plays a very slick and convincing villain, and I like the constant bickering between Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson they are the comedy relief . Rita Moreno,and Helen Mirran in brief roles .what a cast : Brie Larson , Cardi B,John Cena, Michelle Rodrigues, Charlize Tieron, and Scott Eastwood . And of course the Star Bin Diesel.

Movie Review
Written by
Bailey Giannini
( (Film Buff/Movie Fanatic/Movie Critic)Star rating 5 out of 5Starring the one and only Vin Diesel as Dom Toretto, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty and Jason Momoa. I had a blast watching this one. Everything fell right into place. If there was an Oscar for best sequel for an action picture of 2023 and I was the movie buff who was able to chose which one to give the Oscar to, Fast X would be the one. This one has it all, a great movie script, superb cast, production design, amazing visual effects, realistic stunts, which I do give big compliments to the stunt coordinator on a beautiful job well done, incredible cinematography, without a doubt the most believable acting you could ask for by Diesel and the rest of the cast and great directing by Louis Leterrier. These are this is an example of the kind of action sequel and action franchise that we need more of. Vin Diesel has stated that Fast and Furious 11 will be the very last installment in the very long running Fast and Furious action franchise. After I recently heard the news about a seventh Jurassic Park movie being made under the working title: Jurassic World 4, it is hard to be that the Fast and Furious Franchise will end at an eleventh film, but no one knows for sure, except the filmmakers who are the ones who make these movies. But if the eleventh film does perform amazingly and makes a ton of cash at the box office when it releases in theaters, then the filmmakers, the cast, the producers, the production companies and the studios just might change their minds and continue the franchise and make more installments for a little while longer for the Fast and Furious fans. I do hope that Fast and Furious 11 isn't the end, I will say that. Getting back on track to reviewing Fast X I did love every moment in this movie, not just the action sequences, but also the scenes that had to do with just dialogue, especially the opening scene, which had a moment of taking us down memory lane, but I won't go into to much detail because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. One thing that I love about this sequel is that not only did it keep me engaged the whole and had twist, turns and a major jaw dropping surprise at one point that I did not see coming at all, but it was so amazing that it made me go back and rewatch all of the other Fast and Furious movies. I've been a fan of this franchise ever since I was a tween and I can with confidence say that this franchise will always be classic one of the 21st century. I can compare the Fast and Furious movies to other films that have won academy awards/Oscars and Golden Globes. There's a lot of movies being made nowadays and I don't know why movies like this one don't get nominated and win Oscars and/or Golden Globes. It's sad and heartbreaking. I do think for the Golden Globes and The Oscars there should be a brand new category, titled, Best Sequel. If other movie enthusiasts are asking each other and debating what is the best movie sequel in recent years in general, well look no further everyone, I've found it for ya. Fast X is it and I can't wait to go to the theater when Fast and Furious 11 comes out and so I can see it on the big screen. This tenth installment is obviously a must see.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jason Momoa is the show's primary draw. Ignore the doubters; this is, in my view, the most highly awaited summer movie ever made, right up there with Mission: Impossible 7's debut. After Fast 8 and 9, this is easily the third-best Fast movie. The unexpected ending will leave you wanting more, so I hope Vin Diesel would hurry up and release FAST X Part 2 somewhere in the middle of 2024. The movie with Brie Larson in it was excellent, and so is Aimes by Alan Ritchson. I think this movie would be perfect for anybody looking to have their head blown.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

It shows Dom's willingness to protect his family more than we've ever seen before and it also shows what grief does to a man through Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa). This is the fourth best fast and the furious movie and I will stand by that, at least until the next one comes out if it is better. The movie is actually a very good movie and it is an eight out of ten and this movie is probably the most underrated fast and the furious movie. This movie has good action and sure the CGI can be a little wonky at times but it's a fast and furious movie so it doesn't really matter. In conclusion this is definitely top 5 fast and the furious and yes it is indeed a good movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Lots of manic chase scenes and explosions in a tired movie series.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9844107/?ref_=tt_urv","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2024","So, I've lost count of how many of the ""Fast"" movies are out but surely they must be getting to the end. However, as long as they keep making money...Most of the old regulars are in this movie, even a short opening scene which includes Paul Walker who died over 10 years ago. Plus a number of other good actors, many with just short cameo appearances. The main protagonist is Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. His main antagonist is Jason Momoa as Dante who is out to avenge the death of his father.I need to comment about Momoa who has mostly been cast as good and mostly gentle Aquaman in various movies. Here he is totally different, as other commentors have stated his character is reminiscent of The Joker in Batman movies. It was a pleasant surprise for me, I have a new respect for his acting chops, in fact to me he made the movie more interesting than just a series of races and spectacular crashes.Plus, as the extras on the disc show, Momoa did all of his own stunts, including some thrilling motorcycle riding through the streets of Rome. (The disc has other interesting ""making of"" features.)Anyway my wife was tired, so we put this on, a BluRay from our public library. We figured the noise and action would help keep her awake and it did. I don't consider this a particularly good movie but it is entertaining in its own way. It is PG13 but there is a lot of shooting and killing, I suppose that is what movies are teaching our younger generation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some over the top action sequences that break the laws of physics so to speak but very enjoyable. Some of the characters are also very memorable.For what it is it's a fantastic film but the idea of the series continueing endlessly kind of takes away from the experience because there is no conclusion. Every time one of these films finish you know it's temporary.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Those who didn't enjoy it probably aren't very entertaining because they're too serious. The portrayal of Jason Mamoa as the villain in Fast X is one of the greatest I've seen in a long time, and the movie itself is the best action movie I've ever seen. It makes perfect sense that Louis would direct this, given his track record (The Transporter trilogy, The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me, and Unleashed are all excellent flicks). One of my favourite things about going to the movies is seeing a large crowd respond enthusiastically to a movie, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. It delivers on all fronts, from enormous budgeted action throughout most of it to fantastic humour and emotional affects.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.
