"7","/10","Not your typical ""superhero"" movie, but still good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1902563/?ref_=tt_urv","KoondoggSaints","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1541173/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2008","I was lucky enough to go to a pre-screening of Hancock last night and I really enjoyed it. I don't understand all of the criticism this movie is receiving. Everyone take a second and realize this is not a Marvel or DC comic book superhero movie. Now think about that again. It is a different story entirely and has some very unique elements.Hancock isn't action packed. It doesn't have a Superhero vs. Supervillan plot. I would probably describe it as a character study of the superhero. I think this movie does a better job of addressing some of the issues (and vices) a superhero probably would have if they existed today. The biggest conflict in the movie is within Will Smith's character's attitude, not necessarily good vs. evil.I think much of the criticism I have read about is motivated by expectations that were not met, which isn't fair at all. If you watch Hancock with only the expectation of being entertained, you will leave happy. Its a good movie, don't jump on the bandwagon of not liking it just because you can. Give it a chance and take it for what it is, a July 4th action/comedy.","401 out of 548 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Brilliant idea and great idea, but a classic example of the first half being much better than the second","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2533732/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","17 December 2011","What drew me into seeing Hancock in the first place was its idea, which I found one of the most interesting for a film in a while. I am in all honesty not a big fan of Will Smith, but he has given some solid performances so I thought why not.I have to say that I didn't think Hancock was a bad film as such, it was somewhat underwhelming and I'm sorry to say I do understand the criticisms against it.Hancock does have a fair number of good points. It is stylishly filmed, with some well above average special effects, the music is dynamic and the directing is solid. The best asset about Hancock is the acting of the three leads.Will Smith is very commanding, with a lot of subtlety amongst all the wisecracks/gags that don't feel forced(ie.flying under the influence). Charlize Theron shows a glowing presence while also showing a sympathetic side, and Jason Bateman's dry humour contrasts perfectly too.However, Hancock is a very uneven film. I loved the first half, it was well paced, the script was witty and fresh and the scene where the titular character brings a speeding train to a halt as he can't be bothered to lift the car up from its path is one of the better and relevant scenes of the film.It is in the second half where Hancock is less than successful. Here the film starts to drag, the script becomes soapy and heavily melodramatic and the film has one of the daftest twists of any film not to have M Night Shyamalan's name on it.The story's tone isn't the only asset to feel uneven, the script is too, it has wit and freshness in the first half, but becomes mawkish in the second. I also felt that there were only three likable characters(Smith's, Theron's and Bateman's) and the others I barely noticed, with the villain especially flat.So all in all, an uneven film but not a necessarily bad one. 5/10 Bethany Cox","46 out of 59 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Classic case of great idea, mediocre execution. Strong performances are marred by weak CGI and a lack of a central villain.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1902887/?ref_=tt_urv","The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4506876/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2008","Will Smith. That's all you've got to say, and you're guaranteed a big opening at the box office. Well, from the looks of it, Smith also guarantees you at least a mildly entertaining film, which is what we get in his latest movie, Hancock. In the hands of any other leading star, Hancock would probably end up being a below average film. It's Smith's charisma, charm, and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film. He can make you laugh, cheer, cry, and even root for his character (who is a total ass, as he is reminded a number of times throughout the movie) no matter what kind of shenanigans he may cause.Hancock is not the generic superhero film and is probably one of the more ingenious ideas to come across a producer's desk in quite some time. To me, what it seems like is that the writers of the film loved the idea, started off extremely strong, and then began to realize that how hard it is to sustain a simplistic idea over the course of a full length motion picture (and it is because of this that Hancock is relatively short). The writers' plan to solve this problem is to throw in a totally unnecessary and badly handled plot twist to keep the audience guessing. The lack of a central villain also hurts the movie a lot. The character that serves as Hancock's enemy in the finale isn't even well acted. The person is laughable.This is an action movie, so it should come as no surprise to see well done and original action in the movie. However, I felt the effects could have used a few more weeks of polishing in the editing room. The camera is also quite crampy. I also have problems with the film's score, as it does not add an epic feeling to the film like it should have. I felt like something was missing in the climax of the film (which is not the end). The action scenes, while entertaining and original, were not long enough to engage the audience like say, The Incredible Hulk, nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted.The film's strength rides on its three stars. Action veterans Will Smith and Charlize Theron both deliver winning performances as usual, and that should come as no surprise. Smith's charisma is enough to make anyone happy, and it's so easy to see why so many people love him. Theron is always a sight to behold (except in Monster, lol), and this film is no different. I enjoyed her performance the most, especially in the second act and the beginning of the third. Jason Bateman, who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron, is great as usual, and likable, marking a change from his recent turn in ""Juno"". There really isn't another performance to note, and part of Hancock's weakness is that there are really only three main engaging characters. It should also be noted that the kid who played Bateman's son was absolutely adorable.Hancock is the classic case of great idea, and mediocre execution. I can see this idea being remade years from now, and pulled off even better. It's not a fault of Peter Berg, the film's director, as the real weakness is in the screenplay, which falters after an excellent and wonderful opening act. It's not a bad film by any means, nor is it great. It's in between ""okay"" and ""good"".","422 out of 607 found this helpful.

There is a surprising turn of events that I did not see coming. Will Smith, in his usual style, is quick, funny, witty, and charming and I thought the timing between he and Jason Bateman was perfect. If you are expecting to see a movie along the lines of Hulk, Iron Man, Batman, etc, don't go because you won't enjoy it.

I spoke with director Peter Berg after the film and he seemed fully aware of the issues relating to the final act.

"6","/10","Hancock Signs Off","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1902732/?ref_=tt_urv","moutonbear25","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1982210/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2008","It isn't fair to write a film off in the first few minutes but you can sometimes get a pretty good sense as to what you're in store for from the way the film introduces itself. The film opens on an L.A. freeway, where four punks are being chased in their van by countless police cruisers while they fire their semi-automatic weapons into the air. Where's Spider-Man when you need him? (Right, I forgot  Spidey's a New Yorker.) Cut to a passed out bum on a park bench. Who is this man? Of course, we know it's our hero, Hancock (Will Smith), because we know a thing or two about the film before sitting down to watch it. Director, Peter Berg, takes this for granted though and it soon becomes apparent that convention and presumption will drive this unconventional tale. In HANCOCK, Berg, and Smith team up with writers, Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, to debunk superhero iconography as well as the genre itself. The goal, and a noble and exciting one it is, is to rip the superhero out of the sky, strip him of his glory and send him hurdling toward the earth. Only Hancock is pulled down to an earth that is an awful lot more like a movie than the world I know.It wouldn't be so terrible to set this enormous Hollywood action film in typical scenarios if Berg weren't trying so hard to give the film a decidedly un-Hollywood look. The aesthetic is often shaky and unstill, crossing back and forth between odd close-ups and frames finding their focus. Berg seems bent on giving HANCOCK a gritty, guerilla film-making tone but the erratic style is at odds with the predictability of the plot. The borrowed independent style works in its original context because independent films are, ordinarily, about something deeper. Removing the gloss from a Hollywood feature only allows the viewer to see how little there is underneath it all. In HANCOCK's case, the man beneath the lacking luster is a reluctant hero who would rather waste his days drunk in a dive than diving into the action itself to save the day. There is some loose discourse on realizing your destiny but little else. Again reluctantly, Hancock agrees to some help from a struggling public relations person (Jason Bateman) and is set on the path to making the most of his life and abilities. Hancock is such a complex character (lonely, disinterested, depressed) that it would seem ripe with possibility but this is mostly squandered in favor of half funny humour and sometimes hokey special effects that it feels at times like a over produced Nike ad.Luckily for HANCOCK, the film is still somewhat enjoyable thanks to the strong performances of all its leads. Smith continues his streak for picking complicated characters with broad appeal and he also continues his streak of pulling them off. After a heartbreaking turn that pushed his dramatic abilities in THE PURSUIT OF Happiness and his commanding yet vulnerable turn that pushed his presence in I AM LEGEND, Smith plays a character we don't ordinarily see him as. His impossible-not-to-like face is covered in stubble and his physique is hidden by baggy, dirty clothes but his eyes are what give away his disenfranchised soul that shows his hurt for being shunned by society and disinterest in placating to that same society. Smith is joined by the modern master of comedic timing, Bateman and Charlize Theron, as Bateman's wife, who is simultaneously frightened and intimidating. This trio of talent is HANCOCK's salvation. Their grasp of their characters in unfailing and they pull the elements of the film together despite how flimsy the elements are to begin with.HANCOCK is occasionally astounding but mostly mundane. Above all, it is a disappointment. This original premise has been sloppily slapped together and most of its potential was squandered in the process. It didn't show me that superheroes are people too. If anything, it just made me miss the real deal. If the goal was to truly bring the superhero down to earth, then there was still a long, long way to go before this guy would have touched the ground.","66 out of 137 found this helpful.

I respectfully disagree.Hancock is most definitely DIFFERENT in it's last half - it drops off the comedy significantly and introduces some fascinating superhero mythology that is almost like an ancient Greek myth in its context. It also introduces some pretty tense and violent moments that really made me wonder if they should be marketing it as the kid-friendly summer blockbuster that they are. However, both halves have their own merits - the first being the humour, and the second being the (almost tragic) origin mythos. I suspect if you are prepared for the switch in tone, rather than shocked when it arrives, you might enjoy Hancock as much as I did.","328 out of 479 found this helpful.

But after talking to people who saw it, it was half/half of either they loved it or hated it, so I guess this was just a movie I had to see for myself. So I watched it yesterday, I am dumbfounded, I'm the half/half, I loved it and I hated it. I felt like the beginning was just silly and rushed, not to mention that the villain was just under developed and didn't have any depth to why he was so bad. But however, I did like the little twist they had, which I refuse to give away, even though I did predict it sadly, it's one of those things you'll have to see. But I also did enjoy the originality, it's not just a typical super hero movie with all the stereotypes, it was John Hancock(which by the way should've taken place in Chicago after it's famous building).John Hancock is a homeless bum who just has a bad attitude along with a horrible drinking problem, he also is different, he is a super hero. The only problem? He causes a lot of damage when he ""saves the day"" and doesn't care what people think. But when a failing advertiser, Ray Embroy, is saved by John, Ray offers John a chance to look good and be the ultimate super hero. But Ray's wife, Mary, isn't so excited and has a little secret about her and John. But Ray is determined and will make sure that Hancock is a great super hero for the whole city.Hancock is over all an alright film, it's not bad by any means, but I feel like it could have been so much more with a better script. Not to mention some of the camera angles were a little extreme, there were times where I thought the cameraman was on a tilt-a-whirl and I felt sick. But for the story I'll admit that it was original and fun at times, Will Smith is a good actor, I will always admit that, but it seems like his movies(which are always released around the fourth of July, you notice) have become like a love letter to him and how great he is. Hancock is worth the look, but I'd recommend the rental, it's just a notch under a great blockbuster.6/10","26 out of 50 found this helpful.

The film centers on a down and out alcoholic superhero called Hancock, played by the ever impressive Will Smith. He is a superhero that causes destruction and fuels his own public hatred where ever he goes due to his lifestyle and his indolence. It becomes fortunate therefore that one day he should save the life of PR man (Jason Bateman), who is married to the lovely Mary (Charlize Theron) and that in return for saving his life he chooses to help Hancock change his image.The film starts well by introducing us to Hancock asleep, scruffy and unshaven on a public bench but ultimately establishing him as a lousy, grumpy oaf. As the film progresses Hancock evolves into a very endearing character, his apathy and self loathing - exhibited by his alcoholism, are all traits that manage to humanize the myths that surround super human beings. The fact that his physical prowess and lifestyle choice is his undoing is an interesting concept and in some quarters would be regarded as a microcosm of the manner in which gifted, black American men have been marginalized over the years (but this is a short review and I don't want to get that deep... however, examples that come to mind, and help to support this theory, are such great physical talents like Ed Moses, Shaquille O'Neil, Carl Lewis, Jesse Owen etc) some film scholars will no doubt give more precedence to this side of the film.Many critics have labeled the film as being unequal and disjointed and I would have to say that I agree. The first half of the film is amusing, engaging and quite plausible (given its premise) but upon the introduction of a second hero with equal powers the film quickly descends into the farcical. For example, some of the early scenes have Hancock exhibiting his strength in often mundane scenarios from dragging a car up a driveway to dunking a basketball from over 50 meters away but given there placement in the context of the film they are clearly the conceivable actions of a super strong human being. During the latter stages of the film this demonstration of strength becomes inane and coarse, epitomized by a scene in which the two superheroes battle it out the sky, throwing each other across blocks and through buildings, and affecting the weather to such an extent that lightening, twisters and snowfall all takes place. This is ultimately where the film falls down as it resorts to the clichés that are so often witnessed in films of this genre. Ultimately this decline is driven by a foolishly executed back-story that has no place in the film and should have been erased the moment it was conceived. The internal logic of the film is preposterous and nonsensical and would remain so even if it was chief plot device in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.When it comes to the direction it seems surprising to me that Peter Berg should be able to make the leap to making a blockbuster like Hancock, this is because Hancock was always going to be a commercial risk given its target audience and release date and his previous film The Kingdom was not a huge success. In these situations it is normally an established director that is chosen by the studio to carry films of this nature. This is evident from the manner in which the plot, story and narrative transpire to the screen as Berg's direction is gritty, with frantic zooms, sharp fast-pans and steady-cam sequences. His direction does not really complement the film, leading me to believe that in Hancock we have a director that is better than the film he is trying to make, a rarity in film making but it does happen.Finally, Hancock is probably one of the biggest let downs I have had the misfortune to witness this year. The incoherent story has seriously affected the outcome of this film; it has led to it being almost incomprehensible. The futile subplot and unnecessary twist laid the foundations for the films demise. However, despite my immense disappointment I can still sit back and take light in the performances and the direction, but they can do nothing for my overall feelings towards Hancock.","62 out of 96 found this helpful.

What really got me to watch it was the curiosity of how Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (loved watching the two on 'Arrested Development') work together. Now, i must say that I was pleasantly surprised. 'Hancock' certainly turned out better than expected. It has all the ingredients of a successful superhero film. What we get is sheer entertainment. There's a lot of action, drama, romance and comedy in it.Yet, it's not exactly among the best superhero films and what really makes it work are the three leads. I thought Will Smith would replay his 'Men In Black' persona but what we get is a nuanced performance. 'Hancock' is an alcoholic, depressed superhero who does the usual superhero stuff albeit in a very clumsy way and is not careful (nor does he care) to avoid collateral damage. As a result, people see him as a super-nuisance rather than a hero. But, there is a reason why Hancock acts this way. He's angry and he's upset. I won't say more except that Smith brilliantly displays the layers of his character. The eternally hot Charlize Theron (that is, if you forget 'Monster') springs a surprise. At first glance, I thought she'd be the typical wife who at in the beginning dislikes Hancock but gradually grows to like him. But no, it's something else and this becomes more apparent as the chemistry between Smith and Theron strengthens while Mary's attitude gets more curiously awkward. Yes, Theron is fantastic and shares an excellent on screen rapport with both her male co-stars. Jason Bateman's Ray is the suitable link between Theron and Smith. His camaraderie with Smith is very amusing and his scenes with Theron are nice to watch. Sadly, Eddie Marsan is awful as the villain and this is mostly due to poor writing.'Hancock' has quite a few flaws. The execution is not of top quality. The special effects are poorly done and look unpolished. CGI has greatly improved throughout the years but 'Hancock' is no proof of that. As a result the action sequences look fake. Nor is the background score any great and this really takes away from the slick feel one gets from an action film. The screenplay is faulty. It's a very short movie and the writers seemed to be in a hurry as the twists seem really drastic and at times rushed. I would have liked to see more plot development. The villain character is terribly written and has little significance to the overall story. The film starts off as a comedy and then moves to drama followed by romance and then action. Nothing wrong with that but perhaps a little more balance could have helped. Yet, this one is only a minor quibble.To sum it up, 'Hancock' is very entertaining and a good enough flick. But it could have easily been one of the greatest films of the summer. It is Theron, Smith and Bateman who lift this movie from being an average to below average flick. They make it worth the watch.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

It was fun, lighthearted, and easygoing, which is likely why it did so well at the box office. It also had a little bit of heartfeltness with Hancock and Mary. There were quite a few memorable scenes. The premise/backstory was intriguing, although I wish that were more of a focus. Even the CGI was surprisingly decent, although it also looked not-so-decent at the same time; it was a weird but okay middle ground.The most significant praise I can give this film is the comedic moments between Hancock and Mary, including the general chemistry between Will Smith and Charlize Theron. That was further amplified by how impactful (and enjoyable) all their scenes were. I was invested in/cared about their characters and the connection there. Will and Charlize were a fantastic pair that lifted this film to a greater height not reached without them.All three performances of the main cast (Will Smith, Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman) were decent. Will's was probably the best, with Charlize as a close second: and together, they bounced well off each other. Jason was the weakest of the three, but he wasn't bad; I liked his character. He did well with what he got.I liked the score by John Powell, who I'm already familiar with: the Bourne films (excluding The Bourne Legacy), Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and Knight and Day. I think he's my most watched composer; he keeps popping up. That final cue at the end of the film was great. The one before it, as Hancock is on the ground, was good, too, and the one as he's trying to get further away; both may have been the same cue. And I liked Louise Mingenbach's costume design work for Hancock's suit.One thing that could've been better was the tone/story. The first half of the film was about building Hancock back up from a low point, making you think it's going to be about him as a superhero, and it felt competent with a destination in mind. But it shifts to something different, which goes back to what I said in the first paragraph about wishing it was more of a focus; I liked that aspect a lot. And the superhero aspect wasn't that relevant anymore; yeah, there were breadcrumbs sprinkled throughout the rest of the film, but you could tell it was more for show.I feel like one or the other should've been the entire focus instead of doing one for most of the film, then shifting gears completely, even though I liked the underlying details of the film's second half the most. It's hard not to notice the potential of this film. The backstory of Hancock and that side of things could've been more prominent. There could've been more emphasis on the superhero angle of which the first half of the film was building up or more focus on comedic moments or even the action. It's like there was a complete script, but everything after the halfway point got scrapped or rewritten out of nowhere. But what we got was still enjoyable; the first half was the best.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The storyline follows an anti-super hero that often causes as much damage as good during his times of heroism. One day, when saving a struggling public relations expert, he gets the advice he needs. Hancock will partner with the PR guy to try and save his image while continuing to do good for mankind. This movie is directed by Peter Berg (The Rundown) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Charlize Theron (Monster) and Jason Bateman (Ozark). The storyline for this is fairly clever and well done. The cast is very well selected and Smith, Theron and Bateman all deliver their characters perfectly. The script and dialogue is very good, loved the head in the ass references throughout. The soundtrack is also very good. There are some great action scenes that insert the comedic content very well. This isn't a great picture but it is clever and entertaining in a lot of ways.

It definitely wasn't your typical superhero movie; and it wasn't originally a DC or Marvel comic. It's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times, and that is what makes it interesting. If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a ""mask"" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted. I think the best part of Hancock is that it's about a superhuman who is just very human. It was a lot of fun.","189 out of 291 found this helpful.

1. Both Will Smith (John Hancock) and Charlize Theron (Mary) give great performances.
2. The emotional scenes, with thanks to the acting and well-timed pauses, land with great effect.
3. The humour is fantastically dry and dark, which prevents the film from becoming stale.
4. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining.
5. The CGI and special effects, aside from a couple instances, look great and still hold up 12 years later.Cons:
1. There are a plethora of really strange editing and camera angles which take you out of the viewing experience.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, why did Red (Eddie Marsan) only take Man Mountain (David Mattey) and Matrix (Maetrix Fitten) to confront Hancock at the hospital, after it had already been established that most of the prison population was there because of Hancock?
3. During the action scenes, obnoxious and corny stock action music is played.
4. The movie doesn't focus enough on the philosophical reasoning behind a superhero negating their duties, and whether or not they should have free will to decide their superhero role.
5. The entire sequence featuring Hancock and Mary fighting in LA not only has the worst looking special effects, but the conflict just feels really forced.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Firstly: Will Smith. Typically, you don't see an egotistical alcoholic and think he'd be good in that sort of role, but I have to admit he made it believable at the very least. He's certainly a little too one-note, but I do totally believe that he's completely alone, bored, and fed up with his life.In fact, the acting in general is better than you'd think a film like this would deserve. And - sue me I guess, but I did like the story that was given to me. Looking back on it now, I can't deny it would have been more interesting if they had stuck to their guns in the second half instead of trying to awkwardly make it about Hancock's past coming back to haunt him, because it does kind of run out of places to go at around an hour in and falls back on cliches, but while watching it, for some reason that just didn't occur to me. I wouldn't call the second half bad though.This is also an admittedly ugly film, for some reason it's shot like some kind of gritty action movie or war drama, and the effects are terrible, while there also aren't that many particularly memorable shots.But there is some great dialogue, a few honestly amazing scenes, and above all else, I don't think anyone can deny that this film is...unique.And even though it gets messy later on, I think a big reason I didn't notice while I was watching it is that it doesn't feel unsatisfying because of that. The sharp turn the narrative takes in its second half is more due to Hancock's character arc already being complete, rather than them just forgetting about it.It still could have been way better had they just...not done that, but I maintain this is still interesting enough to warrant a watch, even more so today than in 2008, probably.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

That's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view.I appreciated the many original ideas swirling around the perimeter of this movie, but it's a shame that no one idea ever fully takes hold. The script feels like the product of a brainstorming session before anyone has had a chance to make sense of the notes. And not only is the script somewhat of a mess, but the tone veers all over the place as well. The movie gives the impression of having been directed by several different people.About an hour into ""Hancock,"" the script throws in a surprise twist that director Peter Berg handles deftly, and the movie, that had already been ticking along pretty enjoyably, gets an extra jolt of energy and fun. But that sense of fun drains immediately from the film as the entire tone turns nasty, unpleasant and extremely violent. Bad guys come from nowhere, plot developments don't make a lot of sense and back story is apparently made up as the film moves along. The movie itself is only 90 minutes, so I don't know why the filmmakers felt compelled to rush through to an ending without tying things together in a way that made sense, but on the other hand, I'm glad it wasn't any longer because I was tired of the arbitrariness of the whole thing.It's hard to talk about what could have been without revealing the plot twist, but let's just say that the film could have gone in any number of interesting directions that it chooses to ignore. Due to what it reveals about one of the major characters, the script could have given Hancock either an ally or a compelling villain, but it does neither, and all of the actors -- charismatic as they are -- feel somewhat stranded. Jason Bateman alone keeps things buoyant for as long as he can on the strengths of his goofy charm and comic timing.Grade: B-","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a film that is impossible to pigeonhole – in terms of both genre and mood – which is something critics and many filmgoers don't like. If you're going to make a film about superheroes, their reasoning goes, then you must fill the screen with daring exploits, comic book villains, and world-in-peril scenarios. The superhero must be the good guy throughout, and the PR guy – no matter what the genre – must always, always be bad.Here we have an unshaven, drunken superhero who saves people in peril while possessing no real interest or true desire to help (in fact, given his disinterest and the public's lack of appreciation, it's difficult to understand why he bothers at all). He regularly screws things up, hurling a beached whale out to sea where it crashes onto a boat, and causing millions of dollars worth of damage every time he performs an act of bravery. These early sequences are quite funny – although not in a laugh out loud way – and suggest a pleasing ability on the part of writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan to think outside of the box (for want of a better term). The city mayor publicly complains about the expense of his exploits and urges him to go to New York, while bystanders at a level crossing where Hancock has just saved PR man Jason Bateman from certain death criticise the way in which he did it and encourage the guy to sue.The mood is pretty dark for much of the time, and Smith's pretty boy looks are sacrificed (until his character begins to undergo redemption, at least) under the glare of harsh lighting. We probably see a truer image of what Smith really looks like here: the rougher skin, the lines, the heavier features of a forty-year-old man that are magically stripped away by ingenious lighting (just compare him in the prison scenes and the restaurant scene), and it suggests that he could make a highly believable bad guy if he chose to.As Hancock undergoes his transformation thanks to the help of the PR man he saved, a totally unexpected twist is thrown into the mix which gives the film its third act just as it's beginning to look like its going nowhere. Of course this is where the plot holes begin to appear, but every film has holes and this one has fewer than many other films which enjoy a better reputation. In the end the film is all about the superhero saving himself – as it is throughout, when you think about it – and this is possibly why it isn't as appreciated as it should be. The film's left open for a sequel, which is already rumoured to have the green light. It's a shame; I think this is one of those films that deserves to stand alone.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Rushed and thoughtless but with hints at what it might have been. All of that makes the experience a rather frustrating one. Will Smith is, without question, one of the best actors around and as Hancock, he uses every tiny opportunity to make the whole ludicrous thing almost palatable. When the camera is on him we feel the potential. There is a human being there in an impossible situation. Peter Berg, the director, lets his eye move around as if under the effect of a very powerful drug. Massive, nervous close ups in a story that tries to be missing the point at almost every corner. The actors are photographed harshly showing every skin imperfection even on the wonderful Charlize Theron. I wonder if that was on purpose. In fact that's what I wonder about the whole enterprise.

Ever since I saw the first trailer for the movie I got excited about it, it looked genuinely funny, inventive and it starred Will Smith, a sure fire success then right? Will Smith is a great actor and I love nearly every movie he has ever been in, even I Am Legend had its great moments. Yet there is one Will Smith I cannot stand, that being Wild Wild West, which for the sake of space and time I won't even begin criticising. So does Hancock live up to his greats, or deserves to be dead and buried like Wild Wild West? Well it's a mixture of both to be honest. Obviously I didn't hate it, hence the 6/10 rating, but it was also dull and boring in some sections, only livened by Smith's electric presence. Let me start by saying the start of the movie is priceless, funny and witty as hell. Smith gives his funniest performance in years and the movie is brilliant. Unfortunately once we hit the jail scenes onwards the movie hits a snag, while it does have its dark humour streak but Will Smith's sharp tongue alone cannot gloss over the fact the movie is going absolutely nowhere at an incredibly slow pace. As the movie goes on it just descends into almost madness with loads of waffle about immortals and a twist so obvious that I rolled my eyes when it happened. Still the movie does have its share of action and the comedy is pretty inventive, yet its not the movie it really could have been and is certainly nowhere near Smith's best.So onto the acting. As I've previously said Will Smith is truly brilliant in the role, when we first meet him he's a drunken slob who is hated by everyone. He makes out he doesn't care that he's hated but deep down he really does, still these scenes give Smith the opportunity to come out with some classic lines. The best by far being his response to a fat person, I won't spoil it but it made me cry with laughter. Even as the plot gets more and more silly Smith still does a good performance. Admittedly he does become too nice a superhero towards the end, and you do wish his darker streak would return. Charlize Theron does a good job in a role that starts off unimportant but gradually shows importance later. By the end she delivers a pretty impressive performance, and she also seems to be having some fun. Still her opening scenes are pretty painful and bland to watch. Jason Bateman is pretty good for the first half of the movie, being funny and interesting at the same time. Unfortunately he pretty much becomes pointless near the end, in fact its his absence towards the end that really impacts on the movie. The focus on Hancock's relationship with him at the beginning if the best parts of the movie, take that away and it loses its sheen a bit. And then we go onto the lead villain duties, played by Eddie Marsan. To say the character is garbage is an understatement, I doubt I'd class him as a villain, he's more of an after thought that anything else. Its an average performance for a poor character.So do the successes of Hancock outweigh its mediocrity? Thankfully it just about does. The first third of the movie is a solid 9/10 movie, no question about it. The second third is a 3/10 movie, and the final third just about gets a 6/10, so on average the movie is a 6/10 movie. The script itself is pretty sharp for the most part, only losing its focus near the muddled conclusion. The directing is solid for the most part, although the constant usage of hand-held cameras does start to get annoying in your average talky bit, I just wanted to scream at the director to keep still! The action and special effects are extremely good, the final third takes pride in its big brawls and they do really thrill. The opening bits with Hancock flying are equally impressive. However its the odd indecision of whether the movie is serious or a comedy that really proves the movies down point. Its three movies in one, only one being the movie it really should have been. Still it is a bit of moderate summer fare, and I suspect kids and easily pleased adults will find much to enjoy with Hancock. Its also highly forgettable as well, a shame as with a sharper focus this could have been one of the best movies of the year.Overall Hancock is the big average movie of the summer, while funny and witty, the movie is also dull and sluggish. Will Smith just about rises this above mediocrity, but I'm afraid it's destined to be forgotten pretty quickly.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

Early trailers made it seem like a superhero spoof, then it looked like a dark comedy, then an action extravaganza. It's hard to tell what this movie is and the news of all the directors and studios who left the project, the fact that the subject matter has been called controversial and an extreme contrast to your usual summer movie experience, and that the MPAA has ""R-ed"" this movie twice before the studio finally went back and made major edits to get the PG-13 all come into question as this movie gets the coveted huge July 4 weekend audience all to itself. It's a major gamble, but having Will Smith in your movie is a good card to play.Smith stars as John Hancock, a boozing, vulgar, misunderstood superhero living a life of solitude in Los Angeles. He tries to do the right thing but usually every heroic save also creates some horrible damage that leaves him continually shunned by the public. Not that he cares. A life of being the only one of his kind has given him a tough demeanor and a thick skin, but then he saves the life of a PR man named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Ray is eternally grateful and offers to take up Hancock as his client to the chagrin of Ray's wife (Charlize Theron), who believes Hancock can't be fixed.Every once in a while a movie comes along that I can only describe asnice. I wish it were better but I admired it for trying to do something new and felt there were some good scattered moments in a sadly unpleasing whole. The movie is at its most entertaining when Hancock is being an asshole, flying through the air with a whiskey bottle in hand, toying with a car full of criminals, or throwing a washed up whale back in the ocean or a little kid far into the air. It's funny stuff, as is a prison fight that ends with a guy's head up another guys ass.But the movie is really just a half-formed idea. Hancock's origin story is meager and forgettable and his vulnerabilities are lacking. There's no tension in anything that's happening because everything just seems like a cake walk to Hancock. He easily thwarts bank robberies and saves people in distress but that's really it. You want to see him go up against incredible odds or a super villain but the closest thing to is some one-dimensional thug bent on revenge. The screenplay, by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, seems so desperate to create real drama that it introduces a superhero wife for Hancock and then manufactures some lame excuse for why she is the worse thing for him. It all leads to an ending that turns depressingly talky, uninteresting, and just leaves a lot of loose ends.The special effects are serviceable. Hancock flies. Hancock throws people and things up in the air. He lands with a ground-breaking thud. Just where is the wow factor? This movie cost over $100 million dollars to make but there is nothing cool that stands out or shows any kind of ingenuity on the part of the filmmakers. I said it earlier but Will Smith is the best thing this movie has. He's a charismatic guy who knows how to make a surly, unlikable character seem like he has a soul under all the glum boozing. His performance reminded me of Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in ""Iron Man,"" though the material was 100 times better with Downey. Bateman isn't given much to do here and even though it's good to see Theron playing sexy again for a change, she spends most of the movie giving off an iciness which is pretty off-putting.There is going to be speculation that all the edits to bring the movie down to a PG-13 is the reason behind ""Hancock's"" flaws. It could very well be the reason why this movie feels more like an idea than an actual fleshed-out screenplay. It's tame when it should be super. And yet the movie sort of works when it's having fun with the character. So I was torn between recommending or not and all I can really say is.. it's nice.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The first question being: did it waste my time? For Hancock, the answer is no it did not.The story of Hancock is very simple overall, though the concept is interesting and there is a small twist which keeps the 2nd half of the movie from dragging and makes the overall movie more interesting. But I must emphasize that the story is extremely simple. The trailer gives it all except for the twist, which I won't post about as that would be a spoiler. Super-powered individual, is a drunk and not very good at it. Along comes PR man who helps him. The twist doesn't make the story any more complicated but it helps fill the hour and a half.The second question is: did it waste my money? For me, the answer is no. For you, depends... A lot of you pay an arm and a leg to see a movie. I don't understand why you put up with it, but that's another topic. I do not pay much for movies and I get digital projection, digital knock-your-socks-off surround sound and reserved seating in seats with leg room, ample padding and that recline. In that context this movie did not waste my money.This movie is entertaining in that sit back, turn your mind off and watch a movie way. It had laughs, limited but nice effects, eye candy and a simple but engaging enough story that I didn't check my watch once. There was no excitement, though, and nothing to set your pulse racing. Some people commented that this movie was lacking a villain. That is a valid point but I am not sure if a villain wouldn't have made it much worse. The charm of this movie was in its well done simplicity and a super bad guy might have tipped it into the bad, run-of-the-mill superhero movie category.A big part of what makes this movie entertaining is Will Smith. I almost hate to say it, as that guy has grown so arrogant that its a big turn off. However, he does have a way with the comedy and a charm that pulls you into a character. Both of which were key to making this movie entertaining, and he delivered.The last question is: should you see it? I would say it depends on if you are in the mood to be lightly entertained and you like Will Smith. If you're looking for a great movie experience, this is not it. If you're looking for a roller coaster ride, this is not it. If you hate Will Smith, you're going to hate this movie. If you've got time/money to kill or going to see this movie drunk or in an altered state, yeah go see it. Otherwise, you will probably enjoy it more at home for the price of a rental or the bandwidth time of your broadband.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Don't go to Hancock thinking you are seeing another Superman, Fantastic 4, Ironman or Hulk. The superhero angle is treated much differently here. I think part of the perception problem with this film is from the silly trailers we have seen for the last 6 months. Those trailers represent a small part a movie that is so much more to than a drunken superhero throwing a whale at a boat, swearing at a kid or wrecking the city. Sure, there are laughs in this movie, but it's Will Smith! He's FUNNY! Go see Hancock because it's DIFFERENT from the mega-budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ironman and The Hulk. But Hancock is not a movie that will have comic book geeks arguing on message boards about how the movie left so much out and the character was nothing like the comic. It is a film with a story that happens to be about a guy with super powers. Besides, it's got Will Smith and Charlize Theron in it!

"6","/10","Tonight, He ComesHancock","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1899856/?ref_=tt_urv","jaredmobarak","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2020154/?ref_=tt_urv","26 June 2008","Hancock has the kind of premise that you wonder why it took so long for someone to put it on the big screen. With the plethora of comic book movies coming to cinemas this decade, it was only a matter of time before we were given a tale of a washed up superhero, drunk and lonely, being berated for his destruction rather than praised for his bravery. Alan Moore delved into this realm with his graphic novel Watchmen, (for which it seems Zach Snyder has not massacred turning it into a film itself), and Pixar's The Incredibles touched a bit on the subject with the disbanding of heroes by the government, however, here is something different. This guy doesn't hide his identity or pretend he is something he's not. No, he lets it all out on the line and most of it is unflattering and just plain rude. Jaded from the lack of respect he receives, John Hancock finds that he'd rather wallow away in solitude than try and make people like him. Sure he will still go out and help where he can, while making 9 billion dollars worth of damage, but when he's done, it's back to the bar and the bottle, his only friends in the world.All that changes with a chance meeting of a down-on-his-luck public relations man. Caught a second from death as a train barrels down on his car, Hancock swoops in and saves his life, while harming many others in the process. Seeing an opportunity to get back into the big leagues, Ray Embrey decides to make his hero his new client. By having this freak of nature turn himself into authorities for the warrant out for his arrest due to the multiple fines and disturbing the peace charges, Ray thinks that a little time away from the city will show the people how much they need him. While incarcerated, crime goes up 30% in just five days, people start to worry as the criminals begin to feel invincible, and, to top it all off, Hancock gets a little quiet time to himself so that he can rework his image. Dealing with anger issues and alcoholism on the inside, Ray also begins to work on his personality, turning him into a civil person, or at least as close as he can get, (when you see Hancock's smile for the camera, you'll understand what I mean). Once the city comes a calling, his rebirth will allow him to be ready to take control as someone the public can trust, rather than hate.Ripe for comedy, the fact that Ray is played by the immensely talented Jason Bateman and Hancock by Will Smith, the film delivers on the funny. I always assume when Bateman gets on a roll that a lot is improvised, and once again I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case here. The two build a fantastic rapport and the sarcastic wit flies back and forth. What is refreshing amidst this comic bent we expect is how good Smith is as the jerk. This guy has made a name for himself as the blockbuster hero, modest and heroic to a fault, never showing a selfish bone in his body. Here, however, he is egotistical, self-absorbed, and downright mean. It's like how I felt watching Russell Crowe chew the scenery in 3:10 to Yuma, watching a great actor play against type is like discovering them all over again. Smith is one of the best out there and he doesn't disappoint.As a whole, it really is just about these two guys, becoming business partners and friends as they ride the waves to success. I don't want to leave the rest of the cast behind, though, and must make mention of Charlize Theron. After reading an early synopsis, when the film was still titled Tonight, He Comes, I had her character pegged into a certain place. I was completely wrong and surprised to see where her role goes as she plays a very crucial part to the story. I will admit to never really getting all the hype around her, (no I have not seen Monster yet, it'll happen eventually), but she is very solid here as usual, I don't dislike her, I just don't see the unending praise. Also, like every Peter Berg film of late, this thing is chock full of cameos, (you'll even see the director himself, hearkening back to his ""Chicago Hope"" days in a split second scene). I mean, when you get director pal Michael Mann and writer Akiva Goldsman to poke fun at themselves in a board meeting, you know this guy enjoys what he does and invites his friends along for the ride.Despite all that works for it, the film doesn't quite do its premise service. If the writers would have stuck to the comedy element and continued on that path, I think the story would have benefited. Instead, Hancock attempts to be bigger then it is. Without any real villain to root against, (the only bad guy is actually Hancock himself as he tries to turn his life around), there isn't really anything to create a worthwhile climax with weight. Instead we are shown a chance coincidence and how the stakes of that event hold the lives of two of our leads in the balance. The situation wants to be dramatichence the slow-mo visualsbut ultimately becomes a bit out of place if not obvious. It all works OK, though, mostly because the film itself is very slight and devoid of true plot. The evolution of Hancock is a rapid one and at barely an hour and a half, there's not much room for more depth. The laughs are big, however, and the film entertaining, so as a popcorn summer tent-pole, Smith will most definitely deliver some big numbers, even though he's going against that cute little Pixar robot.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

The audiences are too stupid to know what weak film-making is. Berg's shaky, hand-held (and shifting focus) style is emblematic of a director walking on to the set with no idea what he's going to shoot. Just keep the cameras moving and try to pass it off as a ""style"". This technique is (over)used in the last few years, especially in action scenes to the point where now, it doesn't seem to matter if you can tell what's happening in a scene as long as you know a lot of 'stuff' is going on. To use this same technique in a boardroom where people are sitting around talking, just pulls you out of the films and asking yourself ""what the hell is THAT about?"" The same lazy, sloppy style was used in ""Constand Gardner"", another film that suffered from for the ignornance of not realizing that this technique can sometimes work in scenes of intense energy, angst or action...but doesn't play in others. If you're thinking about the direction, the director has failed...and Berg failed through most of the movie on this one.","34 out of 56 found this helpful.

Actor/Director Peter Berg does a good job of bringing this movie to the big screen with cool special effects, some intense action, and humor but the film overall could've been better. The special effects and the action sequences are well executed but unfortunately none of them stand out. I really wanted to like this movie which I did but there were something things that weren't the greatest. Some of the surprises I saw coming and the film lacked a villain who posed as a real threat to Will Smith's Hancock. There's one the movie but his character isn't that interesting just your average criminal who lacks screen time, development, and dialogue. Smith does a solid job in the title role playing a man with powers who doesn't want to be a superhero and is looking for answers to his mysterious past. Charlize Theron is good as always as Mary Embrey who looks at Hanock as if they've met before and has a big secret of her own. Jason Bateman is funny as Mary's husband Ray who is saved by Hancock and tries to help him change his image so that people will respect him. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but none of them have much to do. As mentioned before the special effects are cool but some of them aren't the greatest either because you know most of what you're seeing was done in a computer. Overall though Hanock is worth seeing because of the impressive performances by the cast who make it with your time. If you're a fan of Will Smith or you're just looking for a movie with some action and humor you can't go wrong with Hancock. If you can't get past it's flaws Hanock makes for a somewhat entertaining movie to watch.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first half of the film is no where near perfect but is fairly interesting with amazing special effects and funny one-liners. But as the so called plot twist happens, the story diverts into this crazy pile of confusion. In addition to that I had to suffer Peter Berg's wacky way of directing. I am talking about the close-up shots. One or two is okay. But when it is in every other scene and it is so that I can count how many zits are on the characters faces, that becomes unbearable and annoying.

Sure, there was humor to the plot that was introduced (a down-and-out type with Superman-ish powers and an image problem because he keeps screwing up) but I thought the character development was decent for a quick new superhero story, and I also liked the love story element. The hero's weakness was I thought a ""good"" one (it made me think a bit), and the love story aspect to the movie was something that worked OK I thought.There were values championed here that I didn't entirely agree with. The whole generic off-the-shelf anti-profit save-the-world-through-charity theme didn't seem to find enough contrast, I thought, though there was maybe a ""tiny"" bit. Still, some of us are accustomed at this point to having to overlook that sort of theme in order to find the elements of a story to like and I'm not sure Hollywood writers allow themselves to do many superhero stories that don't have this sort of theme hardwired into the plot whether we like it or not.What they didn't seem to have here was years and decades of comic books upon which to rely for their plot and villain and story-line development and so the movie may seem a bit more sparse than one of the big DC or Marvel Comics or other comic-book-based superhero movies, but I was very good with it, and while it may help really fill up the screen for 2 hours if you are doing a movie about 10-70 years' worth of comics, I suppose it might also weigh it down.I liked Charlize Theron. I'm not sure if it was her role, her look, her acting or the chemistry with the other actors or all four.I give it 8 stars, and would look forward to another installment if Smith and Theron really honestly wanted to do it (i.e.: if it came across as not being just about the money of a part II). I mention further development in part because I thought the basic aspects and powers and weaknesses of the superhero they created were ""not bad at all"" and so there could be other story possibilities.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Whether you like Will Smith or not, this has everything you could ask for.Some notes for consideration: This was a movie that faced some serious adversity from the beginning.The script for this was written in 1996 which makes the film all the more intriguing knowing just how many directors were cycled through before it finally went into production (11 years later!). The title alone started out as ""Tonight, He Comes"" followed by ""John Hancock"" and then simply ""Hancock"". Even the desired rating of PG-13 was a struggle to acquire, as the MPAA had twice already dubbed it ""R"".But after all was said and done, Hancock took the #1 spot after opening weekend with mixed reviews (41% Rotten Tomatoes, 49% Metacritic)! With a production budget of $150 million it brought in $185.6 million after the opening weekend (worldwide, 5 day weekend).Now on to the actual content:The script is refreshing. Not only are there twists throughout, but they are highly unpredictable and start to expose themselves within the first 30 minutes.The cast consists of Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman whom all demonstrate outstanding performances (as one would expect from them). The humor is believable and not overdone, the drama is the perfect amount leaving you laughing and feeling sorrow throughout.As mentioned before, even if you are not a huge Will Smith fan this will surely be something anyone can enjoy. I am quite puzzled by the general consensus here on IMDb but assure you that the film is much better than the rating would infer.----- 8/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Signing off on ""Hancock""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1906123/?ref_=tt_urv","bigstuff2020","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5817363/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2008","Some movies are simply poor ideas put into practice and thus become movies we come to regard as ""bad"". Others are good ideas that are presented to the viewer and are often well-received. Then there's Peter Berg's ""Hancock"", the story of a boozing, loutish, seemingly un-superhero that falls somewhere in between the aforementioned categories.Will Smith plays John Hancock, a superhuman with enhanced abilities in strength, invulnerability, and flight, who, though he tries to save Los Angeles from all sorts of crime, usually ends up costing the city millions of dollars in damages and endangering many people through his alcohol-induced carelessness. When the city's officials decide they have had enough, they issue a warrant for Hancock's arrest. At the behest of Ray (Jason Bateman), a publicist who has been saved by the ""hero"", Hancock enters a county jail to serve his time and prove that the city actually needs him. With Ray regularly consulting him on his public appearance and the city's crime rate rising at an astonishing 30 percent over a two week time span, Hancock emerges from jail by request of the captain of the LAPD to once again the city safe.With these pieces set into place with plenty of humor sprinkled throughout the movie, I was convinced that critics were simply being stuck up in their reviews - true to form, many critics poorly rate movies they deem to be below them. However, the plot actually takes a turn for the worse in trying to trace the path of Hancock's origin and also build his romance with Ray's wife Mary, played by Charlize Theron. While the first half of the film had been very much enjoyable, the last half hour or so drags, with the comedy running sparse and the storyline running thin. In the end, ""Hancock"" is less likable due to it's poor execution in the second half, and I found myself in the same situation as many critics - disappointed.And thus, I return to my initial point; ""Hancock"" is not bad idea for a film - in fact, it has the potential to work as a great action comedy - but it falls short of the expectations many would hold for it by falling somewhere in between ""good"" and ""bad"".","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" and those who enjoy Will Smith.","158 out of 291 found this helpful.

Nah. Best Will Smith movie? Nah. However, it is a good, solid film with a bit of a different look at the superhero genre. I find it very interesting that it is so obvious that the gathered masses cannot simply enjoy that. Hell, it was hugely more enjoyable than Watchmen, which I gave away after one viewing.Frankly, I think that IMDb falls flat reviewing this film. Their outlook is pretty unoriginal. Their storyline is badly written at best as well. Also, how they could not add ""comedy"" as a genre keyword for this film mystifies me. I could go on for quite a while, but I want to concentrate on one part for a moment: But what interests me most is that IMDb threatens users with being permanently blacklisted {""If you write a spoiler without warning readers, your name will be added to a blacklist and all your future reviews will be discarded automatically and unread.""}. Why, then, have they dropped a spoiler as the tagline? I tried out this movie on the recommendation of a friend, not knowing much more than that this fellow sounded like a nasty, alcoholic ""Greatest American Hero"" who happened to be black. I was happy enough to sit down and chuckle through that.Then I checked the page for a piece of trivia, and saw that tagline and crappy storyline. IMDb had me shaking my head every five minutes going ""Ah, crap, when is going to have an affair with the guy's wife -- he would be such an ass, and the husband really loves his wife..."" Give this film a chance, boys and girls. There's a bit more out there than what you've been led to believe, spoilers and all.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","A superhero movie for people who hate superhero movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4963021/?ref_=tt_urv","rooprect","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2904674/?ref_=tt_urv","27 June 2019","Browsing the most popular reviews for this flick, I see most of them criticize ""Hancock"" for not having enough action, not enough cgi, not having a super villain, or my favorite: getting too philosophical. See, this is why Hollywood keeps cranking out brainless superhero flicks; they know that the target audience doesn't want to be challenged with something completely different.I suppose ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" would've gotten the same treatment by imdb reviewers if imdb existed back in 1968 when the core scifi market demanded laser beams, monster suits, buxom babes in distress and loud things in space.""Hancock"" does to the superhero genre what ""2001"" did to scifi. It made things real. Sure, Hancock zips through the sky like Superman on crack, but the point is that Hancock (played by Will Smith) is an ordinary schmuck like you or me, except that he happens to have super powers. Even worse, he has the world's worst case of idgaf, and this leads to a lot of stuff getting broken, bent and blown up unnecessarily. As a result, people hate him.Right there is the all the plot you need. You don't need a contrived super villain just because that's the formula. You don't need nonstop action and dazzling cgi to tell this story. This is because Hancock's enemy is himself.""Hancock"" could easily have been a heavy, brooding drama like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" or anything dealing with self-hatred, addiction or depression. BUT, this is the movie's charm, instead it's done very light-heartedly, with lots of zingers, funny sight gags and a quirky dysfunctional romance angle. And of course superhero powers. And so, this heavy story ends up being fun and entertaining, even breezy. But the more you think about it, there's a lot under the surface.So, as my title says, if you're not a fan of most superhero flicks, the kind with a clean good vs. evil template peppered with zippy action scenes and cgi, then give ""Hancock"" a look. There aren't a lot of movies like this, definitely not many mainstream ones, but I'd put it in the same category as ""Special"" with Michael Rappaport playing a total loser who develops bizarre super powers. On the more disturbing side there's ""Super"" with Rainn Wilson who takes his vigilante superhero efforts a bit too far. These are all deep films under the candy exterior of ""superhero flick"".","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It takes the side of a superhero in a darker, comedic, adult version, and almost more realistic/relate-able side. It shows that even superheros aren't perfect which is honestly a great idea and great side to show. Hancock is basically a non-perfect superman. He has a drinking problem, doesn't care what people think of him, and has personal issues. This allows normal people like us to relate to someone who basically is an all powerful God, and lowers him down to be more on a human level, which again is refreshing and key word: DIFFERENT! After watching other cheesy, totally unfathomable, even for superhero movies, its takes a different viewpoint on what problems a superhero could face if they were in fact real, which gives it a more realistic feel to it. Will Smith also is great, hands down greatest actor of all time and if you don't agree....don't watch movies. He can play any role. But OK i will admit at the end it got kind of weird and I had my doubts because of the story that unfolds, but then when I saw the great acting and how much pain and sadness you could feel while watch Will and Charlize Theron, who have great chemistry together rooting from the Legend of Bagger Vance, it immediately took away my doubts and took the movie for what it is. The producers had a goal and accomplished it. This movie is very good but by no means great. Its very funny at times and very dramatic at times using realistic viewpoints in a very unrealistic world.

It's a serious take on a dysfunctional superhero that isn't based upon a Marvel Comics or DC Comics character. The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers, but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the ""Powers That Be"" comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the ""Shadow State"" comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more.Will Smith and Charlize Theron do a great job. The hero is flawed, but he's not a wimp. The movie's biggest weakness is the pacing. Some of the special effects go by so fast that you don't get to appreciate them. Some of the drama plays out so slowly that you might be wondering why they don't rush it along. The movie is faithful to the trailer. It's tough writing a spoiler-free review of this since there are some great twists in the plot.","128 out of 238 found this helpful.

I think this clever send-up of superhero films should have come out later, when it could have been a commentary/satire of the now very played out superhero film. This story has Will Smith as an grungy, alcoholic superhero who will fly in to save the day for various situations, but does so drunkenly, haphazardly, and always with wild amounts of property damage. That is until he saves the life of PR man Jason Bateman who offers to help Hancock with an image makeover. It's a clever script by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, from an earlier script by Vincent Ngo, though at it's heart it's still a lightweight summer comedy. Smith and Bateman are both quite likable, and Charlize Theron is good, though underused, as Bateman's wife. Directed by Peter Berg, who did the terrific movie and TV versions of ""Friday Night Lights,"" but who also the insipid board game film adaptation ""Battleship,"" delivers solid action and likable characters, which is better than you get in most summer blockbuster films.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was called Hancock, a film about an alcoholic superhero played by Will Smith. A bundle of laughs? NOThe film follows the path of a rude, disgusting, irritating superhero called John Hancock (Will Smith). The public hate him; he causes millions of ""dollars"" worth of damage, is a drunk and makes constantly obscene comments about people. But one day he happens to save the life of a PR Guru (Jason Bateman) and is offered a chance to save his image. This starts of his avid career as a superhero. Until a chance encounter causes the film to dive bomb into the realms of beyond crap.It slots perfectly into the genre of comedy, action, superhero, adventure, romance, sci-fi, fantasy and crime. Though this great mixture of genres usually benefits films, with Hancock it just doesn't work. The film jumps between the various genres so quickly that you never have the actual time to register what's happening and whether the scene is meant to be sarcastic or sentimental. The style changes drastically too; between sad violin music and the latest chart hip-hop; between big set action pieces and amusing family dinners. This attempt at appealing to everybody fails miserably.Personally I would recommend this film to people who have nothing better to do with their time then watch Will Smith throw cars around and make obscenely offensive comments about people. This is not a family film due to the crude remarks, excessive language and unnecessary violence; basically if you showed it to your grandma she would have a heart attack and spend the rest of her life in hospital only able to move the big toe of her left foot.The acting in it is frankly amateur (or should I say appalling). None of the actors seam to like what they are doing- they don't even seam to be trying- they're just acting normally. The producers have obviously tried very hard to get people to hate Will Smith and it works- he is possibly the most unlikeable character in the whole film. British actor Eddie Marsan plays the ""bad guy"" Red, he is acceptable apart the slightly dodgy attempt at an American accent. Not Good. If I was being nice I would say that Will Smith shows quite a good performance as the disgusting superhero, then I look through his previous films and realise that all his characters are basically the same. Only for really die-hard fans.The special effects are disappointing especially when he attempts to land on a pavement in front of some guys house. You feel as if you are watching a 1963 Batman film before they had discovered the wonders of CGI. In fact the CGI is so disappointing it's actually hilarious especially at the end, when you just really want somebody to die, but they just carry on throwing tea urns and hospital beds around while a giant CGI'd thunderstorm rages outside the window- not a good look.In comparison to other films in the genre of Superhero/Comedy it looks terrible. Take Hellboy for instance; the tongue in cheek humour of Guillermo Del Toro combined with the great fantasy creatures in the style of Pans Labyrinth and sarcastic superhero, the film does a really great job. However next to Hellboy the film Hancock just looks more annoyingly, terribly, irritatingly amateur. If you're looking for a decent superhero film with laughs see Hellboy, if you're looking for a dark, chilling superhero film see The Dark Knight and if you're looking for a boring, arrogant, overdone superhero film see Hancock.Overall this film is possibly the worst superhero film of the summer. Only see it if you have to.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

I felt so odd... I did not know who Hancock was, and I had an odd impression maybe because I got used to the way how other such type of movies were created (Iron Man, Superman...). I do think that the crew HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB, but I feel it could have been better if instead of Charlize Theron there would be another actress. IMHO, she has a talent, but in this role she has been too... impersonal...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

There might have been a serious fly in that ointment but rest assured if Smith pulled it off then we'd have the greatest acting performance in the history of cinema . As it turned out this wasn't in fact what HANCOCK was about and concerned itself with a burned out super-hero . One wonders if studios should put a bit more thinking in to film titles ? After all can anyone remember that sci-fi epic called JOHN CARTER ? Not really a title you equate with sci-fi As it turns out I thought HANCOCK might be the sort of super-hero to appeal to someone like me and that is someone who doesn't the avalanche of films featuring Marvel comic book characters and the like . A burned out hero with super powers and a drink problem finds himself unable to care about the world about him . Not a premise you see every day and one that is original . It also deserves some credit for a lack of post-modernism and any temptation to include references to the likes of Bruce Wayne , Peter Parker and Clark Kent has been curtailed . If you're going in to this film thinking it's an extension or at least inspired by the comic book blockbusters that were coming out at the same time then that's what you're going to get . After seeing the movie I'm not entirely sure what I got There's a very strange and often uneven tone to the movie . Peter Berg has a bizarre directorial technique where the camera zooms in and out of the action in a hap hazard way . Some scenes are played totally straight and serious and then there's a big set piece done in a manner done in a manners that apes the films it's giving the impression it's not trying to be . It also seems to contain a bit too many ideas for its own good which has led to a lot of comments here that HANCOCK is a bit of a mess . I don't totally disagree with this view but as someone who feels the need to once again state that there's far too many movies about super-heroes I did enjoy this movie to a limited extent though I find it very difficult to explain why","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Having everyone hate you is just the forte of being Hancock (Will Smith). While most of society may not like him, he coasts through an existence as an unemployed, homeless man with superhuman capabilities. Unlike conventional movies, Hancock is a hero with an attitude. He may not act with justice at times, but it does not take away the heart that rests inside. Why then would I give this a five then? Well mainly, because of the twist. At first the story line appeared to be heading in a nice and pleasant direction, but the fatal twist halfway made me think differently. I suspect that the writers wrote it to provide complexity, but I just felt it was unnecessary. Overall though, it had a unique storyline and was truly one of a kind. Even though I did not find the twist satisfying, I believe that it is still worth the watch for most of it. With or without doubts I say go out and watch it and be the judge of what you see.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

That said, I just can tell you my opinion about this movie: it sucks! But it sucks so badly! Aside from some nice jokes and some cool special effects, this movie has nothing interesting to offer! The plot is pathetic and gets even worse when it starts being melodramatic. The characters are laughable and absurd, even for a Super Hero movie, and if it's true that a Super Hero film can be entertaining, at least for the action or the jokes, this one completely spoils these two positive features with a completely absurd and melodramatic plot! And that ending, Oh my God, that was definitely too bad!

Thats Hancock for all of you!. This is a brand new super hero with a twisted mind and weird lifestyle. Its really good to see some one not coming out of a comic book as an adaptation. So, all you other super heroes get aside...here comes the Hancock.What is interesting about this movie is that none of the promotions were focused on highlighting any of his heroic side. A hero is some one who fights for justice and his people but here, nothing like that. That triggered lot of excitement and a new set of fan-following for this super hero. Well, I'm also one of them! I admit I am a big fan of Will Smith as an actor and as a person but this is primarily because he is a real hard working, dedicated and confident individual. A hero in reality. The best part about Willie is that you really see and feel the efforts he is putting into his work.Like any other super hero movie, this is not about fighting with a super villain and his mission to conquer the world but self exploring of an individual with extra powers. And thats why I like this movie. Something different. The director and script writer has done a good job narrating it. Movie is technically very advanced with some amazing special effects like Willie throwing the whale back in to the water, catching some junkies who have stolen money from a bank, all his flying scenes, stopping the train and fighting with Charlize Theron.The story starts with scenes about how Willie's boozing all day, catching some freaks, and how people of the city hate him. He is least bothered about any one, not even him self. Story takes a twist when he saved life of a PR guy. This PR guy has nothing exciting in his professional life and trying hard to make a good life with his wife (Charlize Theron) and son. This whole incident of Hancock saving his life hits him with an idea to do a makeover of Hancock. From bad to good, from stubborn to be humble and kind to others, from 'who cares' to 'I care'. Watching this whole shift is the most interesting part of the movie. How he convinces Willie to go for a surrender to police and Willie's inner fight to stay in the custody with out using his powers and how he eventually takes on the role of Hancock- the savior. It's sheer fun watching it all that happening in front of you.Well, there are some instances where I feel Hancock, as a movie, lacks that 100% punch. You think of Superman, Spiderman, Batman or any other super hero and what comes first to your mind is the image of that hero with a unique background score. In case of Hancock, there is no such theme song and that's something the producers could've have done it. Hancock is a new super hero, never thought of, never ever imagined. He has a different style with unexpected attitude and a theme song or a special background music would have helped in establishing a strong image of Hancock in to audiences mind. As I said earlier, its not about fighting with a super villain but still I wanted to see more actions and stunts. Sorry, I can't help it! But its a super hero anyways and everybody likes to see his or her super hero doing loads of action scenes. The movie is brilliantly executed till the climax comes. The reason and explanation of who is Hancock and what relates him with Charlize Theron is just too fast for the audience. Director could have taken little more time in explaining all this by providing more meat and content. Especially when you know that its all about exploring the inner you and what are you made of. This thing is very tricky and how you handle it and explain all this to audience is a real challenge. The name-Hancock, is also bit strange and totally unwanted. I couldn't believe it when I heard this name for the first time! Why Hancock? try something more edgy with more substance loaded with some punch.It's a sheer excitement watching Willie as a super hero and joining the league of Batman and Superman. You will always get appreciation on doing new things with lot of hard work and ideas put into your work. Same with Hancock. Audience have liked Hancock and his fan-following will grow day by day to give much needed hype for his second stint on 70mm silver screen. Just to add, Willie almost looks like Paresh Rawal (One of India's greatest character artists) in the poster where they are showing a close-up of Hancock's face wearing dark sun-glasses. Its like Babu Bhai of Hera-Pheri wearing shades instead of his typical glasses!! For those who do not know who is Babu Bhai, suggest you should watch a movie called 'Hera-Pheri' with subtitles. In the end, here's a big round of applause on behalf of all Willie fans waiting arms wide open to give him one tight hug! Welcome on board Hancock.","18 out of 31 found this helpful.

Maybe on a paper it all makes sense but choosing Will as main actor, that is where things went wrong. Heck Will acts same in every movie. That separates good actors from bad ones in a first place. If you wish to explore new concept in a movie you have to bring in actor that can carry that concept damn excellent, otherwise it will just ruin it like in this movie.To be fair Will is not only thing wrong here.

Expectation was quite high having seen the trailers.The premise behind the film certainly had enough promise and potential. It had a ""something new"" and fresh appeal to it. We also had arguable the biggest box office star going attached to the films title character, so it surely going to be an awesome spectacle and the hit of the summer.Well I can't quite comment wither or not the film will be the box office smash of the year, but I certainly can state in my opinion that it AIN'T the ""awesome spectacle"" I initially thought it could be. So what went wrong?The film has no soul, from the very start to the ending credits the film feels empty. No emotion attached to the project, no feeling of awe. Can't quite put my finger on the spot but something major was lacking in the movie experience for the viewer regarding the overall feel of the flick.No character arc's worth mentioning, I know we are supposed to not be that keen on the Hancock character, but there must be something in the character that we will grow to love. There ain't, Hancock has an effect flat-line arc. This is exactly the same with the other major players in the movie. Nobody gets developed fully or even slightly throughout the rather short 90 minutes or so running time.The score was also terrible, from start to end.The Superhero back story again was extremely weak.Villains were so weak, we didn't really need anybody with super-powers to deal with them.The first half or so of the movie was at least enjoyable popcorn fun, but the latter half was particularly weak. When the film became ""serious"" when the drama kicked off the film just became severely lost. It lost structure, it didn't know what genre it wanted to be, action, drama, continued comedy or suspense. Unfortunately for the viewer it was none of them so just became pointless and irritating. They really should have padded out the idea of the first 45 minutes with some more evolved ideas from the part of the story and we might well have had a good movie. Unfortunately they didn't and they padded the film out with a tangent story-line that made no coherence or sense.There are positives, Will Smith for what he had to play with was as usual entertaining to watch. The Jason Bateman character was likable and also enjoyable to watch, well up until the third act when he frittered away to a cardboard cutout. Special effects were more than adequate, and at times quite spectacular. There was also a few laugh out loud moments, particularly the Youtube scenes.Overall this film had so much potential, this movie could have and should have been great, but unfortunately it was very poorly handled and executed. The blame must fall down to the direction, and script.Half marks, 5/10 Worth going to see.......just.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

He's a drunk, hated by everyone for the damage he causes and is being sued. However, when he rescues PR man Ray Embrey, Embrey takes it upon himself to make Hancock popular with the population, despite resistance from Hancock himself, and Ray's wife Mary...Hancock has an interesting idea but the problem with it, is it can't sustain the entire movie. Partly this is also due to the fact that the part of heroes being unpopular with the people, and being sued for the damage, was better used in the Pixar movie, The Incredibles. So the idea doesn't quite carry the movie. As a result, a second plot thread is introduced. I won't reveal it here, but when it happens, you get the feeling the filmmakers needed something to keep the movie moving, but it's too contrived and doesn't really work, and is also never really resolved.Hancock's other main fault is that the so-called villains of the movie, aren't really that threatening. So any dramatic edge is lost in the climax of the movie. What also doesn't help is that it can't decide on what it is. The first half of the movie is pretty funny. The second half more dramatic. It's like they changed their minds about what kind of movie they were making halfway through.But it's not a total loss. Thanks to excellent performances from Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron and helped by an okay script from Vince Gillian and Vincent Ngo it is funny (especially in the first half of the movie). And director Peter Berg does well with the material.The visuals are pretty good, if not spectacular, and the movie runs at a good pace. I just wish they could have decided which way to take it.Is it a comedy? A summer action movie? Superhero spoof? By trying to be all things, it ends up being a bit confused, and it suffers as a result.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can believe it, as the movie feels sort of erratic and can't seem to keep its focus. The film follows the title character, an alcoholic (and generally unloved) superhero in Los Angeles who is more famous for his careless destruction than his heroic acts. After saving the life of a public relations representative, Hancock begins to refine his image in hopes of becoming the hero the city needs.At least, that's what the first half of the movie is about. If the entire movie had focused on this one storyline and fleshed it out more, I think it would've been a vast improvement. Instead, the movie completely shifts gears halfway through into a story about Hancock's origins and how it's come to affect his life and those he's met. Rather than making two good movies out of these elements, the filmmakers opted to make one decent (though mediocre) movie with everything crammed into a little more than 90 minutes. It also seemed as if the movie couldn't decide on whether it wanted to be a light-hearted, fun superhero flick or a deeper, emotional drama about seeking acceptance. In short, the film feels inconsistent in content and the most enjoyable elements are the few action scenes and the performances of the main cast.Of course, Will Smith was a great lead for the film (as has come to be expected). The man's over-loaded with charisma and you can't help but love his character, even when the character is as reckless and resentful as Hancock. Even with such an average movie, Smith manages to shine through. Jason Bateman is Ray Embrey, the PR agent who makes it his mission to help Hancock become a real hero; he was an ample supporting player to Smith and brought a kind-hearted naivety to his role. Personally, my favorite performance in the film was Charlize Theron as Mary, Ray's wife. I won't say much about her character because it falls too easily into spoiler-territory but I thought she was great (especially in the final act of the film).Plot and pacing issues aside, this film does manage to entertain. It has a tendency to drag in some moments but the cast keep the whole movie afloat. While there aren't a whole lot of action scenes, the few that exist are great. It's worth a viewing though don't go out of your way for this Will Smith summer action flick.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not that it looked like it was going to be fantastic and wasn't. No, the problem is that it was fantastic for about forty minutes, and then it became derailed so completely that it absolutely ruined all of my enjoyment. Will Smith, the king of the Forth of July, stars as a superhero. The gimmick: he's a screw-up and a drunk, and his heroic actions generally cause far more collateral damage than the actual problem he's trying to solve. The public hates him. One day he meets a down-on-his-luck PR expert (Jason Bateman) who has some ideas on how he can improve his image. It's a great premise, but the first thought you might have is, can they stretch it out to at least 90 minutes without breaking it? I honestly think the answer is yes, they could have. Their answer is, no, let's throw in an insanely idiotic twist that changes the film from a hilarious action-comedy to a dark, romantic superhero picture. I knew as soon as I saw Charlize Theron in the film that they were saving her character for some big twist, as the advertisements for the movie didn't include a single shot of her. You don't hire an actress that big and not give her something important to do. They had something so great here. The first half of it had me laughing out loud frequently. I've been waiting for Hollywood to skewer superhero movies intelligently ever since Batman Begins, where Batman's chase with the police causes millions of dollars of damage. I know it was pretty much universally hated, but My Super Ex-Girlfriend covered similar territory and, while it was never great, it didn't screw up anywhere near as royally as Hancock did.","19 out of 34 found this helpful.

Starring Will Smith as John Hancock, an apathetic and often drunk superhero, the film explores themes of redemption and identity. Hancock's reckless behavior and public disdain set the stage for an intriguing character arc.The film's first half is engaging, driven by Smith's charismatic performance and the humor derived from Hancock's unorthodox approach to heroism. Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman also deliver solid performances, adding depth to the story.However, the movie falters in its second half. The shift in tone and the introduction of a complex backstory feel rushed and underdeveloped, leading to a somewhat disjointed narrative. The film struggles to balance its comedic and dramatic elements, resulting in an uneven viewing experience.While ""Hancock"" offers a unique premise and strong performances, it ultimately falls short of its potential. It's an entertaining watch, but its inconsistent execution prevents it from being a standout in the superhero genre.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Could Have Been Better, But Still Quite Entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3660625/?ref_=tt_urv","zkonedog","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7826013/?ref_=tt_urv","12 March 2017","The basic premise of this film is a fascinating one that really has never been explored in mainstream films: what happens when a bona fide superhero ends up being more trouble than he is worth? This is exactly the case with Will Smith's Hancock, who (although saving lives) also wreaks tremendous damage to the city and is a dirty, stinking alcoholic. Thus, the ""hook"" of this film involves Hancock trying to rehab his sullen, non-caring image after meeting a PR consultant on one of his ""rescue"" missions.What works in this film is the theme of ""superhero gone bad"". Coming on the heels of ""The Dark Knight"", which really toyed with the definitions of heroes and villains, ""Hancock"" takes that theme to a whole new level, as he is a terrible person in every way besides the fact that he saves a few lives every once in awhile. Thus, the most entertaining portions of this film occur as Hancock tries to learn the delicate balance between being a role model and still being ""cool"" at the same time. Early in the movie, Hancock's loneliness is so readily observed that one can believe he will try anything to gain some respect or friendships.On the other hand, I thought that the reveal of where Hancock is actually from was a bit lacking. The build-up to his origins are fantastic (as his scattered memories contribute mightily to his apathy towards being ""good""), but the reveal leaves much to be desired. In all honesty, I still don't exactly know what/who Hancock is with much certainty. More fleshing out of that angle of the storyline may have pushed this film to a five-star rating from me.Overall, Hancock is a very entertaining movie...and really, what more can you ask for?! Despite being a bit lacking in Hancock's character history, the film DOES provide some great action scenes, multiple moments of comedy, and an original storyline that will make you personally feel for the tormented ""superhero"".","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now the movie had an intriguing premise of a superhero that's not adored for his actions because of their destructive nature but it's not really a premise that's out of a superhero fans thought process. It had a pretty simple story and nothing that really made its plot stand out in any way other than the fact that Charlize Theron's character had powers too (which isn't even a spoiler if you saw the same original trailer I did) and that she claims that there were other super humans in the past but had since died off after pairing up and losing their immortality. But one thing that I wanted to ask the writers and director was, ""Why?"". Because I wanted to know why Hancock didn't care about the collateral damage he was causing. Why Mary (Theron) hated Hancock after he got injured because it's not like he intended to forget her. And she seemed to like him quite a bit before that happened so why now? And as for the criminal who wanted Hancock dead, not a good centered villain since he wasn't there for half of it. And as for all the other idiots who try to shoot Hancock, you think one of them would realize that he's indestructible and others have tried that. But all in all, Hancock is anything spectacular, but it'll get you through part of an afternoon with nothing to do.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

When I finally managed to watch it, I didn't know much about it, apart from it being hopefully a different kind of superhero movie.At first the movie feels refreshingly simpler compared to the epic superhero movies we keep getting. It felt like most of the idea came from how in those epic superhero movies the heroes cause a lot of damage to the city and its people. But as the story goes forward the story does become richer and, even if I hate the word, more epic.It's refreshing to see a character like Hancock. He is like an asshole, clearly an antihero (it's already refreshing not to see a brooding white man antihero, mind you), but there's more to him. And what's important we actually can see how he feels about the people kind of hating him, even if he tries to save them. It's not just superficially shrugged off. I also love how the music is used so well with the story. When the movie becomes more like a superhero movie the soundtrack feels more like a classic score for that type of movies. Hancock is an entertaining and a surprisingly good superhero movie. I think I would've preferred something simpler, something more refreshing, but Hancock is good for what it is. Of course it's a bit typical, but it has several new elements, and it has great cast. And while the story is not great, there are a lot of things I like about it. Hancock definitely is worth seeing whether or not you are tired with the typical Marvel or DC movies we get.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

He is a natural at completely getting into the role of his character. Hancock is portrayed as a likable, funny individual that is looking for a purpose.Jason Bateman's character seemed kind of dry and plain, but he and Will Smith had some on-screen chemistry in a few of the scenes. Charlize Theron did well with her part. Whenever her character met Hancock for the first time, the audience can sense the underlying tension from her, which is a major part in the film.The film was enjoyable, but the movie contained some plot holes that needed to be addressed and further explained. The climax was mediocre, and the villains weren't up to par. They didn't exhibit the typical characteristics of an antihero.Fortunately, the action and comedy in this movie appeals to the viewer. If you want to watch Will Smith fly around and attempt to save the day, then this movie is highly recommended.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The special effects are NOT cheesy (if you want CG cheese, watch any of the blockbuster Spiderman Movies), and the ending DOES NOT spoil the beginning. The flow of events does indeed turn from lighthearted to serious, but that's where the story-line takes us and it does so quite smoothly and logically. All of the characterizations in this movie are spot on and Jason Bateman almost steals the show from Will Smith which is no mean feat since he plays a suit wearing everyday middle of the road nice guy to a booze swilling whale tossing property wrecking Hancock.

Hancock is two movies. The first movie is about an anti hero learning to become superhero, and is by far the better of the two. The second movie is more of an origin story, as we learn more about Hancock's past and he finds out he is not alone. Both parts could have worked well as as stand alone movies, but put together its muffled and uneven.The movie shows all the signs of studio interference and never establishes a clear tone. Hancock only works because of Will Smith, whose performance is stronger than what the movie deserves. Don't get me wrong; I don't hate it, it is sometimes funny, sometimes clever, and occasionally enjoyable. Especially the first 50 minutes.Charline Theron is ok, as is Jason Bateman (who basically just plays the same guy he always plays) One of the problems is the lack of any real villain. Red Parker is just a weasel with a gun and is no real threat.Hancock grossed $227 million at the domestic box office to end 2008 the 4th highest grossing movie of the year.

It had a ""something new"" and fresh appeal to it. We also had arguable the biggest box office star going attached to the films title character, so it surely going to be an awesome spectacle and the hit of the summer.Well I can't quite comment wither or not the film will be the box office smash of the year, but I certainly can state in my opinion that it AIN'T the ""awesome spectacle"" I initially thought it could be. So what went wrong?The film has no soul, from the very start to the ending credits the film feels empty. No emotion attached to the project, no feeling of awe. Can't quite put my finger on the spot but something major was lacking in the movie experience for the viewer regarding the overall feel of the flick.No character arc's worth mentioning, I know we are supposed to not be that keen on the Hancock character, but there must be something in the character that we will grow to love. There ain't, Hancock has an effect flat-line arc. This is exactly the same with the other major players in the movie. Nobody gets developed fully or even slightly throughout the rather short 90 minutes or so running time.The score was also terrible, from start to end.The Superhero back story again was extremely weak.Villains were so weak, we didn't really need anybody with super-powers to deal with them.The first half or so of the movie was at least enjoyable popcorn fun, but the latter half was particularly weak. When the film became ""serious"" when the drama kicked off the film just became severely lost. It lost structure, it didn't know what genre it wanted to be, action, drama, continued comedy or suspense. Unfortunately for the viewer it was none of them so just became pointless and irritating. They really should have padded out the idea of the first 45 minutes with some more evolved ideas from the part of the story and we might well have had a good movie. Unfortunately they didn't and they padded the film out with a tangent story-line that made no coherence or sense.There are positives, Will Smith for what he had to play with was as usual entertaining to watch. The Jason Bateman character was likable and also enjoyable to watch, well up until the third act when he frittered away to a cardboard cutout. Special effects were more than adequate, and at times quite spectacular. There was also a few laugh out loud moments, particularly the Youtube scenes.Overall this film had so much potential, this movie could have and should have been great, but unfortunately it was very poorly handled and executed. The blame must fall down to the direction, and script.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The opening scene with Hancock drunkenly waking up from a bender after a kid informs him of a shootout between cops and Asian gang members during a high speed pursuit sets the tone for the style of crime fighting Hancock undertakes. Before leaving his park bench, he gropes at a random woman and grabs his liquor to go take on the bad guys. He does stop the gang members but not without causing a huge amount of collateral damage to buildings, roads and presumably injuries to people unlucky enough to be caught in his drunken highway showdown. Hancock meets Ray Embry, a corporate image consultant, when he saves Ray from a collision from an oncoming train at a railroad crossing. Hancock tosses Ray's car upside down to get it off the tracks and derails the train as well. Hancock is invited by a grateful Ray back to his house for dinner, where he meets Ray's wife and son. He is slowly convinced by Ray to turn himself into the police to stand trial for the collateral damage caused by his heroics. Hancock goes to a maximum security lockup with the assumption that crime will escalate quickly enough for Los Angeles to want Hancock released. He slowly sobers and is released to help police confront a group of heavily armed bank robbers and rescue a wounded officer. The second act deals with the origin of Hancock's powers and the attempts by one of the former bank robbers and several other inmates placed in jail by Hancock to get revenge. It descends into a maelstrom of CGI-crafted battles and a vague mythological origin to compensate for lack of a decent back story. The idea of a superhero with struggling with alcoholism and rehabilitating his image sounds but this suffers suffers from weak character development and some shoddy acting from Charlize Theron. Will Smith is good as Hancock, but that isn't saying much since he just seems either exhausted/hungover or emotionally distant through most of the movie. Jason Bateman gives a good performance as the nice guy trying to do a friend a favor, and this is considering he's usually the straight guy in these Frat Pack movies lately.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The whole marketing angle of super hero's, think about it!It's such a shame because I feel like we could have really enjoyed exploring this storyline and this whole universe. I thought Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman were great.Anyone who watched this in 08, trust me go back and watch it again.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Lead actors Will Smith and Charlize Theron, a big budget and a good idea should give any Director a good head start, Peter Berg squanders it all in an unimaginative disaster.The script is cliché ridden and formulaic,and the ""happy moon"" ending vomit inducing. In trying to straddle the comedy, action and superhero genres it falls flatly on its ""ass"" (sic). The ""action"" sequences are occasionally quite disturbing for a uk 12a certificate.Now I enjoy my Peckinpah and Tarrantino along with the best. however the convention for this certificate film is that the violence is ""comic book"".The opening sequence of hoodlums spraying a busy freeway, among which are chasing cops, with Uzi sub-machine gun rounds (several hundred a minute)is not Comic strip.The same is true when a Bank is held up and the robbers sprays the busy street with Uzi, heavy calibre machine gun and what looks like an RPG fire.Equally is having women and children wired up to Hamas style explosive vests funny? America has a serious problem with lone young gunmen and random massacres. The naive sanitization of these sequences helps no-one.Supporting actor Jason Bateman looks as uncomfortable as the part is, as part of the ""triangle"" between himself,Theron and Smith. The use of the formers ""child"" for the most excruciating ""kid"" moments are frankly excruciating.The cinema was pretty full, I heard no-one laugh out loud once. the idea of a ""flawed"" superhero is a good one. In the future it has the basis for a good film in the hands of some capable writers and a talented Director.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

While the concept is clever, even with suspension of disbelief there are still an awful lot of plot holes.However, what saves the film are great performances, and a tongue firmly enough in cheek to make a subtle nod to the audience that the film's knows and embraces its own ludicrousness. It then has the balls not to care because the cast are clearly having a lot of fun and as the story moves along there are some very amusing set pieces and some huge laugh out loud moments, the best being Hancock's first run in with some prisoners when he voluntarily surrenders himself to the authorities for his own past misdeeds. Theron is also good value as Bateman's wife, and reason's for the character's guarded personality will reveal themselves as the story progresses, though this plot development ends up being a huge contrivance to help sustain the film's concept as at about the halfway point it begins to run out of steam. In fact the films story then veers off at a tangent and becomes a very different film as the climax is surprisingly grounded and intimate, and at this point the films suddenly, and somewhat out of the blue hits you with a face-full of pathos. Weirdly enough this actually seems to work dramatically and pulls you along to the end of the film, which then signs off with a few more very funny set pieces.Technical credits are first rate, with some impressive and very funny visual effects, provided by a team of companies led by veteran outfit Sony Pictures Imageworks and veteran Oscar winning Supervisor John Dykstra. Editing and music work well for the film and Peter Berg's direction is self-assured and confident enough to allow the film to zip past fast enough for you to almost overlook the plot contrivances and holes. However, the film's original theatrical cut is the much better version, and the directors extended version is notably inferior, particularly early on when scenes are either unnecessary, overtly gross and evenly shockingly disturbing and I am sure would have meant an R rating for the film had it been released. Had this been the original version of the film, it would have made it much more difficult for the audience to empathise with the lead character as some parts of the story in this cut of the film actually turn you off the character in a very big way.In summary then, a silly plot compensated for by a film that is genuinely exciting, funny and for the most part very entertaining.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

What starts off as a really fun superhero comedy turns into an unexpectedly self serious melodrama. Both halves are entertaining even though they don't mesh and that first half in particular has only gotten better since comic book movies really had their moment.It's interesting to see something that is first and foremost a comedy, take the conventions of the genre more seriously than the more straight faced films that succeeded it. Few comic book movies openly acknowledge the responsibility that comes with godlike power like this does and it still finds the time to shove a man's head up another's ass.Will Smith's general disinterest works so well for Hancock's carefree attitude. His boundless charisma shines through with every insult and it's kinda refreshing to see all that energy dialled back whilst losing none of his personality. If anyone comes close to making that massive tonal shift work, it's definitely Charlize Theron who wholeheartedly commits to both sides of it.Peter Berg's direction moves too fast which works in its favour when it comes to preventing the more serious second half from draining all the fun out of it and the action uses the superpowers for pretty inventive ideas. John Powell's score makes it obvious what films were used as reference points by sounding very similar to their scores without actually stealing from them.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Hancock isn't so much a superhero as he is an indestructible force, a god if you will, who has just sort of lost the will to care about collateral damage or public image... and on top of that an anger problem to boot. A plot twist is thrown in there to explain his past and moves the plot in quite a different direction than what would be expected, eventually leading up to the inevitable happy ending.I would consider Hancock something like a mix between Spider-Man and The Incredibles, then garnish with a little Will Smith and it makes for a fairly entertaining movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And it deserves applause for this. Instead of focusing on an earth threatening villain the film focuses on the villain within the hero. The superhero by make not by consensus, Hancock (Will Smith), fights bad guys when he feels like it. He does as much damage to the city he's in as to the bad guys he stops. The majority of the civilians of the city view him as a cause of disturbance rather than a preventer. Hancock has accepted this general opinion and does not care to change it until one of the people he saves, Ray (Jason Bateman), wants to help him. The film has a great premise and does well for the majority of the movie in executing it. However, the movie falters when it attempts to tell Hancock's past and bring it to the forefront. The movie had a great thing going but when the ball was almost out of the park, it got snagged on the warning track. Hancock is still a fun movie to watch, but you will most likely be disappointed with where the writers take the story. Will Smith delivers a top notch performance that is vastly under rated. He gives life to the character and made the viewer care about his plight. This film is worth renting or watching on TV, but it's not one for the collectors shelf.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A superhero, disillusioned and lonely, takes to a life of boozing and petty squabbling with the natives (i.e. us), becoming less and less popular even as he saves lives. Will Smith is always a good choice for summer fare; he has a strong charisma and boyish charm that makes you want to like him. And I'm a fan of Jason Bateman and the ever gorgeous Charlize Theron. But unfortunately, even with all that star power 'Hancock' didn't completely jell for me.I really enjoyed the first half of the movie, but it started to fall apart for me during the second half. Without giving anything away, a bit of a love triangle forms in the middle of the movie. It is eventually resolved - sort of - but for me summer movies usually mean larger than life heroes and clearly delineated good guys and bad guys. Uncomfortable moral quandaries just serve to distract me from the fun. Add to that the lack of any really good villains - most of the bad guys are merely buffoonish - and I was left feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more with some slight script changes.Finally, after a climactic revelation in the middle of the film, the movie felt a little lacking in direction. No big ""saving the world"" moments, just a kind of ""eh"" feeling. Still, all in all I didn't feel ripped off afterwords, so I sort-of recommend 'Hancock' for a decent if unspectacular Friday or Saturday night movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

How do Superman or The Incredible Hulk tear up city streets, crush cars and smash entire floors off of buildings without being slapped with multi-million dollar lawsuits? The title character of Hancock suffers because of his own super-strength, he can fly in and save a man from an oncoming train but his landing causes a giant hole in the pavement and he totals the train by stopping it with his shoulder. The result is that he is in debt to the city to the tune of $7,000,000 in fines.His destructive nature makes him an irritant to the populace of Los Angeles who might appreciate this good deeds were it not for the destruction he leaves in his wake. When he saves the man from the train he crushes several cars and later when he throws a whale back into the ocean, it crashes into some poor guy's sailboat. The disdain is mutual, Hancock isn't exactly a pleasant soul. He's a homeless drunk with a serious lack of people skills, his attitude stinks and he remains elusive from the police and from the press.A sort-of redemption comes his way in the form of Ray (Jason Bateman), a PR guy who is grateful that Hancock saved him from that train and brings him home for dinner. There he meets the wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) who looks at this man with a certain hatred and son Aaron (Jae Head) who looks at him with fascination. Ray is a man who knows how to spin a good idea into a media blitz and thinks he can do no less for Hancock. He convinces him to do time in prison and disappear from the public eye until the crime rate goes up and they are screaming for him to save them. Meanwhile, he will have time to clean up his life and get himself off the booze.This is a brilliant concept. What director Peter Berg has created is a base reality for a man with extraordinary powers. How would the public react to a superhero who trashes everything in an effort to save their lives? What would be the consequences? What is the real reality of having phenomenal strength and the ability to fly? What are the consequences of both powers when you're a drunk?Most of the film's best moments come from the smaller details like the fact that Hancock can shave the stubble off his chin simply by using his own fingernails. There is a scene in which he teaches a lesson to a kid who has been bullying Aaron by hurling the kid into the stratosphere and another scene in prison when he tells a fellow inmate to stick it where the sun don't shine and then gives him a demonstration. Then there's the date the he has with a woman he picks up in a bar, she wants sex but he warns her that his climatic moment may be more than she can handle.These moments would be nothing without the performance of Will Smith who manages to play this character with more subtlety and originality than it probably deserves. He underplays the role and doesn't go for flashy melodrama. He is smart enough to know that this is a guy who has been kept way from most people so he doesn't play him as needy or particularly lovable.Where the movie steps wrong is in the second half, when it tries to explain Hancock's origins. A secret is revealed that brings his background to light and kills the reality that has been created I the first half.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I wish to be able to fill the ten lines that are required for submitting a review, but after that first line, anything else seems to be redundant.Throughout the movie one has to mentally ask himself ""what?"" several times. Perhaps if you put the story on paper it wouldn't read too bad, but the execution thereof seems to be a little trickier. A question arises whether some scenes and lines were really necessary. Surely there's something more useful to be said and shown at that time. The plot is not complicated but nonetheless twisted, and at every turn the inertia wants you to go one way, but the movie has already decided to go the other. Because of all the turns even the acting of the high rollers comes under strain.Perhaps it would have been wise to split the movie in two and make two separate parts, with the first one only concentrating on Hancock's journey from a bum to a superhero. It would've been a good movie and much easier to stomach.In any case, what no one can take away from Hancock is that it's a fresh drink of water in the long line of cliché superhero formulas. It's hard to predict what happens next. And with that freshness you still get a good amount of laughs and special effects.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Whereas most anyone with the powers he possessed would be clamouring for fortune and fame, he tried his best to shy away from the lime light.What I liked most about Hancock, the movie and the character, was Hancock's grittiness. They made him a complete unrefined, alcoholic, foul-mouthed a-hole that had an attitude of giving the finger to the world. That persona really worked, or I should say that Will Smith did it well. It was apparent that he didn't care for anyone and he only helped when it was absolutely needed, or when he felt that he was obliged to do so.The story also had a pleasant surprise in it that wasn't the least bit hinted to in the plethora of trailers. Besides Hancock's internal and external transformation, a lot of light was shed on the story via Mary Embry (Charlize Theron).The CGI was good as was expected. It is kinda funny because the same CGI five years ago would have been awesome, but what was awesome in 2003 is expected today.Overall the movie was above average. There were some haha funny moments and some sensitive moments as well.

The action scenes were well done and the effects were fairly polished. The acting performances were decent and the script was pretty well written.HOWEVER The last half hour or so is completely different from the rest of the movie.

""Hancock"" promotes itself to be a different type of superhero film, but  by the end of the film, and especially by the last 30 minutes, it  degrades into nothing more than a typical summer blockbuster cliché.  The script does so many contrived turns that it becomes a little hard  to believe, even for a summer superhero film.  Here's the lowdown of what I think:  The Good: - Will Smith is always golden as an actor. It really does  become impossible to hate Hancock because Smith injects him with a  certain level of charm; additionally, Charlize Theron at least adds a  little bit of marginal tension; she's pretty easy on the eyes in all  her movies, and this is no exception  - The beginning action scene and another one in the middle of the film;  since the film really doesn't have that great of a CGI job, the action  scene really have to play up for humor; most of them are flat, but the  beginning one where he chases a car on the freeway, and another one in  the middle where he is engaged in a tug-of-war with another character  (I won't say who) is pretty funny and engaging  -AWESOME score. At times, the melodramatic nature of the film is saved  by the fact that the score is really epic and sweeping; it's pretty  easy to get lost in the film  -A really funny scene in the film where a national pundit chews Hancock  out; I'll let you see it to get the full laugh  -A cool twist that happens 45 minutes into the movie that actually adds  about 20 minutes of intrigue  The Bad: - A load of contrivances that are really convenient. Like  the Superman films, Hancock needs to make a lot of hard-to-believe  turns. Hancock really does not pull it off well enough.  - Bad CGI. Despite the $150 million price tag, the version I saw had a  lot of unfinished or really bad-looking CGI  - The cool twist. As good as it is, it takes a load of time to get  to it, and whatever happens before it just feels like its treading a  lot of water  - A horrible third act. Don't be fooled by the trailers. It's a summer  film; not a P.T. Anderson film. Of course it's going to  end with a nice little bow on top.  - Although Justin Bateman was a pretty fun character in Peter Berg's  previous film ""The Kingdom,"" he's pretty much dead weigh here. Don't  get me wrong. I love him, but he feels necessitated by the plot and his  character is really one-dimensional next to everyone else.  - Dumber than dumb villains. Instead of giving Hancock a strong  antagonist, they rely on a couple of prison hoodlums and common crooks  to fight Hancock. Without a really good central villain, there is never  much worry that Hancock will be challenged against these guys.  - Cheesier than Cheddar ending. The ending is so vomitingly saccharine  (with horrible CGI) that I really have to call the filmmakers out on  this.  So, by the end of the film, I just thought ""Hancock"" was superficially  entertaining with only a few moments of truly redeemable good times.  Like most of Will Smith's films, it's a great idea. It just wasn't  executed very well.","27 out of 57 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Will Smith suddenly hates the public and gives us Hancock.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1905089/?ref_=tt_urv","Grant_Price","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7390681/?ref_=tt_urv","5 July 2008","It turns out that the new Will Smith Summer extravaganza 'Hancock' is actually two films spliced together with all the finesse and care of Dr Joseph Mengele. Half of the 92 minute runtime is a promisingly original concept concerning an ""only one of his kind"" superhero alienated from the rest of society and existing only as a recluse who occasionally shows up in Los Angeles to save its hapless inhabitants. The problem lies in the fact that Hancock frequently conducts his superhero-ing whilst under the influence of a bottle of Jim Beam or two and thus often causes more havoc than he prevents. One sterling example the movie presents early on is when, upon having his sunglasses destroyed by a car full of criminals, Hancock effortlessly lifts the car up and skewers it like an olive on the spire of a nearby skyscraper. Events like this lead to public outcry and Hancock's semi-voluntary incarceration after striking a deal with public relations man Jason Bateman, who vows to help him change his ways after the Übermensch saves his life. Seemingly, the remainder of the film would therefore consist of Hancock's gradual path to redemption, winning back the admiration of the public and possibly experiencing a climactic 'Boss Battle' where Hancock learns some kind of important moral. Although not a particularly groundbreaking road to take and particularly wasteful of the idea of what it could mean to 'play God,' 'Hancock' would remain an interesting little package. Instead, at around the one hour mark, director Peter Berg inflicts a whiplash-inducing U-turn on the audience and embarks on a totally different story arc. Does this mean that it is less predictable? No. Does it mean that Berg destroys the film in much the same way that Robert Rodriguez did with 'From Dusk Till Dawn?' Yes.It is difficult to analyse anything about 'Hancock' without relating it to the second half of the movie, like Will Smith's performance for example. It isn't possible to abhor Will Smith. He exists in the collective unconscious of the world's population as one of the coolest and most likable actors around. The second half of 'Hancock' tries its hardest to change this preconception. Willard (yeah, Tonight With Jonathan Ross IS informative) must have known that the movie couldn't work when he read the script for it, so why did he agree to do it? Does he hate us? He seems to be sleepwalking through much of the film, the antithesis of his role in 'I Am Legend' earlier this year. Also, something I've noticed more and more in the past couple of year is the use of the ""Will Smith Patented Sad Puppy Eyeballs Look"" for whenever Will has to convey a heartfelt emotion. He does it the most in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' but 'Hancock' receives its fair share too. And why is he pouting so much? Constipation, probably.Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are pretty much the only other characters in 'Hancock,' unless you want to acknowledge the existence of Eddie Marsan as the thoroughly mismatched antagonist, which I don't. He is about as good at acting as Shane Ryder is at singing. Even if 'Hancock' wasn't a mess already, he would totally ruin it. Luckily for him it sucks, which means he merely makes any scene he is in unwatchable. Bateman on the other hand mellifluously occupies space and does nothing more, although you can't help feeling sorry for him around two-thirds of the way through. Considering Charlize Theron's character is responsible for the abrupt twist (well not really, the writers are), it is difficult not to hate her. So don't even try. Just loathe every moment she spends talking, eating, moving or just breathing. It will make you feel better.Just because 'Hancock' features the irrefutable king of the blockbuster does not mean that it is good. At one point our hero asks ""Do I look like I care what people think?"" Clearly, nobody involved in the making of this fiasco does at all.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

If for no other reason to see the film it's for him and for people like Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron to show what potential they have with their talents; Theron especially reminds an audience every once in a while that she won an Oscar for a reason. And, it's also for the first half of the way through the 90 minute running time a wonderful dark comedy that takes itself seriously but also pokes fun at a superhero who doesn't give a flying f*** and bums around saving people while also drinking his ass off and destroying lots of property.But at some point when the writers decide to develop the mythology of the character, who is apparently somewhat God-like and is immortal under specific circumstances but also has 'another' like him (I won't say who, spoiler), and they don't give it enough time to really sink in after the somewhat 'twist' occurs 2/3 of the way through. And anything humorous in the first half is gone pretty much by near-movie's end, leaving it in the hands of Peter Berg, the director. This was the aspect of Hancock that grated down at me. Berg and his cameraman's style is to usually not bother with things like steadicams or dollys or a camera simply still on a tri-pod or other and to make everything hand-held and wobbly and oddly shot and (in the case of the hospital climax) just awfully lit and shot. It comes off as more-so amateurish than being intense or realistic, and it definitely doesn't fit the kind of movie it's meant to be placed in (i.e. JULY 4TH SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER, hello!) And yet, even with the problems I had, I wouldn't stop anyone from seeing Hancock, as a good way to kill an hour and a half and to enjoy some of Smith's best work to date. He's a charismatic and multi-faceted actor, but his star quality meshes well, and it's a performance that's worth every minute to see he's on screen for. If only the rest of the movie were as good as he and his co-stars.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The storyline, the characters, the secrets... the whole film positively reeks of opportunity. Unfortunately, the theater I was in just, well, reeked. And the experience I had expected going into the movie was not to be found. Instead, I was left with a perfect example of ""What Could Have Been: Hancock."" Now, let me begin by saying that I enjoyed the movie. Will Smith, along with the rest of the cast, creates a great character. The change from down-and-out, drunk Hancock to superhero Hancock, around which the first half of the movie revolves, is done stylishly, and not without a few well-placed laughs. Jason Bateman, playing the part of a Public Relations agent for the ""All Heart"" organization, a ""for the people""-style, charitable endeavor, works wonders on the silver screen. And Charlize Theron, acting as Bateman's wife in the film, adds a sense of mystery that, toward the end of the movie, grows into an attractive, powerful character.The comedy, which many had expected to be the bulk of the movie, is well-placed and effective, though an overabundance of joking at the beginning makes the middle (which housed long stretches of drama) seem drawn out. Smith's portrayal of pre-reformed Hancock is hilariously well done, and he keeps that flair for the comedic throughout the film, breaking the tension where he needs to and reminding the viewers that Hancock is not, by any means, Superman. Bateman's character, Ray Embrey, successfully plays off of Hancock's amusing persona, helping to get the punchline across and adding a few of his own in the process.Unlike the great comedy, however, the action and suspense scenes leave much to be desired. Whenever a point of conflict hits, the camera seems to be a few hundred feet away, watching from a distance as the short, fast-paced scenes flash past. The visual effects are indeed as good as the commercials show, yet Director Peter Berg chose not to use them to their full potential. The suspense lasts mere seconds, the characters exchanging a few quick blows, and the scene ends with one of the opposing parties simply leaves.Unfortunately, the story of Hancock takes after the action. Though many, and I stress that there are many, chances to expand the story reveal themselves throughout the movie, director Berg leaves them untouched. Unanswered questions plague the film almost from the start, and tantalizing ideas of more powerful plot points leave me speechless. Opportunity for greatness runs rampant through every character and every scene. Even, I may add, what could have been a sequel.Overall, Hancock is worth seeing once, not for the action or story but instead the comedy. The idea of a degenerate being the proverbial superhero is well executed by Will Smith, though the rest of the movie falls short. With good acting by the whole cast and a healthy dose of humor throughout the film, I recommend the movie for fans of Smith or Bateman, and superhero movie fans.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The resulting film, directed by Peter Berg and starring Will Smith, is entertaining and involving, at times, for it's first two thirds, but fails to wrap things up satisfactorily at the end.As the film opens, we are introduced to Hancock (Will Smith), a man with superpowers, including the ability to fly, invulnerability and super strength. Hancock also has some significant character flaws: he is an alcoholic, appears unkempt and is generally uninterested in putting on a pleasant front for the public, offending almost everyone he comes in contact with. He also has developed a bit of a problem on the legal front, as most of heroic escapades end up with an associated property damage cost, which has resulted in multiple lawsuits, and the L.A. DA wants him behind bars.After saving the life of Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations professional, from a train accident (in which Hancock manages to derail the train and upset the commuters around him) Embry takes Hancock under his wing and makes him a personal project, with the aim of rehabilitating Hancock's tarnished public image. He invites him to his home to meet his family, including wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who gives Hancock some suspicious looks . . .At the outset, Hancock is an interesting take on the superhero tale, set perhaps in the most real world yet for a film of it's type. Here, as Hancock flies about doing good deeds, he manages to crash into things, tear up buildings, destroy yachts, and, frankly, people don't seem too happy. It is a sad comment on modern society that it is very probable that if a super-hero did exist, this is how he would be greeted by the masses.The script, credited by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, features a number of funny segments in the early scenes as Hancock interacts with the public and gives them his devil may care attitude. Hancock is a tortured character, saddled with super-powers and an innate desire to do good, but he also cannot cope with the loneliness of his existence, and so has turned to liquor to try to survive. Will Smith does an exceptional job bringing Hancock to life, making him somewhat likable, simply by being Will Smith, but also not being afraid to show Hancock as the jackass he is at times.However, at the three quarters mark, Hancock suddenly transforms into an almost completely different film and runs off the rails. It moves into a more ""serious"" vein and introduces some borderline metaphysical elements, while also delving into Hancock's origin. But, frankly, this material fails to grab you. Hancock was much more interesting when trying to fight through his rehabilitation, driven by Ray, than the left-turn the plot takes the film in towards the end. Hancock seems to want to drive home a powerful, emotional climax, but it manages to do the opposite, robbing the film of it's strength.Smith, as mentioned before, is the anchor of the film and proves once again what an exceptional actor he is. Hancock largely works because of him, giving Hancock a injured soul, but one that still has good at it's center. Jason Bateman is amusing in the role of Ray, but his family story with Mary isn't anything tremendously special or unique, and Theron doesn't turn in a bad performance, but isn't really given a lot to work with either.If Hancock had stayed the course of it's original ideas, it may have been a strong contender for a great summer movie, but it's abrupt change of focus brings the film to a less than satisfying conclusion, which is a shame.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

""Hancock"" is an amazing surprise. Charlize Theron is awesome. Her powerful performance elevates ""Hancock"". Will Smith is the most charismatic movie star today, and is well deserved. His power not only derives from his swagger, but also from his humanity and compassion. With the caliber of Oscar Winner Theron and Nominee Smith in a superhero movie by Director Peter Berg, something compelling and special emerges. Along with Smith and Theron, Jason Bateman is terrific. Bateman is having a deserved resurgence coming off of ""Juno"" and here in ""Hancock"". Writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vincent Gilligan create a new and fresh superhero mythology in ""Hancock"". Director Berg provokes killer performances, and unexpectedly veers narrative direction as ""Hancock"" transforms into the poignant homage to hero. Deep down like Bateman's Ray, we all want to ""Change the world."" Hero resonates to the soul.Hancock (Smith) has Superman-like powers: amazing strength, flight, great speed, and impervious to bullets. However, Hancock is a loner alcoholic superhero with a very bad attitude, and completely reckless. In the opening sequence Hancock subdues Asian gang members in a highway chase that costs the City of Los Angeles $9 million. Fortunately, Hancock saves Ray's life from a freight train accident. The grateful Ray (Bateman) thanks Hancock and invites him home to meet his family. Ray has a young son Aaron (cute Jae Head), who worships the renegade superhero. His beautiful wife Mary (Theron) strangely seems to recognize Hancock.Public Relations guy Ray offers his services to Hancock, who is a PR nightmare. Ray tells him, ""People don't like you, Hancock."" Mary is uneasy with Ray's good intentions. She says, ""You always see the good in people when there is none."" In guarded introspection Hancock agrees to accept Ray's offer. The Superhero image ""makeover"" is not easy. Here Ngo and Gilligan hysterically poke fun at recent celebrity jail stints as means of public sympathy. The process where Ray teaches Hancock to say, ""Good job."" is hilarious.Predictably the true hero in Hancock emerges. Then the story takes a surprising dramatic twist. In a quiet moment Hancock recalls his past and he says, ""I must have been some kind of bastard that no one came back to claim me"" Will Smith has cool gravitas that grounds ""Hancock"". He is a great looking charismatic leading man, with a deceptive poignancy. Charlize Theron is the most strikingly beautiful actress on screen. As an actor she wields such amazing will and power. She can shift from light and whimsical to stark intensity without missing a beat. Watching Smith and Theron together on screen is truly captivating. Their chemistry is electric. Jason Bateman is funny and compelling as Ray. Bateman embodies the soul of a very decent and caring man, who is stronger than he knows.""Hancock"" is about reclaiming one's greatness in the morass of circumstance, and love everlasting. It's about being a hero, and wanting to change the world for good. Director Peter Berg always keeps this theme in the foreground. He balances both a sense of humor and gravity. Berg possesses a great action sense for the dramatic. The bank hostage scene is cool and slick. The final conflict is an epic thrill ride infused with great pathos.I really enjoyed and cheered for ""Hancock"". It is a great hero story. ""Hancock"" is inventive, fresh, and completely entertaining. Will Smith powerfully delivers. Charlize Theron is totally amazing. Definitely, see ""Hancock"".","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

It also brought in some quite tense and violent scenes that actually made me question if they ought to be marketing this movie as a kid's friendly summer movie as they trailer. I really like the good special effects and it was an excellent around 100 minutes movie worth watching. I won't declare film was a totally awful because it had some pretty fine moment such as that jail scene and the dramatic change in Smith's character of Hancock, starting from a bad outlook, alcoholic superhero whom everyone hates to much better mannered superhero, whom everybody likes.

I generally like to think I can get a good read from a film before it's released, and the vibes I was getting from 'Hancock' were downright sour. Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. While it's not a great movie by any means, 'Hancock' is a surprisingly potent film with a great, original twist on the superhero brand.Audiences have been given no less than ten superhero blockbusters in only a few short years, each one following a strict playbook. Sometimes it works very well, but we've also had our fair share of stinkers. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before a film explores the other side, and that it may not be greener. Hancock is a loner, an alcoholic, very unpopular, and while he usually nabs the bad guys in the end, he leaves a trail of devastation in his wake. The only one of his kind he tells us, a superhero with a mysterious past.It's this original concept that makes 'Hancock' one of the more refreshing pieces of summer escapism. It's choppy, and at times rather heavy-handed, but it sure is fun and enjoyable. Will Smith takes a character who could have been a one-note bore and does a great job adding a real personal touch that adds a great deal of depth as he battles his inner self. He brings the comedy with him, and it's surprisingly effective. Even the great Jason Bateman finds himself in a great supporting role, and Charlize Theron has her moment to shine as Hancock's dark past is uncovered.'Hancock' takes on the hand-held camera technique, something that I thought would seriously weaken the film. But it actually adds an additional element of reality, a documentary-esquire approach that ends up working in its favor. Peter Berg's personal direction works for a film like this, and he does a decent job splicing 'Hancock' in two. One part comedy, one part action. It leaves a lot to be desired, but a twist that helps us understand Hancock's true nature helps transform this picture into something more poignant and human. I only wish this final cut was longer, allowing 'Hancock' to bring things to a more coherent close.Visually, 'Hancock' is a great achievement. Though there is no clearly defined villain, it could be argued that Hancock is his own worst enemy, the film boils over with an exciting and effects savvy climax that offers one of the better finales of the summer season. It seems to end once it begins to scratch the surface, but for what it is, 'Hancock' is a solid summer blockbuster with more on its mind than your average offering. The humor is there, the story is there, the characters are there, the heart is there, and though it's definitely flawed, 'Hancock' is not bad at all. In fact, it can all be seen as a strange but affectionate look at America's place in the world.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie starts off with the potential to be as good as any of Will Smith's great titles (Ali, Independence Day, I am Legend, etc); but the ""twist"" suddenly deteriorates the movie and, at least in my mind, it joins the ranks of such a silly film as ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"".This isn't your average superhero movie. There really isn't a defined villain or evil Will Smith has to fight besides his own attitude towards the world. Will Smith does a great job for the role, but the story is indeed disappointing. The movie looks like its going great until everything is turned around by a lackluster twist.Also, I'm not sure if this movie is aimed to be an action flick or a comedy. The beginning had lots of wisecracks and smart remarks from Will Smith and company, but by the end of the film the only laughing I was doing was at the poor story being told.Basically the first half of the movie is done to perfection; pure, genuine Will Smith blockbuster, but sadly its turned upside down by a silly twist (Oh, and don't even get me started on the CG)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

No one does a better job at bringing a lofty character like Hancock down to realistic measures like Will Smith.The plot is far fetched and the twists it throws at you are beyond unreal. There's no real action. It's just scene after scene of Will, Charlize and Bateman doing what they do. Perfect roles for each of them.It's a performance movie with a questionable plot but the theme is understood. A comedy about a superhero, not easily pulled off, but an all star cast manages it well enough. Beyond the top three characters, there isn't much. The supporting cast is terrible. The bad guys are ridiculous. You really kind of believe Will Smith is a superhero because nothing else in this movie's world even comes close to him.He's a normal guy who just happens to save the day, whether he means to or not, but his greatest power is saving this movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

His spectacularly destructive efforts to fight crime usually end up costing the city millions. So when Hancock saves budding PR executive Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from certain death at a level crossing, Embrey offers to repay Hancock by helping reinvent his image. Embrey's young son is thrilled to have a superhero hanging around, but Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), seems to be wrestling with both attraction and alarm... ""Hancock"" is outrageous, funny, smart, knowingly ridiculous and surprisingly moving. Yes, moving. I was expecting ""Bad Boys + super powers"", or at most a spoof on the clichés of the rapidly tiring superhero genre. What we get is something else entirely. The surprising tonal shift of the second half is neither as grating nor as abrupt as preview audiences had us believing. For me, it really worked. So much so that this is one of the few blockbusters I wish had been longer, giving writers Gilligan and Ngo and director Berg more time to explore the backstory and the resonant depths it potentially had. The problem isn't so much that the tone changes, but rather that more isn't made of it. I also wanted to spend more time with these thoroughly likable characters. As it stands, ""Hancock"" is still a winner. The script is sharp, the direction kinetic, the music and lens work appropriately manic, and the performances fine. Most surprising is Smith who manages to keep his shirt on and wring a lot more than laughs out of Hancock. While Smith can stoke a box-office inferno with his name alone, he shows once again that he's also a pretty good actor. He can certainly do vulnerable, even in superhero mode.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Comparisons with the likes of the already released ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" and the yet to be released ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Hellboy"" are unavoidable; though it is clear that ""Hancock"" falls short of all these movies.The movie is a wasted opportunity. Will Smith, the most dependable Hollywood actor right now, with his last nine movies topping the box office, plays an unlovable superhero who goes through a transformation.It is a very promising premise, but the writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan along with director Peter Berg seem to lose their bearings half way and allow the movie to take one of the most bizarre and wholly boring twists in any Hollywood movie this year.Not even the talented Oscar winning actress Charlize Theron and the dependable Jason Bateman can rescue or clarify this muddle of a movie.Smith is Hancock, the superhero with good intentions but bad PR skills and even poorer hygiene. He cannot resist helping anyone in need, but much to the annoyance of the residents of Los Angeles, he does more harm than good. His rescues end up costing the city millions of dollars in damages.One day Hancock rescues an altruistic but failed PR man Ray who offers to refine him and make him presentable as a superhero. This takes up the first 20 minutes or so of the movie and is actually pretty entertaining. The wheels start coming off when Hancock starts taking an interest in Ray's wife and the movie proceeds to explain this attraction.Since it is a blockbuster, the movie has the luxury of money and does a good job with the action sequences and special effects. But the true thrills in the movie are the scenes where Hancock is making efforts to be nicer and presentable.Smith, with his wholesome reputation, asks the audience to stretch their imagination in having to believe his crass attitude early in the movie. Fortunately, those scenes are few and brief and it is not long before he goes about smashing things.Smith cements his reputation as the most dependable action if not superstar in Hollywood right now. This movie will not have quite the shine as ""Independence Day"" or ""I, Robot"" and he displays much better acting skills in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" and ""I am Legend"". He was able to surprise us with his acting range.""Hancock"" sadly doesn't even put up any acting challenge before him and that is another reason the movie is a wasted opportunity.""Hancock"" never forgets that it is a summer blockbuster action movie, and in many ways it delivers in the way action movie fans would expect. They will not be disappointed. For those who can put up with a digressing plot line but not at the cost of some action and special effects, ""Hancock"" delivers.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie delivers on so many fun levels and I think it is really balanced well. It's not perfect but perfection is quite rare. Regardless, this movie is fun entertainment. Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron (dang, she looks so great) and the rest of the cast are just as wonderful as Mr. Smith. However, nothing or no one stands above Smith's incredible talent of delivering dead-pan sarcasm! I might actually go see it again just to hear some of those lines, again.

The action and the special effects are clearly the biggest assets, but the scenario says it's a funny piece, up until the third act, where it changes to a dramatic story. It doesn't have a cohesive whole. It feels like an introduction without the followup story. Most super hero film introducing their main character will have more meat to offer. The worst scene is the one with the French speaking kid.

Imagine a man with superpowers who then decides to become a superhero, but his rotten attitude and penchant for causing more damage to his city than good has the citizens of Los Angeles begging him to go somewhere else. It's an interesting twist on the superhero story. Will Smith plays the titular man as a surly, heavy-drinking, foul-mouthed, unpleasant citizen of L.A. As usual, he is very good, probably the thing I enjoyed most about the movie. He adds several requisite layers to Hancock but manages to make them feel fresh. Coming in a close second to what I enjoyed most was Jason Bateman as a PR exec who wants to make over Hancock's image. Bateman's comedic timing and earnestness compliment's Smith wonderfully. The effects are good and there are several moments that are quite funny. However, the film does have its flaws. The first gripe for me would be that the director, Peter Berg, seems to be an avid fan of the extreme close-up. When two people are talking he often zooms so close in on their faces that you cannot even see their hairline. I found it distracting. I also thought that Charlize Theron was miscast. I like her a lot and I think she's a great actress, but she lacked the comedic timing needed for her part as Jason Bateman's wife who is very skeptical that Hancock can change. She plays one scene in particular, a kitchen confrontation with Hancock, very straight and dour which is a jarring contrast to Smith's light comedy. Next, the story. The premise is unusual and quite good, but it looses steam less than halfway through the movie. The movie is quite short, only an hour and a half, so at least in that respect there isn't much left once the plot starts giving out. It takes an unbelievable turn in the third act that I just didn't buy. I think the screenwriters found it difficult to stretch a simplistic idea to a feature length. Also, the lack of a central villain hurt as well. Pitting Hancock repeatedly against petty criminals just did not work as well as if they had given him a main nemesis.""Hancock"" is good and quite entertaining, there are several reasons to see it. Is it a perfect movie? No, but it has enough redeeming qualities to make it the perfect summer escape.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a superhero movie that doesn't treat you like a brainless faceless nobody. It has a classic story with an original touch, it has its twists and all. Better yet, it's very well balanced. The modern age of commercial cinema left it's imprint on the look of ""Hancock"" as well, with the action shot earthquake-shaky, with abundance of CGI, with mild to no character development, although most of it, if not all, works in film's favor. This movie had more soul than most of what I'd seen this year, X-files 2 & Rambo 4 included. But it becomes way too rare that a Hollywood movie can be as entertaining as, say, it'd been ten years ago. I'd say ""Hancock"" is close to a Hollywood's take on Talashi Miike's ""Zebra Man"". Good movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'll avoid talking about the big high concept idea of Will and Charlize's characters because it opens the door to too many questions. The film wants all our focus on this degenerate superhero, or, more the point how do we common people relate to someone who has extraordinary gifts. Do we kowtow to them? Do we excuse their inexcusable behavior? Is anyone so essential to keeping the peace and order that they are given allowances for shortcomings and deeds that the rest of us would be imprisoned for(i.e. Jack Bauer, Vic Mackey, Dick Cheney). The script isn't going anywhere near answering those questions in a real, cogent way.On a side note, some folks believe this is a racist film. I don't agree with that perspective. I believe if this script were around thirty years ago this would've likely been a Richard Pryor vehicle.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That would come in the form of drunken, cocky male humanoids who think they have special superheroistic powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way. Those guys are really just a bunch of cocks. The ""Hancock"" protagonist in Director Peter Berg's feature in reality is also drunk and cocky, but in reality also possesses special powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way to harm the city of Los Angeles. However, the L.A. citizens do not partake in the appreciation process mostly because Hancock is a drunk and cocky (for lack of a better word or maybe it's the perfect word.) Cock! Blockbuster king Will Smith plays Hancock with no real superhero thespian powers but modest enough to give it a heroic effort. Jason Bateman plays Ray Embrey, the public relations guru who desperately helps Hancock in getting the citizens to dispel Hancock's cocky image by changing his superhero persona as more as a crime-fighter than a bottle-chaser. The luscious Charlize Theron portrays Ray's devoted wife Mary, who in turn Mary Mary quite contrary turns out to be a little scary. But I will leave it at that. Do not want to be a cocky spoiler! Berg's direction in the first half of ""Hancock"" is an entertaining crowd-pleaser by displaying Hancock's comedic rebellious ways, but Berg throws us a curve ball in the latter part of the film that struck out with many viewers & critics, present company included. I am slightly recommending a ""Hancock"" because it does bring plenty of comedic saviors in its first hour to satisfy your cinematic cravings. *** Average","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

For some unknown reason, Hancock is depressed and has started drinking very heavily. He has saved many lives in Los Angles over the years, but in doing so, he has no regard for damaging buildings, trains, roads, cars, or anything that gets in his way to get the job done. The last time he captured several criminals, it cost the city $9 million to fix the damages. The public has had enough of Hancock, and they want him to stop or go to another city. Then one day, Hancock saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from being run over by a train. Ray is a Public Relations executive who now can go home to his wife and child, because Hancock was there. Ray owes Hancock his life, and he makes it his mission to change his superhero's image and have the public cheering him. Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), believes Hancock can not be fixed, and she doesn't want Ray to be hurt.(My Comment) Hancock is a different type of superhero film. The movie is original in that our superhero is a washed up drunk who is also a jerk. Hancock, the Rodney Dangerfield of superheroes, gets no respect. We usually love and praise our superheroes for saving us from danger, but Hancock on the other hand is hated for being an a**hole. By the way, don't ever call Hancock an a**hole when he says, ""say that one more time,"" because there are consequences. How can you love a superhero when he is rude and inconsiderate of others? With a PR man, even this superhero can change. Once Hancock is repackaged, and the city comes calling, Hancock is on his way to becoming a superhero the public can love. The movie is comical at first, and then gets a little serious by the end. The a**hole scenes are hilarious and made me give out a really big laugh. There are some twists and turns in the plot that you won't see coming. Smith, Bateman, and Theron displayed good chemistry together. The movie is very entertaining with lots of action and unusual special effects. I enjoyed myself, and you will to, if you go and see it.

Unfortunately, Peter Berg devotes a lot of time and effort up front trying to achieve that very thing, and succeeds in large measure in making you loathe the character Hancock and the film along with it. When things finally kick into gear about half way in, it's almost enough to make you forget the 20-to-30 minutes of squirming uncertainty at the beginning--but not quite. Smith and Charlize Theron are terrific together, and the plot line is surprisingly intriguing, once the film finally gets around to it. Then there's Jason Bateman, who while likable enough, seems to be playing just another version of befuddled Michael Bluth, and is overshadowed by his charismatic costars. With its two dynamic lead actors and half-realized idea, Hancock is a pleasant diversion. But you can't help but think it could have been so much more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I like sci-fi movies. I even like the cool trailer for this movie ... so I thought this film couldn't be too bad. Well, it actually was pretty bad. Among the most annoying things were: poor visual quality, unlikeable characters and a bad story.The ""idea"" behind this movie sounds great: a reckless and drunk superhero with unknown origin is inspired to turn himself around. In the process, he learns that he is not the only one of his kind in the world ... and the story progresses from there.This could have been a really original (and humorous) story. However, it falls apart very quickly. The first sign that something was wrong was the visual feel: much of the movie had kind of a dull lighting and contrast. It reminded me of movies of the 1970s. In fact, many of the outfits even had a dated look. It all felt very awkward.Another problem was that the characters are pretty annoying. It's a given that Will Smith's character should be unlikeable at the start - but the film fails to ever make him pleasant. The other main character, his ""good guy"" PR agent, comes across as both intellectually challenged and wimpy as a husband, so it's hard to feel anything for him. Lastly, Charlize Theron's character is no more respectable or likable than the other two.Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is the story. It sounds good in principal, but when you see how it is fully imagined (executed), it's painful to watch. The story starts out OK but then it degenerates into a love-triangle quagmire with characters that are hard to root for. It's just not interesting.Will Smith is a very talented actor; he's generally interesting to watch no matter what movie he's in. However, with so many Will Smith fans writing scathing reviews, my advice is simple: trust them. This is a bad movie - enjoy the trailer but skip the movie.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

One of these days he will get a great script and prove it to everybody. This is film better than I Am Legend, but it is not the one with a great script. Smith plays a rude & crude super hero who has no idea why he is a hero and does not like being called A-Hole. I watched the unrated DVD version of Hancock which is 10 minutes longer than the movie theater version of it. The extra minutes help the film as the theater version is chopped up too short.It is kind of neat to me having a hero named Hancock. Hancock is a common name used for towns in several states much less being an acronym for everyman as in John Hancock which is the full name of Smith's character. To me, the lack of a master/super villain helps this film because the film isn't long enough to develop that villain. The film title reminds me of a football coach I had. We were playing a team from the town of Hancock, and doing sprints in practice prior to the game. As we started the sprints he said, first you run 20 yards and yell Han, then you run 20 yards and yell c-ck. Then after realizing what he said, he decided we should not do the yelling, especially within ear shot of the horny female cheerleaders.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

About the performance, I would say both Will Smith and Charlize Theron did a good job. Will is always good at being both funny and serious in different scenes in one same movie, and he did it quite good again this time in ""Hancock"". Charlize was also good in the film, her performance was natural and really no strings attached. That really makes us able to see the power inside her performance. The movie actually is not really the one which is ""totally entertaining"". I said it is because this movie has a part which is a bit heavy.

It is an original idea, it's action packed, funny, possesses a sound cast, it is infested with special effects and, generally, has that ""blockbuster"" feel about it. It is most definitely an entertaining film and there's no doubt in my mind that you will feel satisfied upon exiting the cinema however, it soon hits you that Hancock could have, and should have, been a better film. With a concept as original as Hancock, Peter Berg, does not necessarily fail, but is just unable to fully fulfil it's potential. As many a critic has pointed out, the first half of Hancock is great: the plot flows well, Hancock's character is developed very soundly and the spoofs are genuinely amusing. It is often pointed out though, that the second-half of Hancock is what lets it down. I for one, thought exactly the same when I had seen it but, after having a little ponder I decided that the problem was that Hancock was simply too short for it's own good. The events of the second-half are entertaining, don't get me wrong, it's just once the first-half has passed, it feels as though the rest of the film was mindlessly thrown together and it feels awfully rushed. Certain aspects of the story aren't fully explained, Jason Bateman's character is almost completely forgotten, the villain is weak (with no disrespect to Eddie Marsan who gives an effective performance despite this) and the ending, really, is just far too abrupt.But, like I mentioned before, Hancock is an enjoyable movie. Dialogue is snappy and the three lead characters are all developed very well. Will Smith puts in a sound performance as the lonely, public-scorning superhero Hancock and Charlize Theron is effective as the loving wife of Jason Bateman (who is also effective) giving a softly intimidating performance. Special effects are convincing and nicely portray the results of Hancock's recklessness. The action scenes are exciting enough that they make up for some of the film's low-points during the second-half.Hancock is definitely an enjoyable movie but it's lack of coherence during it's second-half and dodgy runtime of 92 minutes means it is unable to completely fulfil it's highly potential concept. Entertaining, nonetheless.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And despite some minor flaws here and there, Hancock provided an interesting twist on the superhero movies. And I think that is a good thing.Smith plays a drunken hero who doesn't know how to limit himself in anyway, including his strength. Will Smith plays a great drunken hero. The the twist happens that many people have talked about. And while it wasn't the best twist of all time, it changed the momentum of the movie.Overall, I really did like the characters of the film. So many of the 'hero' movies are all the time to such a great extent. This one portrays heroes in a much different light. Plus with Will Smith, it does a good job. So I liked it.

But comparing it to Hancock, and My Super Ex-Girlfriend is considered a masterpiece. I mean Hancock tries to hard to be too much of everything, and it fails to hit the high note. I saw the trailer, I thought I was expecting a fun superhero comedy with some dramatic moments. Would have liked it better, if it was just about a flawed superhero, and it did start out that way at first. But has it went on it became a seriously unwatchable melodrama of trying to explain why Hancock is so special, and it didn't explain itself enough to the point where you don't even care anymore. Now I know it was not meant to be a superhero film, Like My Super Ex-Girlfriend wasn't meant to be. But it could have been better if it just stayed a simply comedy. Why are Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman wasting there talent on junk like this, I seriously don't think they need the money, or there desperate. Now the special effects are the only good in this movie. To some parents out there, who's kids love Will Smith, this is not a movie for kids. Take them home and watch Men In Black 1 and 2 instead.","17 out of 39 found this helpful.

Even lighter was Hancock, the least accomplished, but certainly most entertaining blockbuster that came by in that period.Basic idea: Hancock (Will Smith) is a flawed vigilante. So far, nothing new: the whole philosophy of Marvel Comics' production has always been ""superheroes with super-problems"", and Superman and Batman ain't that perfect either, especially on film. The twist? Hancock's case is rather extreme - he has a drinking problem, which causes him to cause more damage than good. Okay, so Tony Stark also has a soft spot for the odd cocktail or two (hopefully, that aspect will be analyzed in Iron Man 2, as promised by Jon Favreau), but even he wouldn't greet a bunch of criminals he's about to arrest like this: ""Your head is going up his ass, his head is going up his ass, and you get the short end of the straw, 'cause your head is going up my ass!"". Is it really that surprising that Joe Public's nickname for the guy is ""a**hole""? Didn't think so.Lucky then for Hancock that Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy, is interested in cleaning up his reputation, much to the dismay of Mrs. Embrey (Charlize Theron). This consists of sending the dude to prison for some time, so that he can sober up and understand what is expected from him. Once he gets out, he can become the real protector America needs, which is a good thing considering trouble is waiting around the corner...This isn't the first time director Peter Berg has handled action and comedy at the same time: he previously helmed Welcome to the Jungle, starring The Rock and, uh, Seann William Scott (plus Christopher Walken), and landed an acting gig (along with Bateman, coincidentally) in the misdelivered Smokin' Aces (where the humor was the wrong kind of black). In this case, he benefits from a witty script co-written by Vince Gilligan, whose knack for weird comedy is well known to anyone who's seen The X-Files (among other things, he wrote an episode where David Duchovny switched bodies with, wait for it, Michael McKean). The ""hero gone bad"" premise is managed deftly, and as long as the focus stays on Hancock's troubled nature the film remains right on track. Too bad the screenplay calls for an uninvited twist halfway through the story which leads to a sudden shift in tone that can't be shaken off, no matter how hard Berg tries. It's as if two different scripts had been glued together and separated by the 45-minute mark.However, the result isn't as sloppy as one could expect, courtesy of one of Berg's major qualities - his ability as an actors' director (quite easy, since he's an actor himself). Even Bateman and Theron, who are supposedly stuck in boring supporting roles, give truly charming and funny performances (now, who said Theron can't do comedy?). As for Smith, his drunken wise-ass act is arguably his most purely entertaining effort since Men in Black (the first one, obviously), and surely the only reason a sequel has been announced. Not that it's necessarily a bad idea: just get him off the wagon again and we'll eagerly await his return.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

No question that Will Smith is a movie star and can pull off a super hero ... even an apathetic, alcoholic, amnesiac-stricken super hero. Here he is very physical while at the same time using facial expressions to try and get in touch with his more human side.This mess goes wrong pretty quickly. The special effects are overboard and director Peter Berg (""Very Bad Things"", ""The Kingdom"") way over directs ... especially with the 360 degree facial close-ups. All the eye gazing between Will Smith and Charlize Theron take away any mystery in what the big plot twist might be. Even the score is weak. Is it too much to ask for a decent theme song for a super hero? This one sounds like it is straight out of a John Ford movie, or maybe ""Wagon Train"".Jason Bateman has almost as much time as Will Smith but really isn't able to bring much to a nothing role. Smith is the only one who shows any depth as his is the only character with more than one dimension. The cartoonish special effects just don't work and the great little idea of the rehabbing super hero just falls flat. This one has the feel of MULTIPLE edits and cuts with the result of one that just isn't much fun.

Hancock (Will Smith): Do I look like I care what people think?""Put your John Hancock on this."" How many times has someone used the signature figure of speech this way? Peter Berg's Hancock is also the real deal, a signature comic sci fi, super hero summer blockbuster unlike any other except Iron Man. Even Iron Man doesn't go far enough exploring the downside of heroism with the weaknesses of being human interfering with an ordered heroic world.Will Smith as Hancock turns in a much more nuanced performance than his I am Legend loner because here he must turn around a public that sees Hancock as an ""asshole"" hero who saves people but destroys property and endangers civilians as a result of his drinking and a bruised amnesiac brain that can't remember his early life. As Hancock he must confront human beings today, not barren post apocalypse as in Legend. He rehabilitates his public profile, sobers up, and contends with his attraction to his ""publicist"" Raymond's (Jason Bateman) wife, Mary (Charlize Theron).In other words, Hancock is not your garden variety super hero although he can fly and destroy with the best of them. He is conflicted about his weaknesses, his feelings toward Mary, and his forgotten past as a hero who may span thousands of human history years. In addition, the allegorical implications about The USA as flawed heroic nation imposing its will on small countries such as Vietnam and Iraq seems to lie underneath this commentary on pop-cult heroism. Even if you don't buy that aesthetic, consider the Star Trek theme of the gods envying humans even with all their emotional messes.Hancock weakens when it plays for laughs the heavy-duty existential attitudes of personal responsibility and at the same time looks for philosophical ballast. Star Trek did a better job of contrasting the lonely perfection of the gods' world with the robust, loving, but terminal world of humans. Hancock does a credible job showing how immortality without love is bound to lose to the glorious imperfection of mortality.""Oh, He hath made things worthier than Himself, And envieth that, so helped, such things do more Than He who made them!""

"6","/10","Unorthodox superhero becomes somewhat orthodox and boring","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2410845/?ref_=tt_urv","RickHarvey","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21819041/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2011","What starts off as a lot of fun, ends with being corny. Hancock is more of your unorthodox superhero. With mega strength at his disposal, he can do pretty much what he wants. Will Smith once again is great. He done many summer blockbusters before and his performance and the overall film keeps up the tradition of raking in a lot of cash. The film itself is entertaining. Towards the end , it hard not to become disinterested.With all the Marvel and graphic novels adaptations being shot for the big screen, it was a breath air to be treated to a light hearted superhero flick. The first half contains laughs and you're never quite sure what Hancock's is going to do next to upset the community.But, when we reach the scene when we discover there more than one person who are gifted with unbelievable strength, it becomes tiresome. The whole love story and the tale of Hancock's past seems lazy and tricks you to believing you've somehow inserted a second disk.If i ever watch Hancock again, i will do so but only the first half. I saw myself avoiding the screen in an attempt to block out the awful love story. Shame, if only they kept the drunken Hancock all the way through the film, more people would of appreciated it uniqueness and no doubt have a higher rating","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An interesting take on a superhero-movie comedy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2195708/?ref_=tt_urv","vip_ebriega","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14080241/?ref_=tt_urv","22 January 2010","My Take: A funny and satirical take on the superhero genre.Before it falls prey to the typical over-the-top effects-heavy summertime entertainment, HANCOCK is a surprisingly fresh take on the superhero genre, which also got a huge makeover at the time with films like IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT. In a way, HANCOCK is a worthy dish to add to the buffet of surprisingly new age summertime comic book movies. Instead of the typical effects-laden movies of its kind (which, actually, is what this film becomes sometime in the second act), HANCOCK is a satire. Instead of your typical superhero origin story, which just get straight to the point: Hancock is an asshole of a superhero, and nobody likes him.For years now, Will Smith has starred in several promising blockbuster (usually coinciding with a 4th of July screening). But his character as HANCOCK is a long way from his roles in INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK. Just as role in I AM LEGEND was a more serious take on his typical action hero, his John Hancock often calls for him to be totally unlikable. Yes, we have to take him as a total jerk, but then relate to him when the only reason for his actions is that the world isn't exactly a ray of sunshine for him. A public relations professional (Jason Bateman) seeks to change that, just as he seeks to change the world in his little ways. But his wife (Charlize Theron) isn't too comfortable when his husband hangs out with the chaos-prone alcoholic superhero.Although the last act boils down to another effects-heavy blockbuster with dizzying special effects (shot entirely in headache-inducing ""shakycam""), HANCOCK's real appeal is how funny it is. Smith is hilarious in the role, yet we gain sympathy from the character when he wants us to. Director Peter Berg knows how to balance summertime effects gigs and satirical comedy (even if the balance does tip a little in the final act), making HANCOCK a good time if far from an entirely perfect movie. To quote our hero, good job! Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

First part where we see Hancock character is developing and trying to get better, and the second part where things become very cliché and boring.The first part was very interesting and fun, often burst me in to laugh, which I think what they intended to do. I do believe that they could have put more fun stuff, and funny lines to this part, instead of focusing on a public relations professional, Ray Embrey's cult idea of making a better life for others, and his wife..Then sadly , the movie started to evolve and change in to something very weird and unnecessary. It seemed like the director didn't have enough preparation to do so too. I didn't see and good lines or anything interesting. All it really involved was bunch or special effects and more Charlize Theron. I gotta say I am not a fan of her at all. Her acting was too hysterical and her moves were often too much. Will Smith does a great job on this movie and gets in to character really well. As said before, this is not a cliché superhero movie, at least not in the beginning. I do believe that it could have been a lot better though. My vote for the first part is 4.5 outa 5 ,and 1.5 for the second part.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I remember seeing the trailer for this film and thought it would be awesome but it really is a lot down. The film shifts halfway through into something totally bizarre and seems to lose it's identity throughout the film. What on earth were the filmmakers thinking of when they put this dross together.Will SMith in my opinion has made to serious errors of judgement, first with I am Legend and now this, is he just now cashing in and taking the money instead of looking for quality films to star in. Very disappointed indeed.Everything about the film was just wrong, acting was poor, the story was garbage and somehow they got themselves confused with the genre of the film. The first half of the film was entertaining and I think had they stuck along these lines for the rest of the film then they may have had a winner, it would never have been the best film of 2008 but people would have at least given it credit for what it is, a half decent comedy superhero movie not some bizarre film trying to use some sort of ancient mythology that just did not work.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Having seen it with no expectation I have to say it was a great summer movie. Jason Bateman is very funny as per usual, and I truly enjoyed Will Smith in his role as the foul, dirty, whiskey chugging, superhero. I thought the role was surprisingly dark for Mr. Smith and I generally enjoyed the concept of an apathetic superhero. The action sequences were good enough, but most of all I was pleased not to be watching a Marvel Brand movie, which I for one and COMPLETELY sick of seeing over and over and over and over. This movie offered a lighter mood to heroes and allowed us to laugh at them, which is something I would definitely like to see more of.I think too many people are giving this movie a hard time, when it really is a solid summer movie. Not film of the year by a long shot, but quality entertainment for a few summer dollars.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1908044/?ref_=tt_urv","imalamin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19398400/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2008","You know how Gotham City loves Batman, and how everyone in New York City is a fan of Spiderman? Have you ever wondered what a superhero would do if everyone hated him and everything he does goes unappreciated? You're not alone, and Hancock is here to answer our question. Hancock is a movie about an alcoholic superhero, John Hancock, played by Will Smith (I Am Legend), who everyone hates because he does more damage than good. He then saves the life of a Public Relations representative; Ray, played by Jason Bateman (Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium), after which Ray decides to help Hancock change the society's image of him. Ray's wife, Mary, is played by no other than the always beautiful Charlize Theron (Monster). Truth is; the less you know about this movie before going in to watch, the better. So is the movie any good you ask? Hancock is directed by Peter Berg, remember him? He is the genius that brought you last year's The Kingdom (also starring Jason Bateman). The guy is a really good director. The movie is very well directed and there are some really amazing shots in there. It is written by Vince Gilligan (Creator of TV series Breaking Bad and Co-producer of TV series The X-Files) from an original story by Vincent Ngo. Not trying to sound like I know more than I actually do, but this is where the little flaw of the movie is. Let me explain. I've read Vincent Ngo's original script, ""Tonight, He Comes"", and it is amazing. When it was rewritten into Hancock, Vince Gillian changed it a little, and personally, I think it did more harm than good (ironically, so does Hancock). Also, I think this movie is marketed very wrongly. It is being marketed as a comedy Superhero Movie. If you go in with that mindset, you sure are going to be disappointed; because for a superhero movie, the action sequences weren't that many. So if you want to really enjoy Hancock, I suggest you go in with the mindset of watching a Comedy - Drama in which the main character just happens to be a superhero. Do you really want me to talk about the acting in this? I mean, the fresh prince himself is the main character. We all know Will Smith can win an Oscar by just making a cameo. Well, maybe not; but he is very good. Charlize Theron is probably not going to win an Oscar for this like she did for ""Monster"", but that is not to say she's not amazing. And Jason Bateman: Funny as always. Even the extras in this movie weren't bad! If you were to divide Hancock into three parts, I'd give: the first part 4.5 out of 5 stars, second part 4.5 out of 5 stars and 3 stars for the third. This is because the third act is lazy and felt really out of place. Too many unimportant things happened and there wasn't enough development or attention to the important ones. That being said, the movie still lets you go with a smile on your face; just make sure you stay after the credits. So what's up with that Eagle? Don't know the Eagle I'm talking about? Go watch Hancock... you know you want to.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think I have seen three different trailers and from those trailers I could have told anyone the whole plot and most of the plot points before the film even started. Even what I am sure most viewers saw as a surprise I could have told you was going to happen just by watching one trailer. I won't give away anything here of course but that anyone who has seen the trailers would be surprised by anything in this movie surprises me. Either I see to many movies or your average movie goers are rather stupid, I'd say a little of both. Also the first half of the movie was almost all in the trailer, nothing fresh or new that I hadn't seen before for at least the first 40 minutes. My point is that making trailers is a lost art, only a very few trailers a year are well made and don't give away the whole film. OK, now back to the movie, the idea for this film is great but this movie doesn't take advantage of that, and there are few things I hate more then bad trailers and wasted ideas. All that said I loved the music and a few scenes were great and could have been amazing if the story around it would have been better. I admit there was maybe three or four funny lines that I hadn't heard before going in, but in a Will Smith comedy only three or four kind of sucks.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Uhm? Either the movie is that good or is another poor investment by Hollywood producers. For what I saw on opening day, it was well worth the admission ticket price. Will Smith as he always is makes a funny, likable, heroic, and believable character Hancock. Ninety minutes of Will Smith can usually make a great movie, but he has some assistance with Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Both thespians help make this an enjoyable movie that adds a little bit of character development and likeness to their characters.As with the rest of the movie, it went into the amazing CGI. Like ""Transformers"" and ""War of the Worlds"", visual effects have proved to be awe-inspiring and captivating. As unrealistic as the plot and superheroes are, CGI makes it real.""Hancock"" is an enjoyable popcorn loving, fast-paced action flick. But there are some things that I did not like in this movie, particularly the prison scenes. I found the prisoners and other criminals throughout the film to be disturbing. Even more so the scene where Hancock stick one inmate's head up another's anus unneeded. It's funny, but it's also something I don't need to see after I had eaten. I liked the movie, but it could have done without some inappropriate scenes as well as some of the violent nature of criminals. I wanted to see a movie that's about escapism, not reality. 7/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie surely evokes extreme controversial feelings. Why? Because, all the movie-making aspects (directing, script etc) were leading to that. Why? It could have been on purpose  which I hope it was. But it could have also been because of poor execution of the idea. I am leaving the cast out of the controversies though. They were simply great. Now, I like to think it delivers controversial feelings on purpose. Isn't it motivating to you guys when a movie does not give explanations on the plate? When it does make you wonder let's say what could have happened millenniums ago? Isn't it challenging to see that our expectations could be wrong about a movie: that it was not about a superhero saving people's lives, but instead about how he was affected by this way of being? If we do not recognize that such controversies come from our difficulty to grasp different (or deep) ways of thinking, than we will surely blame on the movie. Yes, it could have been longer, but it was in line with the purpose of leaving things unrevealed. I personally love that: to have the space to imagine and visualize what could be beyond. Maybe you should dare to do that and not expect the movie to do it for you. And if you are not willing, fine. Just, find another movie that satisfies that need of yours. There are plenty of them. This one is for people who like the duality and completion from opposites: humor-gravity, good-evil, surface-depth, male-female, and so on. I would love to see a sequel. But it would be fine without that too. Thanks.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

He really does try to put his best foot forward in this and he honestly does a good job. The pacing could have used some work though but all and all its good.

First of all, it's maintained a relatively hum-drum rating on IMDb since that time (not that I count that as a top factor, but it is a warning sign).Secondly, I am not a fan of ""superhero"" movies. I've always wanted to like the movies based on comic book heroes, but it's just not me, and I gave up several years back. The Incredibles was probably the only superhero movie I really enjoyed, apart from the great web-swinging scenes in the first Spiderman movie.Thirdly, I couldn't really tell from the few trailers I managed to see if it might actually be funny - and if not, what was it supposed to be? I think the answer to this question is what leads me to give the rating I'm giving.I didn't know what to expect from Hancock, and so when the opportunity finally arose, I just watched it.And I really enjoyed it. Hancock is part thigh-slapping comedy, part action movie, part melodrama, part romance, part absurdly dry observation, with generous slabs of comic book thrown in between.As one person pointed out, the plot was somewhat predictable in places, and yet we were still left guessing just enough - do you think it will happen this way or that way? And every time there was a new development, it caused us to think back to what we had seen 10 minutes before to ask ourselves if we had really seen it coming.We laughed, we grinned (wryly), we ""ewwwww""ed, and we said ""awwwww"". We didn't take the movie too seriously - it didn't take itself too seriously. And I think that's the main point. It tells a story, it makes it fun, adds pretty cool special effects, adds elements from a lot of different genres, and winds everything up nicely in the end.I am a reluctant fan of Will Smith. I didn't really know who he was as his fortunes were rising, and (being an avid rap-hater), I didn't really care. But despite myself, I am almost always impressed. I haven't seen all his movies, but his performances rarely if ever fail to leave me nodding in approval. I wouldn't exactly say this part was a dramatic stretch for him, but he was nicely cast, as were the other two leads.This is not the greatest movie since sliced bread, it is a nice, fun way to pass the time. Normally I would give it maybe 7 or 8 stars, but because I think it's gotten such a bad rap, I'm giving it a 9 for balance.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The plot is descent if you're going in open minded and not expecting a comic book style adventure where some ultimate bad guy has some super doom in mind for all humanity until said super hero defeats before said villain or nefarious event.However, yopu'll immediately discover a sour taste in your mouth whenever a scene involving Charlize Theron comes into play. Her acting is so extremely artificial it almost is like watching a 3rd grade play. Aeon Flux was a perfect demonstration of this, but worked out better because well the character she was playing as was in general monotone anyways. However that sever acting flaw shines brightly in a movie thats more domestic than 'cold killer'. This gets even more highlighted when her role becomes more involved later in the movie.Over all I was generally pleased by the movie until the deeper plot comes out which kinda makes it feel like the writers were runnign shallow on the idea and just making it up as they went along.Over all its a good watch, can be easily waited for to be released to home theater but due to its action scenes and descent screen play by most of the people involved (minus Charlize Theron) you should be able to walk away with a new experience on your hands.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Jason Bateman plays Jason Bateman, a man who becomes Hancock's agent of sorts after Hancock manages to save his life in the most destructive way possible (because apparently seeing terroristic levels of destruction perpetrated almost nonstop by Mr. Sourface is uproarious). We also see Charlize Theron as she stands there having no chemistry with her fiancé (Bateman), and even less with Hancock, who she has a past with (and by past I mean a few incoherent sentences of wooden dialogue tossed out with no explanation). Long story short: Hancock manages to reign in his awfulness somewhat with the help of Bateman and his 2-dimensional nice-guy personality. Eddie Marsan stains his otherwise likable filmography by playing a bad guy who is bad (wow, what depth) in this sorry excuse for a film, tasteless attempts at humor are made in the form of bully children being tossed hundreds of feet in the air, a bad guy's hand getting chopped off with a metal disk, buildings getting smashed in half (by the 'good' guys, no less) and countless other wastes of cgi destruction that happen under the pretense of humor.Nothing was proved. Nobody cared.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

As it was $10 Tuesdays it was an easy decision - see TWO movies instead of one! A mini marathon if you will! Hancock was actually a heck of a lot more entertaining than I expected. It has some moderately to very funny moments, awesome special effects (who wouldn't love to fly even if it is worse than ""The Greatest American Hero"" (William Katt)?) and a plot twist I never expected.As a Will Smith fan I thought it wasn't his best work but still rate his performance as... good. Hot babe Charlize was un-recognisable (ie she still looks gorgeous) and played a great role - just don't get her angry. I haven't seen Jason Bateman for ages but his performance in this film was an impressive re-introduction. Daeg Faerch (young Michael in the Halloween remake) has certainly grown up too - not sure if it his normal accent or he was just awesome in Halloween). And most of the supporting staff are well suited too.Generally production is of a high quality. If you are stuck for a movie after seeing the others doing the rounds you could do a lot worse than Hancock.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The romance between the immortal pair who becomes mortal and victim of attacks was so beautifully shown that I watched the movie more than a dozen time.Will smith is so much believable as the lonely superhero. Neither the super powers of Hancock nor the action scenes makes these movie a wonder for me but it is the vulnerability and the undying love.I will simply recommend you to watch the movie without the superhero angle, it is only an added plus.Believe me giving a 9 to this movie is totally justified.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is just another piece of crap that Hollywood have brought out that is a poor excuse for a movie, remember superman iv with Christopher reeves now that was a great movie and they didn't have a big budget and they didn't go over board with the special effects and even batman begins was really good and there again they made the movie right with little cgi effects and more just old fashioned filming. They only thing the movie had going for it was Jason bateman's role, he was the only real character in the film everyone else just seemed like a cardboard cutout. This film seems to be made like most other Hollywood films these days and that its target audience is the younger generation, in which the should make a film that targets all people an not just the young ones.If you were smart you would wait for the DVD or even wait for it to air on television.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Hancock is a homeless superhero with no respect whatsoever. The opening act has him stop an armed chase with a price tag of $7 million dollars in property damage. He destroys pavement wherever he lands. Everyone, from kids to criminals, call him an a-hole. Then the film gets surprisingly better. He saves the life of Ray, someone skilled but flawed at public relations and convinces Hancock to improve his image, by answering the demands of the public to answer for all his crimes, apologize and turn himself in. From this point, it all goes downhill from here, and it's the second half twist and ending that stinks up the whole movie, to the point where you don't care about how good the first half was anymore. How could they have screwed up such a good premise? Hancock's origin and weakness, though I will not spoil, are the mother of all cop-outs.It's not as if Hancock shows any Achilles heel in Will Smith or Charlize Theron's acting abilities. The second half of the film is that bad if an Academy Award winning actress who worked with Will before cannot pull it through. Throw in a pathetic stinker of a villain, a story of love and tortured relationships and Hancock is crushed by the weight of too many generic superhero clichés.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

It has Will Smith in the lead role and as a producer; it's an action picture with a lot of adrenaline and visual effects; it's, and this is never a little fact, a superhero movie. This said, it's also easy, with one look, to notice that the film presents a turn on the typical superhero plot development. We've got to be fair: the script by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan is original and character driven, but ""Hancock"" is not the first recent film that tries to bring something different to the superhero table; animation plays with the concept of superheroes all the time, and this will continue to happen. However, when it comes to live action and in an era of mature ""Spider/Iron/Super/Bat Man"", ""Hulk"" tales (which never lack sense of humor), John Hancock represents a new race. Precisely because he didn't came from a comic book and because his story doesn't necessarily emulates the steps of the other stories, this is also a race of superhero film we won't see very often.Always comic but never a parody, ""Hancock"" presents us a man with powers, who fights crime and saves lives but has recently lost his popularity. We look at him and we sense something profound in his eyes. He's not a millionaire, or a doctor, or a lawyer He's just a man, an immortal human being with a lot of strength who drinks all the time and isn't able to do his job right. But is this his job? We don't know anything about Hancock, but Smith never plays him with a pose: too smart, too cocky, too serious, or too drunk for that matter. There's a short sequence, with beautiful music by John Powell, in which we see Hancock by himself. He's not comfortable with who he is, and it's never the film intention to mock him, even when everyone keeps calling him an 'asshole'.Therefore, on a second glance, it's once again easy to perceive that story and characters mean more to Peter Berg than the bad guys Hancock has to fight (or what I call 'events'). There are a few action sequences, but they are not necessarily impressive. It seems to me it's always more about what Hancock will do, for him, in each case, than the shock the audience will receive, visually and in terms of sound. At the same time, there's a more detailed construction in the conversational scenes. Missing elements and unsaid things in the dialog combined with strong looks on one hand; unexplained warnings on the other. Of course, this is not entirely serious or dramatic, but it's obvious and transparent. Always comic, the movie has silly musical montages and there are comic touches in a lot of situations but the actors are –when it comes to drama- well directed, focused (specially Jason Bateman); and if I don't tell you anything else is because there's a story worth watching and the way things unfold is natural and not at all definitive. Also, even though it's a short ride, when it's over it's not like there was a big case closed, a mystery solved or a lot of people saved in an event. There's just life, with its (sad) comings and goings, and we want to know more about the people whose lives we've witnessed for a while.Everything in the film is, nevertheless, completely entertaining, given the fact that Will Smith is a winning actor who understands what the audience wants, in any genre he's doing; and because Charlize Theron is beautiful and we can't take our eyes off of her. I saw in ""Hancock"" other things, specific elements I chose not to mention that made this for me a different, enriching experience. The elements are there. You can think of them as part of an uninteresting whole or you can give them more credit. Anyway, is as The Dire says: when there's a good story","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Bateman's character is endearing to the viewer as we see his endless optimism for Hancock's potential, which results in some comical scenes between Bateman and Smith eg: ""Say 'Good Job Officer', 'goooooood jooooob'"" :).I was actually slightly disappointed by Charlize Theron's performance which has been criticized by others, but that is open to interpretation - let's just say she doesn't have a good poker face. However this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.As many of you will have already seen the trailers you may notice that this isn't really about any major conflict or world saving mission like all the other superhero movies. This was never the intention of Hancock. Put simply, it is the story of Hancock coming to terms with who he is and realizing his true potential - to be a great hero (rather than a bad hero).The special effects are good, the story is more humor than action, but it's a good enough mix to keep you entertained from start to finish. Hancock is an enjoyable, fun movie with a good storyline (for a comedy/action flick) that should satisfy all but the most demanding of viewers.7.5/10 (rounded-up to 8/10)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have always had this funny feeling about the movie, thinking it looked weak and stupid, and I had this suspicious feeling about it, too. So recently I finally decided to rent it and to my surprise, my suspicions were all confirmed. This movie was nothing but a thinly veiled Barak Obama campaign advertisement.It is about ""Hancock,"" named after one of our founding fathers John Hancock. A MAGIC black man (super hero) who will ""Change everything."" The idea of Change comes up over and over again in the movie....if only ""people can learn to accept him and to like him. The whole world will change!"" Hancock's friend in the movie is the character Ray, who is an image consultant. His day job before he meets Hancock is going around to EVIL CORPORATIONS run by WHITE MEN and trying to convince them to DO WHAT THEY DO, PRODUCE WHAT THEY PRODUCE, BUT GIVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE WORLD FOR FREE. Just like Obama's communist political agenda! I am not exaggerating, that is EXACTLY what he tells the corporations in multiple scenes. Also, get a load of this: the license plate of Ray's car is shown in one scene of the movie...it reads ""GREEN 44."" Any significance? How about the GREEN MOVEMENT and the 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? Let me tell you, I know movies, and in just about EVERY movie scene where a license plate can be seen, it has some kind of hidden meaning or code put in there by the director. That is one of the oldest and little known tricks in the book of movie making.Also, this movie was released on July 2, 2008 here in the U.S. Just in time to start brainwashing people and warming up their minds for the November Election. Don't forget that stupid staged photo of Obama posing in front of that Superman Statue. That picture was circulated heavily during his campaign, and it was not long after this movie came out. Seems obvious to me they were trying to tie it all together. I guess the people who vote here in the USA really are incredibly stupid. This movie sucked. It had no central villain, and the one armed bad guy they tried to put up against Hancock was weak and under developed. Overall, I rate this movie VERY low. It was a pathetic campaign ad, that's all. Don't bother with this piece of crap.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

Hancock has become a menace to us without really meaning too the question is who can stop him?

Hancock at first refuses by soon sees the truth as the agent tells him just what is going on and how the world now sees him as a menace. Hancock also discovers a missing piece of his life that has near tragic consequences for him. That piece is the agent's wife Superbly played by Charlize Theron who matches will smith step for step quip for quip she makes Smith Better by not underplaying against him instead she makes him Act stronger which is all the better for us. Now the bad parts are this the movie while quite good comes across as uneven in some scenes the story feels unpolished and quite rough this is not Will Smith's best film but it's not his worst. The directer Peter Berg starts out with great intentions but it feels as if he lost steam along the way and decided to use a short cut to finish the film.

The guy has become an appealing actor to watch. That said, I was disappointed with HANCOCK because it started out with such promise but then took a complete turn in the wrong direction somewhere 'round the midway point and ruined for me what was shaping up to be a good film.Hancock (Smith) is a drunken hobo who, we learn right from the beginning, has been somehow endowed with special superhero-like abilities. He is invincible, cannot be harmed in any way, and spends his time flying and leaping into all sorts of local catastrophes to help people and set things straight. Yet for all his seemingly virtuous intentions, he is a cynical personality with a clumsy knack for not knowing his own strength and destroying streets and property in the casual manner in which he works his good deeds. As a result, rather than being loved and appreciated, he is vilified and condemned by the citizens of California and all of the news media. But there is hope when an aspiring ad man and his wife (Jason Bateman and the beautiful Charlize Theron) see the potential in helping Hancock better utilize his powers and gain the approval of the world.Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen the movie, the plot begins to thicken around this point and not for the better, in my opinion. What began as a touching and funny sentiment starts to mutate into something else entirely and, what's even more detrimental, there arise too many unnecessary explanations addressing Hancock's exceptional abilities which then leaves nothing to the wonderment of your imagination. These detours cripple the chance for HANCOCK to be something special. **1/2 out of ****","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It seemed like such an original concept, an antihero who everyone hates trying to redeem himself to the masses by going straight and looking good. But a mysterious menace looms for this superhero, called John Hancock. I admit I thought this move was going to be original, but not so original and weird to the point of excess.The Good: Will Smiths acting is a constant, you know thats going to be good regardless of the film. The special effects were also amazing and really intriguing, it really meshed well with the action sequences. This is also the first movie in which YouTube.com was seen so frequentely which I guess its a good thing. The various spurts of comedy were also really funny and welcomed. But the real good qualities of this movie ends here. Oh yeah and Charlize Theron looks super HOT! The Bad: So Original and Weird to the point of being a turnoff. The Script and Storyline needed some work, I don't know if the screenwriters overcomplicated the movie purposely, but the whole love story behind the movie to me was sort of unnecessary and stupid. There are a lot of questions to Hancocks origin that were not answered. As well as the behavior of the people in this fictitious Los Angeles, which was also sort of strange in a ""Last Action Hero"" sort of way. Jason Batemans character, Ray, had a too large part in this movie as well. It seems like the script was worked and rewritten various times and the end result was far from perfect which detracts lots of the movies enjoyability. The enemies of Hancock were also very spontaneous and were not well explained.The Ugly: Well, when you literally see BIG BOB in prison with a head shoved up his ass. LOL.Conclusion: Hancock is a great movie, to watch at the movies for the fantastic action sequences and special effects, as well as the comical moments of the movie. But the movie itself is too complicated and leaves many questions unanswered. The dialogue is really bad at times and I didn't know whether to take this movie seriously or not. But in the end I enjoyed even with the various downfalls, just because its Will Smith and the action was so good.Is it worth renting or buying or neither? Renting it once a year would be sufficientSupra Score: 6.5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Hancock's one-and-a-half-hour is an hour of formula done well and then a disappointing conclusion.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1917040/?ref_=tt_urv","johnnyboyz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0855231/?ref_=tt_urv","24 July 2008","Here is a superhero film that has its superhero inhabit a world in which the inhabitants themselves demonise the superhero rather than glorify him. If we look at the film poster for Hancock, we can see him in all his 'ugly' glory, an immediately unflattering appearance; thrust into our faces with large sunglasses and an illogical for-the-genre hat which, in my opinion, makes him look more daft than anything else. But this is part of the pull for the film Hancock; the gimmick being that he does not need a mask or a costume (at first) to hide his true identity like Spider Man or Batman do but indeed almost welcomes criticism and exposure by turning up in the most unruly of manners and 'saving the day' in the most unorthodox of manners. The scene in which he stops a car from being hit by a train and a whale from dying on a beach could easily have been handled in a better and more logical manner, but it's almost as if Hancock deliberately hits the train and the boat in these scenes to create problems.But Hancock is really two different sorts of beast. You can envisage the pitch and the idea for the film revolving around a superhero of everyday 'quality' who goes on his own minute journey of discovery and re-image but I think that's as far as the film goes in terms of good ideas. That is to say, when a certain element does make itself known the resulting plot point is both disorientating and disappointing. But mercifully, rather than give us a great point of attack before lambasting us with a daft resolution, the film creates a jovial atmosphere for the first two-thirds and generally keeps us interested rather than merely entertained for this period  it is the final third that needed more care and attention with that sole plot point the reason for the film coming off the rails a tad.The first thing you do notice about the film, and you don't have to be in a multiplex to identify it, is its hero is African-American. It's good but somewhat interesting to see a superhero of the non-white variety to perhaps rival the character of Blade, comic books of course being written decades ago at times of, shall we say, 'racial indifference' and thus; the majority of comic book heroes are of course white. But the film is still needlessly racist towards certain groups: the French boy named Michael (Faerch) who doubles up as a neighbourhood bully towards Aaron Embrey (Head) of the Embrey family that takes Hancock in, is in particularly poor taste as is Hancock's stereotypical view on Norwegians and what they typically look like. Additionally, did any one else notice the ridiculous subtitles during the beginning chase as said by the Vietnamese gangsters? Some of the subtitles were not even grammatically correct suggesting the Vietnamese speak in that fashion anyway. From memory, I think one of the lines were ""What you doing here!?"" But other than this the film is a textbook, and I mean textbook, example of how to establish a down and out character before rebuilding him and having him accomplish his goals. The film runs at 92 minutes according to IMDb, 62 minutes of those are the good stuff in which Hancock (Smith) will begin as a down and out guy; meet and be motivated by a mentor of some sort; go through a training montage (which are the prison scenes); overcome some fears and doubts before getting his opportunity to put ideas into practice and win through in the end. Some scenes that are in the textbook in this case are the ones in which Hancock begins to miss the basketball hoop and begins to speak out during the rehab seminars. He is then given the chance to redeem himself one day after receiving a phone call whilst in his cell  what will await him, him having learnt these new social skills and ability to channel energy? And so I can pinpoint the exact moment in which the film ends for me. It is when, during said test, the protagonist overcomes doubts and, in reference to cheesy superheroes of the past, gives a salute; wishes everyone luck in a booming 'Captain America' voice and probably should remind everyone to recycle or something, that he flies off having passed. From here the film hits a wall, a wall that even Hancock cannot recover from so God knows what it must've been made of. Certain coincidental revelations occur and I was disappointed since the film decides it needs a villain to round things off. Hancock is no longer a villain to himself so a third party needs to enter the fray and that was rather sad. Still, while it lasts Hancock is an entertaining and somewhat amusing ride although a lot of the jokes either miss the mark (such as the repeating 'pass' at the rehab) or are just not that funny for anyone aged over twenty.While the themes of religion feel out of place and the fact a certain group of individuals lay siege to a certain location for the finale to produce one of an explosive nature, Hancock is alright for what it is but what gripe I did have involved where Hancock was during most of the Twentieth Century  surely he could've helped out during the Pearl Harbour attack or the Munich Olympics hostage situation; I guess he, the slacker that he is, took those days off.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Edgy, conflicted, sarcastic, and misunderstood, Hancock's well-intentioned heroics might get the job done and save countless lives, but always seem to leave jaw-dropping damage in their wake. The public has finally had enough -- as grateful as they are to have their local hero, the good citizens of Los Angeles are wondering what they ever did to deserve this guy. Hancock isn't the kind of man who cares what other people think -- until the day that he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, and the sardonic superhero begins to realize that he may have a vulnerable side after all. Facing that will be Hancock's greatest challenge yet -- and a task that may prove impossible as Ray's wife, Mary, insists that he's a lost cause.After seeing the theatrical trailer for this movie, I didn't really want to see it as much as most summer movies. I didn't want to see Will Smith acting like an a-hole is his movies. I don't think anyone does but I saw this film anyway. And you know what? This has got to be one of the biggest surprises this summer! I loved it! Hancock is a movie where it answers the question, ""What happens if a superhero just doesn't care?"" And it does it great! Will Smith plays well as the misunderstood superhero. He does a great job. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are good supporting roles. What I didn't like about the film is that it was marketed in a wrong way. What you see in the trailers for this film is basically the first thirty minutes of the entire movie. It's marketed as a superhero comedy. Well, the jokes are funny but there are also dramatic scenes in here. It adds a surprising sense of sweetness in the film.Unlike other superhero movies, ""Hancock"" isn't based on a comic book so no one really has an idea of what's going to happen in this film and that's what makes the movie so great! Finally, a superhero movie that isn't predictable (in most cases). The film does a great job giving us the information that we would need to know, although it doesn't answer all the questions we want to know, like how Hancock obtained his powers and so on and so forth. The movie also has some surprising twists and turns to keep audiences interested. When you think this is going to happen, a twist comes to keep you off guard which makes the film quite refreshing and original than most superhero movies. The action scenes are good, although maybe not as big and great as you expect it to be.And I must say, John Powell does an EXCELLENT job with the score for the film. I also think this is one of Peter Berg's better films. Now don't go expecting what the TV spots and trailers show you. The film is quite sweet and has a good moral message in the end and doesn't really have as many jokes as you would expect. Will Smith does a great job playing the character and the film is quite fresh and original. Like I said, this has got to be the biggest surprise of this summer so far! And yes, this movie is quite entertaining! Go see it!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sure, he'll save the day but he'll most likely do millions of dollars worth of damage in the process. He's drunk, sloppy and surly (my three favorite dwarfs). When Hancock happens to rescue P.R. man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from an oncoming train, Embrey decides to repay him by focusing his marketing skills on Hancock.In a running gag, Hancock has an aversion to being called a certain insulting term (Hint: it ends with ""hole""). Every time he hears it, he feels compelled to react to the person using the word. What's that you say? As a matter of fact, it is just like Marty McFly in Back To The Future II & III. It was a silly plot device then and it's a silly plot device now.This movie feels like three different films cobbled together. There's the ""funny"" Hancock, there's the ""grim and gritty"" Hancock and there's the ""action/adventure"" Hancock. Any of them could have workednone of them did.Movies of this sort often create their own rules when it comes to the physical laws of nature. But if a film is going to do that, those rules need to remain consistent. At one point Hancock begins to lose his powers. But while this makes him no longer invulnerable he still posses his super strength. At another point, Hancock throws a child what must have been at least a mile in the air (and this is the ""funny"" Hancock, by the way) and catches him while standing still. In the real world, even if Hancock would have caught him he would have, at best, broken the kid's back. In a movie with a lighter tone, perhaps a Spiderman movie, this wouldn't be too much of a problem. But Hancock wants to be somewhat grounded in reality. Hancock is facing multiple lawsuits, he's wanted by the police but they have no real way to apprehend him because of his superpowers, when he lands at full speed he destroys the pavement. So when they completely break with reality for a cheap joke, it rings hollow.What little positive there is in this film comes from Will Smith and Jason Bateman. Smith and Bateman have real chemistry and it's a shame they weren't given something better to work with. While Bateman isn't really a big enough star to haggle over the screenplay quality of a summer tent pole picture, Will Smith most certainly is.For a screenplay that's supposedly been floating around Hollywood for over a decade, this movie seems hastily made. If you've ever wanted to see a superhero film without a super-villain, here's your chance. (And you might want to hurry because judging by the quality of this movie, I'm guessing it's your last chance.) I'm not really sure who this movie is for. It's too dark for younger kids and too juvenile for adults.The special effects are overly cartoonish. On more than one occasion, the director tries to hide substandard effects by having the camera move in a shaky, jerky fashion.Hancock is a mess.On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Men In Black and 1 being Wild, Wild West, Hancock gets a 4.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

An interesting premise to be sure, but it suffers from a poor 2nd half. The 1st half was very well done, both funny and believable, but once the dramatics started up in the 2nd half, with Hancock's backstory and twist, it became ridiculous. While the backstory was somewhat tolerable, the twist was not very well done. It felt incomplete and rushed like the writers wanted to do something far more with the story but they had ran out of ideas/time and decided to slap something on at the end. Once again, Will Smith is well, Will Smith. While he does a commendable job as always, much like his last venture, I Am Legend, he is once again letdown by an under developed script. Overall, Hancock wasn't a terrible film by any means, but it could have been so much more than what it ended up being, another mediocre superhero film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

One of the things I really liked about Hancock, was that while there's a superhero in it, it takes place in a world that's very real. People react like you would expect REAL people to react. Seeing a superhero that's not perfect - he steps up and tries, but he forgets that the rest of the world are regular people. Tearing off the side of a building is EXPENSIVE. I remember when I saw Ghost Rider, and they showed the devastation to the city street after GR tears it up, and I thought, ""Wow, you never see that! They always just wreak havoc, destroy the city, and then go have a soda while the world rebuilds behind their back. This is COOL."" Hancock was cooler :P The characters are great - but make no mistake, Will Smith and Charlize Theron are very, very good in this movie, but Jason Bateman plays the real hero. He may have reminded me a teensy bit too much of his character from Arrested Development, but let's face it, most of his characters have a similiarity. Doesn't matter - he was perfect. By the end, I was clapping and cheering for HIM.Don't pay any attention to what others say - this is a movie that you have to see for yourself; I could probably find something negative to say about it, but that would spoil it, and since I loved the ending, I won't spoil it by complaining about how I ALMOST didn't like how it ended.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This unique spin creates a dark superhero rare in comics. Spiderman has the tag line, "" with great power comes great responsibility."" He continually grapples with this throughout the comics, its what makes him likable. My point here is, every superhero has unique emotional attributes that help contribute to their mystique and popularity. Then there's Hancock.Hancock is a great idea, a fowl-mouth, drunk, politically incorrect superhero. And it makes senses, it must be hard to be all alone and really I'm sure collateral damage is sometimes hard to avoid as we've learned from The Incredibles. All in all the premise is great and some-what shocking. The tone was definitely more R than PG in parts, but it was enjoyable none the less.The problem is once Hancock starts getting into the groove of becoming his own brand of superhero like the greats I listed earlier, it starts to veer of into an unexpected and unwelcome twist.The main problem with the twist is it fails to flesh out the basis of Hancock's character and his unique superhero identity, basically him being an asshole. If they had continued to make it more comical than emotional I could have easily enjoyed the twist. Instead it throws on tons of throwaway background dialog and emotional tripe that doesn't belong unless its coupled with Hancocks trademark toilet humor, which it is not.Too many people are being caught up on the twist, but the twist isn't the problem the problem is the emotional weight of the twist is not coupled with the enigmatic humor that precipitated it and made Hancock's initial 45 minutes so enjoyable.I don't hate this movie. Not at all, it is good, but not great. There are definitely better comic movies out this summer. Pretty much all of them, ( Wanted, The Hulk, Iron Man.) But, it isn't a bad movie either and it is enjoyable to watch, it just has me scratching my head.

I really liked Will Smith with his witty acting making this movie have some truly funny parts from the beginning with drunken Hancock trying to do the right thing but screws it up no matter what he does. But then near the end I kind of lost interest and mainly wanted it to go a different route. Granted there were plot twists from a friend from the past revealing Hancock's past. Which was a lot to take in, in such a short notice. Then out of the blue a not so spectacular villain for Hancock to really care or truly worry about, but with the new found weakness of Hancock's which was a little convenient to make the villain able to hurt him and make us feel that Hancock should be in trouble. This all was just a little to coincidental that's all I'm saying!

I understand this to be a super-hero movie, but its content did not go together well from beginning to end. Yes, cheesy and corny are the correct words to sum up this movie. Don't Watch it!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

For the first 45 minutes or so it works, but then there is the surprise twist which didn't quite do it for me. On top of this there is no real strong villain to complement the hero. THe acting was pretty good, but otherwise this movie is just a little better than average.Hancock (Will SMith) is a drunken superhero who is the total anti-thesis of your typical hero. He swears, insults people, and uses his powers in a destructive manner, but you can see that deep down he wants to help people and doesn't know the exact way to make himself look better in the eyes of the people. Enter Ray (Justin Bateman) as a PR guy who wants to change Hancock's image for the better. On top of this we have Ray's wife Mary (Charlize THeron) who we can tell by the way she acts around Hancock that they have some type of history together that Hancock is not sure of. I 'll go no farther into the plot, but I will say that with Ray's help, Hancock does change his image for the better, and near the end of the film starts becoming mortal for reasons I can not tell without spoiling the movie.The acting is rather well done, but the special effects do not look as if 150 million was spent. I can accept cheesy special effects if the story works, but with Hancock the story never takes off because he has no real strong villain to face off against. The ending is rather weak, but the acting is well enough to carry it somewhat though not enough for me to recommend it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jason Bateman is wonderful as the mild-mannered, good-hearted PR man who takes Hancock under his wing and helps him turn his life around. Charlize Theron makes less of a first impression but really comes into her own when the major plot twist is revealed.The script isn't frequently laugh-out-loud funny but it's consistently amusing and one scene involving two prisoners threatening Hancock is an absolute classic and worth the price of admission alone. Hancock's Kryptonite comes in an unusual form and whereas these things often end up somewhat gimmicky - the green stuff is a case in point - in Hancock not only is it a neat idea but it actually serves the story.Producer Michael Mann's stamp is all over it, and it's shot in a gritty, realistic style that is at first jarring but as the plot unfolds and the tone establishes itself becomes perfectly fitting.It suffers maybe from a weak villain who's introduced too late and the rotten CGI in a movie with this budget is unforgivable, but those are about the only serious things it has going against it. The trailers and TV spots made this look thoroughly obnoxious but renting it despite my better judgement I found it to be not only a lot of fun but one of the most emotionally mature superhero movies out there, and probably the most moving of the ones I've seen.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I truly believe the trailer gave the wrong impression to a wide vote of people that the movie was going to be a comedy. The movie even starts off of a comedic foot only to switch feet abruptly about 45 minutes in. Was the shift to drama unneeded? Yes, the movie could've done perfectly fine without if it kept up it's upbeat comedy tempo but the shift did add some substance to the film although the shift to the drama wasn't the smoothest of shifts. Will Smith did a great job as did Charlize Theron but who really came out and did the best was Jason Batemen. My only true gripe with Hancock was the repetition of some scenes (i.e. Prison Talk Scene, Basketball Scene) and the crappy camera work in the majority of the shots. Now while the remainder of the movie after the shift was no where near the greatness of the beginning half, the movie still lands out at solid 7 out of 10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

When Hancock was released in 2008 there was no DCEU, and there wasn't really an MCU either. Comic-book movies (of which this is not) and superhero movies were still struggling and finding their feet. Outside of Spider-Man, many of them were alienating and disappointing audiences (Hulk, Superman Returns, Fantastic Four) and while that may still be the case with most of these exhausting franchises, they are so ubiquitous that the hits cover-up the significant misses.Hancock divided audiences in 2008 with many not understanding what it was trying to say or do. Now, more than ever, is it time to give Hancock a re-evaluation?Will Smith (as his career was beginning a downturn) stars as a man with an unknown past who has superpowers, only his faith in people and enthusiasm for life causes the citizens of his hometown of Los Angeles to not appreciate his careless, lazy efforts at fighting crime and rescuing those in trouble. When he saves idealist public relations expert Ray Embrey (the always delightful Jason Bateman) from a trainwreck he is encouraged to turn around his attitude and allow the world to embrace him as a hero who really cares. But Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) has secrets of her own and might know everything about Hancock's mysterious past.This alone would have been enough to make a unique, adult-themed superhero movie, but it seems that several re-writes of the script decided that some kind of villain needed to be shoehorned in there where it didn't belong, and the movie flounders in the final act as a standard Hollywood ending conflicts and deflates the many new ideas that came before it. I still enjoy it way more than Deadpool (an ugly, depressing film which I despise). The 92-minute running time screams of a difficult time in the editing room and the struggle to find a traditional narrative in the flurry of ideas that were written, re-written, re-drafted, and re-arranged during the scripting phase. The movie was originally written in 1996 with the rather worrying title of Tonight, He Comes and was about a kid who struck up a friendship with a fallen superhero - really quite different from the final product.With no toxic fanbase behind it, Hancock comes with a clean slate and is enjoyable as a comedy with some okay action scenes. We're all jaded and indifferent to this stuff by now and the physics and frequent 9/11 porn of superhero movies has been done to absolute, stone-cold, death, DEATH, D-E-A-T-H. Please stop making these! At least it doesn't end with a big blue light shooting up into the sky.Peter Berg's direction is always merely a pastiche of whatever his peers are doing at the time, and Hancock has no unique visual flair, which would have been just fine if the original idea at its core was allowed to shine through the muddle of changes it obviously went through. It's a horse made by a committee.It's a camel.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Hancock is the superhero, but his friend Ray is heroic in his own way and that adds a style not usually found in movies of this type.This is a very good movie, but very underrated by people.

Nonetheless, at the end of the movie I still felt that there was just something missing to keep this movie in the race with other summer blockbusters like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk.

He acted in the recent movie, I am Legend and his movies usually make a lot of money. His new movie, Hancock, is good fun although there are some disappointment. I have seen Peter berg's The kingdom which is intense with big gun shootout in the end. I must say that Hancock almost has the same style of The Kingdom- the unsteadiness of the camera, things that explode and some more. The fight scenes and the villains should be better, it is not what I expected but because of the story.The story: Will Smith plays Hancock, a destructive superhero who does not care about destroying people's things like cars, train and buildings. People hate him. He saves a guy, Ray, who considerably asks Hancock to do what he is supposed to. Hancock spends his time in jail, trying to turn a new leaf. Soon, when crimes rates are rising, Hancock saves the world. Just the usual superhero story but Hancock is a superhero that is destructive and says anything he want to say. Unlike other superheroes who are usually good and well-mannered, Hancock does anything he like- not taking things into consideration. I would not really call this an usual superheroes movies, it would be more of an action drama with people with powers added.Overall: Is it good? Well,I would say that it is okay. I thought it could have done more better. With the runtime, it is okay as it is made that it would not be boring. There are twists on the way to the end. Other than that, it got the humour and Will Smith is good. If you are a fan of Will Smith, you should probably catch this out. If you like superheroes movies, this one should fit you but don't expect too much. It would be good to watch this in cinema, you get to see some thrilling action rushing into your way.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

He channels Michael Bay here, with the signature saturated look and big explosions and appetite for destruction.Will Smith is as good as ever, and Jason Bateman is good as a straight man, though I've seen him in funnier roles. Charlize Theron is great too.The action scenes are great. The opening freeway scene, the bank scene, the city fight scene, and the hospital fight were all great and very well done. The prison scene is great too, and funny. The violence here is surprisingly brutal and graphic for a PG-13 superhero film, and apparently it had to be cut a few times to obtain a PG-13.It's a pretty entertaining movie, especially since it's an original superhero flick and not a comic book or video game adaptation.

Yes, he has powers that probably exceed Superman, Spiderman and just about any other magical crime fighter. But, he lives like a homeless man, drinks like a fish, and uses foul language in his efforts. Although he has saved lives in the Los Angeles area, he has also destroyed property. The powers that be, and the common folk alike, sneer at him. One day, however, he saves the life of a public relations officer, Ray (Jason Bateman) whose car is stuck on a train track. Its quite a rescue since Ray's car ends upside down. Although all bystanders make fun of Hancock, Ray thanks him heartily and takes him home to dinner. Once there, Hancock awes Ray's son, Aaron, but doesn't impress the PR man's gorgeous wife, Mary (Charlize Theron). Strange, since he saved her hubby's life. As Hancock wolfs down his plate of spaghetti and meatballs, Ray offers his help. What Hancock really needs, says Ray, is an image change. If he stops drinking and swearing and even goes to jail, briefly, for the havoc he has caused, the superhero can be loved and appreciated again. What a concept! Hancock actually agrees to the plan and ends up in jail, where he refuses to use his powers, except on the basketball court. But, when Mary and Aaron visit, Hancock is confused about his feelings for Ray's wife. Mary is, in fact, harboring secrets, which spill out in good time. These hidden truths could change the lives of Ray, Mary, Aaron, Hancock and the world. What will happen? This is an entertaining film, thanks to nice performances by the principal three actors and great special effects. Smith is always a charmer, Theron is a lovely and fine actress and Bateman's surprises with his ""nice guy"" turn, without a bit of sarcasm. As stated, the effects are a huge bonus, with cars ending up on top of skyscrapers, basketballs going through hoops acres away from the shooter and the like. Nevertheless, it can't be considered a bonafide winner for a few reasons. One, the plot is imaginative but doesn't truly make sense and falls flat near the end. Then, too, parents will not be pleased with the initial appearances of Hancock, where he is guzzling booze from a fifth, using bad language and showing little respect for anyone. Since Hancock does undergo a nice reformation, older children will benefit if parents watch the film with them. Indeed, the lessons of Hancock on living a ""decent life"" are one of the best aspects of the entire movie. Therefore, if you are a fan of the cast, science fiction, and/or superhero flicks, get Hancock soon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Here, a superhero with questionable methods falls out of favour with the public and enlists the help of a PR professional to repair his image.This is an interesting premise, though hardly original (""The Incredibles"" comes to mind, for one). However, apparently this premise didn't provide quite enough material for an entire film so the film-makers decided to tack on another equally slight storyline. As a result, the film feels like two different films, neither of which is especially compelling.The cast is pretty decent, though. Will Smith is perhaps Hollywood's most bankable star and while this performance certainly isn't among his most memorable it is ably handled. Charlize Theron turns in a pretty good performance as well while Jason Bateman plays the same sort of character that he always plays.Peter Berg's direction isn't bad though I'm not a fan of his style, which blends a gritty look with lots of jittery camera-work (see ""The Kingdom"" for a more pronounced example). The special effects are good enough but certainly nothing to write home about. Score & soundtrack are average and pretty forgettable.In the end, the movie is somewhat entertaining but the script could have definitely used some work. I'd rather have one fully fleshed out story than two thin stories any day. With this shortcoming, the movie is unlikely to appeal to many outside of the target audience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It thinks it is progressive by presenting a story of fateful inter-racial partners with no qualms and on the flip-side mocking homosexual people. WRONG!

I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" and those who enjoy Will Smith.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. ***John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your usual superhero. He's an alcoholic, self centred, socially inept, washed-up wino. His bungled attempts at super-heroics, crater-making landing zones and mass vandalism in the line of duty cause more costly damage than the criminals and natural disasters he's sworn to stop. When Hancock rescues a PR executive (played by Juno's Jason Bateman), from certain death, he's offered the opportunity to redeem himself. In complete contrast to the low-life representation that advertising types generally get in the majority of Hollywood movies, Bateman's Ray Emery is the most morally upright, ethically upstanding and commendable PR man committed to celluloid. He offers to re-brand Hancock, making him the respectable, wholesome hero that he clearly has the potential to be.It's a great premise. Hancock has powers comparable to those of Superman, and in this age of every-other-blockbuster being of comic book origins, it's refreshing to accept that these talents are a given, bypassing the usual far-fetched back story that could encumber the tale of comical super-heroism. The film dives straight into the action and flies along at a blistering pace, a trait now inherent with one-to-watch director Peter Berg, who seems to have perfected his intense hand-held style that served him so well during 'the Kingdom' (2007). Hancock is a funny one. Not just in the humorous sense either. Yes, there are head-up-the-ass gags and plenty of cartoon-esquire visual humour (though the best of this has already been seen in the previews and pre-release hype), but there are large amounts of well executed action and even soap style drama to boot. It's also funny, in that it's odd. It's not easily pigeonholed. Contrary to the hype, this isn't a typical summer blockbuster or spoof superhero fluff. Will Smith plays his part just as seriously as he has in his latest roles, the Oscar nominated 'Pursuit of Happiness' (2006), and 'Ali' (2001), even last year's 'I am Legend'. The film's marketing touts Hancock's comedy values, but in reality the Fresh Prince doesn't crack a smile throughout. The comedy is entirely consequential, going on around the title character but never as a result of a wisecrack or quip that we know the actor can handle so deftly. It's a brave move, and it's to the credit of Smith, Berg, and the film's writers that, for the most part, it's a gamble that pays off.Further praise must go to Director Peter Berg's incredibly confident execution, particularly given his relatively short directorial career. The tight structure, distinctive camera work and sheer pace really show his skill and individuality. If Hancock had stuck with the original premise  the hero's road to redemption - for which there's more than enough material to fill the scant 92 minute running time, then this could have been a real winner. As portrayed so effectively in the recent Iron Man, there's plenty of fun to be had from a hero honing his skills. The scene is set for Hancock to really exploit the comedic potential of this concept as he goes cold turkey and works towards perfecting his powers. Unfortunately, this opportunity is, to a certain extent, squandered as it's over all too soon. The decision to fall back on the familiar 'how it all began' plot line, after spending the first half of the film rendering this device redundant seems more destructive than any of the lead character's actions. Subsequently, the second half of the film is a disappointment with the third act in particular being surprisingly downbeat. The tale of origins is pointless nonsense and completely unnecessary given such a promising premise. Hancock has some laugh out loud moments and action set pieces to rival any of the big name comic blockbusters we've seen so far this year, but like the man himself, it's nowhere near as super as it could be.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An oddly enough ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2249871/?ref_=tt_urv","AngelDel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21035753/?ref_=tt_urv","14 May 2010","Hancock is enjoyable, but has three little drawbacks: Will Smith, the clumsy usage of visual effects and (how not so?) the script .Although Will Smith has proved that he can act like an actual actor (see the heart-warming The Pursuit of Happiness), most of the films he gets involved in are just commercial blockbusters, with all their negative connotations (his first actual big-screen hit, Independence Day, may have set the tone...). And if he can get involved in the production (and he does again in Hancock) and show off a bit, better still. Show off chest muscles, or backside, or simply poses... You can tell he likes that. He shows off less minutes than in previous films, but he shows off. Just like in I, robot, or I am legend. Still, there's something about Will Smith's presence that stops you from hating him so much despite all this. Odd. Whether this is charisma or not, or whether this film should have been called ""I am Hancock"" is obviously not the purpose of these lines.All the visual effects from the trailer and used as bait seem to happen rather soon in the film. Which is good, since they aren't anything special or unseen before. After that, for a moment, it seems the story will acquire deeply human overtones and leave effect in the background... but then the film takes an unfortunate and inexplicable path and we come back to visual effects ad infinitum. No surprises here.But we also come back to a much darker atmosphere that changes the style of the film and that (again) seems to be uncalled for. There is a similar confusion with the genre itself: comedy, more dramatic at times, ""adventure"" parts, ... The surprising and unconventional approach probably comes from the intention of making a different superhero film. In practice, however, the producers truly seem indecisive about this, and so ended up creating a strange hybrid creature.All the above, plus the fact that the relationship between characters is awkward and twisted results in, yes, an entertaining film, but one that doesn't make the most of itself or even reach the end of the story looking like it's the end of the story. If you are reading this in disbelief, go and watch it: the cleaners may have to kick you out, because you won't believe the film is over. As spectators, we are entitled to a fulfilling experience. And if a script doesn't give us this ultimate experience, then we feel emptiness in our film goer hearts. Subconsciously, we ask for more and we can't help cursing the experience.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had not seen this in theaters because it didn't look like a movie for me. After watching the movie, I was taken by surprise a bit. I expected this awful drawn out corny plotted film. Although the plot can be considered to be a bit ""corny"" I think it almost helps the movie. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. So I'm thinking that's like an average score, maybe a C in a class? It held my attention, made me laugh a few times, gave me those great 1 liners that you can't get out of your head for 2 days after. But it also had a somewhat nice ending, throughout the movie you start to predict what will happen, but the nice thing is, it almost gives you several options as to ""what could happen."" I think that's a huge positive aspect in this movie. So would I recommend the movie? If you're at the video store, or on your Netflix account, can't seem to figure out what you want to see next, give it a try.

I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull!

When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell, that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey story!

The comedy is stunted by the all too serious tones and the lack of any real villain is a major downside because what it gets right and what we are treated to most of is the superhero side and no baddie equals why bother?Bad points aside though this is a good film. The special effects are top notch and we are treated to some great flying effects and fight scenes. The humour is snappy and spot on with some great delivery by Smith although it is just a bit too sparce and I feel more could have been put in to the script without the danger of it becoming comedy farce.I can see what the director is trying to do with the drama and it works with the subject matter but to tackle such deep psychological subjects of a superhero you really need something epic and fleshed out and as stated before, it's too much of a lot of things at once and never gets to a climax with any of them.A special mention has to go to the soundtrack. The selection of moody down and out blues mixed with some well placed funk and rap songs at appropriate moments really lifts the character and emphasises the fact that this is a much needed black superhero in a world of lilly white comic book crimefighters.Hancock is worth checking out, indeed if like me you are a fan of such superheros (Personally I like any film where someone has the ability to fly) but the film does seem to blow it's load in the first half an hour and descends into more grim territory later on.It would certainly be worthy of a more fleshed out sequel because when an idea is this good it would be a shame to let it die!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unexpected and totally unexplained plot elements and character motivations, confusing mythology, mediocre action sequences, and an unsatisfying conclusion just killed this movie.

It was released back in 2008, during the whole superhero resurgence with films such as Iron Man and The Dark Knight that were both well received both commercially and financially. Of course, now in 2017 superhero movies are pretty much a cottage industry, with some feeling there's an over-saturation, but that's neither here or there. Hancock is about an alcoholic superhero with a big PR problem. He's rude, crass, and he's an alcoholic, and it goes without saying the public doesn't like him. Hancock saves Ray, a PR agent and after that, the movie takes off. Ray wants to repackage him as a better superhero and they develop a friendship of sorts as the movie goes along. Hancock's first act is rather brilliant, it plays almost like a David Chappelle skit with Hancock involved in all kinds of crazy shenanigans. Alas, the movie kind of falls apart under the weight of its own mythology in the second act. There are some interesting things at play with the mythology but the tones from the first two acts never feel organic, it almost felt like it was trying to be two different films. The first act felt like a satire on the superhero genre and the second act felt like a darker superhero film. Anyway I digress, the third act is rather underwhelming with a cookie cutter villain who has no presence whatsoever, it almost felt like they needed to throw in a villain just to wrap the film up . However, that's not to say that the film doesn't have any positives. Will Smith is great as Hancock, he gives the character gravitas underneath all his smugness. Hancock starts out as a rather unlikable character but as the story goes on they do a good job of humanizing him. Jason Bateman is great as Ray, and Charlize Theron is great as Ray's wife, Mary. To give anything else away would spoil the film. I guess this movie is worth a rental if you haven't seen it already. By the way, for you Breaking Bad fans out there, the script to Hancock was co-written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. So I guess it's kind of cool to see his earlier work from back in the day. Hancock had its moments, but overall it's a mixed bag both as a comedy and a superhero film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In fact, the whole cast and the viewers deserved something better.This is one of the worst movies that I've ever saw, along with ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""The Game Plan"". It was directed by Peter Berg (The director of ""Friday Night Lights"") and this is, by far, his worst movie. It was horrible, completely unwatchable.Like I said before, I hate this film. With passion. I know it is strange, but this could be easily the worst movie ever made: The plot was lame, the characters were annoying and irritating, the especial effects were poor...Everything about this film was terrible.

It's not Marvel or DC but it wears it's comic book adventure elements on it's sleeve in live-action form. Will Smith gives a good performance as well as Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (DAMN this woman is SEXY!!) admirably. I enjoyed the action and touching moments Hancock and the special effects are good in a naturalistic setting with some well-timed comedic moments thrown in. The fact that it's not an entirely superhero movie is also a plus and that makes it stand out a little amongst the big-name superhero movies coming out this summer; namely Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight. However, the only fault in Hancock is that there's no real central villain and not enough info on Will and Theron's origins and the possibilities of others like them (especially towards the climax). There's no doubt I couldn't help but feel that some juicy material was removed from the final cut. So in all respects, Hancock is a good film and I must say that I liked it and is original in it's presentation but the film could've used more oomph, content wise. I'm sure it made a lot at the box-office and got good reviews. Only time will tell if it's successful enough to warrant a sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought it was just something that would go away after the very first closeup of Hancock, but no it just continued on and on and on.Lots of other things wrong with this movie. The jokes fell flat (especially with that whole a$$hole thing, a clear ripoff of Back to the future), the action was weak (other than the brief two-minute fight between Hancock and another individual), and the movie constantly felt as if it was being pulled in too many directions. It couldn't decide whether it was a drama, a comedy, a science fiction movie, etc. Basically what you saw in the trailer were all the ""momentous"" moments of the movie, everything else was just boring filler material.The only reason this gets a 3 is because as always Will Smith looks like he put in as much effort as possible into making this something.

I've heard people say that the comedy in this movie is unrealistic. I couldn't disagree more. Hobo drinking a lot. Realistic. Hobo smells like liquor and destroys stuff unintentionally. Not realistic, but still funny. Well, you get the point. I have also heard people criticize this movie because a woman is one of the heroes. Are you derogatory much, people? I am not a woman, I am a dude, but I do think every once in a while you should add woman superheroes into movies to keep things mixed up and fresh. But, that is just what I think. Oh, before I start actually reviewing this movie, if you are watching it with a small kid, which, I don't think you should do, turn off the subtitles and you hear probably 10 less cuss words than you would if you had the them on. Anyway, this movie is very, very good. I think that almost everything was spot-on with what you want in an action or superhero movie, meaning that everything a action/superhero fan would like, like the flying, super strength, or super speed. Well, sort of super speed. In this movie, unlike many others, the superhero doesn't picture his self as a hero, famous, and super hot. The hero pictures himself sort of as an average Joe, if you know what I mean. Just goes to regular houses, doesn't have a larger than superhuman persona (heehee, funny), and just looks like a regular guy. He doesn't have huge, gigantic muscles, he just has muscles. And I think that really enriches the story because it gives you a sense of realism. It also makes the story a tiny bit more believable. It's not believable, really, but I'm sure you know what I mean. The special effects of this movie are also very believable, because most of the scenes don't require a huge amount special effects. Some do, though. This means that a lot of times, there is not tons of effort needed for the special effects people, which have a lot of skill in this field. OK, so I guess it's about time I review the three main aspects of the film, as I call them. They are acting, directing, and the dialogue, as well as music. The acting was pretty much great, except for the fact that sometimes the delivery of punchlines aren't delivered very well. There isn't the much desired ""umph"" of good punchlines. I guess that goes along with dialogue, too. Other than that, the acting was displayed very well by Theron and Smith, who actually made a good duo. They made a kind of combination that makes sparks, but not romantically. Meaning that they just fit together without the slightest problem. Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, is also a great addition to the movie. He provides some of the comedy of the movie, but not as much as Smith does. He is the soft character of the movie, and keeps the tone of the film light when it is needed. Jae Head, as usual, is a great acting kid, and did a wonderful job in this movie, as he did in The Blind Side. Good movie, by the way. The directing style of this movie is fairly unique, because instead of still cameras and slow panning to the sides, it is fast- paced, and action-y. It also isn't still, but isn't so shaky that it gives you a headache. It's kind of in the middle, where a lot of people like it, including me. That's really all I can say about the directing. The dialogue, now. The dialogue is really good in this movie, and I'm serious. The movie has a sense of realism, and it is enhanced very much by the masterful writing. There isn't a big line with a dude in tights that is said on top of a mountain, which can only work in a select few superhero movies. The writers did a really good job fitting in some of the back story in the movie, that unfolds gradually and smoothly. Which really isn't found that much anymore. Also, the costume isn't super blingy and in your face. It's just a leather suit with some designs on it. I guess I liked the movie a lot more than I would have if it was a normal superhero flick because it gave you a break from all of that in your face stuff. The writers did throw in a lot of unnecessary cursing in there. Honestly, I don't care, but there were about 20 use of the a word combined with hole, that it added about 15 seconds to the movie. All by saying that word. Just thought that was kind of unneeded. It's one of the reasons I gave this only an 8. The writers also made some good quotes for Hancock, which are all said so that they are funny and comedic, instead of serious and unfunny. Which also made the dialogue better. Now the music. The music really didn't stand out that much but there was one scene that used the theme from Sanford & Son that was really funny. Make sure you at least watch to that part. I do recommend this movie to anyone who likes fresh spins on superhero movies. Hope you liked this review, and please read some of my others. See ya guys!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

He destroys as much as he saves. The LA public has turned against him. He saves PR expert Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) and Ray is determined to return the favor by saving Hancock's image. Ray brings Hancock back home for dinner but Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) isn't happy to have Hancock around.On the surface, this is a great premise. It has good comedic potential. It would work better if he was a klutz instead of an alcoholic. Hancock is just too unlikeable. And the last half of the movie leaves me confused with more questions than answers. Was there even a climax? That one handed fool can't be the criminal mastermind that is his nemesis. Is there a nemesis? Director Peter Berg has now become an expert on action scenes. I have no doubt about his action directing. But he needs to think about what the story should be. Who the heck is Hancock? I can't really answer that properly after watching it twice. The movie clunks along without much suspense or tension. Every once in awhile there's an action scene.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Having heard that the film had been pared down to fit the ratings for PG-13, I kept feeling that Will Smith and crew should have gone for the R rating anyways. Most of the people going to see it probably feel that way. Will Smith was looking fabu in his hero suit and Charize Therron always keeps me entertained. I enjoyed some of the scenes with Will Smith (Hancock) and some neighborhood kids - that made me chuckle. Goodness knows, I've wasted more time on theatrical duds in my lifetime.

Lacked major conflicts, intimidating a villain, and a more coherent script","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9613293/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","10 February 2024","Hancock is directed by Peter Berg, the professional behind the regular The Rundown (2003) and Friday Night Lights (2004) and The Kingdom (2007). And brings something different to tell a story about a superhero unconventional. Adaptations of superheroes are increasingly common from 2000, where several beloved characters of the comic also invaded the cinema. But Hancock is a different hero. He is not coming from the comics, with an original idea, as well as the world and environment in which it is inserted. Far from cities that exist only in comics or specific worlds. Hancock lives in Los Angeles these days and their personality characteristics or behavior are not friendly to children or adults, and almost an anti-hero.John Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero who is always drunk, bitter, sad, alone and misunderstood that it had lost popularity due to its unconventional rescue attempts that end up destroying the city. He does not hesitate to destroy bridges and buildings to prevent theft or derail a whole train to save a single person. In current times, Hancock is a superhero that does not interest anybody, because the cost / benefit ratio is not appropriate and the population begins to demand that he be punished for the damage to public property. After saving Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), one public relations agent trying to sell your own seal of quality for large companies, provided that they commit to donate their own products to people in need, he offers to help you improve your image. The idea is not well accepted by Mary (Charlize Theron), the wife of Ray, who shows her husband that Hancock had an arrest warrant against him thrown. Ray then suggests that Hancock was delivered to the police, even though they could escape from prison at the time he wanted to set an example to people and initiate change his public image. Ray believes that with Hancock arrested, crime will trigger and, therefore, the population will call back their hero. Ray will then try to make him a superhero ""within standards."" Hancock also have to deal with romantic tension that arises between him and Mary. At first she did not like the hero and makes that clear, but it is the key to Hancock better understand its past.The film features familiar names in its production, as Akiva Goldsman, Jonathan Mostow, Michael Mann and Will Smith himself, is a very valid attempt to create a new superhero unconventional, bringing your personality weaknesses, conflicts and behaviors as well humans, who are in search of redemption. The writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan bring a good mix of various genres. We share very well supported by great special effects, a dose of drama, adventure and comedy that essentially is the fundamental basis of the plot. Until a few remnants of romance can be perceived.Will Smith is the great hallmark of his films. The actor is beautiful, has physical strength, is versatile, and every year gets better and better as an actor and is, above all, extremely charismatic. In any project he decides to venture is certain that millions of people will be taken to the cinema halls. His last film surpassed the $ 100 million easily. Therefore, a film actor, depending on the genre, is guaranteed to thrill and in this case, to have fun and entertain.We soon realized how this new hero. During a police chase, Hancock sleeps on a street bank with bottles of drink in hand, when he is awakened by a child who shows him in a store the chase broadcast live on television. Not very happy, he grabs a bottle of drink, stir in the skirt of a woman and goes flying clumsy and wobbly. Later on it will destroy some public assets and already we can see the population revolted by massive destruction.Hancocké a kind of critical and at the same time a parody of superhero comics and movies, which are always seen as perfect, flawless behavior that is totally donate to save others and who are worshiped in their own universes. John Hancock is now the opposite of all this. No wonder that Hancock is not admired because of their behavior, attitudes and bad examples totally egocentric, you do not care about the opinions of others. For these reasons, the beginning is even hard to create some empathy with the character, but the lighter tone and comedy as well as we know the best, it becomes enjoyable. The scenes where he performs with a uniform and try to be more sociable are hilarious. It's as if the character Ray was teaching a child to behave in front of others.Earlier, before Ray convince him to change to be accepted, we have very funny scenes, like the persecution of robbers logo in the opening scene, the rescue train track and ""rescue"" the beached whale seen through a video posted on the Internet. The scenes of him in jail also take good laugh. Even after already out of jail, the scenes remain. The sequence of the assault was one of the best as well as the short dialogue with the police: ""You let me touch it?"". In some jokes, however, the text searching and force some situations where it should not start laughing, as in the choice of uniform hero.Importantly, for these and other action scenes, director Peter Berg had a great budget of $ 150 million that allowed him to extrapolate and use all the creativity. We see a shot of whale and a boy, thrust striking inside the jail, intercepting a train at high speed, landing with feet on the asphalt of the street, not to mention the scenes of flight performed linearly and very natural. The special effects are the highlight of the film, which are used mostly in the final climax. The footage of Berg performed in much close mostly and with the camera shaking, sometimes even appearing in a more documentary gives a greater sense of immersion and realism in action in the midst of action.The script is lost already in the final, which inserts a twist not too happy, with a plot involving aliens who may not live near one another. Peter Berg, trying to explore relationships between Hancock, just as the mood abruptly and focuses on drama, to bring some answers from the past of the protagonist. This is where the text becomes without much meaning without emotion and even confusing. The only good thing is that Charlize Theron, who spends much of the film without function begins to have importance in the outcome of long.Another fact is that when the director always focuses on the face of Charlize Theron, pointing to the obvious fact that it hides some mystery, even though we do not know exactly what the mystery. What you may have missed the most is the presence of a villain to match. Even if the intention is to show the personality of Hancock and its acceptance in society, lacked any threat more interesting in the end. The villain Red (Eddie Marsan) does not transmit threat at any time and is another element that makes the end does not work as it should.As already mentioned, Charlize Theron is once again incredibly beautiful and during the long ends up having an important role in the resolution of the plot. More serious roles and dense, the actress decided to venture into a genre lighter and fun. Knowing the power of the actress, she does very well, even though there is great depth in the script. Jason Bateman is also the will as Ray and form a nice duo with Will Smith. The contrast between optimism and negativism an optimal yield of the other scenes between the two. The chemistry between Will and Charlize is also worthy of mention.The soundtrack by John Powell (X-Men 3 - The Last Stand (2006), PS I Love You (2007)), is effective and has perfect sync with editing agile Colby Parker Jr. And Paul Rubell. Photograph of Tobias Schliessler well detached Los Angeles and also in darker scenes, and art direction by William Hawkins and Dawn Swiderski also composes well more modern language adopted by the director.In a decade with the premiere of several films of superheroes, the presence of anti-hero Hancock looked promising, especially with Will Smith as his interpreter, but even being a good movie even with the final straight hinder an overall assessment of adventure. Lacked major conflicts, intimidating a villain, and a more coherent script. Anyway, it is an excellent entertainment fast, disposable, but innovates in the synopsis and no doubt is very interesting.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Were not high but not that low either, i expected a few laughs but nothing impressing. Turns out that i was wrong, i laughed more than a few times and the movie was in some ways pretty impressing.How?

Maybe this is just me, but i think that if the movie would have continued the way it had been until the later part, it definitely would have got higher ratings...Hancock is a film including funny comics and some decent drama parts, i'd never thought this but the original score wasn't pretty bad.

This isn't like most superhero movies, there isn't a ton of action, there is no supervillain, and the the protagonist isn't perfect. The protagonist deals with alcoholism, clumsiness, is disrespectful, and has anger management issues for most of this film. The film centers around Hancock's public image. The city residents of LA hate Hancock for the damage caused by his actions even though he saves many people. The difficulties faced by the protagonist are what many could imagine would be the difficulties of a real life superhero rather than a comic book hero. Because of this, despite the story being about a man with super-powers. The story still feels very realistic and relatable to the audience. Many have complained about the plot twist (no spoilers) and said that it disrupted the plot too much. I don't really agree with that though as I found the plot twist to still be remaining in the context. It certainly changes some things but I didn't get the feeling that the movie was ruined because of it. If however, you don't like a movie with a lot of grey morality characters, this movie is not for you since that's basically what the whole plot line is about. If you do however, then this movie is perfect and you will love it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who asked me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Others think that it starts well but ends weak, in my opinion it starts quite weak, but once you understand the characters better and Charlize Theron is introduced to the story it really gets going.The main reason why it wasn't great is because it should have been better, the script could have been stronger and the action is a bit too tongue in cheek.Hancock is a good film that keeps you entertained, however it has a few flaws that make it forgettable and puts it in the ""to rent"" pile.

The role of Hancock suits him down to the ground and allows him to show off his talents without making you want to stick your fingers down your throat.The concept of the flawed superhero in need of a PR expert is great and for the most part it plays out very nicely. However, the story goes off the deep end towards the end and loses its self-awareness to a large extent as the Hollywood theatrics creep in. Having said that, this is a nice short film that doesn't drag on or weigh you down with backstory and pretentiousness. The fairly average CGI and predictable ending prevent it from being particularly memorable but it is certainly far better than I expected.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, the latter helps rehabilitate Hancock.Yes, it had a few laughs but I couldn't wait until it was over.If you are going to a movie I'd recommend The Dark Knight, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Wanted, or Meet Dave.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Why? Yes, I know the bottom line is bucks and nothing but bucks, but doesn't someone in Tinseltown have the wit to make a movie which will keep the cash tills rolling and, for once, still avoid the buckets of treacly sentimentality which Hollywood has made its own? Someone, somewhere please! Hancock is a very good case in point. It is not your usual run of the mill film, it has several nice twists, there is a certain originality in the story and it seems set to break the mould and end on a downbeat, although not one which would be too downbeat. But no, we can't have that, can we. The Western World wants to believe in the Tooth Fairy and sundry notions that it will all come good in the end, so Hancock, too, is obliged to go down the road of slushy sentimentality and end up on a cheery note, so that the punters can 'feel good'. Perhaps there's something wrong with me that my heart actually sinks when everything ends up white picket fences and fresh apple pie. The irony is that Hancock has a good story to tell and at its centre is something of an enigma. The special effects are also something else, and although everyone and his dog now knows that the magic is nothing but several hundred special effects artists spending several months behind their Apple Macs, there's is still that wow factor. How do they do it, how do they have superhero Hancock smash into buildings and take huge chunks out of the masonry? Computers, of course. Yeah, right — but how? Look elsewhere for a synopsis of Hancock. It always seems rather daft to spend most of these reviews retelling what happened. Will Smith is, as always, Will Smith and I have always liked Will Smith, ever since his Fresh Prince days. It would be good to see him stretch himself a little with some character acting but . . . Charlize Theron deserves a great deal of credit for allowing several close-ups to be used which show her skin is less than perfect, but she is, after all, of Afrikaner stock and such people are at tad more down to earth than your average nubile Mid-West wannabe. Don't let me put you off this film (especially, of course, if you are in the majority and are something of a sucker for sentimental, schlocky closure) but all I can say is that I have a niggling suspicion the Hancock, in other hands, produced in another culture could have been a far better film. As it is it gets 6/7 out of 10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Hancock presents himself to the world as the superhero who is strong, takes on a thousand bullets at one stand and smashes everything in his way, do not give a damn about what others things about his action.But, for himself, he is a broken man with some skills which barely fill his plate and an alonely human who is confused about who he is where he was and where he should be headed.But, one day he save a random PR expert named Ray Embrey who was about to be hit by a train in a car, by stopping a train and flipping his car, doing huge damage to the train and nearly injuring Ray and a few others. Though people disgust him for this action Ray stands for Hancock and thinks to repay him for saving his life by helping him to gain what he truly wanted, to be accepted and loved as a true superhero.At the end of the first half yes, Hancock becomes the hero he wants. But love is a double sword for him. Though it saves him from being a miserable anti-hero, it weakens him and drags him to his knees, and to be saved again. In the end, Hancock has to make a difficult choice.The movie might not fit the typical heroic movie nor does it have every best movie characteristic. But, I enjoy the idea of ""A superhero being saved by a regular human"" and ""you do not need superpowers to do good in the world, just start changing a single life, it could lead to saving the entire world.""","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In and amongst the Batmans, the Ironmans and the Hulks was a film made for profitability and to maintain the likable Smith summer Blockbuster saga, a film that is harmless fun and a film that tries but doesn't succeed in preaching. Hancock is bubblegum entertainment with that extra zest and surprise to make it likable.Starting with the positives that multi million smash has a great selection of a cast that add the drama and point to the plot. Charlize Thereon adds a necessity to the romantic side with an unexpected twist and turn performance with a juicy underlining secret and vibe that every scene with her in gives the plot a much needed boost. Jason Bateman is sharp enough for the stereotyped content husband and ambitious but not determined enough convention guy. The business idea is actually laughable.The big positive is that this film is told and shot with entertainment intention and baring in mind it is an action fantasy you don't want to take it too seriously. There is plenty of moments to enjoy including a whale in the sea, a mid air superhero fight and one of the most awful attempts at bank robbery you will ever see on screen.To the negatives and with a heavy weight on my shoulders with this terrible burden, it has to be the central star. From the Fresh Prince to Independence Day Will Smith has brought us effortless comedy and zest with a new approach to humour styling, so where is it here? The grumpy voice, the slumped shoulders the effortless attempt to be funny.And the repetition is dreadful, with the key example at the ""good job"" moments. And whilst this isn't labelled as a comedy there are moments when it should be funny for Big Will. This effortless portrayal at a superhero makes me sad as from a young age I grew up watching his films, and it does sicken me to write this.Before all the blame gets shunted on the star it is significant to recall that he isn't a scriptwriter, so a large portion must be down to the plot. From flying through the air to a reinvented Superman theme to one of the world's worst reasons for superpowers the scripting is as dizzy as Hancock in the morning. It is never grounded, there are too many clauses and rules and regulations. Why can't it be as simple as get bitten and now you're a spider? This whole background base of Hancock whilst initially intriguing finds itself lost in clauses too deep to claw its way back, with an unbelievably cheesy ending.The alcoholism isn't as serious as it should be but as before this is built for enjoyment and Peter Berg blends action and fantasy well enough with some well directed fights and whilst Smith and the plot could be better, this is still reasonable fun.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Will Smith is the reason why this film didn't completely flop.From the start, I caught the notion that everyone behind the camera just didn't really care all that much; They basically let Will Smith, be Will Smith, and just carry the film with his stature. The narrative on it's own was a big issue. It had such a choppy pace and flow, being super fast paced, with little - to - no setup.The script by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan was pretty funny, but lacked wit, and powerful dialogue scenes. If this film was more of Will Smith cracking tongue and cheek jokes, and fighting bad guys, it probably would've been better, being a harmless action/comedy. Jason Bateman & Charlize Theron did their best to compliment Smith, but the character developments they tried to display during the second act, wasn't all that good, or necessary. Theron was just a plot device until the third act, with her character becoming short lived. I was fond of Jae Head's performance, for what little meaning he had. For his first motion picture, he does very well, and seems to be a favorable young actor on the rise.The effects and action sequences were done pretty amateurishly, feeling too cartoonish, and sloppy. The didn't really showcase anything new, or eye catching, being the film's biggest disappointment.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But wait! He's a superhero. He can fly, he is super-powerful, he can catch bad guys. Let's put it this way: Hancock is a superhero in need of a recovery program. Besides his drinking he has rage issues. And he just isn't very nice. He also is very, very messy. In the course of one of his rescue missions he usually causes millions of dollars in unnecessary damage. The media is full of complaints about all this.And that's where PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes in. They meet when Hancock saves Ray from being run over in his car by a train (of course Hancock also wrecks the train and smashes up a lot of vehicles caught in the surrounding traffic jam). Hancock takes Ray home (with his messed up car, through the air) and gets to know Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and little boy Aaron (Jae Head). Superheros do eat, and Hancock develops an instant jones for Mary's ""spaghetti madness"" dinners.The upshot of this rather unusual encounter determines the rest of the movie. Ray sets to work to remake Hancock's image and his behavior. At Ray's urging Hancock turns himself in to do prison time for all the laws he has broken (it seems superheroes can be subject to the law as well as the pleasures of pasta). In the clink, Hancock's thrown in with some pretty rough characters. He goes to meetings where men share about their problems but time after time he just says ""pass"" when it comes to him.Eventually Hancock cleans up his act in more ways than one. Released because he's needed by the city, he learns to say ""Good job"" to overwhelmed cops he's helping, shaves, gets a haircut, washes, cuts down on the booze, and wears a nice tight leather superman outfit Ray has provided. Maybe the ""good jobs"" are the most important pert.Ray's success with Hancock leads the corporations to get back in touch with Ray about his pet scheme to have them give away billions to end disease and poverty in return for sporting a giant heart symbol that will make people love them. Meanwhile a rather unusual relationship is developing between Hancock and Mary. But we can't talk about that because it's meant to be a surprise. It is a surprise. It's also ridiculously far-fetched and elaborate and requires pages of expository dialogue. And that's where 'Hancock,' which was fading once Hancock turned nice, fizzles out. The final rounds of CGI and derring-do and bangs and smashes are redundant, because they don't develop Hancock's initial premise any more.The interest of that premise was that perfection is boring. The gods of the ancient Greeks had lots of imperfections, and a superman who sleeps on a city bench in a grungy watch cap with an eagle on it, grumpy and reeking of alcohol, is intriguing. It's also potentially a little bit repulsive, especially given Hancock's foul language. A little human weakness is appealing, but we don't really want our heroes to be quite such a mess, and there's a mean and sadistic streak to Hancock that is troubling.The character of Ray helps to counteract this. Jason Bateman, a guy who has done a lot of TV and is best known for his role in ""Arrested Development,"" has a resilient nice-guy quality and at times Ray seems to be the main character and Hancock just his project. But should that be? We turn away from Hancock because his character is skewed too far to begin with. Nonetheless the movie deserves credit for taking the superhero idea in a whole new direction, and so does Will Smith for running with it, and the equally charismatic Theron for tagging along.Once Hancock gets all cleaned up and people start to like him we realize this isn't enough, and so did the writers. Unfortunately where they go from there was boring and comes from a more conventional and hokey kind of superhero movie. We want to know more about Hancock--we want to know what has become of his humanness--and instead we're getting lectured about angels and millennia.Will Smith is a superstar--never mind the hero part--and people are flocking to see this movie because of him. But Hancock coats him with a layer of meanness and grumpiness that keeps the Will Smith charisma from coming out the way it does in his best performances, most recently and notably in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' and 'I Am Legend.' And unfortunately Peter Berg, whose last outing was the ham-handed 'The Kingdom,' has yet to show much finesse as a director. It's hard to tell in the end how much of the messiness is due to the out-of-whack superhero and how much is just a lack of directorial restraint. And yet you've got to admire both Berg and Smith for attempting to take an old theme in a new direction.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So when I went to see Hancock, I was hoping for a decent film starring Will Smith. And that is exactly what I got: A somewhat confused film that wasn't great, but not bad at the same time.Hancock starts out with the statement that it is unlike most traditional superhero films out there, and in my opinion, this was a great decision by the filmmakers. Superhero films are all the rage nowadays, but having a film starring a super-powered alcoholic is a comedic twist and makes it somewhat original. The storyline after the first 20 minutes or so becomes incredibly generic and mindless though, which really ruins the movie. Considering the beginning looked incredibly promising due to how it was original, I was disappointed to see the filmmakers take the generic and easy road that as been walked down way too many times in the past. Not to mention how the ending was absolutely terrible, and I almost cried at how shallow and lame it was.The acting was very good though, and Will Smith showed that he is still at the top of his game. I was unaware of Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Juno) being in the film, so it was a very nice surprise on top of the fact that he did an excellent job in his role.If you have seen a superhero film in the last five years or so, you will be aware that they are computer-generated extravaganzas, and Hancock is no exception. While many scenes look incredibly realistic and authentic, many scenes look absolutely horrible, and Will Smith flying in front of a green screen was not cutting it for me. By now, I am really getting tired of these CGI fests, and while Hancock boils down to just all computers with some acting, it was done decently.The camera-work is another thing in which I am not sure whether or not the film did right. Instead of having professional camera angles and smooth scenes, Hancock goes for the raw approach in which the cameras are incredibly shaky to try and immerse the viewer into the scene. It's really a matter of opinion on which way viewers like best, and although I am not always a fan of this camera style, it got the job done.The main problem with the film is just what the hell the producers wanted it to be. It basically seems like an incoherent mash of comedy, action, romance, fantasy and superhero all mashed into one. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to appeal to as many audiences as possible, which turned out to be a mistake seeing as they just had too much on their plates. I was happy to see that the film did not rely on its comedy to propel itself, due to how most comedies rely solely on the jokes tend to fall flat on their faces by the end. As for the comedy found within the movie, the jokes were really a mixed bag. Some were hilarious, while the on-going joke of ""Call me an a-hole....."" really wasn't funny after the second time, which was a problem considering it popped up many times throughout the film.Was Hancock an amazing film? Absolutely not. Was Hancock a decent summer flick? Indeed it is. As long as you go into the theater with low expectations, I think it is an entertaining ride throughout. Yes, it does have quite a lot of problems such as genre confusion and some fake-looking CGI, but for someone who just wants a fun movie with no real purpose or meaning, Hancock should be sufficient.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The year the MCU started, also saw Will Smith trying his hand at a superhero movie. Hancock is two movies. The first movie is about an anti hero learning to become superhero, and is by far the better of the two. The second movie is more of an origin story, as we learn more about Hancock's past and he finds out he is not alone. Both parts could have worked well as as stand alone movies, but put together its muffled and uneven.The movie shows all the signs of studio interference and never establishes a clear tone. Hancock only works because of Will Smith, whose performance is stronger than what the movie deserves. Don't get me wrong; I don't hate it, it is sometimes funny, sometimes clever, and occasionally enjoyable. Especially the first 50 minutes. Charline Theron is ok, as is Jason Bateman (who basically just plays the same guy he always plays) One of the problems is the lack of any real villain. Red Parker is just a weasel with a gun and is no real threat. Hancock grossed $227 million at the domestic box office to end 2008 the 4th highest grossing movie of the year.

Hancock is a mysterious and unhappy man with super powers. When he gets involved in apprehending criminals, he often causes more damage and problems than he solves.A PR man, whose life he saves, takes Hancock under his wing to help him become a responsible hero, but there are more surprises on the way.This is a thoughtful and very unique superhero film, and also in most respects very cool. It goes in directions you'll never expect, but not at the expense of leaving glaring plot holes. Will Smith gives his normal top notch performance, and the supporting cast is great.Laughs, thrills, surprises, and an interesting story.

Smith, Theron, Bateman all together in a superhero movie about someone with Superman-esque powers who happens to be a degenerate drunk in need of an image makeover? That sounds so cool! Seeing Smith break away from his normal nice guy thing to play a real skeeze, also really cool.Then the second half of this movie happens. It's just such a 180 from the beginning, it's jarring in the worst possible way and makes it feel like the studio was pitched two ideas and rather than making both movies they just mashed them into one mess. I either want drunken, rehabilitating Hancock or I want epic battle of the gods. They clearly can't manage both.Solid background flick but beyond that I can't recommend this. Weirdly, I would say it's worth checking out some clips of it on youtube because there are a few really fun scenes, it just doesn't know how to do a whole movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Stars Will Smith as John Hancock, a derro and a wino who we learn has superpowers but despite this, he seems to have given up on life and is anti-social and even more unloved by the people of Los Angeles, for his careless destruction of property when doing 'good'.After accidentally bumping into Public Relations/marketing makeover wannabe Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, John has the chance to attempt to re-invent himself as a hero the people can actually embrace. Charlize Theron also stars as Mary Embrey, Ray's wife. Charlize looks really beautiful in this movie...sort of like the blonde from ABBA (erm, the girl, obviously). It was only on reading the end credits that I realised that it was Theron...shows how much I know about pop culture!There is fun to be had in Smith's convincing depiction of a down and out superhero. Lots of good action scenes and humour that will appeal to both adults and children-whether through visual comedy or the banter.I like the fact that this movie is self-contained. It has an interesting mystery at its centre: who is John Hancock really and how come he has superpowers? We get answers to these questions, which is pleasing. Now, I mentioned that this movie has a novel twist. That's as far as superhero 'backstories' go. I don't think I've ever come across a superhero with Hancock's background in this kind of genre. When that background is revealed, you can either groan (for it being the kind of stuff you'd expect from the US) or just run with it. I did a bit of both, to tell you the truth. If this backstory interests you, I saw a vampire movie which goes down a similar path. From memory, that movie was ""Dracula 2000"". Saw it on free to air TV a few years back, a premiere, I think. Should say here that I watch and enjoy watching the TV series ""Heroes"" despite finding the nature of their powers idiotic! So, if that TV show doesn't bug you, I don't see why Hancock's story would.There is an unexpected twist in this movie which I enjoyed, though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors. Won't spoil the surprise for you though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors.Unlike a lot of movies I give good scores to here, I think this could have repeat viewing value. 74/100. Hopefully there won't be a sequel. Wouldn't be interested in that unless Hancock gets some foes like him, but a bit 'anti'. In other words, it's hard to see a sequel with the same kind of villains being engaging. If the makers of this movie do go down the sequel route, they will hopefully rephrase the origins of Hancock's powers so that it isn't so cringe inducing.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It certainly was, and still is, refreshing to have a superhero-themed movie with a flawed superhero. The whole goodie-two-shoes thing that is the concensus of superheroes grows a bit stagnant after a while, and that is why these flawed superheroes, such as Hancock, prove to have a wider appeal.The acting performances in ""Hancock"" are good, and they had a good cast ensemble to portray the various characters in the storyline. Much can be said about Will Smith, but he does carry the movie quite well and makes it all the more enjoyable to watch. The movie also have the likes of Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman in leading roles, so there are some familiar faces on the screen.Visually then ""Hancock"" is adequate. It wasn't the most impressive of CGI special effects, but they worked. I am not saying that the CGI effects were bad or inadequate, not at all, I just wasn't impressed with the flying sequences.If you enjoy superhero movies, and want something that differs from the usual generic superhero stuff, then director Peter Berg's 2008 movie ""Hancock"" is worth checking out.My rating of ""Hancock"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A sloppy narrative, uneven directing, lethargic writing, and unlikeable central character--the movie had me clamoring for the exit.However, in the second half, when the audience learns something about another character (hint Bateman or Theron might have a secret-wont tell you which one)--the movie shifts into actual watchability--in fact--if the revelation in the second act would have been the central focus of thefilm from the start-it may have been a better movie. I was frustrated because Bateman (who is always first-rate)and Theron (who can be hot or cold--but is definitely warmer than usual in this movie) are the real strengths of the film. Smith's character becomes likable in the last 30 minutes but it was a little too late. The film is filled with about 342 ideas-some good and some bad, most of them not followed through. The second half had the makings of a decent popcorn flick but was weigheddown by its convoluted plotting and misdirection. The last scene involving something that Will Smith does with the moon belongs in a romantic comedy like Sleepless in Seatlle and not in a summer action flick---its an extremely cheesy moment! I think the movie my draw the Wil Smith fans in the first few days, but in the end, Hancock will be cold cocked by its failings. First 45 minutes--F second 45 minutes B- overall borderline C-/D","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

As the title suggests, the film follows Hancock, an alcoholic 'superhero' living in Los Angeles who causes nothing but trouble and unnecessary damage whilst saving lives.Hancock isn't your typical superhero movie and wasn't what I expected in most aspects. Although it's not exactly a huge budget movie based on a Marvel or DC Comics character (Spiderman 3 had a budget $58million more than Hancock) the special effects aren't too bad, with the exception of the computer generated fight, it's just too obviously CGI.At the risk of sounding offensive, Will Smith is brilliant at playing a rude and obnoxious character. He pulls of the 'a**ehole' character pretty well. Writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan really know how to create a 3D character that the audience genuinely cares about.Although it does start to drag on a little towards the end, it really keeps you interested right up until the end credits start to roll. It's laugh out loud funny at times, the twist is brilliant and there's even a little tribute to Superman in there, if you can spot it.Watch it, it's a fun night in.http://ukmore.tk/","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

We first meet Hancock passed out on a city bench being prodded by a kid to wake up and help the cops. Hancock wakes up, slaps a passing girl on the rear and grabs a bottle of whiskey before flying off to help the police.This gives us a great introduction to this movie showing us what is in-store for us. Hancocks attempts at helping out the people of LA end up causing major damage due to Hancocks lack of tact and his supposed selfish motivations. As expected Hancock is hated by the city officials and most citizens because of his reckless actions. Eventually Hancock saves the life of Ray Embery (Jason Bateman) a PR man trying to use his skills to change the world and failing at it. Ray sees in Hancock a lonely person desiring to do what he thinks is right but finding hate instead of appreciation for his actions. To help Hancock turn public opinion Ray begins to guide Hancock in how to be a better hero.This is a really creative film. It takes the hero film fad out there shows us what it could really look like in our world. The best part is every character is well done with one exception. Will Smith shows us a hero who is just like you and me hiding his confusion and hurt behind his actions and attitude. Bateman is a fun counter to Smith being honest about the stupidity of Hancock in a real caring way. The only person I felt was weak as a character was Charlize Theron as Mary Embery, Rays wife and a mystery for Hancock. I don't know if Theron can really be blamed for her character seeming off however.In the story we get a great setup for seeing a cool growth in Hancock. Theron's character Mary kind of ruins that for us. We learn of a mystery to Hancocks origin and when all is revealed it cheapens a lot of the creative story telling done so far. Mary just doesn't fit into the story that was being created and it feels forced to create the drama around her, Hancock, and Ray that the movie makers obviously want.While this is a major issue with the film it doesn't totally destroy it. The film is fun, witty, and has good action. Even with a big bump in the story Hancock is still a good film and makes some cool insights into the superhero type story.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not perfect by any means but it has a solid message in it. A superhero who doesn't remember his past and who hasn't really had anyone in his life is just kind of drifting along. You don't get the typical ""good guy"" in this superhero though. This one has lots of flaws. I guess this is why it's so relatable to me. Being all-powerful doesn't mean that you don't have a heart also. Hancock himself doesn't know why he's on Earth or what he's supposed to do. He does help people but he doesn't know how to help himself.This ends up making him an outcast and someone who doesn't get along with others. He wants to have meaning but he just can't find it. He instead lets himself slip into bad habits because he has never really had anyone that legitimately cared for him. Until he meets someone one day who actually cares. You see a very broken man who has never had a reason to look inward, start to examine himself for once. The shift that Hancock goes through is realistic and creates a very sympathetic character. This movie offers a lot more than a standard ""hero saves the day"" story and I think it's a worth watching.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Hancock is a gifted middle aged man who has been disowned by the public because of the destruction he creates when trying to do something right, costing the city millions. Then Hancock runs in to Jason Batemans character (Ray) who wants to try and change the public's impression of him. Everything seems to be going all right until Hancock meets a woman who has super powers like him and is the key to unlocking what happened in his past.The story is not well thought out and feels that it has been written in a very short amount of time. I think the writers found it hard keeping the idea of a non-stereotypical super hero and because of this the film is only 92 minutes. By the end of the film the story falls flat and so they fill the end up with CGI fight scenes which are actually well-made and quite convincing. To make the story better I think they should have developed Charilze Theron character more. One other problem I found with the story is there is no well fleshed out villain in the story which can leave the audience a bit confused.""Hancock"" is directed by actor/director Peter Berg who has directed films such as ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""The Kingdom."" Peter Berg uses a big variety of camera angles that work well with the shot situation. During the whole the film the only shot transition used is fade; I think the editor does this to create effect. He does this because he doesn't want the movie to come across too fun and silly he wants to show the audience that the film is also serious. In ""Hancock"" all the original music composed is by one man John Powell which has produces music in films such as ""Shrek"" and the ""Bourne series"". The original music in this film works well and effectively throughout the film. It helps to show the audience what the film is all about and what the main theme is. The movie also contains songs from different artists the majority of them are RnB songs which reflect Will Smiths character (Hancock) and shows the tone of the movie. Some examples of these songs are ""move"" by Ludicrous and ""colours"" by Ice T.The film is backed up by an all star cast which includes ""I Am legend's"" Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman they all give good performances. Jason Bateman, who is the character that connects Smith and Theron characters together, is great as usual and likable. Will Smith performance is as good as ever, he nails the drunken superhero very well whilst delivering some funny comedic lines. Particular good scenes for Will Smith is near the end were Hancock becomes all emotional because he remembers what happened in his past. During this scene Will Smith gives his best performance during the whole movie.Even though ""Hancock"" has a rating of 12A I wouldn't recommend this film for children under the age of 12 because it contains some bad language and violent scenes which could scare some children. I think this movie will appeal to teenagers and young adults the most because they would enjoy the type of comedy in this film and the great action and fight scenes. Older adults may enjoy this two but I feel that adults were not the intended viewer and I don't think that some of the comedy will appeal to them.All in all ""Hancock"" is an average film; it's not an amazing nor awful. It is a film that I feel doesn't live up to the good story premise although It was an interesting look at a super hero movie compared with all the ""Supermans"" and ""Batmans"" we are given today, in a sense it is more realistic. I like the way that you can see what life is actually like as a superhero. This movie contains many funny moments, good acting and outstanding special effects. I think that this film would be worth renting but i don't think it's worth seeing at the cinema; it's nothing to rush out to see unless you're a die-hard Will Smith fan.I give this film 2.5/5 stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I agree. It's not. Not even close. However, they've taken it as a comedy. I'm afraid I have to reserve my opinion on that.It was funny at the beginning but turned out to be a sad love story when Mary revealed the truth. Superheroes are created in pairs but doomed to be separated since they would lose their power if they got too close to each other. History has proved that all of the superheroes were killed except them two.Mary said ""we're brother and sister"". She said ""technically he's my husband"". She didn't lie. They are immortal. Through all the centuries, the connections between them are more than those of siblings and couples. They are the only two of their kind in this world but they have to run away from each other to guarantee the safety of their lives. Is there anything else more pathetic? It's such a just-so-so movie that I hardly laughed or be impressed throughout the whole 97 minutes. But I felt a little bit touched about two scenes. One is when Ray said to Hancock ""people don't like you"", his son Aaron shouted ""I do"". The other is bearing all the sores and wounds physically and mentally, Hancock hobbled his way to far far away to save Mary.Heroes are doomed to be alone but they'll never be lonely. They have someone very special to care about and be cared back. Hancock is not able to be with Ray, Mary and Aaron but he watches them and guard them from far far away. He tells his love by that red heart on the moon.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

He saves the life of a similarly ineffective (though is not presented as so) personal relations agent named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who is so grateful that he dedicates his career to improving Hancock's image, despite the lack of any real fiscal benefits from doing so. But Embrey is one of those humanitarian P.R. reps you read so much about, whose pitch to the corporations always seems to involve them giving away their products for free. They unsurprisingly decide to do otherwise.The first thirty minutes or so of the film are decent enough. It's mildly amusing to watch a superhero that genuinely doesn't seem to give a crap about anything. Hancock causes a tremendous amount of collateral damage. But if he ultimately doesn't care about people, then why try and help at all? Hancock is supposed to be an ""asshole"", but comes off as just morose. Smith's been playing that a lot lately and judging by the box office receipts, it's what people want. The film could explore why Hancock feels he owes anything at all to these people. It does not. Note to filmmakers: Never make a superhero without motivation.It's when Hancock voluntarily goes to jail that the film slants into place getting ready for a tremendous nose dive. It becomes boring (superhero sits around in jail = fun movie?) and changes from a comedy to a drama, a critical mistake partly because the writing of the second half is seriously lackluster. The other reason is the special effects are just not good enough for a dramatic film. They come off as cartoonish. Things disintegrate on impact far too easily like there was nothing holding them together in the first place. If Hancock has the mass and strength to stop a train without any recoil and makes craters on landings (inconsistently for comic purposes I suppose), then shouldn't the mere act of walking or running around cause mild earthquakes? I mentioned the second half of the film. It absolutely sucks. I was having a migraine trying to figure out what was going on with Charlize Theron's character, and her's and Hancock's back story in general. The whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense. There's just a series of fights for absolutely no reason other that to satisfy action junkies. This is the first and hopefully last time I ever see Jason Bateman take part in an action sequence. Hancock really felt rushed, I assume because the call of the July 4th box office. Money beats art any day of the week. The producers of Hancock know this, and Bateman's character should have known it too.Boring and rushed in appearance and execution, Hancock gets a D+","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first idea is that of an alcoholic superhero who only saves lives due to some natural compulsion that he can't fight but otherwise cares nothing for anybody. The other idea is a gritty realistic look at what life as a superhero would be like. The emphasis of the story is the latter, while the previews imply the former.The first half of the movie plays out similarly to a super powered bad Santa...making for some very good and unique laughs. As Hancock attempts to clean up his act though things take a much darker turn and we learn that Hancock does in fact have a heart and it's broken.If Super powers really did exist in this extremity Hancock's plot would likely be a pretty good representation of it's pitfalls. The guy's lonely as all hell, he drinks, he costs millions in property damage for every act of heroics. This is something different that we've never seen, Spider-man's not always loved by everyone he saves but at least he was never handed a bill for breaking a window.Despite a good box office return I think feelings of the movie from it's general audience were only Luke warm but I think it will appreciate in value as time goes on. It's a superhero drama with a very interesting and original plot, it's just too bad it was marketed as a superhero action comedy. A stronger villain would've have helped to inject more action into the movie and possibly would have made everybody happy...the movie is a little slow but I've seen it a couple times and it's already grown more on me. I urge everybody to give a chance...even if it's a second one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

My vote is for Will Smith.Valid criticisms:
-love story would have been more appropriate for multiple movies or for a tv series otherwise it should be removed
-better development of villain should be considered
-character actions seemed contradictory to dialogue or established relationships in multiple scenesGenerally the movie is entertaining but has room for improvement.

Probably not a superhero. Will Smith plays Hancock, a slacker with all those attributes who also has supernatural powers. Maybe you could call him a superzero--someone with the potential to be spectacular who falls far short.He's a reluctant hero for sure, who usually rises above his crassness only when forced to, and then leaves careless destruction in the wake of his heroics.He meets Ray (Jason Bateman), an optimistic PR man who thinks Hancock should change his image. Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), seems unconvinced. What follows is an unpredictable story about love and possible redemption. There are bad guys, of course, who complicate matters, but the resolution of this story feels messy and contrived. By the end of the film, viewers may feel like it was all just an origin story that served no purpose except to be the foundation for other real stories to follow. But who would want to emotionally invest in a hero that still feels less than realized, a temporary patchwork of questionable values?One feels that an opportunity has been missed. Imperfect heroes can be quite interesting if their story makes them lovable or compelling. Hancock strains to achieve either.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They actually see movies with the feeling that they WANT the film to fail. Why, so you can talk trash about it on a message board? I will start this review off by saying there's not a single thing wrong with this movie. Sure, some people feel as if they would have made it differently, but that's not them. They're not the ones behind the scripts or the cameras. Behind them is a team devoted to bringing us what we love about a summer movie: great action sequences, cool characters, and a decent story with good looking people. That's the definition of a summer movie people. Now, moving on...I thought I had seen all the best moments the movie had to offer in the previews, but low and behold I was wrong. The scenes in the trailer take place within the first 30 minutes, while the next hour is a well developed story involving superhero origins, complicated relationships and some intense action.You can pretty much guess the story from the trailer, however the movie is far from predictable; a man with super powers who is depressed wants to help the world while society shuns him. Feeling he can help, Jason Bateman's character Ray decided to invest in Hancock and make him personable again. You know he spends time in jail, hates it, then gets called to help out the city when it's in trouble. That's the story right there. Granted there are more twists and turns involving our hero but it is not, repeat NOT what you expect. Will Smith is also very funny in this movie, cursing at neighbors and children while maintaining his A-Hole approach to a hero.The story is ORIGINAL, something hardly any movie nowadays can claim, especially movies in the superhero genre. The background of the hero, as well was his powers' weakness is something I've never seen done before. And guess what? The bad guys are the bad guys! The bank robbers, purse snatchers, rapists and crooks are the people Hancock is battling against, something that all heroes should be fighting, not some made up villain that can easily match the good guy. This is why the story as well as the movie are fantastic.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

It starts out great, its got a fantastic and unique idea for a superhero. I had a lot of fun watching Hancock's antics, emotions, and general attitude toward being a superhero. Some of the other characters were great as well, particularly the supporting character of Ray, the two of them made a great match. I was very happy to be watching this film for a good while but it fell apart when it came to establishing an effective ending. this is just my opinion of course, I enjoyed the movie but I felt a lot of it was ruined by the complications and twists that did not seem to connect very well with the rest of the story and its theme of self renewal and achievement. It went in all the right directions and made a great attempt at a new kind of story but it just didn't make it in the end. But hey, its entertaining, its got some great laughs and its definitely worth a try. I imagine some people might really dig the ending.

It has trailers and ads about Will Smith being some sort of disgruntled super hero with a horrible attitude, while some funny looking PR guy is going to great lengths to ""fix"" him. Not so in the movie! The whole convincing takes about 5 minutes of film!Then there is Charlize Theron. I mean, OK, it wasn't a role unfit for her, but it felt like the only reason she was in the cast to begin with is some weird ""let's see Smith kiss Theron"" thing.And then there is the actual plot. Jeez, what an underachievement. It actually had some very good ideas and they were unexploited, abused and thrashed, giving way to silly special effects and silly dialogs.Bottom line: for presenting itself as an original movie, with a true anti-hero as lead character, and for hiding the real ""jist"" of the story in the commercials, I give it a big BOOOOO!

This movie is typical of all the recent Hollywood movies...it suffers from bad writing. Hancock has an excellent premise, antisuperhero who doesn't know what to do with the fact that he has been given special abilities. In most of the other superhero stories some mentor helps the hero learn who he is, but in this movie it's an Ad man, which is kind of cute. Will Smith does a great job as the antihero so what's the problem. The problem is the unimaginative writing that ruins a good experience by writing in some ridiculous relationship and back story for the characters. My god I just wanted to walk out when this whole stupid story emerged.

It's certainly a fun action movie that has a lot of very funny parts, as well as a terrific performance from Will Smith, who takes on a role nothing like what he has done previously. It's an enjoyable movie, but it has many, many flaws, the biggest one is that the main character is not very likable for the majority of the movie, I know it's on purpose for the most part, but seeing him throw a kid up in to the sky and flinging a whale in to a boat was way too much and it wasn't necessary if you want us to support this character. Also the movies main villains don't show up until about fifty minutes in and don't start doing anything until about the last twenty, which is a significant problem, especially for a superhero movie, where a villain is one of the most important parts. There are several other problems, the cheesy effects, the anti-climactic ending, the lame twist, the lack of comedy from Jason Bateman's character, this movie easily could have been an 8, but because of all these major mistakes, I had to go down to 6. It's nowhere near perfect, but Hancock is still quite enjoyable and it might make for a good watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. After a down on his luck superhero named Hancock saves a man's life, this man feels he owes it to him to make Hancock in to the real superhero he should be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I would have liked to have seen Jason Batemen's character have been a bit more outgoing, as he is eventually overshadowed by Smith and Theron. However, the threesome's interaction is pretty good.This movie was far more dramatic than My Super Ex Girlfriend, which has comparable plot elements, but still has some funny moments. The ending of the movie seemed rushed, perhaps because there was not a strong establishment of a villain throughout. In fact, the movie starts out with Hancock being his own worst enemy, but towards the end, his own inner battle is forgotten, overshadowed, or replaced by an outer battle with foes.Ultimately, this is fun for a while, then gets mired down in drama. The ending is somewhat satisfying, and somewhat unsatisfying. Not so disappointing that it is not worth renting.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was funny, and it had the best surprise mid-plot twist I have seen in awhile. This movie could have been just another mindless comedy if it wasn't for the fact that it has heart. Will Smith's character seem genuinely depressed. Yes, there are plenty of sarcastic one-liners and humorous moments. But Hancock, for all his drunken boorishness, is (shed a tear) lonely.Hancock has super-powers of strength, speed, and resistance to bullets, but he is also a drunken, rude, sweaty mess. And every time he helps someone, he manages to mess things up. Either he costs the citizens thousands in tax dollars for city damages or he insults somebody. And his breath stinks, taboot! Then a soft-hearted guy with a nice suit gets saved by Hancock one day. He witnesses the anger people display afterwords and decides, gee, maybe Hancock needs a face-lift. He's a PR man, and he wants to give Hancock a new image. He brings Hancock home for dinner (it's spaghetti madness night) and exhibits the same attitude towards Hancock as one would a puppy that is destroying your shoes. Can't we keep him, hon? His son loves Hancock immediately, but the wifey seem like she's not impressed. His plan is simple: get Hancock sequestered in prison so that people will miss him.

You're given a large budget with actors like Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Then, you add Will Smith, the biggest box-office draw on the market. It must take an absolute mess of a director to ruin a film with this much potential.The movie rides on special effects. For the most part, they're well done, however, some scenes prove otherwise. For instance, when Will Smith is flying on the freeway, it is extremely obvious that it was all done on a green screen. In fact, many of the special effects look as though they weren't completely finished.As for the performances, they're the best part of the movie. Will Smith will keep you laughing as always. Jason Bateman continues to prove that he deserves great roles. All-in-all, this is the best aspect of the movie.The story, however, is the downfall of this film. There is a twist halfway through the film that will make you cringe with disgust. And the explanation for it all is even worse. Sure, it all makes sense, but it is incredibly stupid. The humor is often misplaced in the film and the director must have had an identity crisis in regards to the film's genre. It goes from G-rated family comedy dialogue (not in a good way) to drama to comedy to action and all the way back again in a matter of several minutes. Now, I don't mind when a movie crosses genres, but this movie does it poorly.It's sorely disappointing that a movie with so much potential turned out as poorly as it did. It will make money nonetheless, but the fans deserve better than this predictable, mediocre film. Will Smith will give you enough entertainment, but even he can't save the movie. Wait to rent it and you'll be happy you did.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Certainly it is not able to measure up to Iron Man or Batman Begins in terms of great storytelling and eye-popping special effects. Yet, it has a simple and fun tone to it that makes it pure popcorn flick material that is altogether entertaining. Will Smith dominates the screen as the mysterious and all-powerful Hancock, a superhero who looks and acts like a normal person, yet can perform incredible feats. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron give adequate performances as two people that have an important effect on Hancock's life. There is a major twist that comes about halfway through the story, and from there the film does get significantly weaker. Nevertheless, the story moves on crisply and we are always intrigued by what might happen next. So, I say give it a chance. You may not like it at all. But, if you are a fan of the superhero genre, this is a different take on the same type of story with some good acting and decent special effects.

These nay-sayers have most likely not even seen the movie or walked into the theater with a bad taste in their mouths and were determined to denounce the film before even watching it. With that being said Hancock is not revolutionary, however, you won't be dissatisfied when exiting the theater after seeing this film. Will Smith and Charlize Theron being their full spectrum of experience to the screen and definitely do not leave this film lacking in emotion. Hancock contains an even mix of comedy, romance, and action and fully delivers as an unorthodox action superhero film. The one annoyance to the film is Jason Bateman's similar acting style in Hancock to his character in Arrested Development. Though his acting is fitting for his role in Hancock, it is also very stereotypical for Bateman and comes of a bit irritating when the movie includes stills of Bateman's facial expressions that are identical to his expressions in Arrested Development.

After his dramatic turn in the rather disappointing The Pursuit of Happiness, and the promising but fatally flawed I Am Legend, I was not sure I was going to be able to accept and genuinely enjoy another Will Smith movie. And sure enough, even going in with low expectations was not enough.Hancock tells the story of the titular hero (Smith), who in a rather original move, is a mean-spirited alcoholic. He helps save the day for many in Los Angeles, but at the price of causing millions of dollars worth of damage, and offending just about everyone. He saves Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations agent, from certain death, and as a thank you, Ray wants to clean up Hancock's image.The actual great thing about Hancock is that it is, for the most part, an original idea. Yes, comic book fans may recognize the alcoholism as a trademark of Tony Stark, but it makes for a hell of a character dynamic for this so-called superhero. As well, unlike the comic book film superheroes we have come to understand, Hancock does not want to be a hero. He just wants to be appreciated for what he does do, and left alone all the rest of the time. And of course, as would be typical for Smith, Hancock is a bit of a wise-ass. All of these elements lead to a superhero character unlike any we have seen (although he borrows from Superman's books and can fly and deflect bullets).But unfortunately, that is nearly the only great thing this movie has to offer.The movie plays itself loose and extremely fast. The brief explanation I gave for the film encompasses nearly half an hour of the film's running time. And for a film that runs less than an hour and a half, that may sound like a bit much to chew on. But somehow, the film flies through from point to point, only pausing for seconds at a time to explain what is happening. And much like I Am Legend, the film veers off into a completely different direction in the third act that nearly completely defeats the purpose of the previous two (although anyone who knows the big revealing moment already may be disappointed to know it does not build on much more). In this case, it attempts to explain the mythology behind the character, but fails because of how convoluted and useless it sounds. Even worse is the dramatic tone change from action romp to hardcore drama that is handled even less well.It is obvious even as early as the film's opening shots that director Peter Berg is trying to do something different. As if taking on an original superhero was not enough, Berg wanted to make it feel even less like a superhero movie, and more like a coming-of-age/outsider tale. While this is an admirable thought, the script is not nearly strong enough to let it happen. It just does not seem to know what it wants to be, and has an even bigger problem trying to understand its main character. Should we feel sorry for him? Maybe at the beginning, but less and less as the film goes along. Its three distinct acts are just that: distinct. They all want to accomplish something different, and when meshed together, they just do not work out. The ideas may be intriguing, but there should have been more experienced writers on hand to explore them.What is even more inexcusable is the lack of development in the supporting characters. While Hancock has something to work with early on, the rest of the cast has to hobble along just to hold themselves up. Bateman's character has an ongoing subplot about an idea he has for pharmaceutical companies to benefit the less fortunate, but we understand very little about who he is, and even less about how wealthy he appears to be (despite some rather negative feedback on the idea he has). He is basically negated to simply watching Hancock do his thing after he works his PR magic. Charlize Theron, cast as Bateman's wife Mary, has something about her right from the moment she pops on screen. You can tell the filmmakers are trying to play up on her development by making her so cynical about Hancock, but when her character finally needs to be used, she falters and flops in an instant. Her character serves a point, but at the expense of being useless all the rest of the time. The rest of the supporting cast, save for The Embrey's adorable son Aaron (Jae Head), are all underused to the point that crediting them would be a waste of time.Smith, attempts to make his character work, but the inherent problems at the core of Hancock's script plague his good work. Yes, he can play wise-ass very good, but he has some good moments of pathos, but not nearly enough to make the audience truly feel for him. Smith plays the character much like others, with very little regard for not basically playing himself (or at least, the image he displays for the public). Maybe another dose of The Pursuit of Happiness, where he is very un-Will Smith-like, is exactly what the man needs to wake up and actually show off some form of acting chops.Thankfully, the music and special effects pull through basically unscathed (although a few of the flying scenes looked terribly fake).While at its heart, Hancock may have been a good idea for a new superhero movie, it did not turn out to be one in the end. Bad writing and sloppy direction take away from any great ideas that could have been infused into the script, and sadly, it does not look like anyone appears to care. And unfortunately, that is the saddest thing about this mess of a movie.4/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A Nutshell Review: Hancock","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1904879/?ref_=tt_urv","DICK STEEL","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0317399/?ref_=tt_urv","5 July 2008","I'll stick my neck out and state this: Should anyone tell you Hancock is not a good superhero movie, then that somebody probably isn't a superhero comic book fan to begin with. Or perhaps prefers the heroes as morally upright boy scouts with unexplainable fetish for Lycra tights. And for those who reckon that the Hancock trailer had shown its hand, for once I thought that a trailer barely, and I mean barely, scratched the surface of what surprisingly was a thoroughly enjoyable story, which will take its stand proudly amongst this year's line up of comic book/super hero movies.But first, I'd got to admit, I'm a Will Smith fan. So at least you might have this review put into perspective. I've been enjoying the Will Smith Express with the kind of movies he's been doing for his career, even for the badly received Wild Wild West. But this guy has been in almost every genre from action (thanks to Michael Bay) to science fiction with I, Robot, romantic comedy with Hitch, a powerful dramatic performance with Pursuit of Happiness, and the recent remake I Am Legend, and each one I find little or no fault with. In fact, save for one or two movies in his filmography which I have not watched, it's no wonder that Smith's A-list material for his legion of fans around the world, having a name that can marquee a blockbuster movie, and one of the more consistently bankable contemporary stars.And Hancock (ok, for this review I'd lay off all the jokes) continues in this tradition of entertainment that isn't frivolous. To tell you more about the story would be to ruin whatever surprise it has in store, so I'll not do that. Suffice to say that like all superhero movies, Hancock is also about sacrifice, and I think that's a theme that the genre cannot do away with. It's almost always an exploration about doing the right thing, be it for the love of mankind, or those that touch on the more personal. If you'd believe the trailer as it suggests, then it's suffice to say that Hancock had to grapple with bad public relations from his jerk like behaviour (stuffing heads up arses being his arsenal of choice), and that assistance comes free through the services of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a life which he saved by, well, causing millions of dollars in damages. If I were to scratch the surface just a little bit deeper, then I'd say that Ray represents the kind of normal life that Hancock probably wished to have, the simple, no save-the-world responsibility lifestyle, with a nice little family with wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and son Aaron (Jae Head) to boot.Director Peter Berg, who last brought us The Kingdom, dabbles with plenty of technology to bring us a man who can fly, possess incredible strength and being invulnerable to bullets. What I'd enjoyed about his take on this superhero movie, is that he didn't find a need to explain everything in verbatim, i.e. what are the powers he possess, where did he come from, and so on. sure they are addressed, but there's no need for putting it in your face, which I suspect lesser directors would have filmed flashbacks, origin subplots, enemies who are megalomaniacs who want to conquer the universe, and so on. They can be mentioned in passing, or a glance, or to let it work it out in your imagination, which of course is a powerful tool. And keeping it simple helped too, as I was really thrilled at how effective, and deceptively simple, its crescendo was developed, that it's tough to fight back tears as it goes for the juggernaut to reach out for your emotions.Clearly there were bits from the trailer which were probably put in as red herrings, or likely to have been reserved for the DVD as deleted scenes. While it runs at just over 90 minutes, the pace is frenetic, though of course not without the usual loopholes, especially with a major sequence probably to show off some cool graphics. If I were to gripe about certain things, it would be how YouTube got a significant product placement, and not actually having the actual, exact clips available (I may be wrong but I did do a search), and having the camera seemed to want to take a jab at Will Smith action movies of old by continuously circling around his face ala Bad Boys. Some may also gripe about not having to see much of the born again Hancock in action, but again, the strength of this movie lies not in how it delivers its set action pieces.So what's my verdict? To Berg, Smith and the rest of the cast and crew, Good Job! And don't be a jerk and bolt for the exits the minute the end credits start to roll, or you deserve to have your head stuffed up another's arse.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

He is a superhero who, despite saving many lives and catching even more criminals in his duty, also causes millions of dollars of damage, and his grumpy unsociable demeanour does not win him over with the public in his native LA. But all fears that this film will be as tetchy and charmless as its eponymous star are quickly banished.Hancock is a superhero film that drops all the natural clichés and instead goes about its business doing things its own way. There is no big ""origin"" scene, no defined hero and villain; rather there is a set of characters that must learn to live with each other.Will Smith, one of the few Hollywood stars that will guarantee a profit-turning film, delivers a convincing performance as the washed-up superhuman Hancock, particularly considering that ""charmless"" is not his forte. Apart from going against his natural type-cast, Smith is not required to give too much to this performance, leaving the special effects to do the bulk of the job, which they do with gusto. No doubt the main objective of the film is to entertain the masses, and it does this considerably well, maintaining an intense pace throughout and adding more twists and turns than would normally be found in a film twice its length.In its bid to engage, it does leave a noticeable hole where characterization should be. Only briefly is the subject of the loneliness of Hancock touched upon, and Hancock's PR guru, Ray, is far too one-dimensional considering his role to the plot. The importance of this character is played up in the film's first half, and then diminished in the closing half as his wife, played by Charlize Theron, replaces him as the film's second main character.This film is by no means faultless, but in terms of blockbusters, particularly superhero blockbusters, it is unpredictable, inventive and, bar a sugar-sweet ending, far removed from the formulaic plots that generally clog up the summer schedules. Despite this, it still manages to do what all big-budget films strive to achieve, and that is to entertain.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The problem with Hancock is mostly related to his image  he already does good but is under-appreciated because he does not make everyone around him feel good (see the difference between 'do good' and 'feel-good'), rather he ensures that bad guys' butts and heads are connected in a convoluted configurations, a device invented especially for this 'moving pictures'. This is another way to ensure that we get the power of the guy  flying and kicking ass is one thing, but sticking a fellow's head in another fellow's butt is quite another, requiring a certain degree of previously unbeknownst sophistication. Having established the need for improvements in our hero's image, a PR man is introduced. And of course, you guessed it, it happened to be very decent PR man. He wants to shower humanity with goodness also because of some unknown to us reasons  may be it makes him feel good, or maybe he was told by Jesus to do so. Hancock saves the PR man and he, in gratitude, starts working on hero's image. They devise a plan by which Hancock voluntarily removes himself from society by going to jail (yes, this is how one is removed from society). Now, people are made to understand, how it is without our hero. Crime's up 30% and Hancock is recalled to save, now grateful, humanity.It just feels that something is missing  the plot requires more action. It turns out that PR man's wife happens also to be a demigod, who used to be married to our hero, but had to distance herself from him because it was lethal for both of them. You see, they both loose powers in each other presence, they are poison for each other, a mutual kryptonite. You know, this thing happen to some powerful couples, who can not decide who bring home the bacon. So, the she-hero stays with the PR man, while Hancock will continue saving the world. In the mean time, we, in the comfort of our entertainment facilities, experience the sublime, safely and without any danger to our health. Do we get entertained? Do we get our money worth? Does this film relax us? For god's sake, should we see this film or not?Let me answer the big questions in the following way. Suppose we view Hancock as a symbol, for example, as US of A. The US saves the world by acting as world policeman; unilaterally exercising its power, flying hither and dither (think Afghanistan, Iraq). US sticks bad guy's heads into bad guy's butts (think Abu Ghraib). The damage US inflicts onto 'rogue' nations, lost human lives are weighed against the potential good. Meanwhile, we experience the sublime on TV projected by CNN, comfortably resting on sofas and lazy-boy chairs with popcorn and beer. I think, Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan could do much better with their plot by simply following major event of the latest US wars, using US = Hancock symbolism. And Will Smith? - yes, camera loves him. But for me, it is a memory of Six Degrees of Separation that beacons me to the movie theater to see his performances. It is regrettable, that after amassing such personal success, wealth and authority, he produces such low grade output. But I keep hoping and he's not the worst that Hollywood can offer. Now, to answer the big question  Do I regret seeing this film? The answer is no; and not because of the film itself, not because its entertainment value, nor because it made me better or relaxed me and helped me to get through the day. Rather because of the polemic energy it gave me to write this note and share it with others. Now I can be, vicariously, a super-hero, better than Hancock, flying high in my imagination, having this discussion with Will Smith himself on the public forum, dispensing him my free advice. This is real power. And as to my vicarious experience and the lack of real super-powers - perhaps this is a good thing.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's 2008, and the year's high water mark for big-budget Hollywood releases, and Hancock is the Fresh Prince's film de jour. Before you start rolling your eyes, however, there's something you must know about this release. it's damn good! In fact, given the story behind the making of this movie, such praise is somewhat surprising.Originally penned by Vincent Ngo back in 1996, the screenplay passed through the hands of various directors, including Tony Scott and Michael Mann (Mann stayed on in the capacity of Producer), and went through a number of cuts to both conform to cinema ratings and tweak the story after test screenings, the latter rarely being a good omen. Which makes it all the more surprising that Hancock out-Supers Superman, out-X's X-Men, out-smarts the Hulk (no great achievement there).I could go on but you get the picture. Hancock is the superhero flick that summer popcorn movies aspire to. And, it does it with attitude and laughs to boot.Smith plays John Hancock, a drunken drifter who possesses many of the same powers as Superman. He can fly, bullets bounce off him, he has super strength, is faster than a speeding bullet, and, oh yeah, he's an asshole (but don't call him that). Basically he's what Superman would be if he was a booze swilling, hungover, homeless person who wouldn't think twice about ramming your head up your arse if you so much as looked at him cock-eyed.His crime fighting antics (when he's up to it) haven't endeared him to Los Angeles authorities either, seeing how he has a penchant for widespread property damage whenever he goes into action. All of which serves as a problem which needs to be fixed, and that's where PR wiz Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes into play, offering to try and rehabilitate Hancock's public image after the hero rescues him from near death.Directed by Peter Berg (The Kingdom), the movie deftly mixes comedic and action moments in a refreshingly even blend, and its story is peppered with enough origin references to lay the groundwork for prequels and sequels, of which you can be sure there will be several. Basically they've created a fully-realized movie franchise without the luxury of a long line of comics or graphic novels to lay the groundwork.If there's one flaw to Hancock (the movie, not the character), it's that it lacks a credible super villain, someone who can really give him a run for his money. Sure it has the cookie-cutter bad guy, but he's really nothing more than a thug with a gun, and no real match for our hero. He's basically a moron's Lex Luthor, without any aces (or anything else) up his sleeve, and an action movie built around a virtually invincible superhero needs a foil of at least credible strength.Nonetheless, the acting, pacing, story and special effects all compensate for this weakness, making Hancock a fun ride. Just don't ever call him an asshole.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Well long story short, I went to the matinée and I still felt like I overpaid.This movie doesn't know what it wants to be- it's comedy/action for the first 45 minutes, drama for the next 40, and corny, gag me please garbage for the last 5.The jokes fell flat and nobody in the theater knew what was supposed to be funny. The resolution was pretty lame as well. I hoped Jason Bateman could bring some humor to the story, as I am a big fan of Arrested Development, but he just doesn't have the tools or dialogue to do so here. Things start to get ""serious"" story-wise and the plot elements are so ridiculous all you can do is groan and roll your eyes.Final Verdict : D Don't go to it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

What I got was something that turned out to be utterly...what's the word? lame. basically from beginning to end it was nothing but Will Smith drunk, flying around and breaking things. So there was nothing else that contributed it. Only one good one-liner came out of his mouth. It also proved that Charlize Theron can not pull off a comic movie, no offense I think she's beautiful and was fantastic in MONSTER'S BALL. Overall I was completely disappointed with this movie. But mainly, I'm disappointed in Will Smith generally. I started not to like him the moment he began to study scientology and began to befriend Tom Cruise.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

When Hancock first came out, because of all the negative reviews that appeared in the newspapers, I did not rush to see it, and I am very sorry about that. I just saw it and, and I really enjoyed it. First and foremost, this film is a love story. It just so happens that it uses the superhero genre to tell it. Although I would agree that the numerous bathroom jokes were childish and detracted from the film, I feel that the negative reviewers lacked the maturity and sophistication to see that, seeing as how most superhero films of late are spoofs, the makers of Hancock chose a spoof of those spoofs as an entertaining and attention-diverting backdrop on which to paint a portrait of love. And not just love between two people. The love in this story is between all of the protagonists--father, mother, son, and Hancock, and ultimately about the love between all things that feel. If you can let your hair down, I believe that this fun and genuinely imaginative film will provide you with smiles, perhaps a tear, and a very warm glow. (P.S., I love feedback, and will be happy to hear your comments on mine.)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has lots of very funny moments, but they are the result of a very lonely superhero. I love comedies. To me, funny and revealing of the character, is much better humor than just funny to be amusing.The plot twist everyone talks about is revealed relatively early, about midway through, and the rest of the story hinges on it. It's nicely foreshadowed and stunning when ""the truth comes out."" The truth is a doozy and puts everything prior to it into a brand new perspective. The last time I saw movie that did as good of a job at a plot point as this movie was ""L.A. Confidential,"" an admittedly different kind of film.Would the movie suffer if its producers choose to reveal the plot twist? Actually, I think not. I think the entire marketing campaign should have been based on that revelation. It would have put the movie in a different perspective and rather than critics panning it, they would have embraced it and loved it.It's truly too bad, because this is a gem of a film. Read the reviews for it carefully... pro and con... think about who the reviewer is and how credible their opinion is to you. Yes, this is a ""superhero"" movie, but it's more in the vein of the Spiderman movies than it is X-Men. I truly liked this movie and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD so I can enjoy it with family and friends and get their take on it, too.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Have these guys ever heard of a tripod? Even when the subjects were not moving the camera was all over the place. Closeups were too close with the frame consisting of two eyes, a nose and a mouth. Shots were too short-often as little as two or three seconds. The action scenes reminded me of the Batman ride I took at Great America. Things went by me so fast that I couldn't focus on anything that I saw during the ride. Apparently this style of filming is considered to be a new type of cinematographic art form.

Former Fresh Prince and current reigning king of the summer blockbuster Will Smith plays the tile character Hancock, a boozing loner and all around prick whose often well intentioned heroism leads to often catastrophic results and a spiraling out of control collateral damage bill. During one of his heroic exhibitions, Hancock saves the life of bleeding heart public relations agent Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who believes that Hancock is in need of a dire image change and offers his services as payback for saving his life. Hancock begrudgingly agrees and is convinced to voluntarily turn himself over to the authorities (who have several hundred outstanding citations against him) and do time in prison in a bid to win public affection and clean up his act. His stint in prison gives way to one of the more hilarious scenes thus far this year involving one prisoners head being thrust into another prisoners rear end! It is crass, but it works. With the first half passed what has been presented is an entertaining urban superhero movie which comes dangerously close to having already shot its load. However, with a switch of genre and some nicely placed twists, a love triangle is established between Hancock, Ray, and Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) which adds some more spice to the unconventional superhero film. And so it goes, as the film jumps from comedy to action to drama and does so quite nicely. Throughout it all the films three leads adapt very well to the shifts in genre, especially the versatile Will Smith who hits all of the right notes. Charlize Theron  who I usually do not look forward to watching due to her often pretentious and dour portrayals of late  seems to be having the most fun on screen that I can remember, and low key comedy maestro Jason Bateman continues to forge a reputation of becoming quite the scene stealer, ala Bill Murray. Keeping the film on a steady register is Michael Mann protégé Peter Berg, who was brought in after several directors attached to the film before him moved on to different projects. Berg's gritty tones and shaky cam styling blends very well with the films big budget fodder, most notably the special and visual effects which are a visceral treat. Since Hancock does not play slave to a source material, it does not come off as generic. The only film which comes close to matching its concepts would be the excellent animated film The Incredibles. Yet while its script may be shaky  especially with its talk of Gods walking amongst men  the films performances and Berg's spirited direction make up for whatever flaws are present.

And the beginning almost fooled me, a spectacular car chase intercut with a hung-over Hancock (Will Smith) sleeping on a bench and awaken by that kid from ""The Middle"". It takes him a while to get up, which is plausible for someone who still got the bottle in his hand, and when he took off, it just reminded me of Woody's comment about Buzz: he doesn't fly, he falls in style. And for some strange reason, despite all the obvious CGI, the flying stunts looked realistic and that's one of the delights of ""Hancock"".Indeed, there's no reason to have a superhero flying like some torpedo, missile or rocket, Hancock's flying consist of high jumping and trying to fall on the right spot, which doesn't go without costing a few bucks to the community. And when he stops the criminals by impaling their car over a tower after a ride that had its share of collateral damages, Hancock's not exactly acclaimed like a hero but booed and insulted. It's so fun and refreshing to see movies questioning the consequences of a superhero's action, ""The Incredibles"" did that in 2004 but ""Hancock"" takes that element seriously and it's the right tone. If it wasn't serious, it would have made his character a major goofball we would have instantly liked, but the point isn't to like Hancock.Precisely, he's a bitter, ill-mannered man who couldn't care less but for some reason, still cares. So when PR executive Ray (Jason Bateman) is stuck on the railroad Hancock saves him from the train collision by throwing his car backwards (instead of taking it away) and causes a train wreck by blocking it. After that, Ray sees the man who's just saved his life being insulted by an angry crowd, and naturally, decides to help him back by restoring his heroic public image. He invites Hancock to his house where he meets his son Aaron and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) who obviously looks at him just like Jean Arthur looked at Alan Ladd in ""Shane"". We haven't seen enough movies if we don't guess there's history between them, but whatever expectation we have, it'll be a big surprise.Another surprise is in the interesting shift of genres, from comedy to drama, with an intermediary section set in a jail. The sequence shows all the efforts to rehabilitate Hancock, we see him handling the prisoners, sometimes it contributes to hilarious sight gags that remind us not to take the material too seriously, and sometimes we see the 'Will Smith' of ""Happyness"" and ""Seven Pounds"" trying to change, to be a better man. His presence in the jail is vital to the development of his character since he can go out at any time but he's ready to play the game, to accept the rules, except maybe when it comes to ""shooting some b-ball"" outside the court. After serving part of his sentence, learning a few lessons about how to congratulate the police force, how to fly and land without causing major damages and learning to be nice, the test comes.Hancock's called for an emergency, he shaves his beard, puts on a tight uniform with an eagle logo and go meet his destiny. He stops the robbery in all professionalism and efficiency, earning him finally the cheers of the by-standers, the police and the journalists. This is where the choice to have a serious action picture instead of a comedy pays off, if Hancock was comical, his ovation at the bank would have been a triumphant and happy moment, instead, it's a moving and emotional epiphany for him, and a fine transition to the third act that finally reveals the deal between Mary and Hancock. And it's such a particular story that it could have been handled in a sequel but the Mary storyline with a revenge from a few villains tie up the plot together in a heart-pounding finale.And I was surprised Roger Ebert didn't mention it in his review, because the climax reminded me totally of the bond between Elliott and E.T the Extra-Terrestrial and it might even reveal what the film is ultimately about: energy. There is a positive energy and a negative one, Hancock had the same forces and skills but before he turned into a decent guy, he was full of negative vibrations that impacted his actions. He couldn't stand people calling him a certain name maybe because he used that same insult against himself. By interiorizing his doubts, his wounds, his questions about his past for years and years, he turned himself into that bitter jerk. Ray could finally unveil the good side of him and allow him to ope to people, it's an interesting metamorphosis from one energy to another.And naturally there's the energetic connection between Hancock and Mary whose respective backstories are finally revealed and make the final confrontations not just spectacular but incredibly poignant. ""Hancock"" is a good movie because it's about a superhero who's a good man surrounded by good persons and learn how to be even better not just by being brave or polite but also selfless.

Yes, this superhero wasn't in a comic or published 50 years ago, but the movie had great twists and turns throughout the film that kept me edging on my seat. I never once thought the filming or idea of the story was far-fetched, just like i never thought Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider was far-fetched. With new ideas, you have to open your mind to possibilities, and this one brought a great idea to the lime light and succeeded. Now a sequel would be going to far for this one, but I would purchase this movie because it was so good. You'll like it if you can open your mind to possibilities.

Peter Berg apparently didn't to know who he made the movie for as parts seem geared toward a younger demographic (Will Smith doing ridiculous things that are cartoonish and physically impossible) while other moments are quite adult (certain scenes border on an R-rating). These elements would be fine if Hancock were purely and action movie for grown-ups or a light-hearted comedy for the whole family, but it just doesn't work trying to have them both in the same film. Also, the comedy just didn't ""click"" for me, it seemed out of place and childish, and the entire role of the guy from Arrested Development (an AWFUL show in my opinion) didn't need to be there - and the same goes for Charlize Theron's character. The shaky cam was distracting, the characters were unlikable (other than Hancock), the story was whack, and as with I am Legend, the Fresh Prince is the only saving grace, but unlike that movie, the depths of his acting talent cannot save a movie that is this broken. Worst of all, the best scenes were in the trailers, making them more entertaining to watch than the actual thing - I almost asked my friends if they wanted to walk out. The one good thing in it - the action - does not last nearly long enough to warrant the rest of the picture. Do yourself a favor, even if you love Will Smith, and save your money. Check this website before watching another Will Smith movie, and never see another one of Peter Berg's messes.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The problem is: this movie, like most Hollywood potboilers, is devoid of any intellectual content. In other words, this movie verges on the brink of outright banality. Not good, not bad, not anything. Why even make this movie? Why not a cartoon instead? Now the movie's main character is supposed to be a hero. Okay, let's talk about heroes. On June 6, 1944, American soldiers invaded Europe on the coast of northern France at a place called Normandy Beach. Their objective: to establish a beach head and begin the liberation of Europe from Nazism. Everyone of those valiant soldiers who participated in that historic event were heroes. So there is no need to for Hollywood to make up heroes. All one has to do is read history books and you will find all the heroes, villains, good guys, and bad guys you want. This movie is proof that Hollywood is now stretching the Superman genre to its limits. Superman with an attitude? Duh. By the way, as good an actor as Will Smith is, he is no Christopher Reeve, or George Reeves for that matter, and Mr. Reeve WAS a hero - a real life hero.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

My view did not change when I walked in to see this film. However since the film was dubbed as a ""comedy superhero film"" I thought I was at least going to be entertained. Despite the good strong start on this year's summer blockbuster films, Hancock is one of the most mediocre and least entertaining of all.The plot follows an unconventional superhero by the name of Hancock. Despite his heroics, he often lays a wave of property destruction during his act. One day, he rescues a doomed PR from being hit by a train. This begin a change to Hancock's life as Ray (The PR) attempts to change the public's view on Hancock.The film's structure is somewhat similar to the Adam Sandler's film Clicks. The first half is mainly comedy and the second part is mainly drama. I personally enjoyed this system because it prevented the film from being dragging on and kept things pretty interesting.One of the key highlights of this film is Jason Bateman. He is one of the few actor in this film that provides a good and solid performances. Similarly, he is also one of the few likable characters in the film. This leads to the negatives of Hancock...One of the obvious problems with this film is the special effects. Not one of the scenes where special effects are used look convincing in anyway. After Iron Man and other films that were able to present excellent and believable special effects, it is very disappointing. Secondly, the humor isn't so great. A lot of the jokes are present in the trailer and the running gags throughout the film isn't all that funny. Considering that I didn't find this movie that funny made the much more serious second part to be a lot more enjoyable.Finally, the plot is full of plot holes and paper thin. Many things are left unexplained and the film's attempts to create multiple story lines does not work in the slightest.Overall Hancock is definitely not worth the 10 dollars price of admission. It is very forgettable and doesn't impress much. Save your money for The Dark Knight.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

By chance, he ends up saving the life of an idealistic image consultant who wants to repay the favor by rehabilitating his image. He achieves a measure of success, but then it turns out that the image consultant's wife is not who she seems to be.I am generally not a fan of superhero movies for a philosophical reason. I feel many (but perhaps not all) of these convey a fundamentally disempowering message: instead of taking charge of your life and your problems, wait and hope for some hero to come along and save the day, while you stick your head in the metaphorical sand that these escapist fantasies represent, and, most importantly, continue to consume.Interpreted this way, superhero movies are the ultimate corporatist feel-good drug, and I see the domination of this genre of today's movie business as a sign of societal ill health.To be sure, a superhero movie every now and then is not a problem at all, but this genre has proliferated (or should I say metastasized?) so much that we are now at a point at which real-life people can get lost in imaginary universes.I decided to watch HANCOCK because I understood it to be a spoof of superhero movies, and it would have been refreshing to see a film that lampoons the darker side of this genre which many people do not even seem to notice.There is spoofing going on in the first hour, alright, but unfortunately it is at the most superficial of levels.We get a superhero with an attitude problem and a PR guy who basically teaches him fakeness and insincerity, for example, persuading him to tell people ""good job"" even when it is completely undeserved.We get, just like in regular superhero movies, blatant product placements which reinforce the primary message of this type of movie, which compressed to three words, is ""hope and consume"".We get a scene in which the superhero, in a vulnerable moment, is told ""you are a hero"", and apparently the back-up plan of the Gods to save the rest of us. Far from spoofing the fundamental disempowering message of this entire genre, this film expresses and reinforces it more clearly than most of the movies it supposedly lampoons!(Incidentally, the ""slap that was heard around the world"", which as of this writing just happened a few days ago, may just be an indication of how people who engage in this elitist garbage messaging let it get to their head.)We get a shot at the very end of the moon literally plastered with a trademark, and this is supposed be a stand-in for performing actual good deeds. It is hard to think of a more obvious way to symbolize just how morally bankrupt the entire concept behind this movie is.But setting these philosophical quarrels aside, the ""spoof"" portion of the movie does have some mildly amusing moments. The real problems for the film, considered purely as an entertainment vehicle, begin with a plot twist about two-thirds into it, after which the film ceases to be a spoof and becomes the real thing.Simply, the twist makes no sense, and even worse, to try to make it work, the characters have to behave in an extremely stupid manner multiple times!Tacked on to this is a fake tragic ending which turns into a happy one (I mean, were you surprised?) for literally no reason whatsoever! Could the screenwriters not have come up with at least some semblance of a reason for why a supposedly dead guy suddenly gets up again? Really?Philosophically, the film is disgusting and even just considered purely as entertainment it is subpar, unless you don't mind having your intelligence insulted.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has its darker elements, it has its more comedic moments, it focuses on character far more than most and forgoes the lengthy final fight sequence that ordinarily typifies the genre. Will Smith is John Hancock, a down-and-out drunk with anger management problems and super-human powers, however he has no idea where he got them from or any idea how to use them responsibly. It is only when he meets PR consultant Ray (Jason Bateman) and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) that he begins to realise that it might be time to improve his image and turn his life around.Will Smith is a very rare entity, an actor who almost guarantees box-office success yet also providing performances that make the Academy sit up and take notice. At first glance, Hancock may not have seemed one of the most enticing of Hollywood's outputs this summer, but when one realises that it is Smith at the helm then all that changes - such is the likability and staunch proficiency that he yields. It is tough to imagine anyone else playing John Hancock once you have seen Smith's portrayal, and nigh on impossible to imagine anyone playing him any better. He finely balances the drunken, bitter and sarcastic Hancock with the more dependable hero he will inevitably become, whilst hints of the earlier (arguably more interesting) side of Hancock's personality remain throughout.Wry humour perpetually crackles through Hancock's crude dialogue; whether it be his interaction with children, criminals, cops or his supporting cast - Theron and Bateman. Scenes between Bateman and Smith particularly sparkle, their mismatch relationship is established early and works an absolute treat. Bateman's role is reminiscent of his character in Arrested Development, Michael Bluth, imbued with an awkward naivety and will to do good, so hats off to the casting director for their choice here. Theron is initially slightly less convincing as Bateman's wife who is less than thrilled to meet Hancock, but as the story unwinds she improves vastly as the script and plot gives her potential to do so (answering any questions as to her earlier performance along the way).'Hancock' is thoroughly grounded in the real world, far more than any other superhero movie to date, and the only point when this aspect actually lets the film down is in the villain department. There is no Green Goblin here, no Joker, Magneto or even a Lex Luther...all we are given is a few thugs and a bank robber with ideas above his station. For some, this may ruin the film as there is no obligatory half-hour, city-destroying, climactic sequence between the hero and his nemesis, for others (myself included) this may be a welcome change. Instead we have a carefully structured plot, slowly revealing the truth behind who Hancock is what he must do to make the transition to archetypal hero. The back-story to Hancock is fascinating and the twist in the tale propels the story into its final act just as you may be beginning to wonder whether it has run out of steam.What could have been a parody/farce similar to 'My Super Ex-Girlfriend' has been transformed into a thoroughly entertaining watch via a script with fresh ideas and top-notch performances. Where some will criticise it for fraying the edges between being a lightweight action-comedy and a more orthodox superhero flick, I would praise it for blending these two facets superbly and maintaining its edge of originality. The closing sequences may be a bit of an anti-climax, but this, thankfully, is not enough to knock Hancock off his stride.Verdict: Possibly mis-marketed and as a result of which Hancock will surprise you - in a good way. Will Smith, yet again, does not disappoint. FOUR STARS OUT OF FIVE","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Disheveled and unshaven in his appearance - and equally rude, crude and belligerent in his demeanor - Hancock lives by himself in a broken down trailer on the outskirts of L.A., a self-appointed outcast, for all intents and purposes, from the society around him. Alternately either inebriated or nursing a hangover, Hancock seems to have as little use for other people as they have for him. For even when he's out and about thwarting crime and rescuing the innocent, he's doing so more out of a sense of duty to his superhero DNA than any overwhelming love for humanity. Plus, his antics usually result in so much collateral damage to any buildings and motor vehicles that happen to be in his vicinity that the ungrateful citizens of the city would just as soon he leave them to their own devices and find some other metropolis that might be more amenable to his services. One day, however, he saves the life of Ray Embrey, an image consultant who believes he can turn the public's perception of Hancock around if only the superhero will allow him to work his magic on him. And perhaps, along the way, Ray will also be able to somehow reach that untapped vein of goodness residing at Hancock's core.Directed by Peter Berg, ""Hancock"" deserves kudos for at least attempting to inject some new life into a genre that seems well on its way to cannibalizing itself out of existence through tiresome repetition and massive overkill. It tries for a slightly more intimate experience by concentrating on Hancock's all-too-mortal weaknesses and by not having him go up against one of those arch villains that come as part of the standard package with the genre (Hancock has enough internal demons to wage battle against to have much time left over for anything else, I suppose). Unfortunately, after coming up with a fairly original and promising premise, the filmmakers let it get away from them through a combination of unfocused storytelling, gear-grinding tone changes, and CGI work that seems a trifle on the substandard side for an action film of this size and scope. Part ""My Fair Lady,"" part ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" part ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" and part whatever-else-they've-managed-to-throw-into-the-mix, the Vincent Ngo/Vince Gilligan screenplay wanders all over the map before finally settling into the slushiest, most rheumy-eyed superhero finale this side of ""Spiderman III"" (though let me just state right up front that ""Hancock"" is still miles above that fiasco). That's a shame, too, since Will Smith is as amiable and likable as ever, while Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman and adorable little Jae Head (from TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") are equally appealing in their supporting roles.""Hancock"" is not a bad movie really, just one that feels halfhearted and half-baked, earning it a Gentleman's C+ in the final analysis.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even with three strong performances, the film collapses from its' poor start and even worse end finale.Will Smith has the title role of Hancock, a one-of-a-kind superhuman who works with the LAPD to catch criminals. Well, at least he is supposed to but he has become an alcoholic to deal with his constant mood of depression, and his inebriated antics have caused millions of dollars in damages to Los Angeles City. All of which has caused him to fallout out of the public's favor. Enter Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a PR consultant who wants to help him repair his image. Before long, well actually almost immediately, Hancock agrees, and the two form an unlikely duo. The finale comes rather abruptly with one of the most surprising, confusing finale that is what ultimately ruins Hancock.All three talented stars (Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron) play their parts entertainingly well, but the story, script, direction, and camera work are what destroy it. The film clocks in at 92 minutes, leaving no time for character development and all the events happen so quickly and abruptly that it feels like an extended TV episodes with gazillion-dollar effects.Another thing that I found particularly annoying was this constant ""shaky"", close-ups of who ever was in the scene. Almost as if the studio was trying to save money on set design so they kept the camera in really tight.Once again the time and effort was put into wowing the audience with the special effects, which are quite remarkable, rather than entertaining with a strong story and developed characters. I would not even recommend it as brainless entertainment because it was rather boring. I still wonder why someone felt the need to go and create ANOTHER superhero movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The visuals in this movie were very cool. The special effects were very good as expected. I think they were better then in some other superhero movies. It was a very different superhero movie. Hancock was a very different, drunk, mean, smelly superhero. The twists in this movie were very good. They were kind of pretty obvious and others were unexpected. The direction of this movie was great. Will Smith was a good actor as he usually is. He had very good moments in this. He was definitely funnier than you would expect. The best thing about him was he didn't try to be funny he just was. This was probably the best action comedy movie made since Rush Hour. This movie has a very high budget for a very short movie. It was funny how all of the kids loved Hancock, but most parents all hated him. Charlize Therron was very pretty and had some good scenes. Will Smith and her and many funny, action, and dramatic scenes together. I think the movie remained pretty consistent all the way through. If anything it got a little better toward the end of the movie. I also thought the story was really good and didn't give anything away until the end. Just know going into this movie you have to be aware it is very far-fetched and very fake. So don't read the other reviews that say how fake and dumb this movie was. It was very fun and entertaining to watch. I would even go see it again maybe to catch anything I missed. Overall go see this movie it was very fun and surprisingly had a ton of heart.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

The film starts on one plot line, and then decides to change it completely half way through.

The beginning of the film is extremely boring, when Hancock is put into prison, but when he gets out, the film becomes as i said mildly entertaining.This isn't no exaggeration this is one of the worst films Will Smith has ever been involved in, its really not worth going to the cinema for, maybe check it out on the internet if you would like to be mildly entertained if not go and watch Deal or No Deal instead.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What the trailer doesn't tell you, is that after the rogue anti-hero drunkenly parades about as advertised, he has to develop a backstory and make the film go from a clever spin on a hot- ticket genre to an emotional action drama. There are entertaining and unique elements that make ""Hancock"" standout, but they end up secondary to a hodge-podge and two-faced plot concept.It's easy to be deceived these days by the shear unruly star-power that is Will Smith, especially when he's attached to a project dealing with superheroes, a genre that has been a cash machine. He's talented no matter what he does, and in that regard, ""Hancock"" is enjoyable. While I personally felt his character was too much of an a**hole as the script so frequently and unoriginally puts it, that doesn't mean Smith isn't good at it. He's just a great hero no matter the film. To quickly summarize, Smith plays ""Hancock,"" a lonely, drunken jerk with Superman powers and a public approval rating of zero. When he saves Ray's (Jason Bateman) life, Ray offers his services as a P.R. consultant and the two work to change his image. Eventually, you get to Hancock's back story and some strange but obvious twists take the film down a different path that to explain would be a major spoiler.So from the perspective of a producer that has a decent script with a highly marketable concept written by some nobodies and with a director (Peter Berg) attached whose best action credit is 2007's ""The Kingdom,"" I would definitely want to sign someone to play Hancock who is going to guarantee me top spot at the box office. Well, voila. Smith is such a proved commodity with an amazing streak of top first weekend box office spots that he could get any contract he wants and he should do that. After Smith, the marks for ""Hancock"" are pretty much middle of the road. The CGI and Berg's directing style is too sloppy for what should be a clean-cut summer blockbuster. His refusal to use any camera stabilizing device works for a few scenes, but most of the time it's just dizzying and the close-ups become obnoxious. The plot concept, which paints a picture of Hancock as a hero and then fills it in with the origin story later instead of the other way around, makes for an interesting affect, but instead of enlightening what we know about Hancock, it ends up taking the film in another direction entirely. While you might think this movie would leave you with themes about turning one's life around and becoming the best you can be, that gets glossed over and you're left themeless.If you want summer fun at the movies that is about as clumsy, destructive and amusing as the title character is, you should check out ""Hancock."" ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I must agree to many comments summarizing it as Superhero yet Human. Charlez Theron looks hot in her sequences, perhaps could have opened her character at least a little in initial reels.The pace and the humor on the proceedings are spot on, arguably there are very few talented stars with the impeccable comic timing, as Will Smith, portrays on screen.Its a must watch even if you loved superhero movies or even hated them.

I instead think that the first half of the movie was the better half. Simply because it had a lot more humor and better storytelling.What didnÂ't I like about this movie? well, first of I didnÂ't like the directing, it was way to shaky and confusing for this kind of movie. I allso felt that the script was very empty, they could have builded more on the character of Hancock instead of showing of effects that doesn't even look good IMO. The dialogue was flat as well and the plot was so short it felt that it was over too fast.As I said the second half of the movie takes a totally new direction and its over before you have anytime to get it in. Will Smith is a good actor, he plays the role relatively well, although its probably not a very hard role to play (Im not saying anything).To sum it all up Hancock is another of the movies that will entertain you. But certainly nothing youÂ'll remember in 10 years. it, like all movies released right now, falls into the shadow of The Dark Knight (ThatÂ's a nice line) and don't leave me touched at all.

They are not great, but they entertaining. They are a good way to spend 2 hours if you have nothing better to do. This movie is not. The main problem with this picture is the change of tone. The movie started out with potential, a flawed character with superpower who needs to change his ways to accept his true calling. I am not going to spoil anything, but you will notice, there is one scene by the middle of the film when the tone changes dramatically. It becomes from a light comedy with action to a sort of melodramatic Greek tragedy. By the third act I had no idea what was going on. I mean, they tried to put so much in the last half of the film that the film falls apart. The ""villain"" is terrible. He is poorly acted and he has no motives. The climax of the film is just a train wreck. I think this film could have been 500 times better if they would have added 20 minutes of explanation and more character development. The last half of the film just did not work because there were too many things happening at once. I have a friend that liked it because he compared to Greek tragedy and mythology, and then I compared it to Superman meets a romantic soap opera and starts crying because he just does not belong there. It had a lot of potential, but it just needed to be explained more thoroughly. Charlize Theron is really hot in this film though, and Jason Bateman plays on his Arrested Development character and makes him more complex and idealistic. The special effects are great of course, but that goes without saying in a big budget Will Smith movie. Something interesting that few people have commented about is the soundtrack. It was very explicit on what it was trying to convey in some scenes, it did not sublimate with the scene, it became a part of it because of its loudness. I liked it at first, normally superhero movies have the music in the background as to build for the climax of the scene, this one didn't. It was an interesting idea, was not great because sometimes it interrupted the scene, but it was OK. In the end, this film is not worth watching. If you want to watch Will Smith watch ""I am Legend"" with the alternate ending, or even ""I am Robot"". Those films are blockbusters that want to make you watch more of it. And if you are looking for a superhero movie in which the main character is an alcoholic, then go watch ""Iron Man"". I gave it a 5/10 because I was generous. The first half of the film deserves a 7 and the second a 4 or even 3. In the end, it was just a movie with potential that crashed by the end. Nothing more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Hancock just doesn't care what the public thinks of him anymore and he does more damage than good by helping the police or trying to save civilians. Hancock saves the life of a corporate Public Relation by the name of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who wants to resurrected Hancock's career for the public's eye. Hancock refuses at first, especially since he ignores Court Subpoenas and the damages that Hancock did in the city costs him millions of dollars. Hancock agrees to go in Prison for awhile to help the law enforcements and the public's eye change their minds about Hancock. Hancock gets to be friends with Ray and including his wife Mary (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron) and their young son Aaron (Jae Head). At first, Mary can't stand Hancock. Because he drinks heavily and he gives an bad impression to their son. When Hancock becomes an public hero again by saving hostages at the bank. Hancock slowly falls in love with Ray's wife but Mary doesn't appears as she seems to be to her family and Hancock.Directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights, The Kingdom, The Rundown) made an entertaining action/fantasy/drama that has plenty of often dark comedy as well. The premise of ""Hancock"" is somewhat original and it is completely different than what Marvel or DC Comics have to offer. Smith gives one of his best roles as ""Hancock"", which he makes his character very flawed superman, who is also human. Theron and especially Bateman offers terrific supporting performances. Director Berg offers plenty of story for a movie that runs a little over 90 minutes but it feels tight in some areas of the sub-plots in the movie and the villain played by Eddie Marsan is seriously underwritten. ""Hancock"" is one of those movies that film critics seems to hate badly (Only a few top named film critics like Roger Ebert or Peter Travers thought ""Hancock"" was unique enough). I also heard that director Berg cut a few things out of the film to not get an R-Rating. Sometimes i think that ""Hancock"" had a darker edge somewhere in the story but i am sure, it was cut for the cutting room floor and also reaching an bigger audiences for the PG-13 rating. I would love to see a Director's Cut of ""Hancock"" if Berg is planning one. I really liked the picture and most of the audiences were enjoying it, when i saw it a big screen theater. I think this is Berg's best movie since the underrated first feature ""Very Bad Things"".The Unrated DVD of ""Hancock"" adds 10 minutes of additional footage. It's includes scenes of the character of Hancock having an one night stand with an beautiful woman and longer kissing scene with Smith and Theron. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes five entertaining featurettes. If you haven't seen ""Hancock"", see it at the big screen or the drive-in. I think, you won't regret it. Daeg Faerch, who's best known for playing the young Michael Myers in the infamous remake of Rob Zombie's Halloween appears in a funny sequence with Smith. Mike Epps appears uncredited in a hilarious cameo as the Hostage Taker. Smith and filmmaker Michael Mann (Ali, Heat, Manhunter) are among the film's producers. Super 35. (****/*****). Also available in two-disc set DVD or Blu-ray that includes the original theatrical cut with two more feautrettes and as well for a digital copy of the movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I can tell you that they needed to have redone just about the whole picture. I like Will Smith, Charlize Theron, & the finally getting the roles & recognition he deserves Jason Bateman, but NOBODY could have saved this. I heard that this was one of the best scripts when it first was floating around town so it really makes you wonder what happened? This movie isn't the worst thing ever made, but it is one of the worst of the summer & is Will Smith's worst summer movie (even Men in Black II is better!) he's ever done. I have a strong suspicion that a lot of the problem w/this is because of studio tampering amongst other things. Right off the bat you know something is wrong when a Superhero flick is a scant 92 minutes (only about 1 hour twenty-something minutes when you take out the credits) and the whole ""explanation"" is a cop-out. I am willing to bet this is going to be right on par with the 1st ""Hulk"" when it tanks 65-70% it's second weekend. This is probably one of the dullest Superhero movies you will ever see & I very much doubt anyone that sees this will ever want to revisit it again either. If Will Smith makes this a hit (which he probably will) he can sell any movie. The acting is good, the special effects are passable, & the cinematography isn't bad, but other than that, skip this unless you thought Will Smith's ""Wild Wild West"" was a classic. Peter Berg has yet to show us what he can really do with a big budget (""The Kingdom"" doesn't count & ""Friday Night lights"" was probably 1/5 this budget) & a good story. In a field crowded with Good Superhero movies, we don't have to swallow anymore of these if we stop going to see them. This movie will be a laughing matter as soon as ""The Dark Knight"" comes out anyway.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

First of all, don't take the movie seriously (you were supposed to take seriously ""I am legend"" and it was a disappointment for me). I liked the fact that there is no big villain character in the movie and no epic battle between the good and the bad (thank you, writer/director/producer!,that's what ruined it for me in ""Iron Man""). It was funny and kind of realistic where it concerned media and public reaction. I liked Charlize Theron character, and the scenes between them were good. I found the explanation about their destiny/love story, whatever you call it, stretched,- but at least trying to be different.I found it charming that they are attracted to each other again and again, but when they are together it neutralizes their powers. Maybe we enjoyed it because we did not expect much and were entertained, it was a more fun super hero (charming Will Smith), and aside from the last scenes in the hospital, kept the good spirit including the final Moon Ad. It made us feel good (my family of adults), instead of the uneasy feeling we have after watching all the other super hero's, including good movies like ""the dark night"" and ""iron man"" and the last ""hulk"". The uneasy feeling is because this comic characters are taken too seriously - more and more so- and people relate to them in a real way. I thought it is a good thing to put it back into purely imaginary product, showing the flows of such imaginary hero and the possible outcome of his imaginary deeds.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was not to impressed with Will Smith's previous movie I Am Legend. However this movie exceeded my expectations by far. One of the things I enjoyed most about this movie is how it avoided many of the superhero movie clichés and set up its own unique style and tone. It did a great job mixing comedy with action. However I fell like it faltered a little bit near the end as it took on a much more serious tone which I feel was out of place. Other than that I have no real complaints.

It has an intriguing premise in that the highly charismatic Will Smith plays a reluctant superhero whom everyone hates - and he hates everyone - for the damages he cause every time he comes to the rescue. But the lead actor's charm is wasted in a material that doesn't know what to do with its setup and essentially scrambles to decide what to do next, ending up as a generic summer movie that had the potential to effectively satirize other movies of its genre.Smith plays John Hancock, a perennial drunkard who feels obligated to help the people of Los Angeles from their troubles. Problem is, no one likes him - and he retaliates by not liking them either, throwing off vulgarities that never seem offensive either because Smith is saying them, or because of the PG-13 rating.He meets public-relations specialist Ray Embry (Jason Bateman) after rescuing the latter from certain death in a railway. In return, Ray takes it upon himself to have Hancock transform into someone people will actually look forward to seeing, and this involves doing time in jail. His wife Mary (Charlize Theron) hates the idea and would rather have Hancock stay out of their lives.Then director Peter Berg, and writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan hit a wall. The dark comedy turns into a conventional superhero movie thereon, with subpar CGI and a messy narrative to boot. The exposition is hurriedly done and Hancock's backstory is covered in such a flimsy manner to give way to more summer movie orthodoxy, and a twist that has been telegraphed right from the setup.Smith is always fun to watch and he'll always be a crowd pleaser, even in this film which reduces his character's edge to mere banality. Which is unfortunate, because underneath all the trapping lies a more substantial promise.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Hancock is good fun about a broken, lost & lonely super hero called Hancock played perfectly by the always excellent WILL SMITH. This film has alot of laughs but more heart & drama mixed into a big budget super hero movie. Sometimes this film goes to a very deep & emotional level during some really brutal action scenes towards the end & it packs that powerful punch that SMITH does & he gives another excellent performance as Hancock. This is basically an origin story of the lost soul super hero Hancock, Yes there is a ""man of steel"" vibe & there's similarities between ""superman"" & Hancock but Hancock feels more real if that's possible when talking about fantasy heroes!!! & he's basically a messed up version of ""Superman"" really but with more grit & darkness. It's another excellent performance from Will Smith who is my favourite actor, he does the big Action c.g.i fx action stuff but also hits all the darker & more emotional notes too, Hancock is a very troubled & complex character.Also Hancock has a beautiful music score by John Powell that really digs into each scene & totally complements the sequence, it's one of the best & most effective scores I've heard in a long time & definitely one of the best of the super hero genre. Also Hancock boasts stunning cinematography & a real heart that's the backbone of the story.Charlize Theron & Jason Bateman are also EXCELLENT & really do give fantastic performances that help lift this very dark super hero film up to a higher level. There's deeply moving music throughout that heightens the emotional moments & the film looks fantastic. Seriously an underrated different type of superhero movie.BRILLIANTLY directed & stunningly filmed with a real gritty & grainy look something you definitely don't expect from a big blockbuster super hero film!!! But like i said before Hancock is alot of fun & has big expensive c.g.i action scenes but the underlining story is very heart breaking & serious & emotional,this movie goes to a dark place in the 2nd half & that's how i see this movie as the first half is comedy action & the 2nd half is very serious dark drama & it works perfectly. Now not everything is perfect as i don't like the big fight between Smith & Theron when they battle in the city & destroy so much stuff, it's a ridiculous sequence that only exists so that Smith can say ""You better not hit me with that truck"" as if that's really funny? & the whole fight is a big mess of crappy CGI that looks horrible & it's such a big expensive waste of a sequence. I really think that fight should've been cut out. That's my big negative anyway that silly OTT super man vs super woman fight.There's actually alot of real life themes mixed into this super hero movie like belonging, friendship, love & acceptance that hangs over Hancock & its such a different way at looking at a super hero character. Hancock is troubled hero that doesn't understand his place or meaning in our world & Smith delivers with his powerhouse performance & creates such a nice hero that i wish Hancock was the start of a franchise.The look of the movie is nice too as is the lovely score & i get a very 90's feel when i watch Hancock.LOVE HANCOCK & think it's definitely one of Will Smith's most underrated films & one of his most underrated pieces of fantastic acting. Hancock is a Super Hero Cult Classic in my opinion.Will Smith has been my favourite actor, rapper & idol since i was young growing up in the 90's & watching the Classic Fresh Prince series on t.v & listening to his Classic album BIG WILLIE STYLE over & over again, big Nostalgic love for Will Smith.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Get yourself a tub of popcorn, turn off your brain and just soak it up. Do yourself a favour though... turn it off when it hits half way! Like a crazy alcohol endued night, this movie builds itself up fast and unrelenting. It has a laugh a minute which may not be the most intellectually challenging, but then again who cares! Then, all of a sudden, a woman comes in between you and your best pal, the movie! Somewhere half way the film flattens out and takes a fast noise dive. The boys in Hollywood always feel compelled to introduce a love element into every story and sometimes it just don't fit. The jokes stop and the sentimental mush begins. Not that I'm anti-romantic or anything... the love story is just that bad! ...and the movie was doing so well. Don't be conned either by the promise of revelations to be revealed (how he got his super powers and immortality, bla, bla, bla...). Its a lose thread, desperately dangling for you to take a grip, designed only to keep you until an unsatisfying end. Indeed you'd be better off not knowing the explanation; the mangled cringe-worthy excuse for a plot. -LEAVE!!!-...leave while you were still enjoying the movie... leave just at the point where the first revelation (you'll know it when it comes) is revealed. Go home with a glowing feeling in your belly from the barrels of laughs, rather then it turning into a desire to barf!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm not here to spoil the movie for anyone, but many will understand the concept of two people who seem destined for one another, but when together, they're weaker than when they're apart, leaving them one option - show their love by distancing themselves.

Another example that you can put the biggest names on the screen but with no script it fails.I will say that Will Smith dishes out a brilliant performance as the neglected superhero who distastefully annoys the American public with his reckless acts of drunken destruction. He does a great job of making you care for his character but the plot is so aimless there is almost no suspense involved therefore rendering all of the characters useless. It's as if the writers had to cough up an idiotic draft for the studio and the producers we're just as moronic to accept it. Honestly who would've approved of that mindless twist that they throw at the audience as if we're supposed to go along with it? At this point I was about to yack on my friend sitting next to me.This movie is a prime exemplification of an egotistical Hollywood holstering too much money and power with little talent to deliver the goods. I walked into Hancock expecting an epic adventure that would satiate my entertainment needs, but I ended up strolling home wishing I had given myself a Handjob instead.If you enjoy flying humans bashing through skyscrapers with unlimited force then this might be for you. However if you teeth for plot and cling to suspense, then you may consider passing on this one.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, unlike other superhero's he really is a bad boy, not caring what he does, who he hurts as long as he gets the job done and winds up threatening more lives than he saves. That is until he saves loser PR man Ray Embrey, who realises that within Hancock, their really is a hero trying to get out. After taking him home to meet his family, he realises that he may be able to help him and turn Hancock into the hero he always could be. After doing exactly what no-one expects to do which is care about his previous actions, he then takes to becoming a true hero, acting against all he instincts he starts to turn into someone that people like and want to be, until his past, quite literally, sends him reeling.This is an Akiva Goldsman production and usually his name on a film is like having Cyanide as an ingredient on a drinks bottle, but, like Hancock himself, he acts against type here but letting someone else pen the work, and as such creates a film that is far better than it could have been. This is a film with some genuine surprising moments and a pretty decent script. When I was watching at first I hated Will Smith's Hancock and thought he was a real *sshole, and was not looking forward to watching his adventure, but this is what we're supposed to feel, Will's performance is spot on and he performs so well against his usual likable persona that it's a real compliment to his skills that he pulls this off so well. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are equally great as the blissfully happy couple into whose lives Hancock crash lands.The script is far better than I thought it would be and while some elements are very Hollywood and clichéd (Especially near the end) this is still a very good film that is worth the price of admission and shows another side to both Will Smith's range and also Akiva Goldsman's skills. I can't say why the critics are having a go at this film as I have now seem it twice, not because I'm a big Will Smith fan, simply because it is a good movie. As I sat there the second time I was trying to think what set the film apart from other superhero studies, and, apart from the obvious that this does not come from a comic, the big thing is that, due to Will Smith's performance we get a glimpse of a hero who really feels, not bullets, or the impact of the train but feels for people around him and the makers really focus on this, this is not a film about a Superhero but a film about a super human.As you may have gathered by the rest of this review, the biggest surprise in this film is that while the trailer does feature many of the films interesting moments, there is so much to this film than what we see in the trailer. In fact in terms of the tone of the film it is very different to what we see in the trailer. I could say a lot more but to do so would spoil some of the surprises that you may not know about, and unlike some reviewers I'm not gonna do that.I think for most reviewers the big problem is that it's not Batman, the film they've already decided if the best cause Heath Ledger's dead. Truth is there is room for 2 good superhero films and this was the first of the year. Trust me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

All I have to say is that this movie was great. I am still trying to figure out just what movie the critics were reviewing because trust me Hancock was all that and a bag of chips. In some ways Hancock was like a super hero movie for mature movie goers as the story line kept movie watchers glued to their seats. The movie twist that so many critics claimed were out of no where were great in my opinion and actually made the movie that much better. If you want to see a solid movie which happens to have a super hero as its main character, Hancock is that movie. Will Smith once again was at the top of his game. And the supporting cast of Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman help make what I would call one of the best mature super hero movies I have ever seen.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

To see movies in another country  and experience the cinema hall, the public and culture is a totally different experience.This is an unusual story of super-hero John Hancock (Will Smith)  who is not the typical super-hero that we see in movies. Hancock is a reckless super-hero, always drunk and dis-interested in life. His super-hero action is always costing the Los Angeles city enormous losses. Everyone hates Hancock  even the kids (who normally love super-heros). Here enter a marketing person Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who convinces Hancock to join correction center and improve his image. Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) does not like Ray and Hancock's friendship. At this point  a story opens up with another Super-hero character. I will not tell you here to spoil sports. Hancock looses his super-hero powers and faces death, but at the end of the movie survives villains.The scale of the movie is big, the actions even bigger. The story line is interesting  but the execution poor. The script has serious flaws. It takes the audience as dumbheads, and there is too much of abusive language for someone to enjoy this kind of movie.At will, the director Peter Berg (the lousy The Kingdom fame) tries to make the audience believe what he is presenting. There are twists and turns in the movie that are foolish to the hilt. I won't go into the details of the big pot holes.Will Smith looks cool  but he carries this arrogant wrenched facial expression throughout  which after some time, becomes difficult to look at.Only fools can enjoy the movie.As Kingdom was bad  this too is a immaturish movie.I go with 3 out of 10 stars  3 stars for its grand scale and Will Smith.(Stars 3 out of 10)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first 15 minutes or so is full of action and fun. Then the movie simmers down but the comedy/humor/irony gets even better. The movie doesn't spend any time explaining who the villains are they just are, and that is just how Hancock himself sees it, he does not care. But being an alcoholic, why does he care, there is no explanation, he is a superman type and so he just do what he does, only, with a hangover the job is not done with razor sharp precision so you sit there and go ""ooops"" ""ouch"" ""not good"" as you follow his erratic or seemingly not so controlled course through the city while showing bad judgment in the eyes of the citizens.Later on the movie changes mood to a bit more serious but there still is a humoristic overtone. Followed by a couple of sudden surprises that explain who Hancock really is, both to Hancock himself and the audience.To me the movie is intense in various ways so it really pulled me into it and it have action in the beginning and end and nothing whatsoever that irritated me I just sucked the whole thing in and it was a great movie.To me it was stronger and more inventive than other superhero movies so I give it higher mark, I have to give it an 8.

He has super-strength, the ability to fly and indestructible. He is also a raging alcoholic, causes millions of dollars of damage and hated by the people of Los Andreas. He is pretty much a tramp and hates what he does. However, he saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), an PR executive, and offers his services to improve Hancock's reputation. He get him to service time in prison and show how important he is to the city and more importantly, make him care about saving people. But Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) does not truth or even like Hancock, and want the family to move away from him as quickly as possible.I could easily picture the pitch meeting, 'Superman as an alcoholic': that is the concept. It works for the most part, with some superhero scenes played for laughs, like Hancock flying drunk and clashing into road signs on the freeway and the world acknowledges that he causes a lot of destruction compared to Superman, Spiderman, Batman, etc... There is a lot of physical comedy, but the best bit of comedy is playing on superhero conventions, like when Hancock saves Ray, and he ends up arguing with citizens. Will Smith is a good comedic performer, but he play his role pretty seriously as well. This was clearly his vehicle. He was offered the chance to play Superman, but he refused because he didn't want to break racial lines, he made the right decision. I think an original superhero was the best option for Will Smith, giving him and all that was involved in the film a lot more freedom. The other actors in the film were perfectly find, Charlize Theron was good, and I personally thought she would have been a great choice to play Emma Frost in X-Men.Peter Berg direction is still a little unsure: this is his first blockbuster film. Some moments didn't quite work, and the CGI could have been better. But the action is solid, and has a good future in-front of him. He has Michael Mann as a backer and producer so he must have something. As well as playing against superhero conventions, Berg also does pay some homage to superhero films, like Superman, i.e. the music, and X-Men, the costume.Some critics complain about the film had a good idea and then the producers forced more action scenes to the film. But this is an action comedy, and the best action comedies have good action scenes, like Hot Fuzz. My criticisms are that film is a little too short, that there is a lack of a major villains and that they should have been more comedy, especially verbal gags. The film should have also stuck to it's convictions, and gone for an R/15 rating, instead of watering it down for a PG-13.A perfectly worthy film, a decent blockbuster.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In fact, I wasn't even planning to see the movie, but the mall was so boring that I decided to the flick anyways. When I saw the trailer, I thought it looked like a fun summer movie. There was nothing really amazing or intriguing about the movie.Hancock is a superhero, but a very different one. He is always drinking and the public hates him so much. When bad guys are on the loose or people's life is in danger, he gets the job done, but not without leaving a big mess behind. The thing is that Hancock doesn't care what people think about him, the public had have enough of this guy rude behavior. His life suddenly changes when one day he saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR executive. With the help of Embrey, Hancock starts realizing he may have a side he hasn't seen and the side that the public really need.At first, things going smooth in the story, but then there is a twist in the movie that I thought the director could off done better. I thought it took a while to fully explain everything in the movie. I was getting a little confused when they were trying to pick up after the twist, but I understood everything at the end.I really liked Will Smith as Hancock. I loved the character and Will Smith did a great job. It wasn't his best performance, but a great one. Jason Bateman was a good choice to play Ray Embrey. I think he did a fine job acting. There were some scenes that he was trying to be humorous, but it didn't worked that well. And there was Charlize Theron, which I thought was great as Mary Embrey.Hancock has good action scenes and good enough special effects. The movie wasn't really action packed; it was just an average action movie. The special effects were believable, but not realistic. To me, they didn't look as really as other blockbuster films. But that doesn't mean I didn't liked them, I'm so saying they could off been better.Hancock was a good superhero movie. The only problem that I had was the twist. If it wasn't for that, I would off give the movie a better rating. The movie has good humor, action, and special effects. It wasn't the best superhero film, but a good popcorn summer flick.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It might have been a bit better without some of the repetitive dialog, but I don't want to nitpick.All in all, a good surprise.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought going in this movie would be pretty bad. Batman and Robin bad. Catwoman bad. Wild Wild West bad. Speed Racer bad. But lo and behold it delivers the goods. I agree with the consensus that the first half is funny and has all the jokes and the second half gets all serious and dark. But I thought that it worked. Will, Jason, and Charlize were all great. The effects were good, not great. I just imagined that this would be a total train wreck of a movie and it's nowhere close to that. It's entertaining and I actually plan to see it again. That's why I say a person is their own best critic. Don't listen to the media. As far as ranking Hancock with the other pics of the summer that I've seen I would say Iron Man, Indy, Hancock, Prince Caspian, Wanted, and The Incredible Hulk. Haven't seen any other ones yet. But I'm glad Hancock turned out to be good.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was hard to sit all the way through it because it wasn't very interesting. Will Smith, plays superhero Hancock, but unlike other superheroes, he is rude, crude, and creates a mess whenever he tries to help. He's caused millions of dollars worth of damage and has been sued by those he helps.One day he saves Ray and Ray has the idea to change Hancock's image so the public will like him. First, he tells him to go to jail so the public will miss him, then wear a superhero costume, and say good job to the police. Throughout, Ray's wife, Mary, keeps giving Hancock weird looks, so we know something is up. She knows him from the past and the movie just tells up why, no mystery to it.The ending just left a lot to be desired. I didn't find it very entertaining. Plus, I don't get why they made the special effects so fake. Hancock flying and throwing the whale looked too fake for today's special effects.FINAL VERDICT: Teens will probably like this but I'd say most adults wouldn't. Also, the language used is too vulgar for real young kids, say under 12. The word a ##hole is used too much.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

When they were dealing with serious issues and ramification of being a superhero, interest would grow, then come tumbling down with misplaces unnecessary attempts at humor. The fx were almost good, but just not good enough so they really stood out as noticeably insufficient to carry the scene. All the talent is underused and again bland performances. No real conflict as the ""villain"" was so normal, regular, and useless. Actually that he became a villain came out of nowhere and didn't gel with the tone of the film. One might suggest the real conflict took place within Hancock himself, but even this was mismanaged. So many good ideas that just failed to deliver. Go watch unbreakable for a good non-superhero superhero movie. My low rating is due to it ALMOST succeeding on all levels, thus disappointing me even more in the end.

Its characters are fully fleshed out and not the same old one~dimensional cartoons seen everywhere else; its concepts are unique and interesting; and even its special effects feel more real. The allegory of its story line is applicable to real life, and the relationships it shows are motivated by the same values as real relationships ~ not a single note rings false!

Will Smith's first fourth of July weekend movie was Independence Day. After its success other movies like Men In Black 1 and 2 and Wild Wild West were also released on July 4th. So, is Hancock a worthy addition to Smith's Fourth of July movies, or is it another July 4th failure like Transformers?Hancock(Smith) is one of only two superheroes left in the world. He is hated by the public because he leaves millions of dollars in damage after stopping a crime. After he saves the life of Ray Embrey(Bateman), they enter a partnership to help fix Hancock's image with the public. They send Hancock to prison so the public can miss him. After the crime rate soars, Hancock leaves prison a changed man. He cleans up the crime, but starts to enter a risky relationship with Mary Embrey(Theron). He will then learn about his past and his possibilities for the future. Hancock's characters start off promising, but don't go anywhere after the first act. Hancock is a very unique led obviously, as the movie bears his name. After the first act though, he's done changing and becomes Mr.Perfect. Ray Embrey is a man trying to change the world, but is currently failing. I think a lot of us can sympathize with the guy. Mary Embrey is the one of the worst developed characters and she hurt the movie the most. Her character doesn't go anywhere and there is nothing special about her. The same goes for her child. Hancock has terrible, last second villains. They barely ever speak, and worst of all, they're just regular people with guns. Hancock's plot had promise, but the execution was terrible. The structure is the worst that I've seen in a long time. The first act tries to do too much, while the second and third act is stretched to make the movie long enough. The movie also switches genres from a light hearted action/comedy to a serious drama. The first act, the action/comedy, was fun to watch and made it look as though this was going to be one of the best movies of the summer. The second act came though, and it switched to being a drama. There is a nice twist, but it isn't well made enough to be called good drama, and wasn't very entertaining. Hancock has a terrible ending. The climax is an easily won battle in a hospital, but that isn't the worst. The resonance at the end was stupid and one of the most illogical things ever seen on film. Hancock puts a heart on the moon for Ray and Mary. Did he use the blood of humans to paint it, since buying paint would cost at least two billion dollars? Did he enslave NASA workers to paint it, since if only he did it, it would take at least five years? Are Ray and Mary really that stupid they need someone to tell them there's a big heart on the moon?Hancock has a very bland setting. The city apparently has a very high crime rate, but it seems as though everything is going just dandy. Batman has Gotham City. Spider-Man has New York City. Hancock has just another run of your mill city. The prison was a very boring place and it wasn't even a very scary one. The hospital was a terrible setting for the ending. Hancock has bad directing, mainly because of the action scenes. They are filmed very poorly because the director moves the camera around very fast to try and create an atmosphere, but it does the exact opposite. He never creates an effective atmosphere, and never uses the right shots to maximize the setting's potential, if there's any. Hancock has OK cinematography. It doesn't take away from the film, but not as good as Iron Man or The Dark Knight(basing it off the trailer). Hancock has bad music. The action music barely adds anything to the movie, and the dramatic music is overdone and takes you out of the story. Hancock actually has good acting. Will Smith is always a good lead, and he doesn't mess up. He has good chemistry with the other actors and always brings his own style to the role. Will Smith is also great with body language, which is he has shown in Pursuit of Happiness, I Am Legend, and Hancock. Jason Bateman does a good job with his role and was the perfect person to play the part. Charlize Theron is the weakest of the three actors, but she's still OK. So, Hancock isn't as good as Men in Black or Independence Day, but it's better than Wild Wild West.BAKED FRESH FILM BOTTOM LINE 4/10Pros: Acting First Act Nice TwistCons: Character Development Structure Switches genres Action scenes filmed poorly/ rest of directing Music SettingRating Information PG-13 1.

Normally surprises turn to the worst in movies, but in this one, they turned out not to be a disappointment, to me, at least, I don't know about the rest of you. Definitely well worth your money to go and see this summer hit wonder!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It started out good and actually kept going that way for about the first 50 minutes but then it all comes crashing down almost immediately. It was as if the writers gave up after the first half and decided to write something that would appeal to Hollywood. I was actually impressed at how quickly this movie went downhill.I've never been a fan of Will Smith. I mean, I never thought he was too great of an actor and his roles are usually cliché or just plain annoying to me. This was pretty much the same. He had some really funny lines but as a whole, I didn't like his character at all. The rest of the cast was pretty good in general and there were some good characters.The story, what can I say about the story? let's be honest, it sucks. even the first half didn't have much of a story going for it. However, when the second half roles around, you'll wish they didn't try to add more of a plot because the lack of one would have actually worked with this film. It tries far too hard to be inspirational and ""cool."" They should have kept going with the comedy thing and it would have been fine. It still wouldn't have been a great movie by any means but it would have been better than what the final product turned out to be.Wait until you can see this movie for free because it isn't worth the price of admission. It's totally average and even down right bad toward the end of the film. It's nothing to get excited about, at all!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Recently we have seen flicks like Spiderman-3 losing itself in everything else by going to make it big in special-effects. Although I will never ever understand how The Dark Knight got to be such a hit, it didn't have a plausible plot(although many claim that the story was the strongest aspect of the movie) or the big-budget special effects.But Hancock delivers it all. I cannot understand why it did not make it big like Spiderman or Dark Knight or Iron Man. Because this movie is right up there with the others, if not above.Hancock has everything in it. Nice story with good special effects and humor. And its Will Smith! He delivers all the time!

'Hancock' is a crime against art, the human spirit, intelligence, and decency, to name just a few. There is no amusement whatsoever to be gained for anyone from watching this film. The tragedy is compounded in that 2 A-list stars and a cult-comedy icon somehow were compelled to do this film.This is a loud, boring and insipid film that does not know whether it intends to be a comedy, action movie, or action comedy. This is not to say that it is actually funny in any places; it is not, but one can discern that comedy was intended in various places. The script, if it can be called such, plays out as though an 8-year old recycled the worst works of dead scifi writer L. Ron Hubbard after being overdosed on Children's Tylenol. There is no plausibility, and no internal consistency in this fictional world, and there are creepy, gross ideas, suggestive of incest.Perhaps the most odious and disgusting thing about 'Hancock' is its overt racism. Here we have an impossibly strong, invulnerable, flying black man, the most powerful man in the world, who wastes his time drinking on the street and behaving like an idiot, until a white liberal takes an interest in him, shows him how to act polite and dress nice. Guess what: the white liberal's 1st step in showing Our Hero the path or righteousness is to send Our Hero to do a stretch in jail. And better yet: this black superhero happens to loose his powers (temporarily) if he kisses a certain white woman.Here is an example of the kind of gross, cheap, juvenile, racist trash being peddled: Our Hero, being miffed at a couple of the other inmates in the jail, literally shoves one man's head up another man's butt. Yes, this actually happens in the movie, the audience is treated to the sight of one man's head clear up another man's butt. All the while, the theme music from 'Sanford and Son' plays, just to make it perfectly clear that we should be laughing at this funny stuff being done by this whacky black person.Some people might be tempted to see this film because there are few other films about black superheroes, but every other film about black superheroes is much, much better. The 'Blade' films, for instance. Better yet, see the new film with Morgan Freeman playing real-life black superhero Nelson Mandela, that one is very highly recommended.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thanks to his alcoholism and lack of charm, Hancock(Will Smith) is despised by the public despite helping a lot of people. This should all change when he meets PR Manager Ray Embrey(Jason Bateman), who wants to make Hancock a fully loved superhero.This movie is just not entertaining. If you enjoy this movie then fine, enjoy its poorness but don't come to me and say 'oh its an in depth character study of what its like to be a superhero' because I will punch you. Very little other than Smithy's little hamster legs are keeping this movie spinning, and little other than him make this movie even remotely watchable. The story is poor, the acting is lacklustre, none of the characters are even remotely likable or interesting; it's just a really shabbily made movie. I will say that the lack of a central villain(other than Captain Hook) was this movie's primary downfall. Movies can be great without a strong villain('Iron Man) or even a villain full stop('Cast Away') but for a movie like this, I feel like one was necessary and the inclusion of a more prominent one would have been to this movie's favour. If you feel the need to watch this piece of sweaty cheese, I cannot stop you but I definitely recommend you avoid it at all cost.The story was so bland in this movie, and so forgettable. It was incredibly dull and its ending sucked. They tried to add more lore in one scene that there are pages in the Qu'ran. One thing that no one can take away from Will Smith is how charismatic the guy is. He could make 'Schindler's List' an even funnier comedy just by being there. Hancock, on the other hand, is a worthless waste of space who contains no redeeming qualities and is just unlikable. He could have been written so much better, to the point where I actually care about the public liking him. As much as I like Jason Bateman, his character was very one dimensional and any attempts to make him multi-dimensional failed miserably. Charlize Theron was also entirely one note throughout the entire movie. She was angry the entire time aside from those precious moments were a character shows 'Emotion?'. Preposterous! Movies aren't about emotion. They're about slow motions lumps of fat bounding in the wind, alcoholism and The Rock. Who needs acting and emotion and WRITING AND ANYTHING THAT MAKES A MOVIE WORTH WATCHING!!!!!!!!! Jae Head was pretty weak as Aaron and served no purpose to the 'plot'. There were little to no character motivations and any attempts at them were entirely contrived and didn't need to be there. My main flaw with this movie is that Hancock has no real opposition. Movies like THIS require villains with more complexity than CAPTAIN HOOK. Go back to Netherland you handless, green tight wearing waste of space. The cinematography was awful. The editing was abysmal. Facebook live videos are better shot than this. I least the camera is straight in them. It's clear that Berg went to the CGI Fetish Anonymous meeting with George Lucas because it's just awful in this movie and is used so frequently. Lucas and Berg like poor CGI more than Hitler loved baking. The costume design was very bland and the set design was very generic. It was a very technically flawed movie.The action in this movie was atrocious. The humour was terrible and even 'some kinda Suicide Squad' couldn't 'white people that ****'. It failed to set up the characters well and all world building was terribly done. In conclusion, I despise this movie and I can't comprehend how people like it. The story was generic. The acting was very poor. The characters were very weak and there is little in this movie to hold it above complete and utter failure. Run little Smith, run because if this movie catches up to you, you're gonna be Facebook living the 'Squad'.2/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

When seeing this movie for the first time, leave your expectations outside and just see the movie for what it is and not what you expected.

My sons (18 and 12) and I found ""Hancock"" to be very enjoyable and never boring.

This daring attempt at a new perspective of superhero directed by Peter Berg results in a dramatic, fantasy, comedy that has mixed results. With good performances by Wil Smith and Charlize Theron, they find themselves in a different, harder edged superhero movie that reveals the human character of being superhuman but at the same time reflecting the a closer connection to the audience than may be comfortable. We get to see alcoholism, anger and its attempted management, we get to see human sacrifice. The first half of the movie reveals a more raw aspect of the frailty of the human spirit regardless of one's power. The second half of the movie reveals the nature of a curse similar to Ladyhawke (1985). Unfortunately, the risk of extending beyond the traditional tried and true superhero scenario sometimes requires experiments and different approaches that require the audience to move along and accept such changes. Sometimes the experience is bumpy, like a new developing film media form getting used to its feet. The result is jarring, jagged, almost forced to make logical sense, but never fatally nor offensively repelling. There are good connections, good interplays between Wil Smith and Charlize Theron. Eight out of Ten Stars.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm not saying there's no GOOD superhero films, because they're a lot that are. But for the majority, they suck. When I first saw Hancock, I thought it looked pretty stupid. It seemed cliché, in a sense where it takes from other superhero films. It seems unfunny, as you can tell from both the trailer AND movie. And it looked just stupid, unoriginal, a pile of poop. When I finally watched the movie, I was brought back by some good things.. then some bad things. Firstly, the first thing I'd like to add, is how this film is labeled as a comedy. If I would have to label the film, I would call it a ""dark comedy"" as in it's about a drunken superhero. Aha, that's hilarious isn't it? Things could've been funny if the movie wasn't so dark in it's nature. This is a good thing in my opinion, as by the trailer you'd think otherwise... Secondly, by the last 30 minutes, the film is surprisingly really good. It's somewhat emotional, makes you think, and is pretty crazy. Sadly, the rest of the film isn't good. Hancock attempts to be (in my opinion) new and inventive, but just comes out as a wanna-be movie. The take of comedy isn't funny whatsoever and the plot is a bit cliché, SOMETIMES. It was somethings about it that I lied, and others that I just sat with a poker face. I don't know whether to recommend the movie, as it's has 50/50 likes and dislikes. It all depends on what you like, though, so I have nothing to give you. I give it 5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Hancock is a flawed man who wants to help people but his troubles get in the way. He has personality issues that he eventually overcomes to become the hero he was meant to be.What I really like about this movie is the fact that he had real life issues to deal with but the movie isn't overly preachy or political.

But, all the critics were saying it was a big disappointment, that it wasn't as good as Will Smith's other movies, and that he didn't do a very good job of being a jerk. However, everyone I went with loved it and so did I! It's fast-paced, funny, and has a really good plot twist that I didn't expect. Smith gave a really strong performance, as usual. A negative was the sometimes shaky camera.

Smith does an excellent job as the drunken, down-and-out, and absolutely alone superhero who always acts to help, but ends up simply hurting. Jason Bateman plays his standard, business-man type character and does it well as he always has (I fear for his type-casted future though...). The film was explosive, sad, gritty, and sometimes even quite epic while always maintaining an atmosphere of hope and light-heartedness, more akin to a strictly PG type of movie. From the moment the film started to when the credits started to roll, than stopped briefly for a final scene, before continuing again, I enjoyed myself. Will it win any Oscars? Surely not, The Dark Night is already being handed all of those. Is it my favorite movie? No, definitely not.Was it a good movie? Absolutely.Hancock is everything that you want in a summer blockbuster. Plain and Simple.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Enter Hancock, a breath of fresh cinematic air and the cure for my CGI character blues. I need not rehash in detail all the spot on positive comments. Suffice to say that Smith is awesome in a multi dimensional role, a very 'human' role given his very special sort of humanity. Humor abounds, chemistry is good to great and originality sparkles. ""Do I smell alcohol on your breath?"" a woman asks Hancock. Then and there you know just how original a super hero film this is. It is no more difficult to suspend one's belief system with this story and its conclusion then it is with most highly rated sci-fi/horror films like Underworld. The patch quilt of cinematic elements including drama, pathos, humor, humanity, relationships and frailties work in almost every instance. What a fun, Summer cinematic ride.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a unique play on the superhero movie starring an excellent actor in Will Smith. And it starts very well. Hancock (Smith) is an alcoholic, miserable, lonely superhero who causes damage and insults those he saves. He's hated by the people and the press. Then unlikely savior Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) comes to the rescue. After being pulled clear of a train by Hancock in the best moment of the movie, he decides to return the favor. Ray convinces Hancock change his image as a hero and finally rise above his very human problems, with Ray's help. It's a very entertaining start. It's not hard to imagine superheros being sued or needing publicists in the real world and the first half of the film explores those issues.Then the twist was introduced changing the movie into something completely different from what I just described. I'm not going to mention it in case any who read this plan to watch the movie. But in a movie that was already unique, this almost ruins the film. A simple story of Bateman's character healing a troubled superhero and healing his own problems in the process would have been much more compelling than a misguided origin story.There are other minor issues. Ray's wife Mary Embrey (Charlize Theron) is a poor character. I admit, I've never cared much for Theron. But I don't think anyone could have made her character interesting. She fills a purpose in the movie, but her character has little personality. The fact that she's central to the unnecessary twist only makes it worse. Then there's a gag scene involving the difficulties of Hancock having sex which isn't as funny as I'm sure the filmmakers intended.But those problems could easily have been ignored were it not for the frustrating direction an otherwise interesting movie took. I haven't said anything different than what most people who watch this movie say. So trust me, watch the first half of Hancock, then shut it off.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Cheap Tuesday, and it was busy with hundreds of baby boomers lining up to see 'Mama Mia' and I ended up in the wrong line, feeling like a complete idiot when I realised that there was no one within cooee of my age in the queue. It was a relief, however, to find that we could walk right into the appropriate cinema and not have to jockey for decent seats.'Hancock' is a good piece of cinema, but very light. It's one of those films with a great premise that kind of falls down when the story should be getting interesting. You could see that spot at the end of the exposition and the conflict where the writersVincent Ngo and Vince Gilligansuddenly realised that they don't know where they're going with this story. It's good, but the best bits are in the trailer, so wait for the DVD.I'd like to give them ten points for trying, but this is one of those unfortunate films that has fallen victim to the Hollywood movie machine. The idea was fresh and new, which is more than you can say for most American films this century, but the execution just didn't cut it.I just wish we had opted for 'Ten Empty' instead. Oh well.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ray's wife (Charize Theron) doesn't like the bad behaving superhero...The director Peter Berg has picked a subject that brings something new to the superhero-genre. The Marvel pictures presents more typical superheroes but Berg thrills to the core of humanity. Every superhero has their human alter egos but Hancock doesn't hide behind some mask and doesn't seal his true persona. Hancock is bored to be the only rescuer of humankind and is lonely. Being different than others can be devastating and everyone needs somebody who understands what it's like to be different.

Will Smith playing a disgruntled superhero whom starts to try to be a good hero, what could go wrong? Well... where should I start? First of all, I was expecting and funny comedy, but got an attempt at being a serious superhero film not based on a comic book, but fell flat. The concept itself was good, but the execution was just plan poorly done. I genuinely enjoyed the film in the beginning, Will Smith was witty and funny, but then it fell into the same old rut with an stupid story that almost anyone you pull off the street could have written. It would have been better if they had just stuck with the whole ""superhero trying to do the right thing but messing up"" idea instead of dragging it out into some bull crap story that failed to be even relatively plausible in any sense. I was so disappointed with everything that followed a certain point when they needed Hancock once again. Also, it took the movie so long to get into the real plot that it had me thinking that we were already in the main part of the story, then it just switched up on me, leaving me confused and annoyed.The movie's saving grace, the beginning. Right from when a kid wakes up Hancock to have him stop some robbers and Hancock completely tells him off, it's funny and enjoyable. Will Smith plays his role well, just like he always does and the rest of the cast does an okay job at going about their roles, none of which are academy award winners, but still good enough.In the end, a dirt poor story that hardly makes any logical sense kills and buries this movie. However, for some reason, just because the movie has Will Smith, it is almost impossible to not at least partially enjoy the film... so let's go with a 5 out of 10, with out Will Smith, it would've definitely been a 2 or 3.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When she noted that I LOVED this film being a big Will Smith fan, she bought me the DVD after it was at BLOCKBUSTER, but I never bothered re-watching it. It just didn't really do anything for me after we broke up and it was her fil , although I liked Charlize Theron's character Mary Embrey in the film, i guess my feelings for this movie wained and never watched it again. I had a different perspective and it doesn't really excite me as it did 12 years ago. The movie has an interesting premise, though where Smith plays a wino named John Hancock who has superheroic powers, but his drunken attempts at fighting crime have caused huge damage and alienated people. Actor Jason Bateman who wonderfully plays Ray, offers to advise HANCOCK trying to rehabilitate his image. Will Smith's acting career is following a recent run of serious efforts, one of the lightweight, crowd-pleasing action comedies which made his name. As Smith's drunken-idiot superhero blunders through the apprehension of a carload of speeding crooks, this feels like a (better) male-slob answer to My Super Ex-Girlfriend, and one vaguely expects Martin Lawrence to show up as Jimmy Olsen. I think the first time I watched this movie, maybe I would've given it an 8, but now the rating is much lower.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie was hilarious, why shouldn't it be Will Smith was the protagonist. Charlie Theron was stunning through out the movie and Jason Bateman was oh so charming.A hobo with super-natural powers who saves the day at the expense of the city. The movie has extremely funny scenes and some poor special effects. He ends up saving the life of Ray who in return wants to help Hancock become the traditional super-hero. His invited to Ray's home and you can immediately feel the love in the air between Ray's wife Mary and Hancock. Mary ends up being his wife from the past with super-natural powers as well. There story is reveal, few jail scenes and more fights to keep you entertain. At the end you can pretty much predict the outcome finale.It will keep you in suspense until the very end, when it becomes somewhat dull but not outrageous bad. Overall it's a great movie to get some laughs in.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

For a regular super hero movie, it wouldn't really matter, but for a movie that tries to stay/ground itself into reality, it's more than a wasted opportunity! The twist also brings up a few questions and should at least bring us a big conflict, but neither (really) happens ... especially not the conflict. Another wasted opportunity. Of course every movie has it's weak points, what really makes the difference is the things that one finds in the movie, that makes it look good. But the trailer moments are the best (jokes) in the movie. Of course you know where this is going from the get go, but it still could've been more ... let's say sympathetic. And there are too many scenes that are repetitive (how many times can Hancock smash into things/destroy them, without getting boring). It might look good, but it could be more diverse too. It's a shame, because all I could see here, were many missed opportunities ... and I don't think a longer cut on DVD will make a big difference ...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main idea of it is to show you that even the one that are chosen to be great, to be amazing, to protect us, can still have problems, which are by the way human like - drinking, failed marriages etc.Most of the time you will enjoy the jokes Hancock is dropping, because they are just the old fashioned way. It seem to me that the producer didn't want to risk with something really extravagant, because the script was already jumping on the line of fondness and dislike. And maybe this is one of the main drawbacks, because there is no bad guy, that has a beef with Hancock, actually there is no motive at all, there is no movement that can give you the idea that our problematic superhero has an opponent. Although Theron seems to show in really pragmatic way that she is the bad guy, her role has been chosen as a more of pole guide that tries to give a hint what is this story about. In other words: you have a picture, but without frame, and we know that without some of the basic components, you can't have a full masterpiece. As final words, Hancock had a great potential to develop as a blockbuster, but its poor execution forced him back, and it ended as a production you will not enjoy seeing again.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

He seems to have more trouble sorting out the sh!t in his own head than the sh!t on the streets, and is something of an alcoholic. When he causes yet another catastrophe, he is approached by PR guru Ray Emery (Jason Bateman) who invites him into the house he shares with his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and their young son. Ray wants to get Hancock to change his image and manners and try to improve the public perception of him, even convincing him to turn himself in and serve a little time in jail. But it all changes when he learns that Mary has the same superpowers as him and a new villain, Red (Eddie Marsan) is on the loose...Obviously intended as a humorous slant on all the superhero movies we were seeing last summer, Hancock further got Will Smith in people's faces after a string of movies as of late. But unfortunately, the lasting impression is that he should be more choosy about the script's he chooses...There's just nothing to Hancock. No depth, no substance, no...anything, really. It's just one of those scripts that you wonder why someone didn't look at it and think...this just doesn't work as a movie. The clever special effects, including a sequence where the two superheros battle with tornadoes tearing the streets of New York to pieces, certainly don't cover up the cracks in the weak script and a plot that just fails to have any sort of narrative flow at all. The Kingdom director Peter Berg's shaky camera doesn't help much either, and Hancock as a character is understandably flawed and depressed. Superheros are meant to be concealed characters, and certainly have more impressive powers than to just blast off up into the air and toss huge things up into the air. Rising star Marsan's villain hardly gets enough screen time to make much of an impression.It may not have been a massive flop, but it's certainly left a lasting impression about Smith for all the wrong reasons. **","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot has at its core a very smart and creative piece of writing which was also its greatest twist. The final portion of the film was also written well and the ending was a very pleasing ending.Cast:
Will Smith - I have watched 12 of his movies and I have never been disappointed in his performance. He delivered every single time. And he did really well in this movie too. He portrayed the lonely and lost character he was supposed to portray, and he did it well.Charlize Theron (female lead) - she did pretty good. No complaints from me.Jason Bateman (Marty Byrd from the Ozarks) - he did good; no complaint.My favorite line in this movie: ""call me crazy... one more time.""There were a couple of scenes I completely disliked in this movie despite the cool CGI: that scene where Jason Bateman's front of the house is destroyed at night and also the destruction of part of the city during a fight between the two characters. The writing for these two scenes was just so wrong. Such reckless destruction of property is illogical. Surely these two scenes cost the movie some points.Conclusion: this is a GOOD film. The plot and screenplay were written properly. There is good character development of the three main characters. However, the two biggest special effects scenes were not written intelligently. The plot has a pretty clever and unique twist, and the ending is as good as it could have been for the plot.8/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film works precisely on top of that: Hancock is a superhero who doesn't seem to want to be one, and who doesn't know how to deal with it. As a result, and despite being effective at what he does, he is quite destructive and unpopular until the day he gets an image manager.Although Will Smith is one of those actors that I never really appreciated very much, I have to admit that he did a lot of good to bet on this film. The character is perfect for the actor, who seems to be as charismatic as he is grumpy, and Smith's effort turns out to be the big reason to see the film. Smith gives us a very well done job and manages to bear the effort and responsibility of the protagonist with great capacity. Charlize Theron also deserves a positive note for the work she left us in this film. Jason Bateman brings to life the most likeable and palatable character in the film, but he doesn't have the material to match his colleagues.Unfortunately, beyond the work of Smith and his co-stars, the film doesn't really have much else to offer us. The script starts from a very interesting idea, but fails to flesh it out and develops it in a very inefficient way. The result ends up being a frankly uneven film, where a good beginning leads to a dull stagnation and, later, a highly predictable and tiring ending. On a technical level, we can highlight, on a positive note, the quality of the cinematography and CGI effects used, as well as the effective and properly used soundtrack. Everything else is simply boring and not worthy of particular mention.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I really appreciate the risks taken in this film and how it feels completely separate from the other films that share the genre.As far as I'm aware this is a completely original story and the use of hand-cam gives the film a more personal feel. The film grapples with questions of authoritarianism, power, loneliness, and depression which are actually interesting paths to explore in a superhero. I like the decisions with the camera and premise for the story.Where this film gets stale for me is how it resolves this by making Hancock a holy savior that is put on Earth to suffer and protect humanity. Really just not a satisfying resolution. That isn't even to mention the attempts at humor which really just feel similar to Michael Bay (the colors and some of the shots also are reminiscent, which really leaves a bad taste in my mouth).There is also the theme of authoritarianism that the film glosses over but discards because it gets in the way of the character finding himself. Superheroes are inherently authoritarian and they regularly abuse their power. This is a main reason why I have become disillusioned with the genre. There is always this portrayal of good vs evil in a struggle for humanity because we are so worth saving. The super people are always concerned with terrorists or masterminds or just petty criminals and are never interested in fixing the root of these problems. Many of these ""superheroes"" just get caught up in a never ending battle with the unfortunate souls that have been molded by the awful system that the heroes try to preserve. They use all of their power to act as super cops because apparently all of these films don't understand that more punitive measures result in more crime and mayhem. In the beginning of this film Hancock is a perfect representation of the over reliance on authority to solve problems, as most of his solutions just cause more damage that citizens have to deal with. I found it a very intriguing allegory for authoritarianism but the film abandons this and pretends mayhem is only a result of sloppy authoritarianism. It stops showing the cost of superheroes once it wants us to think Hancock has become a responsible savior.I'm also not a fan of worship and this film is fairly focused on presenting Hancock as a Jesus figure who was rejected by society before trying to earn respect. It presents hero worship as an ideal which I'm just not a fan of.Overall it has some very interesting themes and ideas but ended up glorifying power and those who wield it. Close to being good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The ending leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth. My god, if you have a superhero movie, have the decency to put at least ONE epic fight in it!

It was Will's 8th blockbuster film in a row, making him the only actor in history to achieve such a feat. The trailer was hilarious, it was visually astounding, and it stirred up quite a buzz. So how was the movie?Story: 5/5 Buckets Of Popcorn Hancock is the story of a single man on Earth with superhuman powers but not the super hero mentality. He rises to the needs of the public, but not nearly as gracefully as, say, Spider-Man or even The Incredible Hulk.With alcoholic tendencies, a general disregard for public property, Hancock serves as the ultimate conundrum: he saves the day, but causes millions in damage; he helps uphold the law, all while breaking it at the same time. The cops want him arrested, but how do you capture a super hero?Well I'll try to not to divulge too much of the movie, because it's quite good really. But suffice it to say that this problem is creatively overcome by Hancock happening across a public relations manager (Jason Bateman) whose wife (Charlize Theron) doesn't approve of the hapless hero being around.Bateman suggests that Will turn himself in to clean up his public image so that he won't be hated everywhere he goes, he does some time in jail until the police chief calls in for his help, and Hancock saves the day in a mass of broken glass, bullets, and explosions.Ordinarily, this would only warrant a few Popcorn Buckets, but I didn't tell you about the second half, which is awesome and earns the story a full 5 Buckets Of Popcorn out of 5.Acting: 4/5 Buckets Of Popcorn If you've been paying attention to the film world at all, you'd know that this cast is renowned for its on screen presence. Jason Bateman's Emmy-nominated and Golden Globe-winning, Carlize Theron is an Academy Award winner, and Will Smith has gotten better with age like a good bottle of wine. Earning 2 Oscar nods, Will has shown growth like no other since his 2004 blockbuster I, Robot into the charming, mature actor he is today.In the movie, Bateman plays the perfect regular human buddy of the hero, torn between his appreciation and gratitude toward Hancock for saving his life and his wife who has little but contempt for him.Charlize gives another fantastically convincing performance as the bitter, cautious wife of Bateman, which really comes to life in the second half of the movie...which I'm not telling you about.Will shows us a side of him that we rarely get to see as the gritty, uncaring ne'er-do-well that Hancock is. He is still true to his comedic stylings that made us all love The Fresh Prince from the beginning, but he comes with the acting chops that got him nominated in Pursuit Of Happiness.This movie really does ride more on its special effects and great story, but the performances and subtle nuances and mannerisms that these three bring to the movie earn Hancock 4 out of 5 Buckets Of Popcorn.Entertainment: 5/5 Buckets Of Popcorn Entertainment?! This movie's got it in spades! From beginning to end, this is good old fashioned fun, the way that Will Smith's always done it. I mean, come on, it's a super hero movie. If it wasn't entertaining, it would've totally missed the mark.The movie starts off with Hancock hilariously sleeping on a park bench, hung-over from liquor consumption, and being called to duty by a little boy. To start his heroics off right, he dashes off into the sky, destroying the park bench and sidewalk where he took off from.He zooms through the Los Angeles skies, smashing through highway signs, destroying the road, and ultimately impaling the SUV of the bad guys on the steeple of the Met-Life building. This scene's got everything entertainment requires: hilarious dialogue, gunfire, invincibility, flying, destruction, and the ultimate ridiculous scenario of a truck hanging from the top of a building.As the movie continues along, the hilarity tones down a bit form the high comedy to a more tame (save for one jailhouse scene), becoming more focused on the story and the special effects that make this movie so much fun.Again, in the second half that I'm not going to talk about here, the movie shifts into high gear, resulting in one of the more entertaining movies of this decade. 5 out of 5 Buckets Of Popcorn.Movie Magic: 4/5 Buckets Of Popcorn Sticking to the formula that first made him a star in Independence Day, continued his success in Men In Black, shined through in I, Robot, and most of his other movies, Will has created another summer blockbuster with amazing special effects.From flying, to explosions, to wind storms, throwing a whale across a beach, and all the other supernatural feats that take place, this movie delivers up a heavy batch of movie magic that you won't soon forget.It's not the same spaceship battles, blowing up cities effects you get in ID4, but they definitely know how to sell a movie with some CGI. For that, Hancock receives 4 out of 5 Buckets Of Popcorn.Overall Score: 4.5/5 Buckets Of Popcorn - At Least My 2nd Favorite Will Smith MoviePlease visit http://www.celebsystem.com for more Popcorn Bucket Reviews.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

That can't be good, and he causes millions of dollars worth of property damage every time he catches criminals.

In recent times of comic book after comic book converting to the big screen with your typical ""good guy, chummy"" superheros with super powers it's a relief to see a superhero that steps outside the box.Hancock is far from perfect. He is cocky and reckless, unappreciated and careless. He drinks all the time and treats people with as much or little respect as they treat him. Nearly everyone views his disregard as brash and constantly call him an ""asshole"". This attitude only makes him act more thoughtless. In one sweep he takes out blocks of the city Until one day he saves the right person.Ray Embrey, a local PR man, is rescued from a runaway train by Hancockwho manages to create quite a disaster during his rescue attempt. As the people around the scene boo and hiss at Hancock, Ray stands up for him, thanks him, and shakes his hand. Bond made, they work together to make the people find a reason to love Hancockmuch to Hancock's chagrin.Though I don't want to give away too much, I will say this. Hancock has every reason to act the way that he does. Years before he was abandoned and left for dead. This event left him scarred and alone. In the end Hancock finally finds a reason to do what he does and enjoy itthanks to Ray and his family.This film received more bad reviews than I believe it was due. Though Hancock is by no means an exceptionally great movie, it was entertaining and worth the money. Some of the ideas behind his powers and the way they affected the world around him were far more believable than a boy getting bit by a spider and suddenly having spider-like powers (Don't get me wrong, I love Spiderman) or a hero from another planet that comes to save us all. Hancock is believable, human, and most important normal.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After all, he has admitted to his box-office formula of choosing movies with killer special effects to make him a star. He disturbed this pattern by doing The Pursuit of Happiness, but his trailblazing ways is apparent once more in choosing to be Hancock, the anti-hero.Yes, Smith plays the lonely superhero John Hancock, who acts out his depression by being an alcoholic bum. He saves ever-the-optimist PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who insists on repaying Hancock by reinventing his image. This means hanging out with Hancock quite a lot, much to the chagrin of Ray's uptight wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) but to the wild delight of their son Aaron (Jae Head).What is surprisingly great about this movie is the acting. Of course Smith effortlessly provides the believable action/comedy necessary, but Theron did fantastic work for a role that could have easily been so shallow, or worse, bad. A formidable figure indeed! Also worth noting is Head, who was charming; thankfully not of the annoyingly perky child star variety.Hancock may be easily guessable, but while it's tame enough to give it a PG-13 rating, it has enough wow factors keep true action aficionados in their seats. Now that's smartly distributing one's eggs in several baskets.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Probably should have been a 'DC' superhero film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4406728/?ref_=tt_urv","bowmanblue","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1406466/?ref_=tt_urv","19 October 2018","Will Smith made 'Hancock' in 2008, roughly at the same time when Disney's 'Marvel Shared Universe' began its unprecedented rise to global domination. Superhero movies were still a bit hit and miss, especially ones aimed at adults. Here, everyone's most charming actor plays - effectively - Superman (or at least a superhero of very similar powers), only darker (and drunk!). Apparently, the script went through numerous re-writes to actually get it down to the PG13 rating as it was meant to be R rated. And it shows.It's definitely not a bad film. In fact, it's pretty good. However, not only was it made while superhero movies weren't as mega popular as they are today, but the prospect of a more 'adult-themed' superhero movie was just about as far off as possible (how that would one day change with 'Deadpool' and 'Logan!'). You don't have to be a fan of Will Smith to appreciate this 'darker' take on the genre. It poses the question would the general populous really put up with someone so strong that they can basically do whatever they want without the consequences that the rest of us have to face? Not only that, but someone who causes rampant destruction - even in the name of 'good.'Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are the main two other stars attached the project and I'm pleased to say that they're not just there to lend their names, but their characters do have significant parts to play in the overall story and make a distraction from this being a Will Smith stand-alone film only.
I guess one thing that hasn't held up so well over the years is the CGI used to show Hancock flying around the city (and trashing it!). It all looks very much like it was rendered for a home console and then Will Smith superimposed over the top of it. 'The Avengers' and pretty much any other film that has used mass destruction of a city since 2008 has done these kind of effects better.The other major problem with the film is that it doesn't really have an antagonist. I guess Hancock wrestling the demons of being cursed with these sorts of powers seemed to be enough for the film-makers. It's not a long film (a modest hour and a half) and it felt like the writers suddenly thought that these plot themes might actually not be enough and attempted to throw in a villain at about the hour mark. This doesn't really add that much and probably could have been taken out all together if they didn't feel confident enough to expand this aspect to be an ongoing part of the story.However, those are a couple of minor gripes. Will Smith is as awesome as ever (as are Bateman and Theron - seems unfair to leave them out!) and if you like superhero movies then you should definitely watch this one. It's not as dark and adult as 'Logan' or 'Deadpool,' yet it's certainly not as 'family friendly' as Disney's MCU, but it's still fun. Enjoy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

PR man Ray (Bateman) believes he can change Hancock so the public will like and accept him.We like our superheroes: Superman, Captain Marvel, Capt America, Spiderman etc. They are good people and we would like to have their powers to be used for good and so we fantasize or we used to (read ""and we still do""). But, when one comes along who doesn't fit the mold, then we cringe, and hope by some miracle (miracles now?) that the superhero will become good like we would be if we had the powers he has (still fantasizing, are we?). With all the above out of the way, the CGI again wins this one. There really didn't need to be all that destruction, but the CGI elves (hey, it's Christmas time) didn't see it that way. And, for some reason, directors think the pubic feels the same way. Not so when the CGI runs too long. They didn't run long here, they just ran too often. Now, if anyone can recall the explanation by Mary (Theron) as to who Hancock is, where he came from and why he is here along with her (hey, she's like him) you really paid attention to her words. I just paid attention to her. But, I did to up to a point where she said she was his sister. HA! You believe that? Well, don't. He is her husband (hey, I guessed it first). Yes, yes, and she is already married to Rayit's complicated. The acting was fine, no Oscars though. The CGI was terrific. The story? Well, there could have been more of it, more substance. As it is now, it's too superficial, an outline. Can we expect Hancock II? Hmmmm.Hope not. Yes, the movie is entertainingsomewhat. I wished it would have gone in different directions, but she's married to Ray and to HancockHey, it's complicated. Does the movie save itself? Yes, kinda.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, one F-bomb uttered by Hancock. The A-H word was uttered a lot.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It just descends. One of the most annoying things about this flick is that i cant quite understand why it doesn't work. Maybe because Wilssons so intentionally outrageous character comes of as flat. Its at most mildly entertaining, mostly just bothersome. I think i start to doubt him as an actor. He tries hard and is mostly i likable fellow, but he seems to have a problem with fleshing his characters out, its all well in flicks like Independence Day but when he is supposed to be Ali ( as in that other film) or Hancock he fails miserably. Or maybe its the director who messed up and couldn't use him rightly. I honestly started to blank out by the end of the film because it all felt like such a unlikeable and boring mess, so its hard to comment on the directing of it, but it was probably both the directing AND the plot that faulted here.

The premise in itself – of a reckless and uncouth alien whose superhuman abilities prove singularly alienating – is not half bad, but it is let down by the unreal CGI effects and the equally fake machismo displayed throughout by star Will Smith. Mind you, the results are entertaining enough – but, again, the baffling emphasis on vulgarity negates the film at least part of its intended audience! The twist involving the character of Charlize Theron (wasted here) was kind of unnecessary, too, especially since it inserts an incongruous dose of sobriety (vis-a'-vis her subsequent conflicted relationship with the conveniently amnesiac Smith and oblivious hubby Jason Bateman) – eventually giving way to outright and unwarranted sentimentality, only to be dispelled soon after by the obligatory 'happy' ending.

So I had to see this movie and the hype was clenching @ my feet.The movie starts off great with all the things I had listed above were just keeping my eyes glued to the screen. But half way through the film it took a turn with a very campy back ground story, that went on way to long. It literally made me think ""wow they're going this route""?? It seemed as if they had a beginning and a middle of a movie and just through in a back story that seemed to be whats the word? oh yes...LAZY, and some how decided thats how the rest of the movie should go. My thoughts were if your gonna use that, save that for a sequel not a 3rd act of a film. The 1st act or I should say the first film should of just been ""Hancock""being a homeless, alcoholic, Anti-Superhero struggling to be good. Thats a movie there I gave this movie a 5(half of 10, 10 being the best) because it starts off great! but the rest just flat out sucks. Great effects @ first then it turns into a C.G.I. nightmare and made me feel like I was suffering through"" My super ex girl friend"" once again.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Projectors for the higher-resolution package have been installed in 200 theaters in the United States with two dozen in evaluation. The impact of the package has been debated, with one argument being that the difference is not noticeable and the counter-argument being that the higher resolution has future value.[22] Prior to the film's opening five-day weekend in the United States and Canada, predictions for its weekend performance ranged from as low as $70 million to as high as $125 million.[23][24] Hancock was shown in advance screenings on July 1, 2008 in 3,680 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $6.8 million. The film was widely released on July 2, 2008, expanding to 3,965 theaters.[25] At the conclusion of the five-day weekend, Hancock took top placement at the box office in the United States and Canada, grossing an estimated $107.3 million. The film had the third-biggest opening 4th of July weekend after Transformers (2007) and Spider-Man 2 (2004). Hancock was Will Smith's fifth film to open on a 4th of July weekend and was his most successful opening to date. The film was also Smith's eighth film in a row to take top placement in the American and Canadian box office and the twelfth film in Smith's career to lead the box office.[26][27] Hancock was also Peter Berg's strongest opening of his directing career to date.[28] Outside of the United States and Canada, Hancock grossed $78.3 million in its opening weekend, drawing from 5,444 screenings across 50 markets, ranking it the third highest international opening of 2008 after Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Iron Man.[29] Hancock averaged $14,382 per screen. It placed on top in 47 of the 50 markets in which it opened;[30] its strongest openings were the United Kingdom with $19.3 million, Germany with $12.4 million, South Korea with $8.5 million, Australia with $7.3 million, and China with $5.5 million. The Chinese opening was the fourth-biggest opening to date for the country. Other international performances included $3.4 million in Brazil and $3.1 million in Taiwan.[29] In Hong Kong, the film opened in first place with $1.3 million, averaging $37,300 across the 35 venues.[31] Hancock opened in France, Mexico, and Russia on the weekend of July 11, 2008.[29] The film's overall gross for its opening five-day weekend worldwide is $185.6 million.[30] In the following weekend, Hancock fell to second place in the United States and Canada behind Hellboy II: The Golden Army, grossing an estimated $33 million, a ""modest"" 47% drop in revenue.[32] To date, Hancock has grossed an estimated $165,034,000 in the United States and Canada and an estimated $180,200,000 in other territories for an estimated worldwide total of $345,234,00.that only means that the sequel of hellboy is not beating Hancock, and in the final of the summer we will have Hancock against The Dark Knight. I think none of these movies are going' to beat Hancock behind Indiana Jones and Iron man . Good job will smith.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Hancock does have adult language so keep an eye out on that for the kids. The story line was well written and gives the audience a great script to follow. Will gives a great performance and give his character true depth in the movie. Overall a great movie, I hated to see it end. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the move seemed too short.

It has action and adventure, comedy and even drama. Hancock is a different type of hero because he doesn't feel the necessity of helping people. He is kinda lazy, he drinks , he likes women he swears and has a lot of bad temper. The story is pretty good and the plot about A hard-living superhero (Smith) who has fallen out of favor with the public enters into a questionable relationship with the wife (Theron) of the public relations professional (Bateman) who's trying to repair his image is interesting but I feel it isn't fully developed. The special effects are really good and it has a really good rhythm which makes the movie enjoyable and it never bores you down. The cast is pretty good. Will Smith in a role that fits him perfectly, his performance is really funny and convincing. Charlize Theron was really good his role I feel is completely different of what she has done and she makes a good couple with Jason Bateman who's performance was convincing enough. In Conclusion, Hancock is one of those movie which only purpose is to entertain and I think he accomplish it very well.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Hancock definitely falls into this category. Hancock is a jerk, plain and simple, he's rude, a drunkard, and selfish, but at the same time he's driven to help people, even though they hate his methods. When we finally learn why he is the way he is, it gives us a fantastic insight into why he's been such insensitive jerk all this time. All in all it's a solid hero flick and worth my ticket money. I hope there will be a sequel at some point, although Hancock might also make a good TV spin off...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

All references to the movie are kept especially generic. Read at your own risk anyway just in case you are uber sensitive. I don't tell you what happened or talk about any specifics.After seeing the previews and thinking to myself that this is a movie worth checking out ""sometime"" I then saw Will Smith being interviewed on a talk show. His enthusiasm in portraying an atypical super hero combined with how much he loved shooting a flight scene with old-school stunt work plus some special effects instead that would normally be done all CGI got my interest in this movie piqued.I enjoy many types of superhero movies and usually find ways to enjoy most of them. Hancock was no exception, and in this case I found that it really stood apart from other super hero movies in a new and refreshing way. Personally I thought it was new, intricate, funny, and full of ""eye candy"" (scenes that are especially fun to watch).Will Smith brought some style and flair to the role and gave us a glimpse of a person going through some hard times and going through some changes. I think there was one part of the movie that ""dragged"" a little for me, but sure enough right around the corner was some more intrigue, action, and other eye candy to watch.I probably laughed the most at a scene that reminded me of the Anal Dwelling Butt Monkey of ""Bruce Almighty"".","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't go to Hancock thinking you are seeing another Superman, Fantastic 4, Ironman or Hulk. The superhero angle is treated much differently here. I think part of the perception problem with this film is from the silly trailers we have seen for the last 6 months. Those trailers represent a small part a movie that is so much more to than a drunken superhero throwing a whale at a boat, swearing at a kid or wrecking the city. Sure, there are laughs in this movie, but it's Will Smith! He's FUNNY! Go see Hancock because it's DIFFERENT from the mega-budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ironman and The Hulk. But Hancock is not a movie that will have comic book geeks arguing on message boards about how the movie left so much out and the character was nothing like the comic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first half concentrates on how antisocial he is, damaging more things than necessary when he does good. A superhero that is unlikeable and hated by others is certainly not common in Hollywood. This refreshing change is overshadowed by a surprising twist towards the middle of the film. The twist is definitely unexpected and fun.

It contains comedy at the right moments and the dramatic tension has been carefully executed.Like all my reviews there is always something I pick on. I kind of agree with other reviewers when they say you can only play the ""un-wanted superhero"" for a short time. What do you do after that? We can see the writers perhaps struggled with.The other question. Where is he villain? Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk. Indiana Jones. Dark Knight all had memorable and evil villains.

Smith is a movie star and he has a great deal of fun playing in this movie as a person who uses his talents remarkably well as a super-strong amnesiac named John Hancock, who saves the world every day. Smith does let us connect with the character in a few unconventional ways.

To me, what it seems like is that the writers of the film loved the idea, started off extremely strong, and then began to realize that how hard it is to sustain a simplistic idea over the course of a full length motion picture (and it is because of this that Hancock is relatively short). The writers' plan to solve this problem is to throw in a totally unnecessary and badly handled plot twist to keep the audience guessing. The lack of a central villain also hurts the movie a lot. The character that serves as Hancock's enemy in the finale isn't even well acted. The person is laughable.This is an action movie, so it should come as no surprise to see well done and original action in the movie. However, I felt the effects could have used a few more weeks of polishing in the editing room. The camera is also quite crampy. I also have problems with the film's score, as it does not add an epic feeling to the film like it should have. I felt like something was missing in the climax of the film (which is not the end). The action scenes, while entertaining and original, were not long enough to engage the audience like say, The Incredible Hulk, nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted.The film's strength rides on its three stars. Action veterans Will Smith and Charlize Theron both deliver winning performances as usual, and that should come as no surprise. Smith's charisma is enough to make anyone happy, and it's so easy to see why so many people love him. Theron is always a sight to behold (except in Monster, lol), and this film is no different. I enjoyed her performance the most, especially in the second act and the beginning of the third. Jason Bateman, who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron, is great as usual, and likable, marking a change from his recent turn in ""Juno"". There really isn't another performance to note, and part of Hancock's weakness is that there are really only three main engaging characters. It should also be noted that the kid who played Bateman's son was absolutely adorable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Anyway i had no real plans to see this movie until i was asked to go on Saturday night, i decided to go as i thought it would be a good laugh, plenty of giggles to be had!It's about a much disliked superhero Hancock, who is costing the city millions in damages due to his wreckless behaviour, and after saving the life of a business man, that man has a plan to win Hancock back his respect! I'll leave the rest for you to discover.Some parts of the film wern't funny, mainly because of the fact i'd seen the joke about a million times already on TV! I also disliked the fact that the plot had a sudden change half-way through, from being about Hancock redeeming himself to a stupid plot involving a superwoman who is much stronger than Hancock! Those are my only real complaints, the rest of the film is fine.7/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As were all the comedies in the 2000s. Hate movies like this.Watching this makes me feel like I'm wasting my life.It's also stylized to be way more yellow than it should be which makes it feel even more depressing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Rushed conclusion but an intriguing departure from most superhero films","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2022143/?ref_=tt_urv","long-ford","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19824448/?ref_=tt_urv","12 February 2009","This is an intriguing departure from most superhero movies. Will Smith plays Hancock like a jerk. Smith's likability greatly helps as Hancock's rough edges aren't very appealing. Charlize Theron has a significant role in the film as (MINOR SPOILERS) Hancock's back story is gradually revealed. It is surprisingly intense and deserved more screen time. The film's conclusion is rushed which may account for most of the critical reactions against it. Also the villains seem to appear out of nowhere and are broad caricatures. Still, the acting is good and the film is a decent watch, at least on home viewing.Overall 6/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Great Idea, Poor execution","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3151869/?ref_=tt_urv","ZedMovie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28330342/?ref_=tt_urv","30 December 2014","What a great story this could have been. A superhero with human weaknesses we can all relate to. I personally think that the creators of this movie were in a rush. It went from a very quick, OK here we go to where on earth did this go!? Also, I like Will, but not the perfect part for him. I hope one day someone does execute a story that has as superhero with human frailties that they overcome and in the process teaches us something too about our life here. The first Rocky had that and its why it lasted the test of time. It can still be entertaining, just maybe a bit more than the usual superhero garbage out there that becomes forgettable as soon as your rear end is lifted off the theater seat.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
