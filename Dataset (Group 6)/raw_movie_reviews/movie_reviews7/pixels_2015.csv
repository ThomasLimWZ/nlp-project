This is easily one of the better Sandler flicks in my book, and there aren't actually that many I like. It's fun, nothing's taken too seriously, it's well-acted and well-directed, there's a minimum of the obligatory shock humor that seems to invade all of his movies. I mean, you could probably let the kids watch and that stuff will go over their heads. Maybe, maybe not. Watch it yourself first.I watched it a second time and still enjoyed it. That doesn't happen all that often.","67 out of 82 found this helpful.

"","","Sorely underrated, most honest fun since Ghostbusters.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3359407/?ref_=tt_urv","amesmonde","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1761695/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2015","Aliens in the guise of video game characters prepare to take over the world and a group of 80s arcade gamers re-team to stop the threat.From the director of Home Alone, Chris Columbus' Pixels plays as a mix of Wreck it Ralph, The Lego Movie and channels the likes of Independence Day and is reminiscent of Ghostbusters to name a few. This highly under-appreciated scifi comedy is a feature-length adaptation of Patrick Jean's video- game themed short. There's something for everyone but if you're a 30 something or more you'll find it hard not to like this retro game blast of a movie complete with arcade slot machine sounds. Opening in 1982 those with an appreciation of the late 70s and early 80s surely can't help but love the throwback gags. It then fast forwards to the present day with Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Peter Dinklage's characters all grown up. It's fast paced fun with aliens disguised as Hervé Villechaize, Madonna and President Reagan. The contemporary cheap quips about Gandalf and Harry Potter also hit the mark. As the grown up nerd gamers assist the President (James) to save the world it's good natured with a flood of one liners, fitting effects and a soundtrack emulating a bygone era. It's packed with references from StarWars to Tron, writers Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling induce nostalgia successfully.The supporting cast include the likes of Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Dan Ackroyd to name a few. There's also some celebrity cameos including Serena Williams and Martha Stewart. Characters from classic arcade games such as Paperboy, Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong among many others appear.Despite scattered anachronisms (who's checking) Columbus' Pixels is sorely underrated, it has great visuals and perfect comedy timing. It also has subtext about today's games. It's very entertaining, even if your 're not a retro gamer or and 8-bit lover, it still comes recommended.","26 out of 33 found this helpful.

I did too, though I knew this wasn't gonna be any greats shakes and it wasn't. There were some funny lines at the beginning and some of the video game gags did go a little well. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan did well with their roles. When I saw the arcade and all those video games during the 1982 sequence, part of me felt some nostalgia for the times I spent with my brother and his friend playing those games at that kind of place. About the ending sequence taking place one year later: lame. Though really, this was pretty enjoyable so on that note, Pixels is worth a look.","41 out of 64 found this helpful.

The 80s movie 'Tron' was one of those first I have seen, followed by many. But the recent one 'Wreck-it Ralph' was the game changer in the modern animation/CGI which led to another similar flick, 'The Lego Movie'. Lego and 'Toy Story' are the toys, not the video games, but very close to this theme and I'm very happy that Hollywood made this film for the guys like me who grew up playing them.The film had a very simple story with the great visuals. Sometimes simple is very good rather going for hi-tech. Especially those who played these games in their middle-age back in the 80s could be now very old and they might suffer to understand the film due to the technology/terms/phrase gap, if it matched to the todays hi-tech hi-resolution video games. But the youngsters of the present era didn't understand that who are the backbone of any movie's success and that's why this movie sunk in the ocean of criticism.My childhood and teenage was the late 90s and early 00s respectively, So 8bit games are on the edge of revolution. My favourites were the races and brick games, especially 'Duck Hunt', because I get a gun, not joystick. So this movie really brought me those sweet memories. A decade ago I used those unique sounds and music for message alerts in my 2G mobile phone(s).I know recently Sandler had hit the rock bottom in his acting career, but, he's kind of lifted after the decent film 'The Cobbler' and excellent multistarrer 'Men, Women & Children'. This is not a massive comeback to what he's known for, comedies. But, sailing on average or above in better than falling downward in the career graph. To me this film was a better one, an above average, obviously not a masterpiece.Guest appearances were unexpected, but was not that effective, except Ashley Benson, who was so hot in her 2-3 odd minutes. This film is not for everyone. Youngsters and oldsters never understand it. If you were born in the 70s and 80s, then probably you will know what to expect. Even it does not deliver to your expectation, definitely gives satisfaction for bringing those lost memories of our childhood.7/10","19 out of 27 found this helpful.

It was fun to watch.Ignore the reviews from critics, the SJW's these days will find anything to complain about and they did with this movie too. They want everything, whether it be a movie, video game, or comic book to cater to them. Anything they find offensive immediately they claim to be insulting and they will overlook anything good about the movie just so they can talk negatively about it.

In fact, I'm sure that part of the dialogue was either a first-take or else ad lib. How do you get Sean Bean, Adam Sandler, and a few other well-known actors to participate in something so lazy? They could have used a studio audience or a laugh track.I think I know where this movie came from. Someone decided to market a nostalgia film (1980s arcade games) to fathers who have boys aged 12-14. The humor is not sophisticated enough for a normally developed adult intellect, but it also is not appropriate for small children with all the adult themes. It doesn't work.

None of the comedy was funny to either us or the child, as the obvious jokes were being cracked on screen we were all looking at each other in disbelief at how cheesy and how much of a lack of effort was put into the writing of this film! Needless to say i will not be recommending this film to anyone, EVER!! I read some reviews on here after watching the film for the 1 hour that we survived and was expecting to find endless 1 star reviews and was so amazed that there was loads of 10 star ratings!!!

"7","/10","Caters to its respective season and nostalgia quite effectively","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3284939/?ref_=tt_urv","StevePulaski","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23483288/?ref_=tt_urv","26 July 2015","The immense hate for ""Pixels"" has me asking a serious question for those who hate the film, did you hate the concept or did you simply find yourself refusing any inkling of positivity or humor whilst watching the film upon seeing Adam Sandler as the top-billed actor? I ask this question as somebody who finds myself at odds with Sandler on most of his projects, but also somebody willing to admit his achievements and provide him with credit when he deserves it.I ask this because it seems the good majority of the public, and critics for that matter, have given up on Adam Sandler, ostensibly just waiting to hate the next project he's working on before it's even released. The negative buzz around ""Pixels,"" similar to ""Blended,"" Sandler's last feature, started early and never let up. While Sandler has given himself plenty of reasons (and films, for that matter) to dislike him and his work, I feel under the work of any other actor besides Sandler and his production company, ""Pixels"" would've at least garnered a handful of defenders.""Pixels"" is a brazenly silly sound and lights show, one that works predominately because of its willingness to exhaust its premise and use many actors with differing personalities to carry the entire show. That, right there, is about all I can say for the film: it's cheeky, it's relentlessly goofy, but it's also just funny enough and adventurous enough to recommend to anyone searching for that piece of entertainment in the cool multiplexes during this hot summer.The film opens with Sam Brenner and Will Cooper, two best friends who spend their days at the arcade, where Sam discovers his incredible skill for video games. Will encourages him to compete in the first video game championship of 1982, which will be recorded and sent into space by NASA, along with other artifacts. At the tournament, however, Sam winds up losing to Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), a cocky, professional video gamer.Decades later, Sam (Adam Sandler) works as an installer of software and his pal Will (Kevin James) goes on to be The President of the United States, still both very close friends despite their difference in power. One day, Will calls Sam into the office to observe an attack on a military base in Guam by what looks to be the video game pixels and characters from the arcade game Galaga. Baffled by the insanity of this possibility, Sam reconnects with Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), a pudgy conspiracy theorist whom he met at at the video game tournament back in the 1980's. Ludlow shows Sam a video claiming to be sent from aliens that the video tape of the tournament was seen as a declaration of war, prompting the aliens to send the video game characters from classic arcade games to attack the world. The world gets ""three lives,"" so to speak, which are lost if one particular battle (video game) is lost. Three lost battles and the Earth is terminated.Desperate and out of options, Will orders Sam, Ludlow, Eddie, and his unique weapons specialist Lieutenant Colonel Violent van Patten (Michell Monaghan) to fight the pixelated monsters, which come in the form of Centipede, Pac-Man, and eventually Donkey Kong.It shouldn't take more than a minute of watching the trailer for ""Pixels"" to decide if you'd want to see something like this. Those who do, if they view the film as the basic summer entertainment that the film is trying to be, will find a perfectly acceptable and balanced dose of fun. ""Pixels"" also works as a showcase for a divisive array of talent. We have Sandler, who is surprisingly very relaxed and nonchalant throughout the whole film, James, who is toned down several notches from his usual self as well, Gad, who bears the same kind of energy Sandler did in his heyday, only with much more personality, and Dinklage, who's narcissism and brazen attitude effectively make his character.Finally, ""Pixels"" works because it doesn't take itself too seriously; it knows exactly what it needs to do to succeed and that is to be a nonstop display of action with a great visual scheme and characters that are at least somewhat fun to be around. This may not be a showstopper of a film, but it's something that definitely caters to a season of films where numerous other, lesser films find themselves being defended while ""Pixels"" sits and suffers in a ""guilt by association"" manner.","28 out of 49 found this helpful.

This movie has no idea what it wants to be or who it's target audience is because it plays out like a typical Adam Sandler vehicle just with video games added in so he can cash in on gamer's nostalgia for arcade games. None of the jokes were funny and were underwhelming, Josh Gad annoyed the crap out of me, there is absolutely no love put into this movie and is the very definition of a missed opportunity, there is so much that could have been done with the concept yet the potential was disposed of just so that Sandler can continue to steal our money with predictable idiotic humor that isn't even witty, sarcastic, clever, or self-referential or even a shred of respect for the classic games put on display. I felt embarrassed for the talent that was wasted for this film such as director Chris Columbus, Michelle Monaghan, Sean Bean, and Peter Dinklage, they deserved better than this. In conclusion I hated this movie, it had massive potential but instead massively disappointed me. In short don't see it at all, you have much better choices in theatres right now.

If you're a certain type of person, I guess you just can't get past your rigid thought processes in order to suspend disbelief long enough to watch a movie with a clearly absurd premise. Once you learn that about yourself, you should stop seeing films that are obviously meant to be stupid fun.For those who don't mind a fair bit of tom foolery, this movie is above average. It's not high art, but it has some very funny moments, and hits a lot of the same 1980s nostalgia buttons Adam Sandler movies often press. The film is comparable to Grown Ups, but for the crowd who played video games before they were cool.I liked it, my date (who is quite a bit younger and never played video games) liked it. It was a pretty inoffensive film with lots of stupid humor. Again, it's nothing special, but if you turn off your brain it makes for a fun time.It's certainly neither a 1-star movie nor a 10-star movie.

Please see it just for the cgi, it's awesome. If you have the dvd look for the short on how they created one of the cute characters. The comedy is snappy, almost witty, and yet nothing new, but it works. You'll smile rather than laugh out loud. The story is absurd, which is exactly what we pay Hollywood for, and with this one they've outdone themselves. There's a classic chase. There's a great cameo appearance. There's a cleverly worded love affair. There's a great homage to nerds of the 1980s and overall, I thought, a really whacky satire of big budget invasion movies. It's just such fun.","101 out of 123 found this helpful.

It has made my movie-going experience more enjoyable and has made me a more appealing companion with whom to watch movies. Likewise, I adjust my rating scale based on a number of factors including genre, intended audience and self awareness.Pixels is a thoroughly enjoyable movie if you take it for what it is: a light-hearted sci- fi comedy that aims to please without being too self-conscious. At times funny, at times sweet, and always entertaining, Pixels manages to take viewers through a nostalgic ride that is well-paced and doesn't suffer from the seemingly never-ending (and often less funny) third act that is characteristic of this kind of movie.Most of the laughs come from Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage, who look very comfortable in their portrayals as quirky conspiracy theorist Ludlow and former video game master Eddie, respectively. Adam Sandler's character seems all too familiar considering the actor's recent string of movies so I won't expand on that, and Kevin James plays Cooper as you'd come to expect from Kevin James. Rounding out our cast of heroes is Michelle Monaghan as Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten, a great addition who may feel out of place in a scene or two, like when her very believable concern for the situation at hand stands in stark contrast with the farcical dialogue.The special effects in Pixels are top-notch, creating a world where you can't help but suspend your disbelief and become engrossed in the action. The references to popular arcade video games are sure to remind audience members who grew up playing them of a simpler time.In all honesty, I didn't expect much coming into this movie, so suffice it to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't pay to see it twice, but I'd be sure to tune in if I ever come across it on Netflix or TV; heck I will probably spare the $2.00 at Red Box when it's released on BlueRay.","30 out of 63 found this helpful.

In fact, it surprised me with its depth of themes that I was not expecting from a jaunt down gaming memory lane.Brenner's honest portrayal of male self-respect and leadership and the effect his portrayal has on those around him is strength of character personified and is a robust genuine male role model for young boys and adult men.The arcade scene was a powerful positive statement to which all children of all ages can relate, and, if taken to heart, empowers and liberates children from one of the greatest fears of childhood. The scene was done in a most natural way. It was a showing without the telling which is what excellent story writing is meant to be.I found a richness of human connection in this film that didn't insult my intelligence and was humorous and believable against the backdrop of a fanciful circumstance. Predictable plot? Yes, but genuine enough to bring a smile to the face and enjoy the familiarity of that plot like a favorite amusement park ride that you want to ride over and over again. Some plot holes? Yes, but should one care? Not if one has taken the time to see the movie from the eyes of a child enjoying the fun of the ride over and over again.Should all movies be verbose in development, dark, and complicated with political social undertones to be excellent or good? This is a fun ""feel good"" kid's movie of pretend play where for once the good guys win, save the world, and get the girl without any shades of gray. It is a wonderful suspension of adult cynicism to return to the creative world of a child's imaginative mind.I don't know the history of Sandler's movies. It seems that most critics dislike his movies. This was the first movie of Sandler's that I saw and it was good wholesome fun on many levels. Maybe that cynicism of Hollywood and the critics is why the world is such a dark scary place for children.We need more men in the world like Sandler's character, Brenner.","28 out of 61 found this helpful.

At one point Adam Sandler says ""For the record, I'm an amazing kisser. All us nerds are. We appreciate it more."" and if that doesn't clue you in to how absolutely terrible this movie is then you're probably the target audience. If you need more convincing, the visibly upset woman he just met & tried to kiss (and is also providing a service for, but to hell with professionalism!) calls him ""a 210 pound dork who installs flat screens for a living."" He retorts with some ""What if I was a billionaire and we were on my yacht and I wasn't 30 going on 13"" line, basically imploring her to admit she was being shallow. If you listen really, really carefully, you can collectively hear men around the world yelling ""OWNED!"" only to be hushed by their parents, because no respectable adult would watch this movie.","20 out of 42 found this helpful.

Speaking of the latter, seeing Paul Blart become President felt more like a barrel of laughs that I could never take my mind off of. Back to my review, the film starring Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan was certainly impressive with its visuals though with a story that looked too simple to write. Director Chris Columbus himself has had a string of hits (Home Alone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) and misses (Rent), but I'd say this one in particular has some significance and is more like a teeter-totter between thrills and monotony.Adam Sandler portrays washed-up 80s avid gamer Sam Brenner who now works as a software installer, but when he's summoned by his old friend-turned-President Will Cooper, he and fellow former 80s gamers must ally together to stop an alien threat taking on the form of familiar video game characters or it's GAME OVER for all.Usually these days, I avoid Sandler-starring/produced films in movie theaters and wait for its DVD release (my last one seeing in theaters was 2008's Don't Mess with the Zohan), but when I first heard of him being thrown into a battle against classic 80s video game characters, they already had me at ""video games."" After witnessing Wreck-It Ralph back in 2012, I was entranced and drooling in 80s/90s arcade nostalgia. Those same elements were used again for an Adam Sandler comedy, so I rushed immediately to the theater to see if it can actually work. In the end, it had a few misogynistic moments, predictable outcomes, interesting celeb cameos, and typical dysfunctional humor used in many Happy Madison Production films. But when you throw in Olaf and Tyrion Lannister into the mix, its brand of humor now feels very much like Wreck-It Ralph crossed with Ghostbusters. One scene, for example, that was pretty clever was luring Pac-Man into chasing the lead guys in their appropriately color-coded vehicles, thus making the city look like a giant maze for him to roam around like in his original arcade game. Though the characters may not have had the best one-liners in some scenes or lacking true chemistry, it's a visual joyride for new, young generation gamers. Whereas old-school gamers of the 80s-90s will appreciate the nods and tributes, but will notice the lack in depth to see it as a good movie. Nevertheless, I liked seeing these four main guys (armed with proton pack-like weapons) getting themselves caught in harsh predicaments when lives are on the line, albeit with humorous results. Shouldn't be overlooked for a summer flick. Try a few quarters and there might be something good out of this. Game on!","23 out of 51 found this helpful.

Pixels is also a disgrace to the gaming society, especially for those who are fans of arcade games because the film is unimaginative and unfond with the arcade characters, though this is the producers fault for not exploring with the characters.

They are called to order when an alien race sends down attack squadrons in the form of classic video game characters. From Pac-Man to Donkey Kong, it appears that the world is headed for a disaster of pixelated proportions. Can Sandler and his gang save the world, or is it game over?Director Chris Columbus, who wrote classic 80s films like ""Gremlins"" and ""The Goonies"" and directed classics like ""Home Alone"" and the first two Harry Potter films, did a great job at bringing all these characters to life. The effects look pretty impressive, and the chemistry among the actors is certainly believable.

Once you get that straight then the movie makes comedic sense.This was a much funner movie than I thought it would be. I like Adam Sandler (loved Happy Gilmore) but a couple of his recent movies have been admittedly bad ""Jack & Jill).The nostalgia it brought back along with the jokes and puns (most of which were intentionally nerd lame) were part of what made the movie more enjoyable. A lot of the jokes were NOT aimed at the children's age group.The movie was definitely written to appeal to those of us that played these games back in the 80's and definitely NOT written for people who only like Xbox/playstation/PC gaming.I left the movie laughing and joking and was generally surprised I liked it a lot more than the trailers made me think I would.After reading some of the online reviews it seems a lot of Adam Sandler trolls are busy bashing it.I liked it better than the new Mad Max, the new Terminator, and a few other big time movies I've seen lately so I say ignore the haters and go watch the movie if you have any fond memories of playing Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Defender, Galaga, Frogger, Qbert, and tons more..... the trip back on memory lane is worth the price of admission.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

It's a movie about a video game apocalypse starring Adam Sandler. What in the world were they expecting? Citizen Kane? The Godfather? The problem with these so-called film critics today is that they're impervious to accepting anything at face value. I believe it got such awful review from critics because it starred a lot of big name actors and maybe they expected more substance from them; but you have to look at the source material before making those determinations. This is a tongue-in-cheek slapstick comedy that's meant to entertain people especially those who grew up in the 80's and can relate to the video game evolution nostalgia of that time. If you watch this movie with that mindset, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.","261 out of 372 found this helpful.

It's getting a lot of bad reviews and people seem to be having fun trashing Sandler. I don't know why. He did a respectable job, here. He didn't use an annoying, funny voice, he isn't dressed like a female version of himself, and his character isn't a pathetic loser, like in many of his films.He does a good job portraying his character. Kevin James is likable, as well. They're pretty transparently shooting for a Ghostbusters vibe with this, but, it's forgivable, because it mostly works.This is far from a perfect movie. I can't say I laughed out loud, partially because of the weirdly hostile audience. The folks I was watching the movie with seemed unwilling to give the movie a chance, so I think very few of them enjoyed it. Too bad.Go see it expecting a fun movie, with a flawed plot, great special effects, and reasonably believable characters. Don't expect it to be ""Gone With The Wind"" and you might have yourself a nice time watching this. It helps if you were about 15 when Donkey Kong and Q-Bert hit the arcades. Or not. Lighten up and have fun with it.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

Most can agree that his 90's work is pretty good if not great - Waterboy, Billy Madison, Wedding singer. But most of us were kids / teenagers at that point and even now in retrospect while we realize that those films are a tad idiotic, there was still fun to be had. But not anymore.Pixels does not know who it's trying to reach. It has all the retro gaming references that will appeal to the 20-30 year old, but the humor and overall acting that might amuse a 10 year old at best. The casting, oh god where do I even begin. First of all, stop casting beautiful women as Adam Sandlers love interest. I mean come on - Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, and now Michelle Monaghan? But the worst part - Kevin James as the president. Have you seen Paul Blart Mall Cop? Exact same character. I lost it there.I won't even get into the stupidity of the plot because that would take ages to get through. In the end I'd say that aside from the retro gaming scenes that some might find amusing and spark a hint of nostalgia, there is nothing appealing in this movie. Quite the contrary.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

This should be in the high sixes. I mean, what is up with people? Is it because Adam Sandler is in it, and people expect it to be bad? Is it too unrealistic? What's the stupid reason for the low rating?The idea is pretty original. The effects are pretty much top notch. The acting is satisfactory. The humor is alright, nothing too advanced though.Pixels is actually of a pretty rare breed. It is a high budget, comedy/action/sci-fi disaster-movie. Maybe that's why people don't like it, it doesn't fit comfortably in one genre.Anyhow, I enjoyed it. It's not quite great, but good. I got a little bit of that late 90's - early 2000's feeling, which I love. The effects look really good. It has a couple of quite exciting scenes. I didn't find it super funny, but it has a light, nice atmosphere. The acting is pretty much like expected, but Kevin James stands out, and does a great job.It doesn't have a lot of tension, but it being a feel good disaster movie, it doesn't matter much.Don't take it so damn seriously, just let yourself be entertained, and you'll probably like it.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Possessing neither a comedic timing, an ounce of actual effort or any genuine hint of life, Sandler is but a zombie walking through this ugly looking cavalcade of ideas and uninteresting action scenes, scenes that are reminisce of someone playing a fun game but never sharing the controller as you sit back and watch. Sandler's career has once and for all slumped to a new low personnel low and the same can be said of director Chris Columbus.The man responsible for the first two Harry Potter films, Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone and also the writer of Gremlins and The Goonies, it's clear Columbus knows a thing or two about entertaining people through the medium of film but Pixels seems devoid of entertainment and Columbus must be blamed for so blandly directing this wannabe franchise starter. Wasting not only the chance to merge gaming lore with big screen thrills but support from the likes of an unbelievably bad Peter Dinklage (Tyrion would be sorely disappointed) and the sad supporting turns from actors like Sean Bean and Brian Cox.Any movie that casts Kevin James as the American President was going to have a hard time succeeding but really there is no excuse for Pixels to be so downright boring and lacking in joy. Getting a star purely around the fact it has some nice ideas that never eventuate into their potential, Pixels is such a sad state of affairs that many of its cast members will be wishing they had another life to spend on not signing up for this disaster in the first place. As for the idea of this becoming a franchise, game over man.game over.1 episode of One Tree Hill out of 5","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Look, I genuinely like Sandler. I am a fan of many of his movies, but this one is not a good movie. He plays a video game nerd that had a chance of making it big as a child, only to come in second place, and thus be regulated to a life of drudgery. Having your best friend become president and still want to hang out with you doesn't seem to qualify as ""cool"" or ""awesome."" Just tedious. Now, as an adult, he works as a NERD, a computer guy based on the Geek squad, and installs electronics in homes (when not hanging with the leader of the free world). Aliens attack our planet, using our old video games as the basis of their attacks, and it is up to Sandler, Dinklage, and Lamansoff, all three contenders from a video game competition from 30 years ago, to save the world. There are so many problems with this movie. It's clunky. It's stupid. It can only appeal to small children, and even they must have had some traumatic brain injury to be able to enjoy this movie. Given the premise, of video game superstars fending off video game monsters, you have to know that children are going to be attending in droves. Make it kid friendly. This movie doesn't try to cater to them--a question of what to call a male maggot was answered with, ""Mangina?"" a cross between maggot and vagina. Funny? No. Not at all. Did the children laugh? They didn't understand. Now...am I supposed to explain to my 8 year old what a ""mangina"" is? The rest of the cast just phoned in their parts. I paid 17 dollars for popcorn and soda, and the the tickets were free. I could have stayed at home and watched it for free in a couple of months, and would have saved 17 bucks.

Really? This movie was not bad! It was funny, action packed, and just all out fun.The idea and the storyline of this movie was very good. It was very creative and it brought back memories of older games such as PAC-MAN, Galaga, and Donkey Kong. The CGI for all the animated game characters was awesome. The cartoony animation was absolutely great and made the characters fit in well with the real world.The comedy was hilarious! I found myself laughing very hard at times and it was just great, classic Happy Madison humor. Part of this was because of the acting which was great by the way. Everyone keeps saying that Adam Sandler is not funny anymore but I disagree. He still was funny at times to me and I thought he did good acting. Kevin James as the president was hysterical. Michelle Monaghan did great. But the two who were just hilarious and almost made you cry because they were so funny was Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad. They were so funny and the stuff they said and did was totally laugh out loud funny.Surprisingly, the action in this movie was really good. The PAC-MAN car chase, the Donkey Kong battle, and the video games attacking the city was great action and there were some cool new stunts I have never seen before and that was nice to see in a comedy film.If you love the old time video games, Happy Madison, good, laugh out loud comedy, and some cool and comical action then you will love this movie. Sit back, don't take it too seriously, and enjoy this fun film.","217 out of 356 found this helpful.

Adam Sandler does a great job, toning down his normal over reactive and colourful style, which is a nice thing as far as I'm concerned. When you get past that part of him, he's really a very capable actor.Overall the acting was well done, the writing was decent (with a lot of 80's references that were fun), it was cast well, and it was visually fun. What more do you expect in a movie of this genre and style? Was it a life changing, moving experience? Of course not, but if that's what you're hoping for, you're doing things wrong. Turn this one on for some fun, some humour, and a couple hours spent with the family that you won't regret.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

While this film has every reason to fail as a comedy, it can still appeal to a specific audience - kids of the 80s, and the current generation of pre-teens yet to discover the trappings of social media.That's a generation gap of 30 years, but the defining moment that bridges this gap is the mutual love for video games. Back in the day, the social norm was to get out of the house, walk to the arcade, spend a few hours with real friends, and vie for social standing as a champion gamer. It felt real with moments that bring back joyous memories that not even a thousand friends on Facebook can match today. On the flip side, gamers are still typecast as nerds, and this is what the film attempts to say. It's 1982 and gaming prodigy Sam has a shot at the Guinness Book championship title. Backed by his gaming chums Will and Ludlow, Sam reaches the finals in a faceoff against narcissist nemesis Eddie 'The Fire Blaster'. Also present is NASA who records the competition and sends it into space to contact alien life. Wrong move. Cut to present day and Will (Kevin James) is the President of the USA (there's hope for gamers?) while Sam (Adam Sandler) and Ludlow (Josh Gad) are everyday losers. Turns out, those aliens did get the message but misinterpreted it as a hostile invitation. Who do you call? Ghostbusters zapping aliens pretty much sums up the rest of the film. While the story gets dumber by the minute (inclusive of the clichéd romance between Sandler's Mr. Fixit and Michelle Monaghan's White House official), director Chris Columbus alternates flat gags with solid visuals and iconic characters that wreak havoc on screen. Add to that some madcap moments from Peter Dinklage as the aforementioned narcissist, Gad let loose ala Jonah Hill style from the Jump Street films, and a list of clever cameos, and there's enough reason for Pixels to generate some offbeat excitement.The fact that Sandler is still pigeonholed as a sad-sack from his Happy Madison Productions (from Happy Gilmore to last year's The Cobbler) can be a typical letdown for many viewers and fans alike. It's the same reason why most of the amusement comes from the supporting cast. Even as they deliver with acceptable comic timing, the real fun is in racing back to the days of Atari or annihilating monsters at the gaming arcade. And speaking of nostalgia, look no further than Columbus, the writing genius behind all time classics like The Goonies and Gremlins - films that are as iconic as the Pac-Man and Donkey Kong games. Kids who watched those films or played those games are grownups today but for the most part, Pixels made me feel as invincible as a kid in an arcade. Game on dude!","29 out of 76 found this helpful.

He's needlessly cruel to the ""love interest"" and is a terrible chore to sit through, enough said. Also, the addition of the White House and the military of all things is stupidly insulting because is renders the two as one big dumb,unfunny joke.

Pixels delivered exactly what it promised in the trailer: total misfits save the world from a wacky invasion by nostalgic aggressors. Oddly, they spent a lot of time making the premise seem logical. I hadn't planned on analyzing the plot that closely, but meh, okay. The only conceit I had trouble swallowing was someone as young as Michelle Monaghan being in her character's position. It was easier buying Kevin James in his role; seems almost believable we'd elect an doufus everyman, if only out of some kind of Clinton/Bush hangover. Next, Being a Happy Madison production, I was concerned about language, but it was nowhere near as cringe-worthy as Ant-Man, and was delivered like a bunch of twelve year-olds, which seemed to take the sting out a bit. Thank you Chris Columbus for not teaching my sixth grader any new phrases. I guess Adam Sandler filling small roles with family made a difference, and it did. I'm getting tired of ""family movies"" dropping f-bombs and angry, profanity-laden exchanges (I'm looking at you Marvel and Michael Bay).Diversity plus: no little people jokes in dialogue or set up. Diversity minus: Yet again, the world is in danger and only white Americans can save the day. And this is coming from a white American.All in all, worth the 3D premium, my kid enjoyed it, and I'll probably buy the blu-ray, which is more than I've been able to say about an Adam Sandler movie in ten years.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

Am not a fan of Adam Sandler, although he has done good performances in the past or the juvenile humour that permeates in too many of his comedies, and the advertising and negative reviews made me further nervous. Absolutely loved the concept though and have a lot of love for Peter Dinklage ('Game of Thrones' is a favourite and he is one of the main reasons).It also garnered a lot of vehement defence so condescending that it put me off watching it for a long time until it came on Film4 and decided to watch it finally. After watching it, 'Pixels' for me was not a particularly good film and didn't do enough with such a great concept, but it could have been so much worse. It is not that bad and is a long way from being one of Sandler's worst (nothing is worse than 'Grown Ups 2' and especially 'Jack and Jill').Starting with the good things, 'Pixels' looks great. Especially in the imaginative production design and truly impressive special effects. There are amusing moments (almost all of it from Dinklage and occasionally from Josh Gad), some decent action and an element of nostalgia.The soundtrack is suitably energetic. Other than the visuals, the best thing about it is Dinklage, for Dinklage it is far from one of his best performances but he does show a knack for comic timing.However, Sandler is on lifeless autopilot throughout and his comic timing is irritating and tired. Gad tries hard but too often over-compensates that he is more annoying than funny and Kevin James is just bizarre in his role. The rest of the cast are wasted and the direction lacks energy and ease.More annoying was that 'Pixels' had such an inventive concept and managed to make it so bland and predictable. There are no surprises here, no originality or imagination, the fun and energy only comes sporadically and tonally the film feels muddled. The references may make older viewers nostalgic but most of them don't serve much purpose and are likely to be lost on younger viewers unfamiliar with what is being referenced. Further killing 'Pixels' is the writing and humour. There are moments that do raise a mild chuckle or smirk but a vast majority of it induces groans and cringing, because the dialogue is so childish and forced and the humour is incredibly juvenile in a way that has been tired and grating long before 'Pixels' was made and came out. It's been present in a lot of Sandler's films especially the ones released in the last decade or so and there is a lot of deja vu here.In summary, not that bad and has its moments but wastes a great concept and is just too juvenile, bland and bizarre to get much from it. 4/10 Bethany Cox","14 out of 30 found this helpful.

It's a very fun movie that does something that most films aimed at families fail to do, it's funny for both kids and adults, I watched this in the theatre and I couldn't help noticing that there was just as much laughter from the older audience as there was children, it has a ton of classic 80's video game characters, such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Q*bert, and it's a delight for all ages to see all these classic characters in one movie whether you're familiar with them or not. It certainly has its flaws, my biggest issue is that the trailer spoiled too much of the movie, it shows every single battle (that being three) as well as basically every video game character that appears in this, it should have had much more, it was clearly given creative freedom by Sony to use as many as they could and I don't think they took advantage of that as much as they should have, there should have been more characters other than Q*bert to be used for cute comic relief, and I think there should have been a few more battles between the humans and the classic games as well. This film is receiving way too much criticism that I don't think it deserves, it isn't perfect and it dosen't make as much use of its creative and original plot as it could have, but the reviews for this are brutal and I don't understand why, I think critics just assume that an Adam Sandler film is always going to be terrible, and when that's your attitude and you're going in to all his films with extremely low expectations, then of course you won't like it, critics don't seem to look at Pixels for the fun and harmless adventure it is, and I actually found Sandler to be quite charming in it, the kind of comedic performance I like from him, subtle and realistic, and because of these reviews Pixels became the most underrated movie of the summer. Though it certainly has its imperfections, Piixels is a very fun movie that had me entertained and sucked in to this world of pure imagination from start to finish, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film that children and adults will enjoy. A group of hardcore gamers must battle aliens who have come to attack Earth in the form of classic 80's video game characters.

It stars Adam Sandler, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan and Kevin James.When aliens intercept video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players (Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad) and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) to save the planet.No, just no. I usually start my reviews with the positives. Okay. The visuals looked crisp and virtual like the old arcade games. That's a major plus this movie has going for it. It also has some moderately funny performances from Gad and Dinklage. Done! Now this is the worst movie of the year. I don't like to give out F's it seems too harsh. This movie doesn't get one. I don't like to write reviews on movie that I didn't enjoy very much. This is the exception. I refused to write a review on Hot Pursuit and Soaked in Bleach because I didn't hate those movies. I hate this one!This movie has nothing funny or interesting to say. It spews out so much garbage that it's almost painful to watch. Adam Sandler kills. What? The role? NO! The movie. His performance is as wooden as Woody from Toy Story(great movie, I am in no way comparing the two) and much more bland. Kevin James' comedy is dry and stale. He's basically the clumsy guy who breaks a ton of stuff. Who thought that that would be entertaining or funny? The direction is fine but could've been better. I didn't expect much from the men that wrote This Means War and Grown Ups 2, at least they didn't disappoint.Overall this movie was bad and borderline unwatchable. If you want to see a movie this week watch Southpaw or Paper Towns, not this. Pixels gets a 3/10 or a D+ just because of Dinklage and Gad's performances and the visuals.

Is it fun? Hell yeah it is. Is it funny? Yep, sure is, is it really really funny? Not really, but are there really really funny shows out there anymore? NopeIs it worth your money? Yes it is. So look here, the show is about ARCADE GAMES ATTACKING THE WORLD, so why take things so seriously? The people who slam this movie are going on and on about acting, the show being not funny, lame jokes, Adam Sandler trying to make moneyPlease..who makes movies not to earn money? Look at yourselves, if you didn't enjoy yourself at this movie, you probably are taking life or yourselves too seriously. The ratings are low because people enjoy arty farty movies too much? Or they are trying to show that they are sophisticated? Movies are supposed to be fun and this one sure is. Looking at the ratings at rotten tomatoes epitomizes the way people think nowadays, all uptight, trying to find a perfect movie and just plain wet blankets.","98 out of 169 found this helpful.

In order to combat them, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his old childhood friend and former classic video game champion and current ""nerd installer"" Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of classic video game players Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and also a colonel and weapons developer Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to try to save the planet.After reading some of the other reviews for this film, I found that most people did not like this film. I understood some of their points but I didn't think it is as bad as they made it out to be. I just want to say that despite the fact that the trailer makes it look like the film is for kids, it is not. This film is recommended for at least teens. Adam Sandler's films this last decade have been rather hit or miss but mostly misses and this one is not a miss but is not quite a hit either. Just like his films, the jokes in this one are hit or miss but in this case, they are mostly hits with some misses. The acting in this film wasn't remarkable either. Adam Sandler plays the same character he has played in numerous other films. The role could have probably been played by another actor and be just as good if not better. Kevin James is serviceable as President Cooper. Josh Gad was good as the clumsy, fat guy Ludlow and got to recite some of the film's funniest one-liners. Peter Dinklage's Eddie was arguably trying too hard. Michelle Monaghan's Violet was OK but had no chemistry with Sam which made their romantic scenes a little cringe-worthy and unbelievable. Sure the story doesn't make too much sense either but the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously and does a decent job of not taking itself too seriously either. For me, the best part of the film has to be the special effects. The way in which they bring all the classic video games to life was rather good. All of the classic video games of the 80s were well represented which was appreciated. The way in which people go in and out of pixelation and how environments got destroyed via pixelation was nice to see. I was also curious as to how they were able to alter old 80s video footage as well (I won't spoil why this happens). This film is nowhere near the best film of the year and will probably not be on any best of thew year lists but I was entertained. If you just turn off your brain and suspend belief and except what you are given, I think you'd all enjoy it too.keithlovesmovies.com","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

A truly, god awful, cinematic release. Adam Sandler aside (though, yeah, he sucks in this too), the movie seems to take pride on this idea that the very demographic it's banking on seeing this movie, are a bunch of losers who live with their mothers, replaying games while covered in a cloud of Cheeto dust. Any sense of logical consistency (Which, yes, does matter even in a movie like this) is thrown out the window for arbitrary reasons. Are the aliens answering our call to war, via the video games we sent up with that probe? Or are they a confused, peaceful species? Is Q-bert a positive trophy for us? Or is he a traitor to their cause? The movie goes back and forth, and doesn't care because it's too busy trying to find some other ham fisted, bad joke about Pac man to make. Hell, the whole movie seems to just want to get you to give them money to be reminded that Centipede existed. Donkey Kong existed. If I tell you Galaga existed, can I get $24 million dollars in a weekend too? AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FACT THEY MADE A FEMALE CHARACTER INTO A LITERAL TROPHY, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE.","20 out of 49 found this helpful.

It is also surprising how hard it is to accept some characters in this film considering the premise and all but I just couldn't believe Kevin James character at all. That must say something considering I'm more willing to accept the Arcade Game Invasion this movie is about over his character and his portrayal of said character. Oh well, you don't watch Adam Sandler movies for the great acting anyway. Overall, for the hour and a half it was on, it entertained; though you won't get much replay value from it as I can see the jokes getting old fast.

He can be funny, but a president, really? just a bad idea to help the main character give him such a powerful help.

I think it was mostly those who dislike Adam Sandler. Both the hate towards this movie and towards Adam Sandler are undeserved. Sandler has made some flops (Little Nicky, Jack & Jill), but he was also responsible for some comedy classics (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer) and has shown that he's capable of more serious roles as well (Spanglish, Funny People). As far as Adam Sandler in this movie goes, it falls somewhere in the middle. Far removed from either his worst or his best roles. He wasn't the primary reason I enjoyed the movie, but he took nothing away from my enjoyment either. And perhaps that's how it should be. I don't remember feeling like I was being reminded that I was watching an Adam Sandler flick.We all know this movie was not intended as fine art and it's almost cliché to point that out when reviewing light-hearted comedies. The point is, I had a good time watching. The short Internet clip that inspired this movie was incredible, and seeing the idea expanded on was good fun. It won't change your life, but it will transport you back to 80s and give you some fun eye candy. One thing of note: I usually get to bored by long, drawn-out CGI action sequences, especially during climaxes. This is the first movie in a long time that had such a sequence during the climax that actually entertained me, and I think that means a lot. For me the movie would have been better had it's intended audience been adults. Some of the attempts at ""double entendre"" humour (i.e: jokes intended to entertain the adults yet be ""safe"" for kids) fell flat for me. But I understand that they wanted to make a family friendly movie, and that's what they did. Peter Dinklage was comedy gold. If you like video games and Game of Thrones it's worth seeing just for those two things alone.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

It is a lazy money grab by all major parties involved. I watch movies for a living and work on many commercially viable productions.

Most of us saw the trailers and were intrigued by using 21st century cgi to bring back to life our old arcade favorites from the 80s. Yet, it takes more to entertain. You need a plausible story and good casting choices. Besides, you need decent chemistry among lead actors. Everything about this film felt disconnected and awkward. I wanted to like Sam Brenner and his side kicks, but could not help myself but feel indifferent. Could someone please write a decent script for the next Adam Sander comedy? This man is talented and deserves better, if he still has the hunger to be out there and pursue his craft.

Pixels, however, is dreadful, and fully deserving of any critical mauling it has received.A promising premise—aliens attack Earth in the form of video games after mistaking a videotape of '80s arcade classics for a declaration of war—is developed as a series of lacklustre action scenes loaded with flashy CGI and not very funny humour.Sandler adopts his usual affable loser persona but can do little with the lousy material; also wasted are the talents of Brian Cox, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, while the lovely Ashley Benson, as sexy game character Lady Lisa, is there purely as eye candy (not that I'm complaining about that—she was sorely needed to take my mind off the terrible comedy).It's also hard to see who the film would appeal to: adults will find much of the humour childish and grating (the 'cute' digital Q-bert character had me cringing in embarrassment), while the many references to '80s pop culture (Max Headroom, Hall and Oates, most of the games) will be lost on the young.And is it even possible to use a cheat code on an arcade machine?

Since there was no effort at plot development, endearing or believable characters, or passable dialogue, I would have to vote for this as a ""kids"" movie. But, would if have been difficult to have at least *one* plot element consistent or plausible. Whether for kids or not, the acting was almost horrible beyond measure. The support acting crew does well, but Sandler can barely be bothered with the effort. He literally could have phoned in his lines via cell phone and saved himself or the studio the limousine fees.Why not a single star rating? I give it one above minimum for the graphics.

The idea though ridiculous, was at least fresh to all the movies being produced today appearing to be recycled from other movies. It kind of reminds me of the original Hot Tub Machine movie that was unexpectedly a fresh idea and was entertaining. Like that movie , there were parts of this movie that were just plain funny and amusing. The movie theater I was in most people laughed multiple times, I can not remember another movie (recently) where the majority of the moviegoers were noticeably laughing.

It takes the cult arcade games of our time & puts them in a story, that is often entertaining, despite some flaws. 'Pixels' Synopsis: When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.'Pixels' has some moments, that work on its advantage. The concept firstly is fun & watching the legendary characters of the arcade games come to life, give us fan boys, pure guilty pleasure. However, the goings-on aren't always engaging & the pace drops in the middle too. But, 'Pixels' needs to be watched with limited expectations, in order, to enjoy it!Tim Herlihy & Timothy Dowling's Adapted Screenplay is mostly fun, but it could've been tighter. The second-hour, especially, lacks meat. Chris Columbus's Direction is passable. Graphics are pretty good. Cinematography & Editing are okay. Art Design is accurate. Performance-Wise: Adam Sandler is as usual. Kevin James is superb as the goofy president. Michelle Monaghan is adequate. Josh Gad & The Terrific Peter Dinklage are funny. Brian Cox is wasted. Ditto for Sean Bean. On the whole, 'Pixels' isn't an all-out entertainer, but yet its fun, especially for those, who've grown up on these games!","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Oh boy.Adam Sandler is certainly no Clark Gable when it comes to being a leading man. He is just a tired 48 year old man, he's better off playing a single father in his late 40s. That's what he looks like. HE DOESN""T LOOK LIKE HE'S GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah, and Kevin James is the president. Yup. That is ""Pixels"" for you. A WASTE OF MY TIME!!!!!!!!!!The film is disturbingly clichéd. Oh is it clichéd. How is it that Adam Sandler gets Michelle Monaghan's character as his lover! That just doesn't make sense! Of course, in the beginning, they hate each other, but you know what happens. You know. It is so predictable, but that's what you're going to get.The first 3 minutes were kind of cool. But that's because I liked the song. That Cheap Trick song was the best part of the whole movie. The WHOLE MOVIE! But, hey, there were a few positive things about the movie. The first 20 minutes had a few brief funny moments, and the special effects were pretty neat. The concept and action sequences were pretty clever, but the battle scenes, overall, become boring. That's the thing about these modern big-budget movies, the action sequences just become boring after a while. They also try to fill these action sequences with ""jokes"". Of course, jokes has to be in quotes, because these ""jokes"" are basically Josh Gad falling down and yelling.Overall, this movie is an embarrassment, but Adam Sandler doesn't care, he just wants your money.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

This movie is not worth the cost (most movies arnt nowadays anyways), but this movie was really not that good. I love Adam, and some of his movies are my favourite all time (water boy, Bed Time stories, Little Nicky), but this movie is not high up on that list for me. The movie of course had its saving moments, and i did laugh quite a bit, and i enjoyed most of it, but overall, the movie was terrible.So the movie plot is: in the 80's, a group of friends loved arcade games, and one of the boys (Adam Sandler) became one of the best in the world, before loosing to Peter Dinklage. At this event, NASA had recorded the arcade games and sent it into space in hopes of communicating with aliens. Fast forward to present times, the friends have all moved on, one became a conspiracy nut, one became the president, and Adam became a software installation specialist. However one day, aliens land on Earth and challenge the humans to an arcade like game, using old arcade games, for the fate of the world and these friends must unit together once again to save Earth.So the pros: I liked the movie, it was very fun, had some good action, extremely good CGI when it came to the video game characters (i thought the centipede was awesome looking),the soundtrack was pretty awesome and combined with the action was very ""pump up"", the jokes were often on que, and the idea of Kevin James as President was beyond hilarious.Cons: The movie lacked any real depth, but it didn't aim to, the dialog between characters was often painful to watch and too corny, the forced love connection with the main characters, the massive amount of plot holesOverall: I liked this movie, it will surely become a cult classic, and it was fun to watch at home on a Sunday night on TV, but i wouldn't recommend buying it. I personally wouldn't reject it as a gift, but i wouldn't go out and buy it myself unless it was $5. From an actually technical movie perspective, it was lousy and deserves a 5. whatever it is, if not less. But don't let that fool you, because if you don't take it seriously, it was a fun movie. As an overall movie, it should be a 5.0, judging it based on what it was made to be, probably an 7.0...so i took the middle ground, and gave it a 6.0","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Sandler wasn't that much of a hyperactive moron, Kevin James played it cool, Monaghan was hot, Josh Gad got all the embarrassing lines and Dinklage was to me the highlight of the movie. Eddie Plant is probably one of the most bad ass characters in comedy. The fights between the nerds and the video game characters were beautiful, there are some great shots. In the end, this movie just like BvS doesn't deserve the hate for no apparent reason (the reason for this one being just because it is a Happy Gilmore production) and you should consider watching this only when you are free on the weekend.

But putting those complains aside, this movie is designed to be nostalgic to the times when we admire these classic arcade games. But it's tough having that kind of magic since, as most people were right, Sandler's humor and clichés keep getting in the way. There is some fun ideas that the film could have explored more often than the standard tropes of its star, but for some reason, it's impossible. While Pacman and Donkey Kong are truly timeless, Sandler just keeps beating the dead horse of his glory days. The best part of the entire movie is the opening, where we see the childhood of the main characters spend their time at the arcade. It shows the culture where videogames impact the lives of these kids until they grow up. And then, the world has gotten weird at the present day. Aside the fact that one of the kids is now the President of the United States, the movie finally sticks to the collection of Adam Sandler movie clichés. Even though the aesthetics kind of established something larger-than-life here and there, the movie rather focuses on how Sam Brenner tries to hook up with the pretty girl he just met and his unexciting life as an adult. When the aliens invade, there is some colors to be appealed for, but again, the focus is subdued by a number of subplots from each of its main characters.And that's the serious problem of the film; of course it's a comedy that doesn't need to take itself seriously and prioritize more on the laughs, but the humor is clearly not as inspired as it wants to be. We're still being pushed to this romantic subplot that isn't really that interesting, also Brenner and his gang are being degraded for being nerds even though they act more like downright weirdos. These bits are hardly worth rooting for. When it comes to the main plot itself, it's often illogical, but it doesn't quite matter. But the best punchline through that nonsense is when one of the players used cheat codes in the aliens' game IN REAL LIFE. It indicates that even the screenwriters have no idea how these work and it's funny because they just throw it in idiotically without this ""self-aware"" reaction, like what they did to Q- Bert in the end.The action is quite impressive at least. The special effects bring a lot of energy and visual candy on screen. It's pretty cool seeing these games come to life with this scale and cause mayhem whatever place they stumble in. But again, the camera just can't move away from the characters. The acting isn't really that special, even when they're trying. Adam Sandler is still the lazy Sandler we see, no matter how many times he is claimed as a nerd. Michelle Monaghan is unable to shine due that her role is written as a cliché. Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage have the enthusiasm, even if the script is supposed to make them obnoxious, but they are the sole charm among these main characters.Pixels is far from Sandler's worst; we could spare it for the impressive craft, entertaining ideas and some rare jokes that work which are intentional and otherwise. But overall, nobody wants to see this type of movie anymore. It could have worked if it was made in the last decade or two, when the actor is still not getting much heat from the audience yet. This movie seeks for nostalgia, but the nostalgia we'd rather see is the classic games than Sandler's old tricks. And it's quite sad that the filmmakers did try to build something crazier in this world; there are aliens and a robot in this movie! But it keeps moving away to the least interesting parts. That side only gets interesting when the screenwriters got things wrong, like the fact that the heroes fight better than the military only because they grew up with the games or, again, the cheat codes. There's an opportunity of fun hinted along the sides, but again, Sandler's fingerprints are too inevitable.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

I often feel that if a story is rather bland, that if it has some really strong, well developed characters the could still go far. Unfortunately with all of Sandlers movies of late, the characters are the same stereotype. They are either A: 40 year old trying to regain their youth while trying to live through their children, or they have unbelievable talents/careers.Its one thing to try and have me believe that Adam Sandler is on some type of nerd squad, but to have a movie where Kevin James character becomes the President? With no explanation? Its a shame because the pix elated video game characters do have a nice look to them unfortunately they have to be in an Happy Madison Production. While not being nearly as offensive as Jack and Jill was, Sandler manages to almost ruin all of these classic video game characters.

To those who trashed it so badly - what were you expecting? It's an Adam Sandler movie, it's not going to be masterpiece theatre.So the premise is ridiculous (aliens create weapons based on 80s arcade games to attack the Earth), the script is silly and at times self-contradictory, some of the humor induces groans rather than laughs and a lot of the acting was over-the-top. OK, maybe I'm seeing where those bad reviews came from...But if, like me, you practically lived in the arcades in the 80s, this movie is just jam-packed with nods and references to games like Centipede, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, Robotron, Burger Time and others. It was fun just trying to identify which games all the alien attackers came from.My one gripe is that there were some characters that were just made up for the movie. I was scratching my head trying to figure out what game the purple ninjas were from, or where the red dressed warrior lady came from. Turns out they were both invented for the film.Another questionable aspect is why the intellectual level of this movie is clearly aimed at pre-teens. They weren't even born when these games were popular.Overall though, if you're looking for a mindless comedy with well done special effects and tons of 80s video game references, this makes for an entertaining couple hours. Just don't expect an Oscar winning film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It looked like a funny and very creative concept. Seriously, extraterrestrials misinterpreted as video game characters attacking Earth in a declaration of war, using technology that was inspired by various video games. Doesn't that just scream excitement? Then, I saw the studios behind it all, Sony Pictures and Happy Madison. Plus, Adam Sandler was part of the cast. Alarms went off in my head right away. Now, I'm not saying I hate Adam Sandler as an actor and film maker overall, he has been involved with a few good and some great movies in his career. But, a handful of them are utter trash. Even after I saw Adam Sandler was in the cast, I still wanted to see this ""movie"". I planned on going to see it in a theater, but several things came up in my life and I didn't get a chance to go see it during it's theatrical release, thank God for that! Soon after it's release on DVD, I saw that it was going to be on TV one night. So, I watched it, since it was 100% free at that time. Let me just say this, you guys. This is one of the most poorly executed films I have ever seen. ""Pixels"" has a cliched and boring storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a predictably generic soundtrack to try and tie it all together. As I mentioned before, the plot for this ""film"" is a very clever concept. Aliens recreated as evil versions of video game characters invade Earth? That was a fun and unique storyline practically gift-wrapped for the writers and film makers! But, apparently they got morons involved and none of the brilliant opportunities were taken advantage of at all. Adam Sandler's production company, Happy Madison, has ruined yet another cool idea, again! This is really starting to aggravate me. ""Pixels"" is stuffed to the brim with cliche after cliche, dull and boring dialogue, uninspired action scenes and a lack of creativity with the villains. There are so many awesome video games out there that they could have used for this ""film"". Sadly, they chose a few of probably the most boring ones in arcade game history. The only one out of this group that I actually like, is Pac-Man. Why? Because everyone, including me, can look at that character and know where it's from, whether you've played that game or not. Overall, the plot was poorly executed, next to nothing of interest happens and the script sounds like it was written by people on drugs. Probably the saddest thing is, that it didn't have to suck. It could've been, and should've been so much more. I honestly could've wrote a better script in less than two hours! As far as the acting goes, it's just as big a letdown. The only actors that seem to be trying here are: Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean. Their acting was not too bad. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast was just plain mediocre, especially Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad. To give Adam Sandler some credit, he's not a bad actor overall in his career. But, Kevin James and Josh Gad are not funny, nor will they ever be funny in any form of media. Why do those two keep getting cast in films and TV shows? The acting is just a joke from the majority of the cast! As far as the soundtrack goes, it's a big disappointment. When I saw who composed this ""film"" score, I was very surprised. Henry Jackman wrote the music! Usually, he writes decent music for any movie he gets involved in. What happened to him here? Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a nice atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Yes, they do get a little cheesy, but that was the intent, since the villains are classic video game characters. ""Pixels"" is yet another letdown in the world of Adam Sandler movies. One thing I loathe in the film and animation industry is wasted potential. This ""movie"" is the epitome of wasted potential, they had a phenomenal concept and yet they somehow screwed it up. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this ""film""? Unless you're a fan of the video games that this ""movie"" is based on, you'd be much better off skipping it. To tell you the truth, I have more fun playing the video games instead!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Everything works except the characters & how they're written","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3384793/?ref_=tt_urv","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29565770/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2015","Although video games have not been around as long as the car or other significant technological advances, it certainly has an equal amount of an impact in today's' society. Which only started as a couple lit up dots on a screen in the early 70s, has turned into a worldwide phenomenon of competitions of expanded universes with detailed landscapes as far as the eye can see. It's amazing looking at the transformation of video games. The time that was most nostalgic for much of the older generation was during the 1980s when video gaming was starting to become a big thing. Kids around the nation would line up in front of buildings filled with arcade machines looking to spend their 25 cents to see who would be the next gaming king. It was a time when things were much simpler but still just as fun. French director Patrick Jean had an interesting idea. What would it be like if the video games we used to play with began attacking our world? What would happen? For the two-minute short film that Jean provided, it was a unique idea. For this big screen production of Jean's idea, the concept remains the same but now it has things added to it that don't make it as fun. Adam Sandler plays Sam Brenner, a frustrated electronics repairman who longs for his gaming days back in the 80s. However he gets this opportunity after what appears to be old video games attacking the city. So he gathers up his associates, Cooper (Kevin James), Ludlow (Josh Gad) and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to help fight back. With a screenplay penned by Tim Herlihy (a frequent Sandler collaborator) and Timothy Dowling (Role Models (2008)) knowing what might be included in the story ended up being predictable. A major element that wasn't necessary to include was the love interest subplots for multiple characters. Practically every main character has a struggling relationship with somebody and they all look to better themselves. Brenner ends up meeting a divorced mom, Violet (Michelle Monaghan) only through forced exposition of her son. What child talks to a stranger like that? There's also Ludlow's fantasy of being with Lady Lisa from a game he plays. Even Brenner's childhood rival Eddie wants to be with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams. All these threads tally up and just pad the film making the momentum slow down. Oh and don't forget the potty humor - a trademark of Happy Madison productions. There's also a series of plot contrivances that make no sense and a number of noticeable continuity errors that add to the confusion of how some video game characters are more developed than others are. A blatant example is Q*bert; how does he have a conscience but not Pac-Man? Even with these problems, this could've been tolerable if the characters were funny. Unfortunately very few are. Kevin James plays one of the goofiest presidents seen on screen and Josh Gad plays it mostly awkward the whole time. Sandler occasionally spews out a line worth of a chuckle because he's trying to sound like an old timer, but it's not often. The rest of the time he just sounds like he's saying whatever came to mind at the time. It doesn't even matter that Sandler is cast with his usual buddies but at least switch up the role. His female co-star is equally sporadic. Dinklage just being snobby stuck up gamer was the best part. There are other appearances from credible actors like Brian Cox, and Sean Bean but they end up being wasted. It's sad that all these issues are just as powerful as the positives. For direction at least, Chris Columbus headed this project instead of Sandler's regulars. The visuals are a nice too. The special effects that make up the video game characters and how they pixilated the surroundings is wonderfully colorful. The director of photography was Amir Mokri (Man of Steel (2013) & Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)), a guy who has plenty of work dealing with blockbuster scope films.The other bonus of to this movie is the nostalgic factor. For those who really enjoyed playing games like Asteroids, Q*bert, Frogger, Super Mario Bros., Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Centipede, Duck Hunt, Tetris, etc. - the fact that seeing these iconic games on the big screen is awesome looking. It does kind of go back to how video game movies don't work though because a gamer would rather play and be interactive than submissive and just watching a game happen. Lastly, the film score was decently made too. Composed by Henry Jackman (this would be his second video game score - his first being to Disney's Wreck-It Ralph (2012)), the score lacks a main theme but does keep the energy moving throughout the action scenes. Even for the slower scenes Jackman has tunes that sound okay. And of course, since this is a film that hearkens back to the 1980s, the soundtrack does include 80s bands like Loverboy and Queen. They even got Daryl Hall and John Oates to play a cameo. That's awesome. The good is equally countered by the bad. It has decent music, colorful special effects, clear cinematography and a large nostalgic factor based on its library of retro video games. Sadly all this is bogged down cliché casting and character development, hit and miss comedy and not enough focus on the video games.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

What's more, those who remember the older games (Donkey Kong, Pac Man, etc.) will love reminiscing on the older style of games, while those who are fans of the newer games will be glad to find the new games play a role, as well. I know that, so far, this movie is getting mixed to negative reviews, but I strongly recommend seeing it yourself before making up your mind about it. The whole theater was laughing and enjoying the movie. I'm glad I spent the money on the theater version.","98 out of 189 found this helpful.

That being said, this movie could have been much better with a few more believable characters. Dear Kevin James, Your humor and acting style is hilarious and never gets old. Or at least that's what I would have said in 2005. But it's 2015 now, and it HAS gotten old. You're the same old goofy Kevin James in EVERY SINGLE MOVIE you do. Haven't you learned any new tricks since becoming an actor? No? Looks like you're still coasting on the same old corny dancing you got so famous for in Hitch.Seriously though, if Adam Sandler movies always pull from the same pool of about 40 actors, why not cast Blake Clark as Brenner's dad who later becomes president? The president is ashamed of his son who is a simple Nerd Brigade employee. When Galaga, Pong, and Centipede attack, the president would have no choice but to listen to his gamer son. In just two sentences I've created a more plausible plot line than casting Kevin James as president. Pixels may have some serious flaws, but the movie would have been significantly more enjoyable if Kevin James had a smaller role, or perhaps none at all.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I grew up in the 80s arcades and loved the games that are used as characters in this flick. However, I'm not a big fan of Adam Sandler - if you've seen one of his movies, you've seen them all, and if Sandler hadn't used his money and friends to back this production it never would have been made. No, really. There are far better ways to spend 90 minutes of your life. Sandler and crew are not trying very hard; the jokes are largely lame, the characters are trite and no amount of special effects or all-star cameos can save it from being utterly uninspired and dull. If you're a Sandler fan, go on and watch it - you'll see a lot of positive reviews - but if you were expecting anything else, give it a pass or lower your expectations.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a little above average, the special effects are good and the humour, on the whole, is quite good too, but as an aficionado of older games it doesn't do that aspect justice; there are a lot of incorrect references and it doesn't show the fantasy of that particular gaming age in it's full glory. The plot isn't too generic, but isn't exceptionally original. Overall, it isn't worth going to see at the cinema and, I feel, is likely to upset anyone who has a passion for gaming of the 80s.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was supposed to be ridiculous, boyish, puerile, lame, stupid, hackish, dumb-dumb-dumb-fooly-foolish.Surprise! It's all of that! And it's awesome. How else can you make such an outlandish plot work unless you totally sell it. Kevin James becomes the President of the United States?! Doesn't Mark Cuban have something to say about that?Maybe it was the opening scenes that drew me in, giving me a strong sense of nostalgia for those ancient days when quarters seemed like gold doubloons because you could put them into a machine at an arcade and shoot down invaders from outer space. I immediately remembered the infamous Sluggo's arcade where 14-year-old kids chain smoked, tugging on joysticks and slapping buttons while their mothers went shopping at the mall. I remembered that time when I was four and all the kids at the bowling alley were watching me set the record on Spy Hunter and I peed my pants because I didn't want to stop chasing fame.It was worth it, of course.What is a pixel? It's a cube of energy. And it's a weapon. We don't understand it, but we can harness its entirety and make nerds pew- pew it. ""Let the nerds take over.""Adam Sandler is just fine in the movie. I normally despise his hammy overacting, but he reels himself in when he could clearly be a joker daddy with some of the scenes. And Kevin James isn't annoying, either!The movie is actually filled with some pretty biting satire of modern politics, modern video games, social media, mass media, and conspiracy theorists. As a young man watches the alien invaders destroy the Taj Mahal, he quickly films it with his cell phone and just as quickly decides it would be better if he could be in it so he turns to get a selfie video. Who wouldn't?There's plenty of good cameos, campy references to the pop culture of the 1980s, and a pretty sick burn of One Tree Hill. And we get a nice break from the action at a cocktail party that has a lot of funny moments.I thought Peter Dinklage would be cringe-worthy as a mulleted dork, but he actually garners some sympathy by the end. Brian Cox and Sean Bean give nice over-the-top performances along the way, too.I liked Pixels.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

Sandler stars in the movie, with his buddy Kevin James; along with Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Monaghan, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Jane Krakowski. It was directed by Chris Columbus (who's famous for directing such popular hits as 'ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING', 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE', the first two 'HOME ALONE' films and the first two 'HARRY POTTER' movies) and it was written by Tim Herlihy (Sandler's buddy, who also co- wrote 'BILLY MADISON', 'HAPPY GILMORE', 'THE WEDDING SINGER', 'THE WATERBOY' and other hit Sandler flicks) and Timothy Dowling (who also co-wrote the Sandler film 'JUST GO WITH IT'). It was based on the 2010 2- minute French animated short, of the same name, by Patrick Jean. It's not nearly as bad as the reviews make it out to be, or the film's Box Office; it's actually pretty entertaining (for an Adam Sandler movie, at least). The movie takes place sometime in the near future, when aliens have misinterpreted a video feed, from earth, featuring classic 80s 8-bit video games, as a declaration of war. So they attack our planet, in the form of characters from those games. Sandler, James, Dinklage and Gad all play former child video game whizzes, from the 80s, who now need to use their skills to combat the alien invasion. They're given three specific game challenges, in which, upon defeat, they'll lose a life (and someone is abducted). When they lose all three lives, earth will be destroyed. James's character is also the President of the United States (for some bizarre reason). The movie is a fun 80s throwback; if you grew up with these arcade games, you should get a kick out of it. The effects are just OK, and it's not especially funny, but it is entertaining; it's a fun summer popcorn flick, at least. It's much better than Sandler's usual slapstick garbage, especially the stuff he's been putting out lately, and it's nice to see him branching out, and trying different things. This is at least somewhat different; he's never done an action movie before. It's also a good kids' film, and it's not too dumbed-down; especially for an Adam Sandler movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0-wDtevNo","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's as if they throw darts at a rotating board filled with random words stickied on to it, just to see what it lands on so they can come up with these movies. Sandler throws first, dart lands on nerd, he plays the nerd. Sandler buddy number one throws second, dart lands on president, he plays the president. Sandler buddy number two throws last, dart lands on conspiracy theorist loner, he plays the conspiracy theorist loner.Just don't forget to throw in a delightfully cute piece of romantic interest in the mix (Monaghan) so that our nerdy hero gets his trophy at the end of the movie, since any flick that panders to nerds has to have some type of fan service add the chick with swords, long legs and cleavage and voila... you have one more forgettable movie on your Netflix catalogue.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But when it came out, critics tore this film apart for how cringe-worthy and unfunny it is. The critical reviews made me nervous that this is going to flaw badly. But gladly, I wasn't disappointed. Well... maybe a little. What I mean is that, I think Pixels isn't bad at all. Of course, it has some problems, but take my advice, it's better than Grown-Ups and Jack and Jill (I haven't seen those movies but I'm sure they'll be terrible).So, what are the things I like about Pixels? First off, is of course, the concept. The concept is so original and inventive. There are many alien invading movies out there but this movie does the unusual way, using video-game characters to ""pixelate"" everything in their path. The visuals and the action in this movie are quite well-done. It is a bit funny at some parts of the movie. This might be a rare and special praise here but I think it's fast paced.What about the problems? The first problem is that the characters in this movie are kind of weak and forgettable. Before I get to criticism about the story, I want to say like how the plot suggests. Anyway, the problem with the story is that it has some confusing points like there's a Smurf in the movie. Why is the their a Smurf if the invaders only used video-game characters? The biggest problem about the story though is that it's overwhelmingly predictable thanks to the footage of the trailers. Lastly, there are some jokes I didn't really get.Despite having plot confusions and weak characters, Pixels, in my opinion, is an okay summer experience with great visuals, good action and some humour. One thing for certain, you'll probably find this movie better than Grown-Ups and Jack and Jill but don't enjoy this movie too much if you're suffering Sandler's potential.Film Score: 6/10 - Okay","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

The soldiers try to fight back, but are easily defeated, and one soldier is abducted.Brenner is sent to work at the home of Violet Van Patten, a divorcée who lives with her son Matty. Brenner heads to the White House after receiving a call from Cooper. To his surprise, he finds out that Violet is a Lieutenant Colonel. Cooper brings Brenner into the Oval Office to show him the attack in the base. Brenner says that the way the attack was carried out was like in the classic version of the video game Galaga.Later, Brenner drives home when Ludlow suddenly appears inside his van. Ludlow takes Brenner to his home where he says that the aliens are sending creatures with classic video game designs to attack. Ludlow found a message using manipulated footage to explain their plans: The tape was found and seen as a threat; they are using the video games as a challenge. If they win three rounds, they will claim the Earth.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: An enjoyable time-pass film which has some great C.G.I. effects. The action sequences are the highlight of the film. There are some veteran actors in the film: Brian Cox who plays Admiral Porter, Sean Bean as British Corporal Hill and Japanese actor Denis Akiyama who plays Toru Iwatani, the creator of Pac-Man. Dan Ackroyd makes a cameo appearance as the Arcade Game World Championship M.C.Kevin James, star of sitcom The King of Queens plays William Cooper, the President of the United States. Josh Gad gives an excellent performance as Ludlow Lamonsoff, a conspiracy-theory-obsessed, genius with poor social skills.Directed by veteran director Chris Columbus who is known for directing such movies as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) and for writing movies such as Gremlins (1984) and The Goonies (1985).Adam Sandler is not a great favorite of mine, but his acting is bearable here. He sticks to the lines given to him and does not overdo the sarcasm he is known for. Complementing him is Kevin James who gives a reserved performance. In every Adam Sandler movie, there's a hot chick opposite him. In this one it's Michelle Monaghan who plays a divorcée single mom Violet van Patten. Violet also works for military as a weapons developer. Ashley Benson is cast as eye candy in the role of Lady Lisa, a beautiful warrior from the fictional 1982 video game Dojo Quest.Overall the film cannot be considered a work of serious film-making. It will appeal to casual film goers.More ""Hero Saves The Day Films"": Superman(1978), Commando(1985), Die Hard(1988), Army of Darkness(1992), Last Action Hero(1993).List of arcade video games: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arcade_video_gamesThank you for taking the time to read my review.

"5","/10","A Nostalgic Joyride with Pixels of Fun but Stumbles in the High Score of Storytelling.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9547734/?ref_=tt_urv","Mysterygeneration","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104853183/?ref_=tt_urv","7 January 2024","Pixels, with its concept of classic video game characters attacking Earth, promises a nostalgic and entertaining ride, especially for those who grew up with arcade games. The visual effects capture the essence of beloved pixelated characters in a way that sparks a sense of nostalgia. The action sequences, featuring giant versions of iconic video game foes, are visually engaging and provide some moments of excitement. The humor, driven by Adam Sandler and his comedic ensemble, delivers occasional laughs, making it an amusing watch for fans of the actors and the era of classic video games.However, Pixels struggles to sustain its initial charm, falling victim to a thin and formulaic plot that relies heavily on juvenile humor. The narrative feels rushed, with character development taking a back seat to the spectacle of pixelated chaos. While the concept has potential, the execution misses the opportunity to explore the deeper implications of video game nostalgia and falls into the trap of predictable storytelling. Despite the fun nods to classic gaming, Pixels ultimately becomes a missed opportunity to fully capitalize on its unique premise, leaving audiences with a mixed bag of enjoyable moments and unfulfilled potential.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is a homage/cash in on arcade gamers sweet memories. When NASA send a message into space containing examples of 80's pop culture in hope of contacting alien life, the aliens that discover it mistake the message as a declaration of war. They retaliate by sending real life video game icons of old (Pac-Man, Centipede, Tetris, Pong, Galaga etc.) to destroy the world. When the military fail, the president has no choice but to call in his nerdy friends of old to use their gaming know how to defeat the alien forces.The premise of the movie is pretty unique, and actually pretty good. The plot however, leaves little to be desired. I won't spoil it here, but it is anything but impressive. The video game theme actually saves the movie, and the jokes, while dull and unoriginal for the most part, do make you laugh from time to time. The CGI, is just CGI but the visual style with the pixelated effect is very unique and makes the movie way more enjoyable to watch! The action sequences are well directed and better yet actually follow the arcade game rules! The biggest pro of the film is that it is true to its source material. When you fight the games, you fight by the rules. Video game cheat codes even play a pivotal role in the plot, which is pretty funOverall, Pixels is not an objectively good movie by any stretch of the imagination, with predictable comedy, sub-par plot and cliché characters. However, the premise saves the film from falling flat on its face. The video game sequences are what you are paying to see and when they happen, yeah, they're bloody great, and these scenes bring the funniest moments to the movie for the most part! Top it off with a few decent quips and Peter Dinklage playing the only fun character and you've got a film that isn't great, but is fun enough for arcade gamers to enjoy. You'll be awash in a sea of nostalgia!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Another Weak Sandler Film, Just With a Bigger Effects Budget","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3293299/?ref_=tt_urv","rcolgan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20595945/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2015","Video games really don't have a good reputation when it comes to having film adaptations. Sure we have a few good one's like Wreck it Wralph or Scott Pilgrim, but for the most part they seem to go down the same route as the Super Mario Bros movie where the film loses all the charm that made the game enjoyable to begin with. Part of the reason for this is they always seem to be put into dreadful hands. This time those dreadful hands are Happy Madison Productions, Sandler's film studio that have been producing his cinematic turds for 15 years now. And once again they have produced another insulting comedy, lacking any real charm and being light on laughs.The plot unfolds because back in the 80's NASA sent several video games in to space to communicate to extraterrestrials. But their message of peace was misinterpreted as a declaration of war and the aliens send several video game characters to attack the earth. Thus President Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood friend and gaming champion Brenner (Adam Sandler) to fight off the alien invasion.Right away we've really got to suspend disbelief to accept the plot. Not just because of having to accept the poorly explained justification of why the aliens are attacking as video games, but also buying Kevin James as president of the USA. It's never explained how he became President, but unless Donald Trump was the only other candidate there's no way he could've gotten voted into the position. Especially considering he plays the same annoying character he always does of the dumb guy who does nothing but hang out with Adam Sandlers character. None of the other characters are much better. Sandler has as much charisma as a plank of wood. Josh Gad's performance as the nerdy friend is annoying from the start. The only one who gets even a chuckle is Dinklage as the over the top douchey rival, but even that gets worn out quickly. Also just like all Sandler productions we get a lot of offensive stereotypes. This time the focus is on geek stereotypes, like gamers are antisocial weirdo's who have no lives and live in their mothers basement. Albeit this isn't the most offensive stereotype, but it's still insulting one of the film's biggest audiences. Besides this there are other typical offensive representations we see in all Sandler movies, like women being nothing more than eye candy. In fact there are only two female characters in lead roles. The first is Michelle Monaghan who's in the film only to give Sandlers character somebody to flirt with. The other is Ashley Benson who plays one of the video game characters who comes to life, who not only doesn't get a single line of dialogue in the film but also ends up being a literal trophy for one of the characters. Having some of gaming's most recognisable icons, you'd really think the film would actually do something good with them. But it doesn't. The gaming characters will just attack Sandler and co. only for the humans to fight back and that's it. It never tries to actually make any jokes with these characters, but instead does the same thing as a film like Disaster Movie where it will try to get a laugh by just naming something popular. The only video game icon they do anything else with is Q*bert, who is one of their trophies to help them. But all they have him do is typical annoying Sandler humour like watching Q*bert wet himself with pixels and some weak slapstick.Although at least the gaming icons they use actually look good. It's not like the Mario Bro's Movie where Goomba's looked like a pear on the body of Frankenstein and instead the 3d CGI models maintain the charm of the original designs. But to me this makes the film even worse than typical Sandler comedies because it ends up feeling like such wasted potential. Had a better production been given the chance to use these characters, we might have got a charming homage to video games. But instead we got a typical Sandler comedy, just as unfunny as always but with a bigger effects budget.","11 out of 32 found this helpful.

I'll have you know, the audience I was with knew what they came for. They consistently laughed at the comedy, was dazzled by the visual effects, and clapped their hands at certain parts whether a joke or a visual effect was done well. The jokes are hilarious- whether it be visual or verbal. If you see this film, screen the 3D version- you won't be disappointed. A lot of the action and destruction scenes are wonderfully done- CGI or not. Not a lot of ""bodily functions"" or ""raunchy"" humor- and when it does crack a gross-out joke, it's actually funny!! Great callbacks to 80s pop culture. Stay for the credits also- it's a very cool pix-elated sequence that sums up the events of the picture. Don't believe the haters who probably don't have a good sense of humor or imagination- go with your friends and/or family, get a bucket of popcorn, relax and enjoy the show!! I have nothing to fault about this film, and I'm not going to feel sorry for that statement.","76 out of 145 found this helpful.

My expectations were so abysmally low that I felt compelled to watch a few minutes to satisfy my curiosity as to what they could possibly have been thinking. While it falls short of what I would consider a good movie that I would want to watch again to catch any subtle nuances, it has a few funny moments, the CGI animation is top-notch and it has a couple of amusing cameos. The film is infantile, schmaltzy and corny. Sandler's Brenner doesn't seem to grow, mature or develop much. Having risen to heroic stature to save humanity, he seems content to return to his life of mediocrity. We are left with a puerile fantasy fulfillment story with no moral that seems instead to pander to the self-indulgent mentality of adolescent video game addicts. As with many comedies, the romantic B stories also fail to rise above the level of adolescent wish fulfillment. The aliens seem contrived and inconsistent. They are smart enough to master intergalactic travel, but foolish enough to interpret a sort of travelogue film as a declaration of war. Q*bert indicates they were a happy planet until they received the message from earth, but they claim to have already destroyed many planets. When we do catch a glimpse of the aliens, in the guise of Q*bert, Max Headroom or Lady Lisa, they either join forces with the arcaders or inexplicably give them a second chance. ""12 Rounds,"" ""Predator,"" ""Saw"" and dozens of other films have antagonists who manage to engage the protagonist in twisted games much more convincingly. The movie goes to considerable lengths to make its characters unique, complex and multi-dimensional, but the aliens are generic 1950s B- movie aliens with twenty-first century weaponry. In the end, their departure is as unmotivated as their journey to our galaxy. We should also have seen Sinnamon. Her presence could have amped the stakes in the B story and provided fodder for jokes. The film is much better than I would have expected and has a few laugh-out-loud moments but never rises above the level of mindless entertainment.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

A few years later,aliens looking like the arcade games declare the war against the USA...I think that this movie is very hilarious and it is the best recipe to have a good time with your family. The movie is a pearl for the passionate about retro gaming because it brings back many memories. The story is kind of absurd and totally assumed, it is not a complex or spiritual movie just a crazy movie about aliens and games. The cast is not perfect, Adam Sandler is the main character but, it is eventually the only good comedy with him. The special effects are funny and create an impress of reality through the virtual world.Personally, I recommend this comedy if you want two hours of laughing.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is one of my favorites from Adam Sandler. It felt like a birthday present from Adam Sandler because it came out the day after my birthday but I took advantage of the early 7:00 showings and I laughed throughout the entire movie. Adam Sandler was funny as usual but was eventually outshined by Josh Gad. I liked Kevin James as the President. A lot of people thought he was a poor choice but I thought it worked for this movie. Michelle Monaghan was great. I don't think Peter Dinklage was the best thing about the movie but he was good. I really liked the presence of Brian Cox but I wish there was more of him. I liked the fact that Sean Bean was in it but I don't care for the accent he used. I was surprised that Ashley Benson had no dialogue but she's pretty and I thought her character was pretty cool. I honestly think this and Pearl Harbor are some of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. I don't entirely get why people hate this movie because it has a great concept. It's like people think a movie's automatically bad because Adam Sandler's involved. He has talent. Sure he plays the same character in almost every movie he's in but if you're like me you can set that aside and enjoy his movies. I'm not saying all Adam Sandler movies are great but I enjoy most of them. Why was this the movie that had people saying that Adam Sandler has to quit movies? This movie is an Academy Award winner compared to what I've seen of Jack and Jill. It makes me sad that after this movie he basically started acting in Netflix movies. I am glad that The Meyerowitz Stories is getting a limited release in theaters but I do hope Adam Sandler comes back. This movie is not without its problems. I don't like how it just jumps into the some of the action sequences without any set up and it would have been nice if there could have been more 80s songs like Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins. I also wish (as I said before) that Brian Cox appeared in the final scene congratulating the arcaders on their victory and apologizing for doubting them. Maybe the movie would have been more successful if it had actors like Robert Downey Jr but it's great for what it is and I enjoy this movie..","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Being born in 1987, I wasn't around long enough to see the classic arcade where games like Pac-Man, Q*bert, and Donkey Kong all created a new form of escapism for the youth. Most people weren't too sure what direction these games would go in. No one knew whether they would evolve into something bigger or if they were a fifteen-minute fad. When companies like Nintendo and Sega brought the games home, it was set that these games were here to stay. When Sony and Microsoft connected these games to the Internet, it seemed that the whole world was playing!In a way, most modern games have become like major motion pictures. I say this as a negative as while many games have long cut scenes that establish a full story, much of the action is with how well you can react and push a button rather then a true challenge. Exceptions include Minecraft and World of Warcraft as your poised to create a character and evolve him like most role-playing games or Modern Warfare and Mario Kart, which relies on playability between other players. A blast from the past puts the world on edge in the latest comedy, Pixels. In 1982, young Sam and Will go to a video game championship where Sam does well as a Pac-Man champion, but looses on Donkey Kong from the egocentric Eddie Plant. The event was recorded and placed in a time capsule that was sent into space, hoping that I would reach intelligent life.Cut to 2015 where Sam (played by Adam Sandler) is working as a home theater installer and Will (played by Kevin James) is now the president of the United States. Both seem board with their lives and hope for more.Aliens attack an army base in Guam that seem to turn everything they touch into pixelated forms. The White House examines the creatures to see that they resemble the characters from Galaga. It seems that the aliens misinterpreted the video games as a declaration of war and are attacking the Earth using those games. Will calls Sam to discuss how to defeat these aliens with his arcade skill. They get Eddie (played by Peter Dinklage) out of jail to join the team to fight They go to London to fight Centipede and New York to fight Pac-Man, yet these aliens seem bent on destroying the world.The idea of Pixels is a good one; a great one that could have been the blockbuster comedy that might have reached Ghostbusters levels. But the big problem starts right at the beginning; you see the Happy Madison Productions logo. This company seems to exist to only give comedian Adam Sandler as much work as possible while putting in as little effort for the comedy as possible. I was hoping that director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter) might spark Sandler into stepping up his comedy. IT DOESN'T!Adam Sandler not only plays the same obnoxious man-child he's been playing for the past ten years, but looks depressed through out the entirety of Pixels. Kevin James adds little to nothing, Peter Dinklage is insultingly wasted (though he gets a few laughs), and the rest of the cast serves to buffer Sandler. Story wise, the pixelated characters attack various cities, but I don't recall one person being hurt. With that, Pixels doesn't seem to care if the humans lived or died. Nothing is at stake and what's gained are women which I find sexist. Worst of all, this is a family movie that is speaking to a kid audience who have no idea who Pac-man or Q*bert are. Why even go after the children when they could have gotten an easy adult audience?I'll give this two ""Game Over"" screens out of ten. I'm declaring Game Over for Adam Sandler who doesn't seem to care about genuine comedy or the usage of a funny idea for a movie. This is a game that's not worth anyone's quarters!","12 out of 38 found this helpful.

The idea was cute, but Adam Sandler's character was unnecessarily vulgar as usual, talking to a female character that was an unrealistic bimbo and everything was pretty predictable, so it wasn't my cup of tea... but there is something worse...There is no way around this: this movie induced a full-on panic attack in my girlfriend. We were just watching it to pass the time, but at first she was bored, then she was trying really hard to not watch it, playing games on her phone, etc, then I had to turn the movie off, shortly after the PacMan scene, because she asked me to. I later asked her about it, and she told me it was triggering her anxiety.You see, my girlfriend has irregular anxiety about existential dread: We don't really know what happens in the afterlife, and she is incredibly worried that it would be just boredom and nothingness, or maybe there is something happening there, but it is so uninteresting that it makes you wish that even it was not happening, as you are trapped there in bored purgatory for all of eternity.This movie gave my girlfriend a panic attack, because it reminded her of her greatest fear that she could be trapped in boredom for all of eternity.2/10 the animation was cute","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Ludlow Lamonsoff is a weird nerd with his grandmother. Sam loses to Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant in the final game. A tape of the event is sent into space as a message to aliens. In the present day, Cooper (Kevin James) is the ridiculed President of United States. Brenner (Adam Sandler) is still his best friend but he's in a dead-end job. He falls for Violet (Michelle Monaghan) who turns out to be a Lieutenant Colonel in weapons development. Aliens mistake the tape as a challenge and send light-based weapons in the form of the arcade game characters. Ludlow (Josh Gad) has turned into a conspiracy theorist and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) is in prison. The group has to use their gaming skills to defend the planet in a death match.There is a lot of hate for Adam Sandler. This is not that horrible but he wasted a great opportunity. I love this concept. The movie works great during the battle scenes. It's fun action with loads of 80s recalls. When the action stops, the movie gets really rocky. Sandler continues to have trouble being likable. He keeps playing an annoying douche although he's not as bad as some of his recent outings. He has lost his boyish fun charms of his early movies. His romance with Monaghan has its ups and downs. Kevin James starts out well with a bunch of girl scouts making fun of him. The problem is that he takes his cue from Sandler and overdoes it. Josh Gad needs to dial back the creepiness one level. Being obsessed with a pixel character is creepy although making her Ashley Benson helps a lot. Peter Dinklage is pushing too hard. In general, Chris Columbus has every character pushing too hard. They don't need to and it screws up an otherwise fun comedic action thriller.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I gave ""Pixels"" a try for two reasons: 1.) I loved those 8 bit games the movie is based on and 2.) The trailers looked good.If we were to grade this movie on a curve (i.e. compare it to the Sandler movies of the last 10 years) then this would be at least a B+. If we were to grade it on its own merit, then I'm thinking more like a C. Acting was OK (he's long stop being funny), story was a bit flat and CGI/special effects were about what I expected. Nothing ground-breaking and nothing embarrassingly bad. If Sandler could just improve upon this movie; just build upon the successes of this movie and add more non-stale jokes, more range of actors than himself and his friends and something new then he may be able to recapture the success of old.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There, I said it. Why it has an 18% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me. What were they expecting for a family-friendly summer sci-fi/comedy based on '80s video games? Ghostbusters Go Back to the Future? Look, we all know Adam Sandler movies are fodder for the critics. I, myself, am not a fan of most of them (though his newer Netflix murder mystery comedies are actually pretty good). But I think Pixels delivered what it promised: good, clean fun with a high-tech twist on nostalgia. I'll break it down here:Writing: not hysterically funny but humorous throughout with a few big laughs.Cast: all good choices except Kevin James as the president. Sorry, but even as a buffoon of a leader, Kevin isn't the right fit. Maybe Dan Ackroyd should have had that part instead of the small Emcee part in the beginning.Effects: good job of turning 2D video game characters into destructible 3D voxels. The Donkey Kong scene is especially impressive.Cinematography: a very good job of shooting for a ton of on-screen characters that were not really there. Not an easy task.Directing: Chris Columbus does an admirable job tying reality to CGI, also not easy to pull off.Summary: Ignore all the negativity. Don't overthink it and you'll enjoy it.7/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie made me angry at how bad it was and it is incredible to think it was given to us by the same director of the first two Potter movies, which are by all means, in my opinion, two gems.Pixels is the nail in the coffin for any redemption Adam Sandler could have possibly had at this point in his career. I mean, I get it when you're not caring with your stupid hang out movies like Grown Ups, where the whole point is for you to have a paid vacation with your friends, but this? You manage to screw up a film that has this potential? How the hell do you do that?! Characters that are boring, underdeveloped, uninteresting thrown into situations that are clichéd to the point of exhaustion. The whole set up was probably directed by a machine. The further it goes on the further the characters get boring and so does everything around them. There were clue moments in this movie of action that should have been the climax moment were I was close to falling asleep. I cannot stress it enough: this film is BORING! Yet it gets worse: it isn't even funny! I laughed exactly zero times, maybe, maybe I smiled twice. The lengths to which the jokes are stupid, unremarkable, disgustingly delivered is baffling. I am not stupid Adam you know mother effer! I want to be treated nicely and respected when I go to the theater, instead you serve me with insults to my intelligence and a performance that is the pinnacle of you cashing it in. The script is a lazy mess probably put together in a weekend and is more misogynistic than some 40s movies, wow you truly found a way for people to hate you guys! Fortunately, for the love of god, the film has Peter Dinklage in a few scenes where he shows great comedic timing. Moreover Cubert steals any show that there ever was to steal and is legitimately a good part of the film. Finally, as much as I was about to collapse sleeping once every five minutes, the visual effects kept coming back and keeping me awake, because even if they weren't interesting in the story, they did stand out as truly amazing special effects, some of the best I've seen recently and there wasn't a single time I could make them out to be CGI.That isn't enough to save a disaster of a film, if you were on the edge of deciding whether to see this or not I'l tell you: don't go give your money to Sandler he doesn't deserve it, nor does Sony and their recent line of work of which everything wrong with shines here.","9 out of 29 found this helpful.

Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was interesting, mysterious and innovative because there aren't any other movies similar to this one. The storyline was well-written, well-explained and it's concept was something innovative. Also, the characters were interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. The casting of the movie was nice and their performances were descent. Gladly, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of epic fight scenes. Moreover, the cinematography and the CGI effects were both amazing and very well edited. The opening scene of the movie was kinda unexpected, very promising and the 80's were very well portrayed. The ending scene was definitely predictable, however it was still enjoyable and adventurous. Overall, ""Pixels"" was a nice fantasy/action film, full of fight scenes, excellent graphics and I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Last but not least, that movie definitely deserves a sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I watched it in the theatre and it was way better than people said.Pixels is a good time and funny and it's better than people say. It has good jokes at times that. Are you laugh. It is a Adam Sandler film but it also is his best since the 90s. This film had great effects for games that 80s game will love to see. Peter Dinklage as the culling is great he is great in this film. And Kevin James as the president is random but still funny to see him fighting these pixels. The film has a lot of references adults will pays those games. If you love games from that time you will have a good tie.

Walking into the cinema... I am trying to think of something that makes me want to see this film. Nope, I cannot seem to find anything.Overall Rating: 1 starIn 1982, the world was was enjoying the new arcade games of Pac-Man, Galaga, Centipede and Donkey Kong. Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler) and Will ""Chewy"" Cooper (Kevin James) lived for playing the latest arcade game and finding opportunities to show off their gaming skills. They decide to show off their talents at the World Video Game Championships where they come in contact with Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) and Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant (Peter Dinklage). During the competition they show their knack for seeing patterns in the games and their joy stick dexterity. At the same time in human history, NASA sent off a probe into space to attempt to connect with intelligent life in outer space. In this probe they sent glimpses into the 80's culture of our world which included components of these iconic video games. Fast forward to 2015, the lives of this band of nerdy brothers have gone down different paths. Sam is an installation technician and Will has become the President of the United States. Even though they are still close friends, their life responsibilities carry different levels of significance, until they are drawn back together when aliens attack the earth. The explanation for the attack is that the extra-terrestrials received the 1982 message from NASA and saw it as declaration of war on their planet. Their response to this unintentional call to arms is to send the classic video games to attack earth as pixelated weapons. Sam and Will have to re-connect with their former video game competitors and work with the world armed forces to fight off the nostalgic alien invasion. Similar to the life cycle in the video games, the team is given three attempts by the space invaders to apply their former gaming skills and to discover the answers to saving the world from an Atari- inspired annihilation. Pixels, as a concept, is refreshingly original and has the potential to serve as a digital bridge between multiple generations. The other potential hope for this film is director Chris Columbus at the helm, he has produced some great family films throughout his career. This hope was for Columbus to take this convoluted storyline, which has the potential to go the way of fun and nostalgic hilarity or he could produce a mess of a film with catastrophic proportions, and make a great family comedy. Unfortunately, Pixels falls into the latter category as a mess. Columbus attempts to deliver a 1980's retro style film with ridiculous characters and situations with a modern computer-generated spin, but fails to deliver. This failure has to do with the inclusion of Adam Sandler and Kevin James as the lead characters. At this stage in their acting careers, they seem unable to deliver original comedic performances. Their roles are as predictable as the patterns in the old video games. They walk through their performances in this film with little enthusiasm and with a reliance on dated comedic styles that have worn out their welcome. Josh Gad provides the potential for originality, but he falls into the trap of overacting which attempts to compensate for Sandler and James' weak performances. Also, the only reasonable explanation for Peter Dinklage and Michelle Monaghan being part of this project was to potentially procure a comedy on their resume. Unfortunately, they are poorly cast in parts that any credible actor should have given a miss. If all of these components were not bad enough, the truly frustrating thing about Pixels is not in the weak story line or the poor performances, but the fact that this is promoted as a family film. The humour and innuendo is not funny and is not appropriate for children. The marketing conveys that this film should be accessible for any generation to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon, but what happens is the potential for embarrassing conversations with small children on a multitude of levels. For example, why Eddie Plant is going to the White House's Lincoln bedroom with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams or the stalker-type mentality of the Ludlow character. So much of the film was creepy to experience as an adult, much less trying to explain it to children. This review should not be misconstrued as prudish, but more of holding the marketing team to account for the disservice to families. In the concept stages, Pixels may have had the potential to be a fun adventure for people who grew up in the 80's and potentially for a new generation, too. In the end, it proves to be an embarrassment for those linked to this production and for anyone who might go to see it. Leaving the cinema... Avoid the potential awkward conversations with your children and give Pixels a miss. It is one of the rare films that I would not recommend for any audience. Do not be fooled, it is not funny or a family film. Game Over. Bigger questions: 1. Do we all have a role in this life? (Proverbs 16:9, Romans 8:28) 2. What is the Bible's view on war? (Ecclesiastes 3:8, Matthew 26:52) 3. Why do people still go to Adam Sandler and Kevin James films?

I must confess that I once was a huge Adam Sandler fan and watched everything he did from his Billy Madison days up to Jack and Jill in 2011 (with Chuck and Larry being the only exception, which somehow I miraculously missed). As a young teen I found his movies hilarious, but as I grew older his schtick got repetitive and I somehow decided to give up on him. I hadn't seen another film starring Sandler since Jack and Jill, but decided to give this one a try for nostalgic sake and because Columbus's films usually appealed to me despite his films being overly sentimental at times. It didn't hurt that Peter Dinklage was also starring in this film since I love what he does (his short scene in Elf is one of my favorites and he is awesome in Game of Thrones). All these factors managed to convince me to watch Pixels despite my low expectations and I honestly got what I was expecting. It's as if Adam Sandler directs all his comedies because they are so similar in tone despite never having directed, but I guess the directors always let him improvise and he ends up making the same jokes in every movie. The only positive feedback I'll give Pixels is that it did manage to engage with the younger audiences; my ten year old brother had a blast, so it might make some money at the box office. Based on Patrick Jean's own screenplay for a short film he made in 2010 (which seems far more appealing to me), this feature film opens in the 80's with a group of kids who grew up loving arcade games. Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) is so good at predicting these game patterns that he signs up to compete in an arcade national championship. His closest friend, Cooper (Jared Riley), is there cheering for him and he truly believes Brenner is destined for great things in life. During the tournament they also befriend a young boy named Ludlow (Jacob Shinder) who is obsessed with a cyber game character named Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson). Unfortunately, Brenner is defeated by Eddie (Andrew Bambridge), a loud mouthed arcade lover who goes by the nickname of fire blaster. The film then jumps to the present where we discover Brenner (Adam Sandler) hasn't really accomplished anything in life. He installs technical equipment for a company called Nerd. Cooper (Kevin James) however has become the President of the nation. Nerd sends Brenner to Violet's (Michelle Monaghan) home to install the latest gadgets for her young son Matty (Matt Lintz). Brenner and Violet have a small moment, but when he tries to lean in and kiss her things get ugly between them. Right after that awkward moment Brenner receives a call from Cooper about an alien attack on Earth (and so does Violet who is then revealed to be a Lieutenant). Apparently these aliens have attacked using the arcade game format created through pixels, and the only way to defeat them is similar to the way they played the game. Brenner enlists the help of Ludlow (Josh Gad) and his archenemy Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to try to defeat these alien invaders and save the Earth.As ridiculous or appealing as the premise sounds (depending on whether or not you're nostalgic over these classic arcade games) the greatest problem with Pixels is that its incredibly hard to believe some of the relationships between these characters. The first time Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan's characters meet, the dialogue between them is so phony and forced that it makes it impossible to relate to. That scene was probably one of the worst I've seen all year. Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Brian Cox can be funny people, but they play the same characters they've been playing in recent years. Dinklage's Fire Blaster seems to be either hit or miss for some people, and I actually found his character to be the funniest in the movie. No one here is actually trying hard and the film is proof of that, but audiences that are simply looking to escape for a couple of hours might find it amusing. I still don't know what Jane Krakowski was doing in this film since her character isn't given anything to do despite her comedic talents. She should've been used more. Pixels is recycled Sandler material that will only appeal to hardcore 80's nostalgic gamers and young kids who enjoy pretty much any adventure. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","10 out of 35 found this helpful.

I went in with medium expectations, and I was blown away. Sure, it was silly, but it is a comedy, not an Oscar-winning drama. The visual effects were very intriguing, something I had not seen before in a movie. I think all of the actors gave fantastic performances, yes, even Adam Sandler, and the full theater I was in was laughing constantly. Most importantly, I left the theater feeling better than I did going in there. I left this movie with a warm feeling, and a smile that would not leave my face. This film is heartwarming fun for the whole family, and plenty of nostalgia for fans of the 80s. Don't listen to the critics! Go see this movie and form your own opinion! Definitely Adam Sandler's best movie in a long time. I cannot recommend this movie enough! If you want to have a great time on a hot summer day, go see it!","102 out of 204 found this helpful.

This movie is a money maker, Adam Sandler picked something that is loved by almost every parent, teenagers and some children, Arcade games, to squeeze your wallets and beg for money. The characters are nothing new, Adam Sandler plays himself in this movie, just like every other actor, Peter Dinklage is the only that tries to make a new character but still fails.Yes, the awesome arcade characters are here, and that's the only thing this movie's good for, but they are in the movie for 25 minutes! I went to see Pixels waiting for a good story with some decent jokes or just some time to watch what they did with these legendary characters, and they fail.The jokes are awful, i only laughed once or twice and it was because of the plot holes of this story, did they watch this when they were done shooting? This is a summer blockbuster that will be forgotten very soon without any cool or memorable scenes. And basically the directors just waste our time with an Adam Sandler's horrible romance when we could have had awesome action, boss battles, Space invaders sky battle or something! this movie should be called ""Adam Sandler and some games"". And don't try to understand some parts of the movie, you wont get answers of what the hell just happened, maybe they though a ""comedy"" shouldn't have a story at all and they put this excuse to make some money.Nintendo tried to redeem itself from the horrible ""Super Mario Bros."" but now they have 2 movies not worth watching or even remembering. This movie is a straight 3/10 not recommended, don't waste your money on it, you should watch it later when it's free just to see how bad it is and why Adam Sandler can't make good movies like he used to.","7 out of 23 found this helpful.

A bit simple, yes, but still a fist full of entertainment.The actors do a great job, the fact that Mr.Iwatani (creator of Puck Man) participates as a hardware tech in the arcade at the beginning, is thrilling. The CGI is very well made and representation of the game characters was flawless in spite of that several famous elements from the 80's were missing.An interesting detail that sadly put me off already at the beginning of the film as we're back in the 80's browsing an arcade, - the monitors in all game cabinets are of flat screen type!? This is painfully obvious given that flat screens weren't around till at least 15 years later. All games then used standard CRT displays. In later scenes there were some CRT televisions and old CRT computer monitors shown.Personally I would have liked more of the classic games involved in the invasion. Where was Gorf, Moon Patrol, Ghosts n Goblins and several other of the time's famous characters? Donkey Kong, which by the way was a tad too generously promoted, is and always will be a great game, but as the supreme ruling force of the alien invaders, the monkey is just out of its place. Why not have the Gorf mother ship pose as the ultimate threat?Even though the film manages to deliver plenty of game nostalgia, as well as hang on to its objective as 'pixels VS humans', I can only give it a mediocre score. Because of its lack of research in the area of video game history, where it should, and could do much better. ""Pacman and Donkey Kong"" are of course two of the most famous games ever created, but how about a 'giant kung-fu master' walking down the street, kicking and beating buildings and vehicles? Or the Moon Patrol rover shooting down airplanes? And what about Scramble? I noticed the Konami logo on a few occasions, but where were the games? So much I missed in this film, yet I still enjoyed it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's simply aliens that attack the Earth, and they're giant older video game characters who are doing it. The visuals are incredibly stunning and the action scenes play well with each of the classic arcade games and their rules (Donkey Kong, Centipede, Pac-Man, etc.). In an overall sense, I'm not too terribly surprised that this movie hit a down low. I think it would have been a little more interesting if they maybe included a little more of a variety of certain game moments like they had with the major attack scenes. The overall script maybe wasn't all-out pleasing or as entertaining with some of the outside jokes a little dry, but it still was pretty fun and engaging especially if you grew up with these kinds of video games. Good or bad, it was certainly a laugh riot. With Sandler, it's almost always funny.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While, I'm sure, a nice guy I just can not get behind his comedy style of poop and pee jokes with some sexual references. So when I heard that good ol' Adam and his regular crew of Kevin James (Paul Blart), Peter Dinklige (of Game of Thrones fame) and Josh Gad (Olaf from 'Frozen') were creating a Video Game based film I was suckered in to checking it out. The plot is Video Games take over, not going to make the 'Futurama' comparison. Of course though, unless you saw the trailer you probably wouldn't know WHY the aliens take over. Sadly they only have a few lines in the script that explain why they attack. Now this isn't really a problem if you saw the trailers, but if you are going into this blind viewers may be confused. As it goes on it just becomes a big pile of clichés that does make way for some interesting battles and references but really doesn't stick. I was surprised when I started laughing a bit. Not often (yes there is the obligatory Happy Madison touch with a few pee, poo and sex jokes) but enough to make myself happy. Something about Adam's cocky personality in this that really makes most of his character jabs something to laugh at. Good enough but could have been better. Now facts. They got a few video game facts wrong. Firstly, I won't spoil it here, but once you see it you will realize the problem especially since these are arcade games. Additionally according to the plot they sent the space thing in 1983 or so. Mario (8-bit NES sprite) didn't exist and in the background during one of the battles he is there. Also, Donkey Kong didn't have set stages like shown in the intro so that's wrong. And there are many other little errors but I won't waste your time here. And the Sony product placements? Don't get me started on that! Overall I am shocked at the rating. Even me, the Happy Madison Production hating self enjoyed this movie more then I thought. Will I watch it again? Maybe. Will I buy it on DVD? No. Do I regret watching it? No. You done good Adam Sandler. Just next time don't make Kevin James president and make yourself a hip gamer.

Lets get this out of the way... Adam Sandler has, in my view, the potential to be a great actor... ...That said, PIXELS is NOT him showing that he has that potential - Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler!!! If you have seen any Sandler movie before, you know exactly what you are going to get...And alongside him are all his old SNL Buddies which does not help people who review this movie as its all been done before.Kevin James as President Cooper should rightly get the WORST casting role... But actually he is not so bad.That Credit has to go to Peter Dinklage, Which is actually rather unfair - Dinklage acts brilliantly! Its just his character is so over the top and poorly written... And in all honesty, had ANYONE ELSE been given his role - They would have failed miserably...Much as his character is really poor... He manages to save it and you actually end up liking the piece of (Censored!)So, Yeah! The film is a typical Sandler-Fest... But honestly, its not as bad as many reviewers are making out.Yes there are some damn serious plot-holes... People like to argue about the Death Star Exhaust Port but trust me that has nothing on this film!!! (And if you still think that the Death Star Exhaust Port is a Plot Hole in Star Wars - Look for Dorkly on YouTube and see why its not!!!)Effects are great, the story is kind of fun, and it has some great elements of humour...But not a film for the kids... Sorry! It may look all harmless and fun but some of the content is pretty near the knuckle at times, so unless you are OK with your kids swearing - Give it a miss!Its not Sandlers greatest film ever... But more enjoyable than many give it credit for.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

That's not where the movie's potential lies. The result is still a mediocre kid-in-an-adult-body representation of Sandler's expression. The addition of historical video game characters gives it a bit of a nostalgic experience that could (and should) have been investigated further. By adding Peter Dinklage and his pivotal character to the cast, ""Pixels"" was boosted to an acceptable level which makes it enjoyable for small children, or the nerds who enjoy the backgrounds of the various details. Unfortunately, these backgrounds would have made the movie a good watch if they were given a more prominent position in the foreground, to hide the lacklustre interaction between the main characters. The idea and resources were all there, but in the end the sum of the parts didn't add up to a whole movie.CGI was fine, entertaining, but ""lame"". ""Pixels"" felt like Elijah Wood's reaction to the arcade game Marty McFly discovers in ""Back to the Future II"". Luckily we don't need our hands to watch ""Pixels"".In the end, it's worth a watch, but for those who don't understand the backgrounds and details, it'll be nothing more than an inflight entertainment second choice.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In a similar plot to the Last Star Fighter, the main character Sam, after being nothing else but good at video games all his miserable life, somehow becomes the only man on Earth with the skill to defeat an alien invasion in the form of arcade classics (If the alien invasion was in the form of Sonic the Hedgehog, best believe I'm your guy).That sounds like a good idea, but let's face it, it's been a long time since Sandler's Joe Schmo routine has been that appealing. I'm sure he had fun on the set playing out a full scale level of Donkey Kong, but it was not fun to watch at all. I will say the best video game reenactment in the film was when they went up against Pac Man, that was cool, but all the other pixel battles just looked lame.Sandler's good at surrounding himself with friends he likes to work with, like the charming Kevin James who I loved as the U.S President and best friend to Sam. Peter Dinklage was also hilarious as Billy Mitchell another middle age man who reached his peak after becoming Donkey Kong champ.I think I feel most sorry for Chris Columbus, he's a pretty good director but he could not turn the short film this is based on (and I'm sure is far better) into something worth sitting through.The movie was good for a few chuckles and it was cool seeing some of my favorite old school game ions back in 8-bit form, but the movie falls to the rock bottom of being anything at all. Game over.","7 out of 27 found this helpful.

The viewers who grew up in the 80s and 90s would most likely agree. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Space invaders. All these arcade games just flash by you. The arcade too is named ""Electric Games"". The promise the movie showed during the starting few minutes is immediately lost. We see President Cooper (played by Kevin James) and Brenner (by Adam Sandler) involved in silly discussions. It may have been done to show the president as a very friendly person but what it does is shows him as a silly guy you would meet on the streets. President Cooper has turned the White House into more like a public picnic area.Violet (by Michelle Monahagan) is simply splendid in her opening scene. The makers of the movie could have given Violet more importance and more screen time. She is good in bits and pieces when she appears. The same with Eddy (by Peter Dinklage). Eddy just doesn't stand out. His flamboyance and flair are neither goofy nor stupid.Parts of the movie still do make you sit up and enjoy. For instance when Matty asks Brenner if classic games mean Counter Strike, a surprised Brenner replies 'no'. And when the Admiral was trying to blame Iran and Moscow, it does put a smile on your face. I believe aliens were brilliantly done. You get to see them communicate directly with the earthlings, but never see a green or double headed creature with tentacles.With all the war against the aliens you fail to understand what the director wants to deliver. If it was to make the current generation kids understand the simplicity of the arcade games or make the adults feel nostalgic about their childhood. The movie fails on both accounts.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

Sandler and James have this reverse king Midas effect where everything they act in seems to be absolutely terrible and Pixels follow suit.

Sandler sticks to his trialled and failed form of comedy where he always has to explain his jokes and leaves nothing to the viewers imagination. Kevin James playing Kevin James as the president is completely ridiculous and unlikable( like every other role of his), however both these characters aren't the most annoying that the film has to offer. That goes to Josh Gad, he's is constantly shouting in this dreadful, high pitched voice. Monaghan is there to be another beautiful women who Sandler gets with. Peter Dinklage's character is probably the funniest character in the film, thats not too hard, and has a total of two funny things to say.I feel this film could have been a lot better as a homage to retro games but instead falls flat.

It's kind of weird, all together. But.. that said: the recognizing of all those Arcane heroes, the way they are part of the movie, the fun quotes the characters have here and there and the chase to get rid all the Arcane stuff, it's actually pretty fun to watch.No, I don't think I'll see it ever again.

Fit perfectly with current generations and audiences. Good movie that have brought some iconic old video game characters onto the big screen if you saw it on cinemas. The main actors are all funny, & some lines too that made me laugh in a exact way then the three childhood friends that have kept their friendship strong & adamant till they grow up is one of things that is so insipiring and then still connect to each other even how they aged already made me also apply how i should be like that too with my true friends i had in my life. I loved the visuals & the cgi's editing that has transformed into live action style masterpiece and it's likeable, adorable, and gorgeous. I rate this movie 7/10 and seen it on a couple of times and this film is a beatiful rare movie packed with rare stuffs have shot on this film.

Do all movies have to be the same basic story line in order for the critics to like them? This movie definitely brings back memories for those of us born in the 80's. Yes, there are a few ridiculous scenes in the movie, as is often the case in fun,comedy movies, but overall, the acting is fine, and watching the games come to life is exciting. In my opinion, it is definitely worth the watch. Sit back, relax and enjoy the imagination and fun put into the movie, while sipping a glass of wine. :D Sometimes it is better to see for yourself than to trust the critics. They are looking for something different than the average person wanting to simply see a fun film that takes you away from the reality of life for a few hours. :)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Galaga, Donkey Kong and of course Tetris. So for a film to use these legendary titles, well, the nostalgia should've instantly won me over. But wait! What's this? Happy Madison Productions is involved? The same writer as 'Grown Ups 2'? Urgh. And this is why we can't have nice things in life. An extraterrestrial race misinterpret video games as a declaration of war (oh, a time capsule of a championship was sent out to space for no apparent reason), to which they mimic the characters within the games and send them down to destroy Earth.A planet hosting an array of powerful nations with the capacity to decimate cities with the click of a button. But you see, the army just can't get to grips with the pattern of Centipede or Arkanoid. They Just aren't trained enough in arcade gaming! So naturally the army recruit a former Pac-Man champion, his video-gaming nemesis, a random conspiracy theorist and the President of the frickin' United States. I do not want to be in a world where Kevin James is the President and Adam Sandler stops an alien invasion. Nope! Anyway, as you would expect from the onslaught of recent films that Sandler's studio pump out every year, it's bad. Not even an entertaining ""turn your brain off"" kinda way. It's just flat out terrible.Herlihy's writing was incomprehensibly painful to say the least. No character personalities, no bite to the plot and certainly no humour. The story exists to play on the nostalgia of its audience, without actually going anywhere with it. Colombus' direction is bland and predictable right down to the inner code. The cast were just playing themselves, and Sandler happened to drag fine actors into this mess. Monaghan, Shaw, Cox and Bean, come on you fine actors! Just say no next time. Q*Bert has way too much screen time and is, for some unknown reason, physically communicating in English. At one point, a certain character engages in intercourse with their video game crush. And, wait for it, produces five baby Q*Berts. Five of them! Nope. I'm done. Why the hell is Iwatani involved? Why does Max Headroom look worse?Aside from the semi-decent pixelated visual effects and Serena Williams being the queen that she is, Pixels is one glitchy affair that is essentially unplayable.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Lucky for him then, that aliens start attacking earth in the form of video games. Video feeds of retro arcade games were sent in to outer space as a peace offering, not a admission of war. Sandler, his geeky friend Josh Gad and nemesis Peter Dinklage are the ones leading the defense. Just as unconvincing is the world relying on three gaming wizards. The acting hits all sorts of levels from mediocre (Sandler), to good (Dinklage, Monaghan), to over the top (Gad). Pixels is a lavish, easy to look at yet underwhelming comedy that's only appealing to gamers.

I played the games featured in this movie in the arcades in my youth. Pixels should had been a lot of nostalgic fun but the Sandler formula is getting old now and I am amazed that there are some 1980s songs still left that have never featured in Sandler's previous films.Adam Sandler plays a whizz-kid arcade games player who in his younger days came second in the world arcade championship, footage of which was sent to space.Now years later an alien planet interpret the footage as an aggressive act and sent sprite like arcade characters to earth to attack it. So you have Pacman on the rampage, Centipede all over London, Donkey Kong is still on the lookout for a plumber.It is up to grown up arcade aces from the old days such as Sandler, his best friend Kevin James, incidentally also the President of the USA, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage to battle these space invaders. Michelle Monaghan plays the love interest. Sean Bean and Brian Cox are the military types who never mastered Commando.Once the film has the big arcade showdown during the climax of the film, its a lot of fun. Q*Bert pops up to give Minion type of support to keep the smaller kids happy.The problem is the film takes too long to get going, the romance angle between Monaghan and Sandler is predictable. The film is actually not funny and there are a lot of problems with it. Why does the Japanese creator of Pacman gets his arm taken off for showing love to his creation but Gad gets to get his Lady Lisa to drop her swords? It looks like they dig dug themselves in a hole.There are a few star cameos which tends to be par to the course in Sandler films but he is a star whose creativity has been on the wane for some time now. It certainly is no can Mr Do.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

First off l would like to say that nostalgia ≠ good movie. And l must say, Adam Sandler was just being Adam Sandler, however he was not the only factor of the movie that made this absolutely awful, it was also the absolute crap writing, the stupid premises, the lazy sequences, just everything you could name in a bad movie, here it is. The only reason l am giving this film a 2 star, is because 1 star is the lowest you can go, and 1 extra star for the CGI. The CGI and compositing in this movie is spot on, and it looks great, that at least l can appreciate. The movie starts out to introduce the premise of the story and our protagonist, and than hard cuts you into the 'current time' where our world starts suddenly being attacked by various classic video games. Each of those video game sequences are done so well in CGI, but resolved so HORRIBLY lazy. lt's hard to explain, but basically l had to force myself to finish this film, l couldn't stand watching it and l wanted it to be over so badly, and even the end wasn't satisfying for the viewers. The credits were cute, but that still plays more on CG. Don't waste your time unless you want cheap (AND I MEAN EXTREMELY CHEAP) laughs and want to stare at some cool CGI. Most of other people that will say this was a good movie, are blinded by nostalgia and CGI. What lies beneath is an extremely lazily written piece of garbage movie script that has wasted a genuinely good movie concept. (and no, the rating has nothing to do with Sandler, l came into watching this movie with low expectations)","6 out of 27 found this helpful.

As a fan of video games, this film really took my interest. The movie is about a probe being launched into space containing old video games and when aliens discover it, they attack Earth in the form of classic video games and its up to Earth's greatest gamers to stop them.I guess people are hating on this because Adam Sandler plays the main character. Honestly, this casting choice didn't bother me. I remember seeing this in theaters with a friend and we both enjoyed it. Pixels was directed by the legendary Chris Columbus, whose other films I greatly admire. The film also stars Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan. I thought their performances were pretty good. The action scenes were pretty cool and creative. I liked how the Pacman scene was set in New York so it could look like the original game. The Centipede scene in London was great, and the part with Donkey Kong in the aliens' ship was also a lot of fun. It was also nice to see lots of different classic game characters during the climax in Washington DC. I did have issues with some of the writing though. For example, Kevin James' character conveniently became president of the United States even though he's the main character's childhood friend. I also thought some of the humor was bad and I did find Q-Bert slightly annoying. However, I'd say that the positives in this film outweigh the negatives. It's a fun movie for gamers everywhere and I would recommend you watch it at least once.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My brother loves Adam Sandler, so he's dragged me through some pretty bad movies. But Pixels was okay. It would be good for kids and people who like classic video games and are also sympathetic to the Happy Madison style of film making. Certainly, there are worse ways to spend an hour and forty five minutes.As a homage to arcade games, it far surpasses the otherwise decent Wreck-It Ralph. The problem with Ralph was that it used video games as window dressing to tell the well-worn story of the outsider who finds meaning and self-respect. Pixels actually works the video game motif into the storyline such that the story wouldn't work without it.Some people seem to have problems with how unlikely the plot is and how far-fetched many of the bits in the movie are. It's really not a problem. The movie signposts at several points that it is not to be taken seriously, usually in the form of a character verbally noticing the illogic. Normally, this kind of dialogue irritates me, since it is rarely funny, but it was done well here, especially because the things being commented on needed to be commented on.The movie made me laugh a couple of times and was rarely unpleasant. It lacks the onslaught of juvenile sex jokes that categorise and ruin many of Adam Sandler's other movies. It managed to pass the threshold of being acceptable entertainment. Which makes it one of the best Adam Sandler films I have yet seen.On that note, it seemed like Sandler was putting a bit of himself into his character. Both were promising talents in their younger days, but squandered that talent and became undistinguished presences in their neighbourhoods by middle age. Unlike his character, I doubt that Pixels signifies a reflowering for Sandler, since there mustn't be much motive for him to do better than his lowest common denominator comedies. Still, perhaps he can surprise us one day...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Years later aliens discover it and see it as a declaration of war (???). They send outsize versions of the video games to Earth to attack. It's up to the president (Kevin James) to get help. He hires his old friend (Adam Sandler) who used to be a whiz a video games to help battle the aliens. Along with some fellow gamers (Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage) they do battle. There's also the obligatory love interest (Michelle Monaghan).Like all Sandler films this is full of sexist smutty humor--not one bit of it was funny. I think I chuckled once or twice but that was it. Also Sandler gives a terrible lifeless performance. The plot is full of HUGE loopholes that make little sense. And Josh Gad is fat, loud, ugly and as annoying as hell. Still there are good things here. It does move quickly; guest stars Sean Bean, Serena Williams and Jane Krakowski are amusing; James and Monaghan are great in their roles and there are some great 80s songs on the soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film is the video games graphics. They look GREAT and the battle scenes are lots of fun. Best of all is an all out attack at the end by the aliens where virtually every 80s video game character makes an appearance. It's worth seeing just once for that alone. Otherwise it's pretty stupid and pointless.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

It's overacted, feels crazy, and breaks loads of rules making this movies technical score (not talking about cgi, rather story and use of cinematography editing ext.) more of a 4/10. However, it's not aimed at movie geeks like me, but rather families, and people that don't take notice of plot holes and bad acting, they just watch the movie for what it is, a movie.
It depends entirely on what you class as a good movie, I personally like films like gone girls, and zodiac (both Fincher films), that have great acting, feel real, and every detail is calculated to an insane extent, but would a kid enjoy almost 50% of a film being dialogue (even if it is amazing dialogue), no.So, in essence, I recommend this film as a family film, and to people that don't look into every detail of a film. But not to anyone that actually cares about acting and story, and cinematography, well actually the cinematography isn't awful.So, as a film geek, and on a technical bases I'd rate it a 35/100
but on entertainment level, i'd rate it 58/100I would recommend wreck it Ralph to people instead of this film, similar concept, but a better portrayal.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This immediately tempered my expectations for this film, but it had a fantastic plot, and enough actors/actresses that I still was pretty excited for it. What I watched absolutely blew me away.The basic premise of the movie is this: an attempted communication with aliens is taken as a threat of war, and so they attack earth using the very games they were sent footage of. In order to defeat them and save earth, a group of people who were video game champions as kids are called upon to save the planet.As previously mentioned, I loved some of the acting choices for this movie. Ashley Benson is a personal favorite, and despite only having very limited screen time, and not actually saying a single word, she delivers a very strong performance as Lady Lisa. Peter Dinklage is most known for his role on Game of Thrones, but I personally know him from the horror comedy Knights of Badassdom. Previously I knew him as a vulgar, ""out there"" comedy actor, but in this film he manages to tone it down enough to make it a (mostly) family friendly performance, while still maintaining the edge that I love about him. This was actually my first time seeing Michelle Monaghan, and I didn't know Josh Gad too well, but both of them (in particular Gad) had more than noteworthy performances.Now finally for the biggest question mark of the film, Sandler. As the title I put to the review indicates, I believe this has the potential to be a career saving movie for him. I have previously only truly enjoyed him 3 times, the latest being The Longest Yard, and before that in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. More recently I have wasted money going to the theatres to see his films, and even seeing what I consider to be the 2 worst movies I've ever seen in theatre in Funny People, and Jack and Jill. But he delivers a great performance here, and has made a step in earning my trust back in movies.Overall, I'm not trying to say the film is without flaw, but then again not many films are. This is a very fun movie, and will keep you entertained the entire time. I give this movie a 10/10.","60 out of 118 found this helpful.

I was such a big fan of his back in the Happy Gilmore day, but lately (and by lately i mean the last ten years or so) he was only in awful movies. I almost got up and left for this one and i actually did that for Grown Ups 2. He may still be funny, but the movies he's in sure aren't. The only reason i gave Pixels 4/10 was because of the CGI which was on par and for the idea. Other than that, the acting is decent, but the scenes are just put together like it was a 10th grade school project. It has no logic. I think that the top positive comment on this movie says it all - being written by a twelve year old... Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

However, after a humiliating defeat to local rival Eddie (Peter Dinklage), he can't see his life going anywhere...and it doesn't, whilst years later his best friend Cooper (Kevin James) has gone and become the president. But Brenner's life might be about to change, after aliens in outer space misinterpret a signal sent from Earth as a declaration of war, and send an army in the shape of the arcade games he was once so good at playing to attack Earth. Brenner now must go from zero to hero, and save the world as only he can.Some films are harder to read than others. Sometimes, it can be difficult to work out whether something was meant to be taken seriously, as a piece of high art, or will end up leaving you to marvel at whether it was just a massive in-joke when you see the abysmal quality of the finished product. In a nutshell, some films were made to win Oscars, and some, while not being meant as bad, were simply made to switch your brain off and have some cheesy, shameless fun. It's safe to say a film about arcade game characters from the '80s being sent from space to attack Earth would fall slap bang in to the aforementioned category, and so anyone who approached Pixels with any sense of Citizen Kane expectations, and slammed it simply for what it is, would only have themselves to blame for not recognising the potential sort of entertainment factor it had. But somehow, it doesn't work even on this level.The revival of '80s nostalgia seems to be pretty high right now, and a lot of popular culture seems to be selling its premise simply on a concept that promotes that. So a film where a host of these former game icons, most notably a giant Pac Man, are among the main characters is a cat in the bag all of its own. Indeed, the film itself has a zany sort of Ghost Busters esque appeal about it, and the hope was that it could match the zany fun of those films. All the right ingredients are there, and it does manage some funny, enjoyable moments. But consistently, despite the affection for its source material, it fails to really be any fun and keep the tone going.Director Chris Colombus litters the most high profile thing he's done in years with a host of big name stars, including Brit actors Brian Cox and Sean Bean in comedic hard man military roles, whilst big name comedy star Sandler vies for comic affection from other established star James. Somehow, none of them can inject this missed opportunity with the spark it needs. **","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Gamers who like legit game a lot, are the kind of people to seek patterns even in their real life, many gamers will claim that ""real life is actually a game"", some people think they crazy saying that, but if you game enough, you develop your brain to see the patterns, and yeah real life is probably an extremely complex and dynamic filled with puny details game and the patters are insanely vast and different at each corner, but they still exist.To add a bit about the movie, horrible, even creepy, approach from Adam's character onto the mother of the kid, setting a horrible example for children (since people say it's a movie mostly kids should watch) about how to speak, look, or behave with women. yes, the teasing (afterwards) was kinda nice and silly, but it wasn't in any capacity the right way to do it, nor the appropriate response from the girl. Movie itself wasn't serious at all, when I say at all I mean AT ALL, it was from start to finish ""I win cause I'm the protagonist"" kind of thing, and again, sets a horrible example for children, having people who don't train, do not work hard for what they can do, just do things and succeed, because... this set of mind is what makes kids egotistical, makes them think that they will win because they are they, they are the most important, so they should be listened to and get everything... and when they lose they become very salty losers, instead of embracing the lost as part of their experience and being eager for next time, like GAMERS (aka the thing they act like they know what they are talking about) learn to do. Being respectful? working hard? making your dreams with your own hands? pffffft please... just get into a car and drive like a pro drifter! WHATEVER.. grab a gun too on your way, start shooting things cause no one ever needed training in shooting a gun pfffffffffffffffft. these guys don't even game, and even though gamers are more likely to pick up how to use a gun faster than non-gamers, I would NOT expect gamers to be good with a gun right again, let along some guy who's best skill is speaking like he knows anything. Just forget about it, look it's not a bad filler thing to watch whenever you need pass some time or whatever, the CGI and the filming look pretty good and the reason this gets 4 and not 1 (or 0 if I could), so look at those and enjoy the detail while they pass by and you may enjoy it! that is if you can handle some really heavy cringe moments along the way. Kid was the best character (and good actor, pretty impressive for the age) in the movie, smart, intelligent speaking, respectful, understanding, supportive, and actually cool dude. The only relationship that made sense is the virtual warrior and the nerd, since she's an alien and probably never herd the word ""love"" before, was still creepy at the end, first time I agreed with Adam's character in this movie.p.s This is not a movie about gamers, these guys know pretty much nothing about gaming, like completely nothing... like Donald and Hillary talking about ""the cyber"" kind of nothing. so don't go in expecting any of that.Have a good one! ❤️","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a fairly clean movie too with some nice surprises. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time as when Ludlow tries to give a pep talk to soldiers. A refreshing point is also that we aren't treated with the typical feminazi nonsense you would expect to see in an exchange between male and female lead characters. To see a male fire some stinging one-liners right back at a woman, sniping both the class divide and hypergamy as well, is not the trend Hollywood usually pushes. It was a nice change. There is also a tiny jab at Obama near the end of the movie, you have to listen to catch it, as some of the political jokes will fly over peoples heads. The nerd jokes will also fly over peoples heads who are not familiar with the culture. It is definitely a good time movie, ignore the politically correct out-of-touch haters. If you are easily offended at Sandler-esque insults, slight crude humor, or if you are expecting a 'serious' movie, this is not for you.","7 out of 38 found this helpful.

No really don't... Unlike another review I don't agree that this movie is good for gamers (not for real gamers anyway), even on the contrary, it's clearly made by people who haven't played a real game in their entire lives but want to use the 'gaming' aspect for success. And seeing from the first review I saw it works with let's say some of the more simple viewers. They tried to get on the hype of 'Wreck it Ralph', which failed. Bad puns, stupid sometimes incorrect references. One of Ben Stillers (and that says a lot) worst movies as an actor. The plot is terrible, the ending is predictable and poor. The actors apart from Ben Stiller are possibly ever worse than him.The only reason you should watch this movie is to explain to other people why you don't like Ben Stiller.To recap:1) Terrible Movie 2) Bad acting 3) Rip-off 4) Ben Stiller","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

First of all this movie is not for those who haven't played arcade games. Yes because in cinema hall I found most of the people confused just because they don't know the rules of the games like pacman,etc. They were trying to figure out that why pacman died with a car. So the people who rated down this movie maybe didn't knew about gaming much. But if you are a gamer then must watch this because you can understand whats going. And the movie has lots of comedy parts too as most of the time i was laughing.

In Adam Sandler's latest comedy, those comments have been magnified as a race of alien beings misinterpret a deep space satellite transmission as a declaration of war and have chosen classic arcade games as their soldiers. Yes my friends, my next review is on none other than Pixels, a movie that may be one of the most ridiculous adventures to grace the theater. Hi I'm Robbie K and you're just in time for another review on the latest ""comedy"" release. When you think of Adam Sandler, as well as the plot summary above, you might tag the comedian with words like ridiculous, stupid, immature, etc. Well that might be true, but let's focus on some good qualities of his unique imagiantion. Pixels jumps back into the 80's to bring nostalgic memories of the endangered arcades to nerds like me and amplifies to monstrous proportions. After a fun trip back in time, we jump to the modern day world where Sandler and his typical crew are again the oddballs in popular culture. This is where one of the positives comes in, and that is Sandler's poking at the trends, stereotypes, and culture. I chuckled at the writer's jabs at our government system, mocking their obsession with war, country strives, and glorification of the military. In a manner along the lines of Revenge of the Nerds, nerds are shown to be powerful, using predictability and practice as the mighty tools of defense. This tired and true story line has a nice refreshing twist using games as the medium, but the story is lacking in so many ways. Most stories running tangent to the main plot are very shallow, nothing more than predictable moments that center on wishes shared by our beloved arcaders. How the aliens saw this as a threat, what they looked like, heck even the reasoning of their choices were cut short to be dumped into the flood of jokes this movie is filled with. Speaking of jokes, Pixels is more of Adam Sandler's tactics of being kiddy, geeky, and somehow sweet at the same time. Pixels has loads of his overdramatic, throaty yelling, often partnered with a drawn out with someone rambling on and making a fool of themselves. Other characters were drawn in to the awkward vortex as well, Peter Dinkelage especially dropping into the ludicrous 80's punk with a heavy accent that is more annoying than funny for me. However, I did enjoy some of the humor in this movie, especially witty quips at modern culture. Being a gamer myself I also laughed at a few of the gaming scenarios as well, despite many of them being ruined in the trailers. And yet Pixels humor gets lost in the teams inability to realize enough is enough. Sandler and his crew take their jokes too far, and don't let up until it is too late and the jokes are super stale that only kids will be cracking up at them. Because of this lack of balance, the movie's humor really only stays consistently funny to kids, who we know can't get enough of the things they love. Let's turn our attention to the game scenes now. Pixels art directors took an interesting path for this film, as they brought the pixelated warriors to life. Most of the soldiers look like high definition renditions of minecraft sprites, obviously designed to pop out of the screen in the 3-D viewings. The arcade games are colorful though, sporting the flashy vibrant hues and shades that caught our attentions all those years ago. Life is further imbued with the sound editing, the 8-bit bings, bongs, and other digital noises filling the high definition speakers and bringing you into the moment. The designers even translated the games 2-D movements into fluid 3-D excitement as the monsters and ships battle our real life defenders. As for the adventure itself, it's okay. The battles with the light guns start out exciting, but it doesn't take long before you realize it's just repeated movements of our heroes shooting left and right with the enemies barely adapting their strategy. As the journey continues, the actions gets better as the situations get a dab of cleverness added them all with an arcade twist. Butthey take the scenes too far, and cross into the overdramatic zone and losing its majesty. Exaggerated moves and simple comedy can't beef up the sequences, or improve the movie for that matter. The only thing that might have helped was the kicking 80's soundtrack that played throughout the movie, another fine moment of nostalgia. Okay so Pixels isn't the greatest movie ever, and it may be more of the same Sandler movie magic we've come to know. However, the movie is a fun trip back to a colorful time, and retro gamers will appreciate the references they make throughout the film. There isn't much of a story and things do go stale from time to time, but I think younger audience members will enjoy the adventure to be had. Word of warning, this movie has some fair bit of cursing. My recommendations are to hold off on this movie, as despite the cool special effects, it is not worth the high price of a ticket. The scores are:Comedy/Action/Sci-Fi: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

But please hold your horses because this still pretty much sucks. The trailer more or less tells you what this is about - When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.That's not a bad idea, actually it sounds like great idea, but Pixels is a one trick pony. The story never tries to take the simple premise one step further and it expects to coast along with the nostalgia generated by these larger than life arcade 'monsters'. I think they have forgotten that everybody who was into these games have grown a lot older. There are some hilarious bits but I just couldn't laugh (likewise with the rest of the pitiful number of heads in the cinema on a Thursday afternoon). One of the reasons is the insipid and lazy script that basically broad-strokes every character into just one identifiable trait, and for the umpteenth time Sandler is the gentle man-child who will win the day and get the girl. It is the same old lazy talking pattern and acting screaming at the world that losers will be winners and shite on the world who thinks otherwise. Do something else man! The script also didn't do the film any favors. Tell me if this makes any sense - ""you smell like the Book of Genesis"".The only sequence I like is the Pacman one and the only character I dug is Dinklage in a mullet hamming it up, but he couldn't save the movie for me. The only way this movie would work is for the studios to put the film in a time capsule, place it in a time machine and make it go back to the 1980s. The audience then will definitely lap it up. That's where it deserves to be, but that would mean they have to delete that Obama joke.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Can't be forgotten games are shoehorned into a 'can be forgotten' movie.Madison's been trying hard, and no matter how awesome Sandler is in person, his films simply suck. So the production company comes with another one, with Chris Columbus in the vanguard – Pixels. But even Columbus fails to elevate the trodden.This movie is another big fiasco in the long list of fiascos by Happy Madison. Not only Pixels isn't funny, but it is also dumb on so many levels. There are maximum 4-5 places in the entire movie where you might actually laugh. There you go! Counted them on fingers.So they tried putting some melodrama to it, and it looked so unnatural and stupid that you wish why bother? The concept was pretty stupid for a sci-fi flick. The plot had nothing to offer. Don't even get me started on the screenplay.It does light you up with reminiscence if you have lived the Arcade gaming era. All those games did bring a smile of nostalgia to my face. But that was it.Oh and Peter Dinklage could have lived without this.Just remember the bottomline – If you are feeling a little bit down or without a brain, and wish to watch something light, Madison movies go amazingly well with popcorn.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

There's lots of childish jokes, nothing wrong with that, then Sandler weighs in with some dead pan stuff that just doesn't seem to sit right. I guess pulling off this kind of movie is difficult, in comparison Wreck it Ralph I loved.

I mean arcade games used to be a threat to mankind, that is awesome, Chris Columbus as director for a child friendly (more or less) action comedy, that is fitting, Adam Sandler in a movie not directed by Dennis Dugan or Frank Coraci, that can be a career change in the good way. There is one thing which can make a movie like this don't work and that's laziness and you can bet on what happened, the movie becomes lazy. Still the movie isn't as bad as anybody says it to be, its average not more and not less. Let's dive into detail Visuals: If you know Chris Columbus you know that he can't fail on this point and he didn't, there are some weak spots in the visual department but overall the movie looks good and resembles the feeling of an 80's arcade game. The Action is shot well; the scenery is nothing special but still very convincing and gives just the right feeling. It is colorful it is crazy and chaotic and in such a movie it should be. If you don't like the style, this movie wouldn't be for you anyway. Story: Here we go into the territory where it begins to fail. The Story itself is alright, but for one it is nothing original yet the same concept as other movies at the likes of Independents Day or Pacific Rim and for two it consists of so much plot holes that you can't sometimes follow it or find some parts unnecessary or confusing. But in point of story I can get an eye closed because in a movie like this the story is secondary for the entertainment. Character: That is the part the movie fails! You did have one job to do in this movie, to entertain and while the movie did entertain visionary it seriously failed to entertain in the character. For a comedy it is hardly funny and the comedy is based on very superficial humor. The jokes are neither deep nor complex often they are the same one- liners and sentences over and over again. The acting performances aren't particularly weak, but very unbelievable, which isn't a smart thing to do in a movie where the action relies mostly on the reactions in the action scenes. With a namely exception of Peter Dinklage all characters play the same archetype they always are playing or fulfilling a movie cliché like the love interests and the needy boss. There was one funny scene in the beginning of the movie I really cracked up and even that scene was superficial, not well acted and filled with one-liners. Overall: Pixels should have been one of the greats of the year but failed in doing so. Is it a bad movie nonetheless, no but it isn't good either. Visually it is solid and hit the themes it used to hit. But the story is that bland that you can't really consider it being compelling or let it suck into the world. It is surely a fun flick to watch at a party or with someone special on a Sunday evening, but don't expect a masterpiece I give it an overall score of 5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie certainly delivered on those things - but what I wasn't prepared for was the constant referencing to alcohol in the movie - think about it if you have seen this movie - drinking in the closet, he drinks (and then drives), shots of Jack at the Whitehouse, Chugging a jug and a woman skulling a bottle of beer. It seems we have moved from every movie having some ridiculous requirement to have someone smoking (think Avatar) to making it so it is really cool to drink in a closet to overcome your sadness for a marriage break up. What the hell is going on here? I also had an issue with the overt sexualisation of some of the scenes, when the singer in the band starts humping the ground was definitely one scene too far... I love funny, dirty, rude and crude films (my fav comedy is This is the End) - but to sit there and watch this with an 8 and 10 year old made things extremely uncomfortable and required a long discussion at the end of the movie about why people drink alcohol. Just for the record we have a wine cellar in the house and a full bar fridge - we just don't ""skull"" beer or drink purely to overcome sadness or emotions.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Loved the video game concept but the rest of the film was a let down. 4/10","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3370722/?ref_=tt_urv","leonblackwood","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28260582/?ref_=tt_urv","12 December 2015","Review: Adam Sandler always seems to star in these mediocre movies which make millions of dollars at the box office. This movie had a really good concept, in terms of using the old video games, which I personally grew up with, but the rest of the plot is far fetched and quite silly. Having Kevin James as the president was a bad choice but there was a couple of funny moments, especially with the little orange character, Q'Bert. Anyway, the movie starts of with a young Brenner (Adam Sandler), Cooper (Kevin James) and Ludlow (Josh Gad), playing video games in a amusement park. Brenner then enters the 1982 Worldwide Video Arcade Championships which also has the Guinness Book of Records attending, along with Nasa who will be recording the nights events so they can send a probe into the solar system, hoping that it can connect to extraterrestrial life. REALLY! Anyway, Brenner has to beat Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" (Peter Dinklage) to become champion but he fails to beat him at Donkey Kong so he has to make do with second place. The movie then switches to the present day, we're Brenner is a mobile electrician and Cooper is the president of the United States. When an army unit gets attacked by a mysterious spaceship, which turns out to be from the game Galaga, the president turns to his best friend Brenner to try and work out a method to sort out the problem, as he had a talent when it came to the old video games. There other close friend, Ludlow, works out that the Aliens took the video tape, that was sent to them from Nasa, as a declaration of war and as the tape was sent to them in video game format, they were sending video game characters to destroy earth. They also give earth 3 life's, like any ordinary video game at that time, so the first one with 3 wins would win there destructive game. Anyway, they turn to the Fire Blaster to help them save earth and the humans that they have taken as a reward. They also get help from Violet (Michelle Monaghan), who works for the president and Q'Bert who was a gift from the Aliens because they won a couple of there matches. This movie could have really worked if it was taken seriously. The film company was lucky to get the rights to use so many of the old video game classics but the director didn't take full advantage of the opportunity. The silly jokes throughout the movie, we're really poor and the corny ending really let the movie down. With that aside, I did stick with the movie because I didn't know what direction the director was going to take the whole video game element of the film. I liked the Pac-Man game with the cars and the Donkey Kong game looked pretty impressive but I just couldn't take the childish humour, which is in many of Adam Sandler movies nowadays. Watchable, because of the arcade game content!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Chris Columbus, 57, who brought you some all time classics like Home Alone I & II, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, Stepmom, the great Bicentennial Man, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. He's got quite an impressive portfolio, which is why he was given this hard project to direct. Visually, he did do a great job in terms of making it look real and as he didn't write the script, I can't blame him for the silly storyline. I'm slowly beginning to dislike Adam Sandler, 49, movies because his latest films have been pretty poor. I haven't seen the Cobbler yet but I wasn't impressed with Grown Ups 2, That's My Boy, Just Go With It or the awful Jack & Jill. Blended was watchable, mainly because of the scenes with Terry Crews, who he teams up with again in the upcoming Ridiculous 6, which also stars some top class comedians. Anyway, there's no rumours about a sequel for this movie so I would like to see a serious director take on a fresh movie with this old video game concept.Budget: $88million Worldwide Gross: $244millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/comedies starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Dan Aykroyd. 4/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well, it is shallow and it is by the numbers, but it's hardly the steaming pile of digital poop the tepid critical (and commercial) reception would have you believe. Despite a great central concept – 80s computer games attack Earth! – and competent CGI, it doesn't quite reach the level of action excitement it's aiming for with a handful of pedestrian sequences culminating in a cluttered and underwhelming finale. Where it scores power-up points is in the comedy department; the dialogue unexpectedly funny at times with a mix of on-the-nose jokes for the younger audience members and more subtle gags for the adults. There's also the small matter of Peter Dinklage (rocking the greatest mullet you'll witness in 2015), who provides a spark of humorous arrogance every time he's on screen as conceited gamer Eddie 'Fireblaster' Plant. The rest of the cast can't keep up with the little master, although Josh Gad lands a few laughs as conspiracy nut Ludlow Lamonsoff and Michelle Monaghan is reliable as ever as the sane member of the ragtag group. Adam Sandler and Kevin James are, well, Adam Sandler and Kevin James, for better and mostly for worse; the former offering a lazy but mercifully toned-down lead turn, the latter dishing up a frighteningly weird take on the U.S. President. It won't be up for any awards (except maybe a Razzie or two) and is undoubtedly a missed opportunity considering the awesome premise, but Pixels isn't a complete disaster thanks to its comedic successes.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Never have. Don't find him funny at all. There.Having said that I saw some reviews for Pixels on here that suggested I should give this as a try, with superlatives such as 'hilarious', 'laugh out loud' and 'brilliant' used to describe the humour and entertainment to be had - flying in the face of the critics who described it as a dog.They were very, very wrong and, I hate to say it but the critics were spot on.Sandler is as unappealing as ever and the humour childish and unfunny throughout - though he isn't the only bad thing about this film by a long way. The performances are poor without exception, some of the actors (such as Kevin James as a bungling President) are woefully mis-cast and all are easily outperformed by their pixelated co-stars.The ending is just as moronic as the rest of the film. The special effects are okay in the action sequences. The storyline is confused and it feels as if the film lasts for 3 hours, though apparently the running time is 'only' 1 hr 45. Perhaps someone became aware of this as the final large setpiece feels rushed. The soundtrack is plastered over the top of the film as if in some grotesque afterthought.All in all, it left me puzzled. Who would this film appeal to ? The average teen would have outgrown the unsophisticated, in-your-face, clumsy humour...and would be too young to be aware of the so-called 'classic' games that the movie is presumably trying to evoke some feeling of nostalgia for.Next time - I will listen the critics (and my intuition) and give anything with Adam Sandler a wiiide berth.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Watch it if no other movie is available to watch. No reason to avoid it, no reason to watch it either. It's exactly in the middle. Just to pass the time. They did not do the games right, and it's not that funny (typical Adam Sandler movie) but not horrible either. I am still wondering why Peter Dinklage agreed to this movie. Did he not read the script? Did he not know what Adam Sandler movies look like? Also Toru Iwatani, how did you accept a disgrace to your game? I mean OK, it's a passable movie, acceptable with Adam Sandler standards but still, if you are selling movie rights for IP should you not research what the buyers are planning to do with it?

When these four guys were kids, they took part in the 1982 National Arcade Championship. The footage from this competition & footage of other popular culture, would be sent to outer space by NASA via a space probe, in hopes of communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Unfortunately, the aliens interpret these messages as a declaration of war. They attack Earth in the form of famous arcade video games like, Pac-Man, Centipede, Donkey Kong etc. Now, it is up to Brenner, Cooper, Eddie & Ludlow along with the help of lieutenant Violet(Michelle Monaghan), to teach the US army how to fend off these alien lifeforms. Together, they must utilize all the knowledge, experience & expertise they have to defeat these classic arcade video games in real life, before they take over the planet. Pixels is an extremely funny & entertaining movie. The special effects of the movie are very unique. CGI has never been portrayed like this on screen, ever before. The makers of the movie have successfully recreated all our favorite video games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong & the rest. The fact that all the video game characters are made of pixels in real life, just like in their respective games, is amazing. The riot of colors during all the battles against the alien invaders is otherworldly. The set pieces where many famous monuments of the world get destroyed are spectacular. The Pac-Man set piece in New York is one of the highlights of the film. The 3D, puts the viewer right in the middle of the action. Chris Columbus successfully helms another family film. A tiny flaw of the movie is that, given all the never before seen, revolutionary visual effects, they could have made an unforgettable movie. However, the generic script makes this movie, mostly forgettable. Don't get me wrong! This movie is hugely entertaining. But, it could have been so much more. Adam Sandler is great as Brenner. Kevin James is awesome as Cooper. Michelle Monaghan is brilliant as Violet. Peter Dinklage is the highlight of the movie as Eddie. Dinklage's character steals the show, in every scene he's in. I just wish he had more screen time. Josh Gad is hysterical as Ludlow. Matt Lintz is impressive as Matty. Brian Cox & Sean Bean are good as Admiral Porter & Corporal Hill(SAS Officer) respectively. Jane Krakowski is effective as First Lady Jane Cooper. Ashley Benson is smoldering as Lady Lisa. Dennis Akiyama is hilarious in his cameo as Professor Iwatani. The supporting characters are effective. So, get ready to feel nostalgic as you see your favorite video game characters come to life on the big screen. Pixels is super fun for the whole family & is worth a watch.","37 out of 72 found this helpful.

The only good things is some of the action helped liven it up and there were some witty moments. I liked the questions Adam Sandler asked but the tension of this film just falls apart. It was quite unrealistic, I mean, how would Adam escape Pac-man by jumping off a roof? He would've got hurt. And I also didn't like the ideas the characters came up with to avoid the video game characters. Like pretending to be the man who doesn't want to die? That's pretty obvious!But almost the whole movie is boring and made me want to fall asleep. There was sappy romance towards the end. The acting and dancing was weird. I thought that the man singing was good in that one scene.I think that there was too much talk about video games in this movie, I know this is a video game movie like Wreck-it Ralph but the special effects to this movie were also weird.This was quite a disappointment. I thought Wreck-it Ralph was better. Both movies are not so bad for children but I recommend to go watch Wreck-it Ralph instead. A lot of things were executed way better as well as the animation and acting and they were not painfully annoying.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

For example, his best movies for me were Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy which not to sound agesit (cause he is getting older and his face doesn't give that juvenile charisma much anymore), but this was that start of his lost ""Zing"". It's his face that gives the lackluster performance because he seems to be only half into his character. I think he said once in an interview that he doesn't like playing the ""cool guy"", so he doesn't try to act. Some could argue that makes him cool? I don't know, I digress.Pixel had its cool moments and storyboarded-neato scenes but, I just think it's like all his other new movies- get his usual friends in it, a hot co-star and one-liners and bam, movie and success. He's funny but the deliver of a lot it felt off. Plenty of B-word humor and a very awkward scene when Josh Gad's character Ludlow interrogated the soldiers, and then slapped their butts pretty affectionately when they trained on the arcade games. Gay 90s humor is still funny I suppose.I just wanted more. It's worth a watch? Hmmm, well support it and at least Sandler can buy another friend a Lamborghini, or make another sick joke about pizza with Jennifer Aniston... Hollywood is weird.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, despite that, it still has every Sandler trope used in a movie, a loser overlooked by society, and there's a girl involved. The majority of the jokes are DOA, nothing's really funny, and the acting is just strange, with the exception of Michelle Monaghan. But, to be fair, this movie is fun if you take into account of the main story. Forget the romance. Aliens in the form of classic video game characters invading and attacking Earth is an awesome concept, but adding Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Josh Gad's over-the-top ""paranoid conspiracy theorist"" into this movie, it just kills it, and we're watching a movie with a sense of boredom. I wonder if Chris Columbus regrets making this movie. However, the best parts are the video game battles. That's it. Nothing else is really redeemable. But, this is not the worst Adam Sandler movie.

But, upon hearing how poorly it was doing, I avoided seeing it. When it on came TV earlier this year, I decided to give it a go. I think enjoyed it more than most people did but it was obvious why it had been criticized so much.Many people have said it would have been better if Adam Sandler hadn't been in the lead role. I partly agree with that statement but I believe the films biggest problem is it's script. The story has a very unique concept (based on Patrick Jean's short film) but if it had just been scripted better, then it may have been more successful. There were multiple moments in the film where I found myself saying 'really?'. I must admit I found myself shouting in disbelief at a few of the scenes involving Josh Gad's character towards the end; I personally think this was a pretty poor performance from him. Plus hearing Q*Bert speak English wasn't quite right either. If he'd spoken the same way he did in Wreck-It-Ralph then it might have been better. And that post-credit scene was, to put it quite simply, wrong.But the film wasn't all bad. The story is very original, the special effects are brilliant, the few gags that the film has are quite funny, Peter Dinklage's acting is top quality as ever and the final battle set to 'We Will Rock You' is very enjoyable.All in all, it's a long way off being the worst film I've ever seen but, equally, it's even further away from being the best.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As often seems to be the case with critical pile-ons, it turns out not to be that bad. That's not to say it is very good, but it's not the steaming pile of excrement lots of critics made it out to be. Most of the lazy, unsuccessful attempts at humor come from Adam Sandler and Kevin James, both of whom are more subdued and less obnoxious than is often the case. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have figured out anything interesting or funny to substitute for their usual antics, and so come off as boring. But a much better supporting cast than they deserve helps buoy the film when their own tedium threatens to sink it. Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, and in smaller but well-played roles, Sean Bean and Brian Cox, as well as several lesser known actors keep this from being the painful experience I was half-expecting.For my money, the premise buys a lot of good will. I didn't see the short ""Pixels"" is based on, but the idea of an alien superpower who misinterprets 1980s arcade games as a declaration of war and sends an army of Pac-Men, Centipedes and Donkey Kongs to attack the Earth is as inspired as high-concept concepts come. A filmmaker would have to go out of his way to screw that delightful idea up completely, and director Chris Columbus doesn't. Given that he has to work with a story where the most ludicrous notion is not that aliens attack us with Pac-Man, but that Kevin James is the President of the United States, he does a decent job of keeping the film mostly on-track and keeping the action light and fun. There are too many dead spots -- all of them when either Sandler or James are on-screen, and especially when they're together -- to make this as enjoyable as it wants to be or could have been. But if you find the concept of this film is at all attractive, you should give it a shot.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Directed by Chris Columbus, this film features some of the iconic figures of the classic Atari games from the 80s including Pac-Man (who is a bad guy this time around), Q'Bert, Arkanoid, Tetris, Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Space Invaders, and Centipede.I had rather low expectations for this movie. The idea of the characters fighting against pixelated video games characters who invade Earth does sound quite interesting on paper, but looks utterly silly on screen. The shots of Pac-Man attacking a downtown area and the aliens from Galaga destroying the buildings and major landmarks like the monuments does attract children's attention, but will very likely lose attention from adults when they see this being an Adam Sandler movie. Although this movie does manage to bring out a few laughs here and there, it does little satisfy. The action sequences and the bloated use of CGI pixelated characters are fun to watch for those who grew in the 80s during the age of Atari, but can't save this movie from the disappointment it is. Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad are the only ones manage to have anything remotely funny to say, while Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are left sitting on the sidelines of humorous dialogue. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani makes a rather goofy appearance midpoint through the film before getting his hand chewed off by Pacman, leaving him with pixel dripping arm. The problem is the movie spends the majority of the time drenching the audience with non-stop CGI pixel galore, and neglects its effort on coming up with true laughter.Pixels is one of those comedies that will very likely appeal to kids, but feel like a chore to watch for adults. While this isn't one of Adam Sandler's worst comedies like Jack and Jill and That's My Boy, it certainty doesn't fit the bill and suffers from a weak script. Those who carry interest in retro gaming may find a little entertainment in this, others will be left with strong discontent.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I don't understand why people are hating this movie, but it deserves far more than a 5.5 rating. This movie was MUCH better than I expected!This movie brings back the joyful memories of the 80s, featuring very famous classic arcade characters. Except this time, they're all packed into one hilarious, action-packed adventure! There was great comedy throughout this movie which made me laugh a lot. It's perfect for all the family because there is different comedy to suit different age groups, and there is only a small bit of swearing, which younger ones won't exactly recognize (there was a family in the same row as me with a child who looked about four, and he was saying after the film it was the 'Best Movie Ever'). Also, the animation of the pixelated arcade characters is very fluent and very very impressive, which is amazing when combined with the action of the movie. I can't think of anything that disappoints with this movie, however, there are some clear goofs which makes parts of the movie briefly confusing at times. That said, it doesn't really affect this fantastic movie in any way.Please ignore the critics reviews- perhaps they were terrible at the video games and hate to see them again :D? If you're not sure about the film and you think it looks terrible, trust me, it's better than it looks (like the Lego Movie) and it's the perfect treat this summer.","45 out of 91 found this helpful.

If not, then its not for you and you probably won't like it. However, if, like me, you are in the target audience you will most likely enjoy this film. Although it isn't really that original, (let's be honest. It's ""Ghostbusters"" but with video games) it's still well done. The ending was a bit silly, and felt rushed and du-ex-machina, but up until that point I thought it was great. It is a bit slow in some parts and I wanted it to get back into the action, especially because those parts have no effect on the plot whatsoever. They tried to set up a romantic relationship between two characters, but it's wasted because they don't end up together anyway. And since Sean Bean is in the movie I felt they missed an oppurtunity to make a joke about how he always dies. They could have had him in an arcade where he gets a game over screen, and then had him say ""Why do I always die?"" Missed oppurtunity. I did enjoy the countless 80's pop culture references, and those were the best part of the movie. It's too bad this is getting bad reviews, because I was the only person in the theater the whole time. I thought this was a great movie. Will it be remembered in 10, or even 5 years from now? No, but it's a great movie nonetheless.Grade: B. 8/10 3.5/5 stars","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The whole idea of earth being attacked by aliens in the form of video game characters is silly - but still good material for a fun summer movie. Unfortunately, it's not a fun summer movie at all. I will admit that this is definitely a guilty pleasure, and that gamers and 80's kids will probably love it just for the nostalgia factor, but as a movie, it's really bad. Adam Sandler is consistently mocked for his quality of movies, which has been going steadily downhill, and can't seem to recover. This movie is part of that massive slump. It features the double whammy of him playing a former expert gamer who is now a mechanic with Kevin James, who is now President of the United States. That's every bit as bad as it sounds. The plot is that in the early 1980s, a satellite was sent into space containing items from Earth, including several retro video games. This was seen by the aliens who recovered it as a threat, so they recreated these creatures and sent them to wreak havoc on Earth. It's goofy, yes, but it could be great fun. Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is that it could be just good fun, but it's really not. It's dull, cliché, and forgettable. The characters aren't interesting and the story is bland. However, the references to the old games are nice, and it's cool how each action scene reflects the games so well (like the Pac-Man scene in New York). Q*Bert was probably the best character in this movie. He actually curses this time. What happens to him at the end is just... freaking disgusting. All in all, it's not as bad as it could be. That's not saying much.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I should start by saying that I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. I don't dislike him, I generally just don't like his movies. A few exceptions would be 50 First Dates, which I liked, and Click and The Wedding Singer, which weren't bad.But this movie . . . Wow! Did anyone read the script before they green-lighted it? I cannot imagine anything worse, even if they had intended to make a bad movie.More of the same garbage from Adam Sandler. This abomination has the same thing nearly all his other movies have had: humor that only eight, nine and maybe ten-year-old boys would (should) think was hilarious. So it's come to this: I honestly believe that if not for the normal bodily functions of humans (and animals of course) for Sandler to make fun of -- over and over and over again in this, and about all of his movies, he'd be a broke joke remembered mostly for his okay SNL skits from 25 years ago. From horrible dialogue to incredibly offensive stereotypes (and this is coming from someone who loathes being pc) this movie has just about everything you can think of to dislike in a movie.A truly awful movie that I couldn't get but about half-way through it was so bad.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I tend to be an apologist for Adam Sandler's movies more than anyone else I know. I also have a great fondness for the days when I would spend hundreds of hours (and probably hundreds of dollars) in the arcade playing things like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. However, I can't endorse this film, because it is a piece of trash. To be fair, the visual effects are amazing, and I do have to commend them for making the games look so good. I almost found myself caught up in the nostalgia, if it weren't for the fact that it seems no one on the film (aside from the CGI artists) had any knowledge about these games at all. It can look like Donkey Kong all day, but if it doesn't follow any of the rules, then what's the point? I was shocked how this stupid movie doesn't understand the most basic principles of video games, and invents ridiculous contrivances in order to slap together a script that feels like it was never edited after the first draft. They even have a few references to The King of Kong documentary, and yet it seems no one watched that any time recently to get a better understanding of how the game functions, or how arcade tournaments/records work.Even for someone who cares nothing about these classic games, there's nothing worthwhile in Pixels. I'm sure I get a little extra mad at the film because it doesn't pay respect to the games I loved, but it's not like the story makes sense outside of the video game stuff either. The relationships between the characters are not handled well, the hastily thrown together romance is utterly lacking in chemistry, and the humor falls flat every time. I don't expect much from actors like Adam Sandler and Kevin Smith, but even they feel like they are bored or annoyed that they are even in this film. Perhaps Sandler would find some joy in the movie if it all took place in Aruba and he could milk another family vacation out of this film production. Josh Gad is trying so hard to inject some energy into the film, but his character is written so poorly that it comes off like a toddler bouncing around while desperate for attention. And his romantic storyline made me want to put my fist through the screen. Peter Dinklage is also trying, but his character is intended to be a self-important jerk, so it's hard to appreciate the performance. Pixels is a film that looks good, and had a promising premise, but manages to disappoint in every possible way.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

From the trailer it looks good but having Adam Sandler and Kevin James in it was working against it, not to mention all the bad review I've heard since it's premiere overseas.I don't like Adam Sandler, I think him and his comedy is stuck in the '90s and I think 1 out of every 5 of his films, is even worth watching, let alone good!I like Kevin James and his characters even less!One thing to do if and when you see this movie is leave your expectations at the door. No, this isn't going to be cinematic brilliance but it did turn out to be a fun, enjoyable film.Adam Sandler and Kevin James were dare I say not that bad in this. Josh Gad on the other hand was actually very annoying and idiotic – a role that usually is occupied by Sandler and James.There are a lot of funny moments through out the whole film but there are also some moments where they drag the joke on and on and on until it dies a horrible death. Also the way they portray the British in this film is pretty crap, with stupid, old jokes.As well as an awesome soundtrack, there is also the cast, aside from the above mentioned; Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, Jane Krakowski and Dan Aykroyd.An enjoyable, brightly colourful film that I would watch again, maybe even buy when it's in bargain bin or something.CHAPPY THINKS leave all expectations at the cinema doors and just chill out and watch an entertaining, fun movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","""Pixels"" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3283823/?ref_=tt_urv","CleveMan66","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17590531/?ref_=tt_urv","24 July 2015","When I first read about the premise of the movie ""Pixels"" (PG-13, 1:45) – early 1980s video arcade games coming ""to life"" and attacking the earth – I thought that it was a really original and fun idea. The feature film is based on an award-winning 2010 French short film of the same name, which simply shows some of these 8-bit game images and characters emanating from an old television set and turning objects and buildings into pixelated versions of themselves. (The short film is only about 2 ½ minutes long and is available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUnyUrA34bQ.) I felt that expanding this simple idea into a feature-length science fiction action comedy was brilliant and held a lot of potential. Then I learned that the movie starred Adam Sandler and Kevin James whose last few films haven't exactly been their best. Yet, I still hoped that this movie would signal a return to form for those two talented and accomplished comic actors and also that the filmmakers wouldn't screw up what could be a very cool movie. So, was my optimism justified? In my opinion, yes! That's right, folks. It is, of course, my opinion (although not ""just"" mine, as I'll explain later), but I really think that this is one of those times to ignore the professional critics and listen to a fellow Movie Fan. ""Pixels"" is terrific! Sandler is Sam Brenner, an erstwhile nationally-ranked arcade gamer who hasn't done much with his life since his success in the first National Arcade Game Championship in 1982. He now works for ""Nerd Brigade"" (a fictionalized version of companies like ""Geek Squad"") and he still hangs out with Will Cooper (James), his best friend from back in the day. (Although it's revealed very early in the film, I won't tell you what Will does for a living in the present because finding out is a real hoot!) When earth comes under alien attack (meaning alien, as in outer space – don't be frightened, Mr. Trump), in order to save the world as only they can, Sam and Will reunite with other former ""arcaders"", Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), who ""lacks the social skills"" and is obsessed with conspiracy theories, along with Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), who is over-the-top arrogant and of questionable moral fiber.Video footage from that 1982 competition was put in a time capsule and sent into space where it was discovered by an alien race and misinterpreted. The unnamed aliens took the tape as a challenge to do the galactic equivalent of ""racing for pinks"". This other planet sends giant versions of our classic arcade games to fight earthlings in a series of battles, with the first planet to get to ""game over"" three times taking the other's planet as a prize. With the support of the President (and to the dismay of military leaders played by Brian Cox and Sean Bean), Sam and company link up with weapons designer Lt. Colonel Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to fight high energy light with high energy light.As the attacks unfold, the pixels (actually, voxels, because they're presented as three-dimensional cubes and the film is in 3-D) take the form of a different classic arcade game each time, announce their next attack via re-dubbed versions of early 1980s news and entertainment video clips, and commence to pixelate everything from ordinary objects to famous buildings to people, which is how they capture humans and transport them to their spaceship as war trophies.""Pixels"" both is and isn't your typical Adam Sandler movie. It's more high concept than most of his other Happy Madison Productions, but has typical Sandler-esque elements such as his character's friendship with a young boy and budding romance with a beautiful woman, plenty of 1980s music (including one of those songs amusingly sung on stage by one of the film's characters) and cultural references from that decade, some of his usual crew in the cast (although not as many as usual), a few well-done celebrity cameos and a moral of the story which includes underdogs making good and rising above their personal histories. There's some juvenile humor, but this script features better jokes than most of Sandler's recent comedies, while the sure hand of director Chris Columbus (director of two ""Home Alone"" movies, two ""Harry Potter"" movies and many others) maintains great pacing and keeps things very entertaining.The special effects are crude, but that's by design since the attackers take the form of decades old video game characters, which don't have nearly as many pixels as those in today's games. However, the filmmakers cleverly use the rules of those old games to drive the movie's plot. Those who remember the 80s will appreciate this film the most, but it also appeals to those born long after The Me Decade ended, as I observed in the reactions of my fellow theater patrons and as a young lady and young man (15 and 16-years-old, respectively) with whom I spoke after the movie confirmed. Better than previous 80s video game movie adaptations like ""Tron"", ""Pixels"" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time! And isn't that what going to the theater is all about? This is a movie that ISN'T supposed to be realistic and IS supposed to be silly and fun. Lighten up, critics. As this review ends, the pixels on my computer screen form the letter ""A"".","40 out of 81 found this helpful.

I saw it with a group of people and we all thought it was a very good movie. It was much better than I was thinking. It had a good mix of both Humor and action. It is a great movie for the family to see. This is one Of Adam Sandlers better films in the recent years. Pixels is a solid action movie with added humor. This movie is a must see and I assure you that you will not leave the theater unimpressed. So if you are looking for some action plan if on laughing Pixels is by a far the perfect movie to see. You definitely will not be let down by this amazing film.","32 out of 63 found this helpful.

Some people may comment that the acting was lack luster and stale even cheesy, however I believe that was the intent. You'll notice at the starting credits that Sandler's production company ""Happy Maddison"" was used so you can imagine the type of humour. The story was funny uncomplicated but riddled with little innuendos and subtle jokes that will keep Adults laughing.The Idea that a Computer nerd could have a beer and pretzels friendship with the president of the USA cracked me up and I think a lot of people will enjoy the slapstick tongue in cheek humor used In this film.If you like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, here comes the boom. Your sure to love this, and I think even more so when your kids look at you weird because your laughing at something completely above there head.","33 out of 66 found this helpful.

For those of you who might be averse to the presence of Adam Sandler and/or Kevin James, note that both are quite subdued in this film, especially since the real stars are the video game characters who are invading Earth. The action sequences are all brightly colored and fast paced as well as fun to watch, and since everything the aliens destroy simply pixelates and disappears, the ""violence"" is more comical than anything. Peter Dinklage also takes a surprisingly comic turn in his role as the all-time video game champion; few, if any, jokes are related to his short stature. If you're not willing to spend the money to see ""Pixels"" in the theater, do yourself a favor and at least rent it when it's released on DVD. If you watch this movie without preconceived notions, you might be pleasantly surprised.","40 out of 84 found this helpful.

When a US military base is attacked, the President of the United States calls his old gamer buddy Brenner(who was at the competition in 1982) to confirm his suspicions that characters from Galaga destroyed the base. Soon enough, the 1982 champions are back together defending the Earth against the alien threat.Pixels is not Wreck it Ralph, but who wanted it to be? Instead it is a bunch of crazy alien invasion fun with a heavy helping of 1980's nostalgia. Peter Dinklage is surprisingly funny as a comic foil, and the rest of the cast are good in their roles. Good but not great direction from Chris Columbus and a funny script. As for the 3D, while it had proper depth, it didn't add too much, but the alien scenes(which account for about a third of the film) did benefit from it.Despite the fact the Adam Sandler is in this, it's one of Mr. Sandler's better films of late. Not one of the best comedies of 2015, but very far from the worst. Pixels is an entertaining silly comedy, and worth your time.","31 out of 63 found this helpful.

This movie is funny, it has a lot of action, and it is the only movie I've really seen dedicated to gamers. I mean a gamer saving the world?

Although the movie doesn't have great appeal to adults, it certainly does have appeal for its intended audience 12 - 15yr olds.I found it thoroughly entertaining, and the young man I took to see it was very engaged.The humor was dry and good, and the visuals were very pleasing on the eye. The storyline was totally ridiculous, but despite that, it worked well! Normally I wouldn't bother rating or reviewing this type of movie, but because I got a pleasant surprise, I thought I'd pass it on.It was entertaining and enjoyable - and that's all that matters! If the theme of the movie appeals, then go and see it, if you aren't sure, then watch it on your streaming choice on a miserable day - it will cheer you up!!! It's a whole lot better than doing yard work!!!!","26 out of 52 found this helpful.

It's different from most Adam Sandler movies as it have heavy CGI but still had some solid laughs. It had some real good 1980s moments as the aliens not only used arcade games but when sending messages had clips of various 80s icons providing their message which added some funny moments. Like most Adam Sandler movies there was some interesting casting. I loved seeing Brian Cox and Sean Bean in a few scenes together bringing back memories of ""Sharpe's Eagle"". There was also a nice cameo from Serena Williams. The CGI was great and it was pretty original, not a rehash of the aliens blowing things up. I will definitely see it again.","35 out of 73 found this helpful.

I can't imagine anyone else playing it better. He's funny, charming, genuine, and has great chemistry with everyone in the film. The supporting cast did a great job. The one thing that doesn't add up is how the dweeb character of Kevin James became POTUS in the first place. But I overlooked that and enjoyed the movie for what it was. Entertaining, fun, a great story with great pacing and special effects. Sci fi fun, great action, and very well done all around.People need to chill out and get over themselves. These low reviews are not justified, make no sense, and are just Debbie downers who don't know a fun feel good film when they see it.There were so many little details in this that were spot on, and everyone's role, big or small, was executed very well. A great soundtrack and fun throwbacks to so many classic video games makes this a total win. Sandler, Columbus and crew should be very proud.I'm hoping and praying for a Pixels 2 soon!

I enjoyed the idea of a movie where kids would win a video game tournament, and they would send those games and other stuff into space in hopes that aliens would find it;the aliens did and misinterpret as a declaration of war and retaliate with those games! Adam Sandler and Kevin James were the perfect choices for the leads. Especially Adam Sandler. I liked the choices of the ""battle games"" with Gallaga, Centipede, Pac Man, and Donkey Kong, and cameos by Frogger, QBert, and others. My favorite scenes include Kevin James in the school (reminiscent of George W Bush!), the battle scenes, and the scene in the prison. Anyone nostalgic about these games will enjoy this movie.

If everyone tried their complete hardest, this movie would have been a Smash Hit. In my opinion Adam is a very funny guy and I just love that he wont quit making movies. I just loved how pacman looked and the whole idea of the small cars as the ghosts, it was just straight genius","29 out of 61 found this helpful.

My son, like most young teenage boys, likes the action thrillers. My daughter likes anything cartoony and cute. They both LOVED this movie! There was some humor that seemed aimed right at the 9 year old (...that the 15 year old didn't find funny), and there was other humor that seemed aimed right at the 15 year old (...that the 9 year old didn't understand). The violence was mild enough that it did not frighten my daughter at all. This old 51-year old even got a few grins out of it. Although it's no masterpiece, it's a fun summer movie that everyone in the family can enjoy. Nothing stupendously original, but a very pleasant way to spend a summer afternoon with the kids.","23 out of 47 found this helpful.

Pixels is the funniest film of the year so far!This is, of course, a comedy. However, along with that, there is a lot of drama and a hint of romance all packed into one huge adventure made for the entire family to enjoy.The story features Brenner (Adam Sandler) who installs electronic equipment for a living. However, when an alien species attacks in the form of 1980s classic video games, Benner and his friends are the only ones capable of stopping them. And, to do so, they must beat the aliens, as if they were in the game.This film is fantastic! The special effects are absolutely mind blowing. There are no boring scenes and some special effects are simply mind-blowing fantastic. I still can't figure out how they did it some of them. The acting is spot on. One scene I really liked is where two kids are competing on classic arcade machines with Donkey Kong loaded on them. The director makes it so you see them playing, their points and the screen as well as the reflection of the games in their eyes. It looks amazingzing!My favorite scene is when they are facing Pac-Man in mini coopers that are designed to be the ghosts who chase and destroy Pac-Man. When Brenner is the only one left and Pac-Man just gets a power up which allows him to eat the ghosts, Brenner pulls of an awesome and insane stunts to run away and it is action packed and just stupendous to watch!This film is good for kids, adults and gamers of course. I do believe people in their 30s and 40s would like this the most because they can understand a lot of the older game references. I don't think younger kids should watch this due to the adult language and mature references. I recommend it for ages 9 through 18 and older and give it 5 out of 5 pixelated stars.

What a surprise! I laughed throughout.Yes, the writing could have been better, most of the characters were not believable (with the notable exception of the Wonder Kid who was very believable!), and some of the acting did appear somewhat stiff. I didn't think it detracted too much from the movie, as this is a silly movie. I think why I didn't mind the minor faults was that the movie was quick to point out some of them and make fun of itself. This is not a movie to take seriously, just like almost all of Sandler's previous ones. It is fun, the special effects are great, and it was entertaining.","25 out of 53 found this helpful.

There was no 'boring' bits for either of us and loads of laugh-out-loud moments.My highlight was the small Dan Akroyd cameo near the beginning and I especially loved the scene in the bar a bit later on when Adam Sandler whips out a bottle of Akroyd's crystal head vodka - the best, most subliminal bit of product placement I have ever seen in a movie. I was the only person in the cinema giggling at this!","30 out of 66 found this helpful.

The only reason I decided to view this film was because of the actors; Angela Demo, Barbara McCarthy, Jason Knight and John Buchan certainly done a great job on the casting. I have always been a big fan of Adam Sandler and Ashley Benson so although my opinions may be slightly biased, the film genuinely made me laugh and not many films can do that. The plot is entirely unrealistic but the visuals are interesting and different from anything that is already out there.I really liked the costume design in this movie, the clothing and style gave the characters personality and contributed well to the overall feel of the movie. I loved how the location of film changes, from different cities. The establishing shots helped to set the mood for each scene and kept the film flowing.Even if you are not a fan of this genre of movie and haven't particularly enjoyed Adam Sandler's work in the past then you should watch purely for the soundtrack alone, with music from Queen, even if you hate the film it makes the whole 106 minutes worth it.","18 out of 37 found this helpful.

On a traditional (and reassuring) narrative pattern Authors built a film which is, under many aspects, innovative.The idea is funny (credits should be given to French artist Patrick Jean and his 2012 short 'Pixels' for inspiration and further graphic development). The moral message is relaxing (being awkward doesn't mean that you can't be President of the United States, at least as long as you'll stay close to your loser friends). And the visual impact is great.Chris Columbus has the gift of creating entertaining and amazing images (remember the Gryffindor's Quidditch from the first Harry Potter?) and if you'll turn your brain off you'll be nicely amused: it's a kids movie.","22 out of 48 found this helpful.

I got to the end of Pac-Man. I could play forever on Robotron: 2084. To this day I have MAME always loaded on a PC and I go through the old games. I do love Skyrim and Super Hexagon, so as a gamer, I'm complete. I read all the bad reviews on Pixels, but I just had to see it for myself. I was pleasantly surprised.I never cared for Adam Sandler's other films, having only sit through Happy Gilmore. I couldn't stomach much else of his. But maybe he gets better as he ages, or I get more tolerant as I do. Either way, I couldn't find a single bad thing about this film. If you're an old school gamer, this movie is a great treat.The footage of the old arcade games in the beginning - the games didn't have video screen artifacts. Basically, they weren't pixellated as they were supposed to be. I forgave that. I mean, who cares, really? That's about the only inconsistency I could find, and it was trivial.The film was entertaining from beginning to end. Especially nice was during the end credits. They replay the entire movie in 8-bit format. It was easy to see that Pixels was a labor of love, and I guess you have to be an old school gamer to appreciate it all. This is a classic, and I'm happy to be alive to have gotten to see this. I can imagine what it's like to be Stan Lee, and see all your superhero creations come to life as some of the most successful films of all time. To see the 80's arcade culture brought to life and memorialized in Pixels, it's a similar feeling, one that all gamers can share.I highly recommend this film. I give it a perfect score. Well deserved.","16 out of 33 found this helpful.

The animation fully expresses the world of '80s video games wonderfully. As a previous reviewer stated this film is destined to become a cult classic.

Typical Sandler humour all the way through with a good splash of quality gags (although the cheesy Sandler slapstick does show it's face occasionally). The story: Aliens receive a message from earth including some retro- computer game footage. They take said footage as a declaration of war and.... yeah, you get the idea. Sandler and some of his childhood friends who were/are computer game pro's are drafted in by the government (who else) to fight the threat. Now... Just go watch the movie, it's worth the wear and tear on the eyes. Trust me.p.s. It has Peter Dinklage in it.

(Seriously, any movie with Kevin James as POTUS can't be taken seriously.) There will certainly be a generation gap with the audience in this film. Some will get it, some won't. My wife and I (both born in the early/mid 70's) took our kids (7, 9, 11) assuming they would probably enjoy it more than us. We were wrong. My wife and I were belly-laughing much of the time. And our kids laughed, too, but they didn't get most of it. (Our Singaporean audience didn't get a lot of the jokes, either.) Maybe we're just old enough to relate to these washed up gamers spending summers in front of REAL arcade games, where you had 3 lives before you had to cough up another quarter. When Max Headroom unexpectedly pops on the Silver Screen and starts to speak, how can you NOT laugh (if you even know who he is)?!?! Take a step back to your childhood (or a step in the childhood of your parents) and sit down to watch this one. It's predictable, and you may even roll your eyes a couple of times, but it WILL make you laugh. It could even become a cult classic...","18 out of 39 found this helpful.

Is this movie masterpiece theater? Far from it. Will it win best picture at the Academy Awards? Highly unlikely. Will it enthrall 40 year olds who grew up with arcade games? Chances are, most will. I just stepped out of the theater and I must confess I enjoyed PIXELS very, very much, despite reading the god awful reviews by ""film critics"" as well as pimp faced IMDb readers. I agree that Adam Sandler's fortunes at the box office have been on a down slide for some years now but then again, he was never that ""big"" of a draw, like say, Eddie Murphy in his prime. I guess if you try to over analyze any of Sandler's films you're going to wind up seriously depressed. PIXELS is big, dumb fun, full of 80's references (the arcade games, the music, hell, even MTV!). I won't describe the movie because other users have done eloquently so. I'll just stick with my very positive praises for this movie. My daughters, who have nothing to do with 80's culture, both enjoyed the movie a whole lot. True, my kids know most of the games that appear in the movie and see them come to life and interact with real characters was a roller-coaster ride. There's Pacman, Defender, Frogger, Q- Bert, Galaga, Asteroids, Space Invaders and of course, Donkey Kong. Certainly the over 40 crowd out there will enjoy it, but young kids will too.Plus, as a GAME OF THRONES fan, it was a rush seeing Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage in here, and having CHEAP TRICK kicking off the movie is always good in my book!I'm buying this on bluray as soon as it comes out!","24 out of 55 found this helpful.

Adam Sandler plays his usual humble character who starts out as a loser and ends up with impressing the girl and doing the seeming impossible. He came up with a novel scenario and meets the fun needs of the viewers. At least the ones who didn't start out the movie intending to hate it.MY OWN TAKE ON IT was that it was an update of Ghostbusters, and even included ghosts of a sort (PACMAN ghosts) in the process. It was pretty much Bill Murray and company battling surreal enemies, engaging in witty repartee with the heroine, and using similar pasted-together high-tech devices to battle the enemy with. I was half expecting ""Don't cross the streams!"" somewhere along the line.

The movie doesn't have a lot of hard laughs and every time there was an opportunity for one, it dropped the ball. That being said there are lots of chuckles.The cast works really well together but that's not a shock because most of them are part of the Happy Madison family. PIXELS doesn't really pick up until we see Josh Gad. Adam Sandler may be the star of the film but all the best lines and funny parts are given to Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage. Also, keep your eyes open for Dan Aykroyd and the product placement of his crystal head vodka.PIXELS has a nice blend of light laughs, romance, sci-fi, gun action and car action. The film moves at a nice pace and it goes by fast. This film is fun for the whole family, young and old; the music is a 80s greatest hits soundtrack and really ties the film together.The c.g is fun, cute and really well done... One thing that bugged me the first time I watched PIXELS was that Q-Burt could talk. But then after the 2nd viewing, I figured that he is an alien not the real game character and he is a big part of the movie so he has to speak. Another thing that PIXELS does is point out the generation gap, but as someone who plays a lot of classic arcade games, I'm shocked that some kids don't know about arcades. Hopefully this film will make younger kids want to find and play arcade classics.I'm so happy about this film, I was hoping for big laughs and even though there weren't any, it wasn't a let down. The story was good, the action was fun and it was awesome seeing my favorite classic arcade games come to life in the real world.

Round of applause for this fantastic movie. Watch this amazing movie as soon as you can!","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Retro vibe is nice.Visuals are good, especially last battle scene is superbly done with a lot of funky
familiar pixelated retro game characters.Even Adam Sandler I can stomach in this movie.If you go into this with no expectations, you might be pleasantly surprised. It's surely not everyone's cup of tea.For geeks born before 1980-1990 this has some extra layers and can evoke a bit of nostalgia.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sure the story may not be rhe greatest and stuff but does that really mean you should complain? It's not really about that and it's mostly for people at a young age and those who played these games when they we were younger. It's extremely nostalgic and the cameos are amazing. I really liked the sound/music choices and a nice editing style that really does fit.

I could never get the handle of Defender, though. So this movie spoke to me right from the opening shot. So our future hero's are the nerds of their time taking part in a great Arcade Shoot-Out, where it comes down to two players, Eddie, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Dinklage, who gives a nice air of sleaziness to the character and his ""Hard Guy"" voice is great, and Brenner, played by Sandler (who does another great portrayal of Adam Sandler :-) ).Brenner loses and this loss paves the way for his future fate as he never quite gets to become the person he dreamed of in his youth. However, his best friend Will Cooper fares better and is elected as the President of the United States. So when the strange attacks on the Good Ol' US of A cause concern and the heads of security cannot figure out what is happening President Cooper spots something familiar on a video clip and calls in his friend Brenner for help.This is a totally outlandish plot, which the actors, writers, and director do a fantastic job of playing straight and make the comedy about the situations and narrative. The scene where the creator of Pacman meets his ""Sweet Little Boy"" is well thought out and is a perfect example of this.And the scene where Brian Cox's and Sean Bean's characters become ""Extra Close"" made me laugh out loud... very loud... loved it. The director, Chris Columbus, uses all of the actors and each of them gives a good performance to build character and comedic situations. Not one of them feels like they would rather be elsewhere; this makes for a better film. He also keeps the pace going as the action ramps up to the finale.To be honest, I cannot find a single fault with this film. Yes, Adam Sandler's acting dexterity isn't of the highest calibre, but in this film, he tones down the outrageousness of some of his previous movies and it works well within the story and movie, so it's not a drawback here.And since I can relate to the film, as well as it making me laugh a lot and giving me a nice warm and happy feeling, this has now elevated it to the upper ranks of my favourite comedy films.I would recommend this to all, just sit back and let the happy come...","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's an enjoyable film with funny characters, tight direction by family film veteran Chris Columbus, a decent script, and good acting by everyone involved. My only guess is that the backlash is due to one factor and one factor only - Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison crew were involved in the project. Not that Sandler was bad in the film, he was as good as he ever was. I think it's more of a bias built on a foundation of bad/sub-par movies that Sandler has released in recent years (i.e. ""Grown Up's 2"", ""Just Go With It"", ""Jack and Jill"", ""That's My Boy"" etc.), but I think that people are letting their resentment of Sandler cloud their judgement on this film which is a delightful family film rooted in a ton of 80's arcade game nostalgia. The film and everyone involved don't deserve that and if people would just ease up on their biases a bit then they'd see that the movie is a fun fantasy romp with likable characters and an interesting premise developed from a French short film of the same name. Sure the story is far-fetched, but it was a fun ride and is a movie that is a great Saturday night flick with the kids. Not to go into too much detail, but the premise of the story is simple - It is 1982 and Sam Brenner (Sandler) is a teenage arcade game whiz who is talked into enter the World Video Game Championships by his friend Will Cooper (James). During the championships, Sam and Will meet another contestant, an eccentric young kid named Ludlow Lamansoff (Gad). In the finals Sam has to face-off with Eddie ""Fireblaster"" Plant (Dinklage), another teenage arcade game whiz. Sam eventually loses to Plant and it haunts him for the rest of his life. In the current day, Sam has grown up to become a Audio/Video installer and Will Cooper has become the President of the United States. After a mysterious attack it is discovered that a video of the 1982 World Championships was sent into outer space on a probe. The probe was intercepted by an alien civilization and the games on the video were misinterpreted as a threat by the aliens who proceed to develop weaponry similar tot he games to battle Earth in winner-take-all battle. Once it is discovered that the aliens are using old arcade games to fight us, President Cooper employs Sam, Ludlow, and Eddie to help use their old-school gamer skills to team up and stave off the attackers. Again, this a fun movie that really ignites old-school arcade/video game nostalgia and does a great job of interweaving old games into the modern time-line of the film. I highly recommend it to anyone.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The great thing about this movie is how they got nerds, vintage video games and aliens, put them into a blender and mix this caper, because they pulled it off!!! I find it organic. All these non-related subjects mingle so well everything fits and makes sense.
I've seen this flick a bunch of times and I always have a ball. The cast pulls it off and Dinklage is very funny.
So much fun!!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

So called ""professional critics"" gave it negative reviews. No surprise. Our world is full of evil people. Cinema critics should find some real job and stop typing letters.

It's bright-eyed warm electo-nostalgic vibe will vaporise the smudgy marks left by the critics that almost universally panned it at its birth. First of all I find Sandler's essential charm unfaded here, just mellowed somewhat, and note he's playing the part of a parody of his character anyway. You'd have to be very unkind not to realise there's something of an interesting satire on early videogame and nerd culture here, mixed into this ambitious work, that is more than a little tongue-in-cheek from start to finish about itself. Perhaps when it came out it was just a little too soon from the early eighties to develop a nostalgic yearning for the subject matter that now feels self evident viewing it couple of decades or more on. The interesting mixture of blocky CG graphics & countless cuboid physical props on the other hand seems almost timeless, perfectly credible, and appropriate to the low-res monitor milieu, and visually it doesn't even seem especially dated. It's a great package, a dizzy pot purri of busy action, funny dialogue and effective acting. One has to admit to the rather formulaic plot, but it does nevertheless serve to anchor the manic energy down enough to give the film a firm, reassuring positive story arc that overall serves to cater for a pretty wide demographic, then, and now, and indeed long may Pixels entertain the whole family for future generations too.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had few friends. But I loved the music of the eighties like Olivia Newton- John,Duran Duran,Spandau Ballet,Michael Jackson,Lionel Richie,Huey Lewis and the News,Robert Palmer,Debbie Gibson,George Michael and Rick Astley etc. And I loved my Atari 600XL computer. My personal favorite video games were of course Pac-Man,Q-Bert,Space Invaders,Donkey Kong,Frogger,Pole Position and my personal favorites were Star Raiders were you fly your ship across the galaxy and wipe out enemy ships in other sectors and Star Wars the Arcade Game. I really liked Adam Sandler as well as Kevin James and Josh Gad and Michelle Monaghan in this movie,and I loved the part where Pac-Man eats his creator's arm off.

It was entertaining, funny, and fast paced. I found the acting decent and the premise entertaining. Plus Qbert adds one extra star just himself. Especially if you were a kid in the 80s you could totally appreciate this. Not only for the arcade games and the nostalgia of our childhood. But it almost feels like a movie from the 80s. But with better quality and some awesome CGI. It's nothing serious. It's just fun and entertaining. Nothing you have to think about like the a ghost busters, or something. I think some people take them selves to seriously and think they're film critics. No, this is not an Oscar-winning film nor was it intended to be. It's fun it's cute and when you just want to be entertained, it's wonderful. Sometimes you don't feel like deep emotional movies. Sometimes you just want some plain and simple entertainment. And if that is you try this movie out, I promise you you won't regret it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I purchased 10 and was going to get those two free ones come hell or high water.I fall into that perfect age group where I would spend the weekend at the video arcade playing the games highlighted in this movie so I figured there was a chance that I would like this one. I don't quite get all the hate directed at this movie, it's obviously intended to me mindless entertainment where you enjoy a hearty laugh.Don't over think it, if you're middle aged, grab a soda and bowl of popcorn, maybe even snag the kids if you can pull them away from the PlayStation or Xbox and share some laughs.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Kids from the 80s all remembered the arcades. Filled with games who's images were a blend of pixelated images which brought many fun hours to everyone's lives. These arcades were considered the coolest places to hang out, sadly these days with the ever fast pace moving technology video game arcades are fading out fast... this story reminds us of those fun days.

I feel she could have at least have some spoken words in the movie, she is one of my favorite actresses but her overall appearance was enough for me.

The actors where the ones who bought be, Adam Sandler and Peter Dinklage, I was curious how he performs in another thing than Game of Thrones and it's fabulous, he's such a versatile actor. Adam Sandler did his part perfect as expected in a comedy, which is a territory almost ruled by him, one of my favourite.

He starts off as a Naval Aviator in the briefing room, then he is wearing NFO wings on the BDU's to being undesignated in Khakis.Being a former naval aviator, myself reaching the rank of CDR. I catch those kinds of movie mistakes that feature the military. USN officers would wear both ribbons and wings on the Khakis. The wings of pilots and Naval Flight Officers have slight differences to them and an officer would find it hard to change designators especially at the rank of O-10.Lt. Colonel Patten should also have been wearing her cover in all the scenes she was outside while in uniform.Outside of those very minor mistakes on military uniforms that most people won't even catch I would say this is a movie worth watching and adding to your DVD collection.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Never the less, i found this movie quite hilarious and entertaining.This movie made me feel so happy that i was born in between the 20th and 21st century so that i can enjoy and understand this movie a tad more than some others.First of all i want to address the elephant in the room and by that i mean the ""Adam Sandler is a terrible actor"" bandwagon. Eh, i strongly disagree whit this, Adam is a great actor, the things that put him down are bad scripts, but in this movie he did an amazing job.Never in my life have i seen a movie about video games, and actually be good. I thought there was a good reason that this movie had such a low rating, so i set off to investigate and i came back whit pretty much nothing apart from the ""bandwagon"" i talked about earlier and the fact of people saying that this movie is not ""realistic,"" its a movie with 80's video games for crying out loud.This movie has surpassed my expectations and also made me giggle like a school girl. It had an interesting story (as far as video games go).Also, hats off to the CGI department, simply amazing animations, it really felt as if the actors were actually where they seem to be.So, if you like 80's video games, like a nice comedy and have a spare 1 hour and 46 minutes on your hands i really recommend you watch this movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And he save the world. My favorite part was cuber was when cuber was jumping in the trampoline and he fell. And a cone is PAC man and Donkey Kong takes allot of time to go to the world.

However, the film's execution is subpar. While it has some laughs and is better than recent Sandler films like ""That's My Boy,"" ""Blended,"" and ""The Cobbler,"" the material could have been better if placed in the right hands. The film's squandered execution makes it almost more painful to watch than the typical Sandler stinker, as it could have been a better film if placed in the right hands. In 1982, NASA launched a capsule containing popular culture examples to reach alien life forms. The capsule contained a cassette of a video game championship featuring arcade masters. However, a hostile alien force intercepted the tape, deeming it an act of war, and sent down large, malevolent versions of the characters to attack Earth. The aliens' actions were interpreted as a threat to Earth's fate. Spaceships from ""Galaga"" rain pixilated horror in Peru, a ""Centipede"" game broke out over London's Hyde Park, and New York City's grid-like layout set the stage for the world's largest Pac-Man game. In a time of crisis, the President (Kevin James) decides to bring in old-school gamers to help stop the invading forces. Sam Brenner, his childhood best friend, is joined by Ludlow, a paranoid conspiracy buff with an unhealthy obsession towards Lady Lisa from ""Dojo Girl."" Eddie ""The Fireblaster"" Plant, who beat Sam at the Donkey Kong game, also joins the group but carries a shocking secret that could lead to the world's destruction. Lt. Col. Violet van Patten, a specialist who creates weaponry for the invaders, is also included in the group. Despite her role as a girl in a movie aimed at adolescent boys, she is a brilliant specialist who creates the weaponry to be used against the invaders. The film highlights the importance of bringing in old-school gamers to help combat the invading forces. ""Pixels"" may appeal to some viewers with nostalgia for arcade games like ""Donkey Kong,"" but it quickly loses its potential. The film could have been better, but it quickly loses its ghost. Despite this, Hollywood is remaking films quickly, making it likely that they will continue to do this one again. However, the film's potential for improvement is limited, and it's likely that the film will be remade in the future. Pixels is a movie starring Adam Sandler as a self-pitying tech repairman who hits on the only female character, Michelle Monaghan, while she's crying in a cupboard. The movie is aimed at family audiences but built around references only over-30s would get. The director, Chris Columbus, elevates the material a little, but there's little of the charm or wit of his Harry Potter entries. The movie has two novel twists: the villains are classic 8-bit video-game characters inspired by a 2010 French short by Patrick Jean, and the usual hero types are replaced by Adam Sandler and his slacker band, including Kevin James as POTUS. David Spade doesn't appear as director of the NSA, probably only because of scheduling. While there was potential for a decent summer movie, the finished product boils down to three fun set-pieces and lots of dull, drecky filler. The movie's potential for a decent summer movie was there, but it ultimately boils down to three fun set-pieces and lots of dull, drecky filler.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Despite this i could really enjoy seeing those very old games on the big screen and seeing the characters in them.Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief on some aspects like Kevin James as President but this movie is about old video characters attacking the world so duh...This is the kind of movie where you buckle your seat belt, have a few drinks and watch for the laugh and thats about it.

Honestly, I was expecting something humorless and stupid. However, it was a crazy, humorous film. It sort of reminded me of a live action version of Wreck it Ralph.Adam Sandler's acting could have been much better, but not his worst either (save that for 1989s Going Overboard). Kevin James wasn't bad as Cooper, the President of the United States. He was genuine.I did think it was great that Sandler included, literally his entire family in the film. But I wondered why his wife didn't play his love interest. Awkward!?The graphics of the film were great too, especially loved the way they used the CGI to make the old 8-bit computer characters. The Pac-man chase was the highlight of the film. And the ending was pretty good too, featuring an array of first generation characters, and Donkey Kong as the final boss battle. I think kids may like the film, but needless to say, watch with an adult as the film is rated PG-13. The younger kids may know a few of the game characters.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Finally, a movie that is just plain FUN from start to finish. I had such a good time watching this, it seemed altogether too short. I wanted more.While this film may or may not appeal to those who have never enjoyed video games, it will certainly appeal to anyone who loves fantasy and enjoys movies for pure escapism. And for those who do like video games, especially anyone who, like myself, grew up playing the classic games portrayed in this movie, prepare for a rollicking great time. For people who actually played some of the original video games in arcades when they first came out, this film is a genuine treat. It is like seeing some of the characters from those old games come to life - in fact, they are larger than life.As far as jokes, dialogue and humor, Pixels delivers over and over, with lines and situations that will make you laugh out loud, and cheer and root for the underdogs and others as well. Not only is Adam Sandler back in rare form, but the rest of the cast is given great lines and executes them beautifully. I really did have one of the most fun times I've had watching a movie in years. It was a joy to just laugh and let go into the pure escapism which truly did deliver what a movie like this should deliver.If video games aren't your thing, you may still very well love this funny, silly and engaging farce. And if they are your thing, and you can appreciate characters from some of the games that started it all coming to life and creating havoc in the world, this film is absolutely not to be missed. Check it out, you will love it!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie was absolutely entertaining. I actually don't understand the low ratings. The acting are just right with their character and the story of the movie. I enjoyed Josh Gad's acting (oh come on! He was funny here!).If you feel disappointed after watching this movie because you think it was silly, (like Adam Sandler's acting was bland or why the heck Kevin James was the president) -- then I think you just have the wrong expectation for this movie.I would feel bad if you were not entertained at all. (Maybe ask yourself.. what is wrong with me ? Why didn't I enjoy that ?)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The story was crap (trailer) but then IT TURNED AROUND 100%","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3691723/?ref_=tt_urv","joefuzzy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24172429/?ref_=tt_urv","23 April 2017","I am sorry guys. I am sorry to tell you that your reviews, even though I like the general ratings of IMDb a lot and often they reflect my own, are total garbage in this case. And here is why: After seeing the trailer for Pixels I thought to myself ""Omg, what a stupid storyline, it does not make any sense and it looks stupid."" So I did not go to the cinema, because I didn't like the trailer. But when it actually arrived on Netflix I just couldn't help myself and watched it (I am a huge fan of Kevin Smith and Michelle Monaghan and I kinda like Adam Sandler sometimes). After I whitnessed the explanation for the entire story to be fantastic (SPOILER ALERT: NASA sent games into space and an alien race thought it was a declaration of war) I really enjoyed its comedy and special effects as well as all the characters (except Piter Dinklage's character who was just annoying af) a lot. I do not see a single flaw in the entire movie to be totally honest. Of course it is a popcorn type of blockbuster and nothing in comparison to One Flew Over the Coocoo's Nest or Pulp Fiction, but for what it was meant to be (to entertain) it was of supreme quality. Kevin Smith as a failed president was more convincing than Bill Pullman in Independence Day and the entire cast was believable, especially Monaghan did a great job playing the snobby White House employee. And oh man, the jokes were genius. I laughed my *** *** when Adam Sandler asked if no one was disgusted by his friend kissing a small green alien that suddenly changed into the woman of his dreams. And the final scene where their babies jumped around, I nearly died.So, please, for the love of god: If you are a true gamer and haven't seen the movie: WATCH IT. Thank you for allowing me to enhance your perspective on excellent movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is an exploitation movie for the nostalgic. The script is bad. The story is left at the one page offer to the movie studio. Overall a waste of time.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

In fact Pixels just may be his best work since the Wedding Singer The plot is simple. In 1985 the US sends up into space a sample of its culture including video games. Now its 2015 and the Aliens believing they were challenged come to earth and attack us using video games characters. The only hope is to assemble a team of nerds who once ruled the video arcades in the 80s. To battle for the fate of the Earth. Intriguing story great execution. This movie lets the viewer use his or her imagination. And in the end it provides great entertainment. after all isn't that what a movie is supposed to do ? Entertain us ? Don't listen to the so called expert critics watch it yourself and make your own judgement. I'll bet you will be surprised at how much you like it and how much your kids will like it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The direction and screenplay are both terrible. Both the casting and acting are terrible also. All in all I would give this zero out of a possible five stars.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
