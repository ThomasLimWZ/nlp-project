I actually found Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz to be entertaining additions, but the story felt cobbled together and it was riddled with plot holes. I know Natasha is a very skilled assassin, for instance, but she's almost invulnerable in this. It probably would have been better to give Black Widow her solo film a year or two after Iron Man 2 came out.","99 out of 116 found this helpful.

The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie.","195 out of 275 found this helpful.

And while it wasn't anything groundbreaking, it was still a fun watch. Taking into consideration the splash of spy genre, a pack of new and interesting characters, plenty of action and intensity, I'd say this wasn't a bad movie. It's something exciting, while not totally memorable in the large expanse of the MCU. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh both did great. David Harbor's character was good and definitely became a favorite in the movie, but I think he still has some things to unravel. The ending ""big reveal"" was kind of mediocre, but the final fight swept it under the rug mostly. Hopefully we'll get more of some of these characters in the future so they'll have the time they need to grow. Overall, if you haven't watched it and want a movie to watch while you're bored, I'd recommend this one.","29 out of 40 found this helpful.

But I enjoyed it because finally, I get to see where Black Widow came from. It's nice to see some of what made her, her. It is a shame that they didn't get more into it. I think the movie really could have given us more about the ruthless training and experiences that Widow had to endure. A lot of the movie was implied but not shown.The plot was simple. It was nice to have some new heroes and villains. I really liked the cast and the jokes were fun. But as I said before the plot is very simple. Pretty much about killing a guy, a guy that we really didn't know or have any bad feelings for because we barely even got to see the man being evil. The movie lacked on showing the power of the widows. They had very spaced out and very few scenes of them.I did enjoy the sister dynamic of the two girls. It was fun to see them both in action and it was fun to see them bicker with each other. In a way it is a sad movie. With what happened in the previous film. Did it do the Black Widow Justice? Some. It really could have been better by showing more. It missed all the heart string moments. Giving us more of an eye candy film with not much depth.""Your pain only makes you stronger""","5 out of 5 found this helpful.

Black Widow, though, has a lot in common with James Bond movies. There's even a scene in which 007 is playing on TV. The Black Widow must stop a Russian General called Dreykov, a sort of SPECTRE czar megalomaniac who ""rescues"" unwanted girls and turns them into super assassins, called widows. Widows go through extensive training. A select few get chosen. The rest are killed. This makes Dreykov a monstrous misogynist, in a movie, directed by a woman, Cate Shortland, which has unmistakable feminist themes. There are two main Black Widows: Scarlett Johansson's character, and Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh. Belova is impulsive where Romanoff is introspective. The two are sisters only in that they grew up as part of a Russian cell, in an Ohio suburb, along with Rachel Weisz as their brilliant scientist mother, and David Harbour, as Red Guardian, Russia's version of Captain America, as the dad.The action set pieces, and fight scenes were good, but no better or worse than your typical Marvel Avenger movie. There are the standard wisecracks, as Johansson and Pugh riff on each other. Yelena teases Natasha's signature landing move, with one arm extended behind, the other hand on the floor, and legs spread apart, a fighting stance Yelena finds diva-like and pretentious, and is disgusted with herself when performing the same pose. The chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh is nimble and enjoyable. The scenes with David Harbour, arm wrestling people in a gulag prison, are also very funny. In summary, this is a solid, fun Marvel movie, with a hint we will be seeing more of Black Widow Yelena Belova.","58 out of 91 found this helpful.

Too many people expected full comic book accuracy with Taskmaster, which would have been hard to accomplish and harder to fit in the story they were trying to tell. I understand the disappointment from fans who expected that full Taskmaster story, but do not think it means that this movie was a flop. Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense. At least make it clear the shows are a must watch if you are going to make them necessary to understand certain things.

When a production studio spends so much money and time in delivering a film as entertaining as Black Widow is, and people pay a mere ~$14 to see, then complain about it not being any good, you know they're straight up in dire need of a new hobby.The thing is, that it isn't really just individuals doing this. Recently there was some minor celebrity who was quoted as saying he felt bad for ScarJo and that she could have picked a better film to be in. Now this from a guy who next year will probably be auditioning for Subway commercials. Are these types of stories meant to stir up controversy, ergo 'talk', and as such, free advertising in the form of posts across social media?Either way, what a disservice for those who simply enjoy good movies.Was Black Widow a ""10""? No. Is it a Shawshank Redemption or Godfather? Of course not. But when you take the drivel that's out there earning 6's and 7s, to relegate Black Widow to earning anything less than a SOLID 7.5/8, is pretty sad.They story was extremely well-acted by everyone involved. Not one actor was out-of-step. More so, it was amazingly well-crafted in that it offered us a FULL back-story on Natasha Romanoff and answered as many questions as possible without over-cramming or becoming bogged down with surplus material. Beyond that, like all of Disney/Marvel offerings, it was funny. The humor ranges from simple to tongue-in-cheek to more complex, and is scattered throughout the film a'la Joss Whedon style. It is a feel-good movie full of action, heartfelt family moments, and the underlying sadness of knowing it is a prologue to the eventual end of the Black Widow's tale.","182 out of 309 found this helpful.

This was a nice change of pace from the typical superhero fare that Marvel does so well, but so many times that it often just the same story with the heroes and villains shuffled about.To my eyes this came across as a Bond film on steroids (with a nice nod to him in an easter egg that gave me a grin when I saw it). The acting was stellar with Pugh stealing the show and solidly puts her in the most likely to be seen again in the MCU. Don't pay attention to all the negative reviews. Just strap in for a fun new ride in the MCU.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

So the whole MCU deal is not really something that gets me worked up. Sure, I watch the superhero movies because they provide adequate entertainment and have over the top special effects, and that is about it.So of course I ended up watching ""Black Widow"" as well, as I was presented with the opportunity to watch it. I went in expecting little in terms of proper entertaining, believing it to be yet another visually astounding experiences that covers up for a shallow storyline.And I was actually genuinely entertained and surprised with the outcome of ""Black Widow"". This movie was a movie that felt like a good old fashioned fast paced action movie. Especially since there weren't superhero powers involved here, so this 2021 movie was up alongside the likes of ""Batman"" in terms of me having an interest in it.The storyline told in ""Black Widow"", as written by
Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson was actually interesting and turned out to be more than just your average superhero smackdown. I liked the story told here, and it definitely added depth to the Natasha Romanoff character (played by Scarlett Johansson).Visually then you will be in for another top notch special effects galore, as with all other Marvel superhero movies. The special effects teams that worked on ""Black Widow"" definitely delivered, and then some. This movie was through the roof.The action scenes in ""Black Widow"" were fast paced and adrenaline filled, which was something that really appealed to me.""Black Widow"" does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel Weisz and a short appearance by William Hurt.I have no doubts that the 2021 movie ""Black Widow"" from director Cate Shortland is not going to please the fans of the MCU, as someone like me (not at all a fan of the superhero genre) could be more than genuinely entertained.My rating of ""Black Widow"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.","172 out of 383 found this helpful.

The action scenes in the dark rooms were really bad, because all the characters are dressed in similar black uniforms, so I had no idea who was doing what most of the time. I guess this was all CGI? It was impossible to follow.Black Widow is not very interesting, and most of the best lines come from her sister (Florence Pugh), and her father, the Red Guardian (David Harbour). The comic book version of Red Guardian was totally tough super-soldier, but in the movie he is just a fat has-been, like Thor in the last Avengers Endgame movie. Harbour is mostly around for comedy, but he is a good actor, and makes his role interesting.Rachel Weisz plays the Black Widow's mother, and it is a pretty generic performance. The story is really odd, as Weisz is the brains of the Russian spy system but she is on a farm doing brain control experiments on pigs.The main Russian spy master was a very generic Russian character talking about world domination and power. He could have been from SPECTRE. The guy reminded me of Blofeld, and several other SPECTRE leaders from past James Bond movies.TaskMaster was a very unique and interesting character in the comic books, and he is totally destroyed as a character in this movie. His entire back-story, character, and everything about TaskMaster is changed, and not for the better.This movie takes place after Captain America: Civil War, and before the Avengers versus Thanos movies. It seems like this movie should have been done and released about five years ago, and it is out of place in the current Marvel Timeline.","68 out of 117 found this helpful.

The highlight is Florence Pugh as Yelena, who I hope we see more of.The movie has lots of flaws, but works well enough as a standard summer action flick. I think the average person would enjoy it, and it could be a good entry point into the MCU.

You're never going to actually enjoy movies if you're doing that, you care way too much.I always loved Black Widow and Scarlett Johansson and she fits very well on the MCU. Unfortunately, her 6 movie contract ended and after the events of Endgame I don't think we'll ever see her character again, and that's exactly why I love this movie so much, because it gives us an ending on her story and closure to one of the most loved characters on the entire universe.Also I'm not sure if Florence is now supposed to take her place since it seems like every original Avenger is giving the role further to someone else but I'd love to see more of her too. She did not carried the movie tho, that's still Scarlett.Also what makes the movie even greater and gives you goosebumps is the opening credits with Malia J's cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" which fits perfectly with the emotional story.10/10 I loved it so much makes me wanna buy a ticket to it and watch it again even tho I just watched it.","97 out of 179 found this helpful.

The Black Widow does not comply to this organization anymore and goes her own way, to even bring down that organization. The action, acting, directing, not top notch, but mediocre-good. Compared to the last chick flick, Wonder Woman 1984, this movie is a lot better, but still a struggle to get trough. The first half of the movie there is an overload of action scenes, but they are all the same, women who roll around the neck of an opponent to work them down to the floor, over and over again, like it's the only move they have ever learned. Then there is a homecoming scene that goes on for ever and ever, so boring. And then off course the boss level end-scene. My advise, if you have nothing else to watch or to do, you could give this movie a try, if you never see this movie, then you have missed out nothing.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

Or mostly solo - she's joined, at times, by her ""unique"" family: father Alexi (Harbour), mother Melina (Weisz) and sister Yelena (Pugh). There's plenty of backstory there and it's well handled.Having Pugh & Harbour actually added way more humour than I was expecting, which was good to see and helped keep things moving. However, this is primarily a Bond-style action-packed car-chase into explosion into hand-to-hand-combat film. And that's what 'Black Widow' should be - she has no super-powers, after all. The plot involves Natasha going after ""the Red Room"", which is the spy agency that programmed her to be an assassin. Dreykov (Winstone) and the skull-helmeted semi-cyborg (no spoilers!) are OK as the bad guys, even if they don't have that much screen time.Pretty satisfying conclusion, with the post-credits scene linking back into some of the Marvel TV shows. I enjoyed all the scenes with Harbour, but Pugh steals the show, with some solid stunts/fights, but mostly her well-placed quips. It's also a fitting conclusion if this is the last time we see Johansson as Black Widow, as she's so assured in the role that you feel light at home when she's on screen. Bring on Phase 4!","112 out of 209 found this helpful.

In this movie they really mess him up by changing his entire character.

While hiding out in Norway, Natasha is attacked by a supersoldier known as Taskmaster who is after a package containing several vials sent to her by her estranged adoptive sister Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) who like Natasha was raised to be an assassin as part of the program The Red Room. Natasha reunites with Yelena learning the vials are an antidote to chemical conditioning used on other ""Widows"" like Yelena with the seemingly defunct Red Room still operating under the direction of General Dreykov (Ray Winstone). With the antidote in hand and chased by Task Master, the two setoff to gather information from former spies and adoptive parents Axeis Shostakov (David Harbour) and Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) and set out to bring down the Red Room and free the Widows under Dreykov's control.Black Widow is the long in development stand alone entry focusing on the longtime MCU character Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow who despite being present from Iron Man 2 and appearing prominently in both the Captain America series and Avengers films, had a standalone film featuring the character lingering in development hell despite audience demand for the character. The reason for the delays were often attributed to the ""crowded"" MCU schedule with the Black Widow film often losing priority due to other more pressing films in terms of establishing the Infinity Saga and Thanos and the film went through multiple revisions and incarnations. When the film was completed, it was primed as a blockbuster for the 2020 movie season only like so many other films to be delayed until the following year due to the ongoing covid pandemic and upon release was at the lower end of MCU films due to the premier access on Disney+ among other factors. Critical and audience reception tended to skew mostly positive and I will say that despite my hesitance at a Black Widow movie this late in the MCU's life, the end result is a decent entry in the franchise.I think going into Black Widow with the series being a prequel, there was the lingering question of ""why does this need to exist?"". With Black Widow having died during the events of Avengers: Endgame and a story focusing on a brief blind spot shortly before the end of Captain America: Civil War, I think there were hurdles inherent to any prequel in that I already knew where the character would end up and we're now establishing characters and threads that don't have baring on current or future parts of the series. Despite the baggage associated with the premise, the movie does do a solid job of diving into Natasha's character and with the establishment of her ""family"" of sleeper spies the movie does go for something of a dysfunctional family dramedy intertwined with a spy flick by way of the MCU and I did actually enjoy many of the scenes featuring Natasha's fake family operating as if they were a real and estranged family. I particularly enjoyed David Harbour as Alexei who was a soviet superhero known as the Red Guardian who is sort of like a drunken bumbling counterpoint to Captain America and he walks the line between being funny and action oriented with his tight fitting Red Guardian costume making him a bit like Homer Simpson if he were a superhero. In terms of antagonists Task Masker and Dreykov are decent and provide legitimate threats for Yelena and Natasha to square off against, but they really don't stretch too far from the standard established by forerunners in this type of movie ranging from Le Femme Nikita to other examples like Anna, Salt, or Colombiana so there is that underlying familiarity the movie is working against, but the fact it plays it with more humor and character does help alleviate it to a point.In hindsight a Black Widow film probably should've come much earlier than it ultimately did and the fact that we're only getting one after the character is already dead does feel like it makes the film feel less impactful than it should. However despite the questionable need for a stand-alone Black Widow film I did enjoy the performances as well as the action beats making it a decent entry in the MCU.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Like us as fans, Scarlett Johansson has deserved it over the years and it's the only way to show it. Better late than never.The whole vibe is close to that of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", but I would not say that the overall idea is the same. The story is quite interesting and apart from Johansson's character, it also revolves around others that we will see in the future.This is not the traditional origin film, as the action takes place over several time periods, but on the other hand, it fills all the gaps and gives us the information we have needed for years.All the actors are great in their roles, but Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson stand out, mainly because of their relationship. There are a lot of emotional moments and honestly if the film had been released at the beginning of MCU, the effect would not be as strong as it is now, because over the years Natasha has become an important figure in this universe.Most of the dialogues are really strong meaningful, so you can realize, that over the years Natasha has become one of our favorite characters.The action is done with taste and you can realize by watching the fight choreography. There are several scenes between Natasha and Taskmaster, which are pure pleasure for the eye, although the Taskmaster story could be better.I hope that every true MCU fan will appreciate the movie in the right way - in the cinema. As every movie in the universe, there are some surprises, some of which are really nice.","36 out of 80 found this helpful.

Well, it does not, although some merits still may be highlighted. Funny and charismatic Alexei Shostakov (David Habour always shines!) and sinister and dangerous supervillain Taskmaster (besides an interesting concept, there is a nice background) are excellent characters. Dreykov is the revival of the archetypical cold war villain in Hollywood, a heartless schemer who uses science for strengthening Soviet Union and destroying freedom; off course that is silly in terms of understanding politics and reality, but he is an amusing fictional bad guy anyway. Natasha Romanoff and Melina Vostokoff are more layered characters, although script does not let them have a very sophisticated development, and outcome is not as remarkable as could be expected for so sikilled actresses such as Scarlett Johansson and Rachel Weisz. However, the movie has a serious drawback, which is much worse than the fact that the surprising mood in initial scene was not kept throughout the story. The greatest and serious drawback I refer to is called Yelena Belova. Her lines are bad, and her relationship with Black Widow is boring and takes a long time in the movie. Therefore, after a brilliant and promising beginning, the film moves to a boring family melodrama, and eventually becomes no more than a conventional action flick with few moments above average.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

However I felt his portrayal by David Habour was a fun take on the character.. If one wants to look at the bigger picturer. I feel that marvel is eventually going to jump the proverbial shark with regards to its superhero movies. The stories are going to get too convoluted, plot wholes are going to eventually appear. Simply installing more and more dangerous villans is going to get repetitive. Eventually will there be a villan that can eat entire galaxies? Stand alone narratives with a beginning middle and end usually appeals to me more and since this is a branch off the main Marvel movie trunk. I could enjoy it better than the Avengers movies.

However, the film:It starts of with me wishing the actors shut up, and I cringed and was wondering why I wasn't doing something else. But, it becomes quite nice after the first 10 minutes (and these 10 minutes are kind of crucial for the rest of the film).The story is okay, simple but exciting. Weighty yet lighthearted, humerous and not overly superhero centered (as in that 20 superheroes are fighting for 50% of a film and having debates and useless conversation for the rest, which I hate (and which makes me dislike a lot of marvel movies; especially 'the avengers')).As for the black widow as a character, this film helps build that for sure, and gives her new dimensions with respect to background and more.The Yelena girl is freaking hot, which makes this film a 7 and not a 6.Also, special effects were cool, but that s something marvel always nails.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Worth the wait...mostly","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7435960/?ref_=tt_urv","MoviePeek","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139667078/?ref_=tt_urv","12 October 2021","It's well known that female-led superhero films are few are far between, the reason being that the usual punching, kicking, and occasional killing done by the gents just isn't possible when it comes to the girls due to their obvious lack of arms and legs. Of course not, in reality, the reason behind the lack of representation is much more complex and would make everyone a lot more uncomfortable than a good-old-fashioned dash of violence, that if we're all being honest isn't the behavior of a person who has dealt with their emotional issues and has a healthy relationship with their parents.After making her debut in Iron Man 2 way back in 2010, Black Widow sees Natasha Romanoff finally given her own solo movie. Where she is at long last given the chance to put on full display her incredible super-spy skills. Picking up after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Natasha finds herself on her own after Tony and Steve beat the living daylights out of each other, thereby leaving a bit of an awkward atmosphere at the Avengers compound. Oh yeah, also the government is also hunting her down. This then leads to Nat embark on a perilous mission where she ultimately returns to Russia where she reunites a bunch of colourful characters who are her only hope to save the day.Superhero movies are more common than ever nowadays, with every character no matter how obscure or outlandish being given their time to shine on the big screen, this inevitably leads to some being awesome genre-defining pieces of work, others becoming a laughingstock before they are even released and some being so utterly mediocre, they are forgotten as quickly as a MacGuffin.It is my genuine pleasure to report that Black Widow falls into the more positive side of that spectrum, delivering great action scenes, spectacle, engaging characters, and most impressively of all expands Natasha's story in interesting and unexpected ways.The film undoubtedly marks Scarlett Johansson's best performance within the titular role, with Natasha's backstory being delved into and expanded upon in ways that don't bog the film down and make it feel like a paint by numbers origin story that is so often case. Instead, we are treated to a pulse-pounding opening sequence that explores Nat's childhood and in this humble review's opinion remains one of the best sequences Marvel has produced in recent memory.On the run from her own government, Natasha's day then goes from bad to worse when a terrifying skull masked lunatic mercenary named Taskmaster is sent in pursuit of her. Whenever a man in a skull mask makes a b-line for you, you know he isn't there to talk politics, the weather, or even about that game last night that you defiantly didn't see. No, he's there to kill you; Taskmaster is no exception. The good news is his ability to copy his opponent's moves makes for some tense and creative fight scenes and when The Taskmaster is onscreen, he has a genuinely creepy present. However, much like so many Marvel baddies, his motivation fails to rally genuine empathy from the audience or deliver Saturday morning cartoon camp fun, much like Hela or The Red Skull did so well. No Taskmaster in my opinion was a serviceable but ultimately underwhelming presence in the movie, and a little bit of a let-down.The film has more in common with Captain America: The Winter Soldier than the cosmic carnage of the Avengers movies, and as a result can deliver tense and grounded fights, in which the oh so killable heroes must use all their skills, wits, and occasionally those electric stick baton things to survive. The fight scenes are a real highlight of the film and demonstrate more so than ever before why a woman with no superpowers not only deserves but has earned her place on the Avengers squad alongside patriotic super-soldiers and zappy-lightning gods.Marvel has delved more and more into the cosmic side of the Marvel universe in recent years with films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok, with great success delivering some of their best films. But Black Widow demonstrates that there is still a place in all that camp space-bound craziness for more grounded and realistic slices of this universe. Don't get me wrong, the film is by no means a Mike Leigh film, and requires you to suspend your disbelief like all superhero movies, but never in an insulting way that makes it feel like the film is wasting your time and it would be better spent repairing spider webs or cleaning the pennies at the bottom of the local park fountain.Obviously, Natasha shines throughout the movie, but the real surprise of the film is the supporting cast made up for new characters making their Marvel debut. David Harbour stars as Alexi Shostakov, aka The Red Guardian, a Russian Captain America knock-off with his own big shield and an even bigger ego. The Red Guardian injects a much-needed and well-balanced sense of humour into the film and delivers some of the film's biggest laughs. He's a fun larger than life character and it's clear that David is having a lot of fun playing him. In addition to The Red Guardian, Florence Pugh Black-Widow's-up into a leather onesie and dons a deadly pair of batons as Yelena Belova and is the biggest surprise of the movie. With one Black Widow already establish over the last decade Florence had the unenviable task of not only matching Natasha when it comes to the fisty cuff but also when it comes to the emotional scenes. However, Florence not only rises to the challenge, but she cements Yelena as one of the more interesting and complex characters the Marvel universe has seen, and I for one hope to see more of her.Black Widow may not have huge universe-altering ramifications for the rest of the Marvel franchise, but it doesn't need to, what could have been a tedious origin movie like we've seen so many times before is instead an action-packed thrill ride that may not change the genre forever, but it does change Natasha forever making her a more interesting and complex character.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Starring Scarlett Johannson in the lead role, alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz, it establishes some previously desired backstory for the original female Avenger while setting things in motion for the future of the MCU.Sometime after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"", Natasha ""Nat"" Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), still on the run from the US government, is living in a safehouse in Norway. Shortly after receiving a package containing a strange red substance, Nat is attacked by a powerful figure known as the Taskmaster, whom she eventually manages to subdue and make her escape. Nat soon learns that the substance was sent by Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), a fellow assassin raised as her surrogate younger sister, and decides to seek her out for further information. Later in Budapest, Nat and Yelena reunite after decades of estrangement where they discover they are now being pursued by unknown forces that will stop at nothing to wipe them out.It has taken quite a while, eleven years to be precise, for a solo movie to be made about the lone female member of the original six Avengers. In that time, the Black Widow character, or Nat as she's better known, has appeared in many other MCU films, working alongside Steve Rogers/Captain America in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and later going against him by siding with Tony Stark/Iron Man in ""Captain America: Civil War"". After so many films where she is relegated to a supporting role, she finally makes her debut as the main character in ""Black Widow"" and proves she can successfully stand on her own without the help of her fellow heroes.I've always wanted to know more about Nat's character, as she always seemed so shrouded in mystery about her past and why she even decided to join the Avengers in the first place. Aside from a brief hallucination scene in ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"", little else has been divulged about her upbringing. In this film, we not only learn about Nat's home life as a child, but also the reasons why she defected from her Russian roots to become one of Earth's mightiest heroes. We also see how corruption runs deep within the organisations she was loyal to, similar to Hydra's infiltration of S. H. I. E. L. D back in ""The Winter Soldier"". Though the film didn't cover everything I would have liked to see, it does fill in enough blanks to hold me over until a possible sequel or even a future TV series can pick up where it left off.As is often the case with Marvel movies, we are presented with the usual high standard of explosive action sequences and scenes of hand-to-hand combat. However, rather than throw us into the thick of it right away, director Cate Shortland instead uses most of the film's first act to develop Nat as a character, helping us to better understand why it's so important that she gets to the bottom of what is happening all around her. As a result of this, the film does feel a bit slow near the beginning, but it's all worth sitting through for the exciting car chases through Budapest, the shootouts in various different buildings, and a creative helicopter rescue scene that ends on a humorous note. These are later punctuated with meaningful conversations between the characters discussing their insecurities and failures, which helps us to empathise with them. Considering Nat is one of the few Avengers without any proper superpowers or signature weapons, it is necessary for us to be reminded of her vulnerability and that deep down, she is still a regular human being.Scarlett Johansson gives it her all in the role she has gone on record stating is her all-time favourite. She does a great job depicting Nat as a more emotionally motivated character, acting on her own personal instincts rather than as a mindless drone merely doing what she is told. I really liked her interactions with Florence Pugh as Yelena, who is about on the same level as her in terms of combat skills. These two really did feel as though they had a history together and that familial bond they shared made their scenes more believable. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz, although not as prominent in the film as I had hoped, were also a nice addition to the cast as Nat and Yelena's surrogate parents Alexei and Milena. Harbour provides some comic relief reminiscent of his character Hopper in ""Stranger Things"" while Weisz loses herself in the role of both a maternal guardian and an elusive undercover spy.As we see the MCU move beyond the Infinity Saga, it is inevitable there will be even more stories to be told and even more heroes to be introduced. In spite of that, it is comforting to know that one of the most underrated members of the original six was still able to have her much deserved time in the spotlight. With the "" ""Hawkeye"" miniseries not far off, it seems that all of the old Avengers will finally have had an opportunity to shine on their own before the torch is eventually passed on to a brand new team. The seeds for the rest of Phase Four have now been sown and I greatly look forward to what future prospects the MCU has in store for us.I rate it 8/10.","24 out of 39 found this helpful.

It shifts quite abruptly from a family-friendly Jason Bourne knock-off to a parodic spy family comedy to a nonsensical cartoon plot. The beginning promises a generic and intense action movie which fails as soon as the protagonists display completely invincible durability, negating any tension. The second act is by far the best part of the film and brings together the family members back together. Great scenes like the prison escape sequence, Yelena's distraught longings for a family and the ramblings of Red Guardian really deepen the emotional core and relationships of the characters. The third act is mind-numbingly absurd as it escapes its grounded spy movie feel and transcends into traditional Marvel territory. Any pretense of hard-hitting action and emotion give way to overly obvious green-screening, unnecessary monologues, inexplicable sky fortresses, freefall fights and legions of girl drones controlling current events around the world. I'll take the sisterly banter and skip the mind-controlled pigs, please.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

In Russia, according to Marvel, there are only officials who brainwash people and are obsessed with how to overthrow states all over the planet with the help of young women.There is not one normal character from Russia in the Marvel universe. Natasha Romanoff is a good character because she is a Russian American. Her home is not Russia. Her home is Ohio.I used to like the Marvel universe.

I found it all a bit dull and boring. I didn't particularly like the action sequences or set pieces. Black Widow is a great character and an integral part of The Avengers and MCU but I just don't think she is big enough a character for a feature length movie. Maybe a TV series with her going on missions would have been better. The huge plus in all of this is Florence pughs character who was fun and engaging and had great chemistry with the Widow. After about the first 30 minutes I just generally lost interest which is a real shame as I love the MCU.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Back to black...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7104758/?ref_=tt_urv","Chalice_Of_Evil","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5464931/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2021","There've been complaints about the 'lateness' of this film, how it should've been made years ago and now that we've finally gotten it, it's 'too late'. I beg to differ, as I feel all good things come to those who wait (and those too impatient for something don't deserve it to begin with). However one may feel about Scarlett Johansson as an actress, there's no denying she's been in the MCU longer than most (if there's one 'good' thing about IM2, it's that it introduced this awesome character). She's done the hard yards and the fact that it's taken until now to get her well-deserved solo film isn't her fault (blame the higher-ups). While some dismissed her as 'not special' because she didn't possess super powers, she's proven her detractors wrong by enduring for so long.Johansson isn't given the credit she deserves for bringing such a complex character to life. Natasha is someone with some real demons in her past and she's done everything humanly possible to make up for her mistakes (unlike certain other so-called 'superheroes'). When the movie starts, we're in 1995 with young Natasha (Ever Anderson, who does a great job of not just looking like a young version of Scarlett Johansson, but also conveying so much for such a young actress) and her adoptive sister, Yelena (Violet McGraw, also doing a fine job for one so young), who're both capable of doing the 'spider walk' from The Exorcist. While those with short attention spans may find the opening 'boring', to those who aren't so easily bored, it's important for the movie to establish this sibling relationship, as this movie all about family.When the sisters are whisked away in an exciting airplane sequence and then separated, you really *feel* it, as young Natasha has shown her utter devotion to Yelena, willing to take on anyone to keep her safe. It's then that we're treated to probably one of the best montages in a comic book film that I can think of in recent memory, involving chilling images set to an unsettling version of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'. It immediately sets the mood for the rest of the film, which is actually a lot more brutal when it comes to the fights/kills than we've seen before in the MCU, and lets you know this will be a more 'mature' film. That's not to say there isn't some humour sprinkled throughout. It's there, but not overdone, and when the laughs do come, they're all the more effective *because* there hasn't been constant wisecracking (the biggest laugh had to be Yelena bringing up Natasha's superhero pose that she does and then acting it out).The best thing this movie did was casting Florence Pugh as grown-up Yelena, as she plays exceptionally well off Johansson and their onscreen chemistry makes for a believable sibling relationship. Their fight, after being reunited, is one of the film's best scenes, but the quieter heart-to-heart talks they have are equally important, as is their complicated relationships with their adoptive parents, Melina (Rachel Weisz) and Alexei (David Harbour), who bring different dynamics and add even more depth. 'Dysfunctional' doesn't begin to describe this family, but when it counts, they're there for each other. It's a shame that we'll likely never see all four together again, as their interaction proved quite compelling.On the side of the bad guys, there's the masked 'Taskmaster' who can mimic the Avengers fighting styles, hence why we see the use of a shield and bow/arrows among other fighting moves. Whilst able to hold her own, the first face-off between Taskmaster and Natasha shows that she's not some unbeatable 'perfect' fighter, but she uses her smarts and her brains over brawn is what sets her apart from all the characters that rely on muscle. If there's one letdown in the film, it's Ray Winstone's Dreykov, but it's kind of worth him being so pathetic a human being just to see Natasha outsmart him and smiling more than I think we've ever seen her smile before.This is a more 'intimate' MCU film, and as such the climax may not be quite what some were expecting/hoping for, but it's still satisfying because of what it means for Natasha, Yelena and all the other Widows. As for any 'unbelievable' elements in the film...at this point, if you're willing to accept things like helicarriers and talking raccoons/trees, then having a problem with the 'fantastical' elements here seems a bit hypocritical. It's not just the acting, action, humour, and music that the film has going for it, but also the way it *looks*. Cate Shortland should be commended for her directing, as there are some truly great/beautiful shots throughout, the fights are never confusing and the effects on display are used sparingly, but really well. All three lead actresses look smashing in their costumes (Scarlett proves that whether she's wearing black or white, she looks good in ANYTHING). David Harbour? Not so much.While some believe 'it's all downhill' after Endgame, I personally feel it's actually the opposite. With a certain character no longer hogging all the focus/screentime, we can now focus on other characters who deserve to have their stories told. This is one such instance. The main disappointment is that this is, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett Johansson's/Natasha Romanoff's swansong. While I would've liked to have seen more films with the sisters together, at least ScarJo can rest assured that the mantle of Black Widow will be in safe hands with Florence Pugh (assuming, of course, she takes over the role, though they'd be foolish not to see what a stand-out she was here and feature her in future MCU projects. The post-credits scene suggests she will be, but the conflict it sets up could be resolved with a simple conversation between her character and the target she's sent after). So long, Natasha. Thanks for all the crotch-throat grabs. Fade to black, Widow.","37 out of 64 found this helpful.

A fun action blockbuster but one that perhaps wasn't needed this time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7177080/?ref_=tt_urv","quiqueperezsoler","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80500138/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2021","With a gripping, thrilling and even darkish opening; and following with a swift but effective Black Widow backstory development; the film felt like it was going to be the origin story we wanted to see of her without actually being an origin story.And so it was. I was on board with ""going after the big bad guy"" main plot and the family development that ensues. Because from the trailer I knew those were going to be the themes. However, i was pleasantly surprised by the execution. I was expecting a cliched, average Marvel Captain America and the Winter Soldier-like spy-action movie, but in turn i was treated with, well sort of that same thing but with surprisingly more things to offer.The filmmaking felt different from other marvel spy-action movie. The action sequences were actually trying something other than quick cuts and weight-less jumping (not that there wasn't any, but there are always because it's a superhero movie so what'd you expect?). And the characterisation of not only Natasha but the rest (although slight, enough to be captivating) of the 'main charcters' was engaging enough to keep you wanting to know more about how their stories develop.Perhaps it was because I went in knowing it wouldn't be a game-changer, that it was going to be just that fun blockbuster action movie with strong female characters and easy quippy jokes. So i went in with a certain mindset that was changed immediately when the opening credits kicked in. I thought 'woah, maybe they will get a bit more mature', because that is sort of how her backstory was introduced as in the first Avengers and followed up in Ultron. This dark past, where she did horrible things she was trying to make amends of. A secret russian assassin school that did horrible things to her and turned her into a weapon, sort of like the darker story with the Winter Soldier program in terms of tone. However, I must say as the story progressed I was beginning to understand they weren't aiming for that sort of story and rather a more heist-like mission impossible action thrill-ride with cliched villains and a happy ending. I just would have liked more of the assassin than the spy angle, more John Wick and Winter Soldier-Russo angle than the action-hero time.IN CONCLUSION, I truly enjoyed the movie, it was a great popcorn cinema experience. But maybe it's because I haven't seen many new game-changing releases lately so watching a movie that presented those well known tropes and characterizations properly and cohesively made me value this movie higher than it actually is in the great scope of things. It's okay to love this movie, to consider it one of the greatest of Marvel. But we have had already twenty somethings of these and the movies have gotten better with time so seeing how some turn out to be just easy-blockbuster movies, becoming just good movies when they could have been great ones. Marvel should not be afraid of getting creative and risking their franchises. I personally would have loved if Natasha's send-off movie would have been a more bleaker and even dramatic take at Natasha's past just to end the movie with a crescendo of heroism, ""blaze of glory""-ending type. Which is and always has been her actual story, she was in a bad bad place, doing bad things until she said 'enough', found her calling at SHIELD, who gave her a second chance and found a family in the Avengers. A group of misfits, just like her, with whom she'd fight the battles others couldn't. I just personally wished the movie was more about Natasha and less about yet another world dominating plot which started and ended here.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

What should've been a swansong for one the original Avengers is actually a enjoyable but disposable prequel only really made to set up more projects.It's overuses CG that often looks weak and is very noticeable. The villains are some of the worst in the MCU, especially Taskmaster who is massively underutilized and completely forgettable. The humour, whilst pretty funny occasionally, constantly undermines the more emotional moments with frustrating results. The action sequences are competent but nothing more.However, Scarlett Johansson gives a reliably great performance and Florence Pugh is definitely the standout. David Harbour is only comic relief but he's still able to make the cheapest jokes land. The opening is really strong, surprisingly dark and mature and promises a way better movie when combined with the really good opening title sequence.","26 out of 60 found this helpful.

Soft hearted Americans and Europeans just don't understand how cruel FSB methods can be. As for entertainment itself, it was solid. I even can swallow the feminisation of Taskmaster.

A full strech dive into her character, her not being a sugarcoated sidekick - i of all person needed a movie like this!And those who are complaining that TaskMaster was done wrong.. Honestly for the Black widow movie, This Version of Taskmaster was the one Natasha needed to complete her Marvel arc... And i get why folks bash Marvel movies always for over the top Things and not so shocking twists, the reveal of the daughter has alot of plot movement than it was some random dude. Now we can get this Taskmaster becoming an antihero or an avenger even, This movie was a 9/10 for me.

So the bar was low for this, especially given the viewer critiques here. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Good production values, decent action scenes, and comic-relief scattered throughout. Scarlett's ""Natasha"" character was a bit too intense, too serious throughout so that wasn't endearing, however ""Yelena"" was spunky and funny when ribbing Natasha about her action poses, and the ""Red Guardian"" was awkwardly funny throughout, too, so those elements can't be denied. But some elements of the plot towards the end went stupidly implausible and things ended up a little too tidy instead of the mess it should've been which would've led better to any sequel. Final note, the various black widows were colloquially called widows which didn't make good sense since they were more once tiny child orphans (of a sort) than once-married widows, so that piece of backstorying is weak.","25 out of 58 found this helpful.

If you go in expecting a big sendoff to Scarlett Johansson and her version of Black Widow, you will be slightly disappointed. But if you wanted to see how a Fast and Furious-esque movie from MCU would look like, you would have wonderful time. They open the movie strong by letting us know what's like to be in the Red Room. We get to see a glimpse of happiness these girls had in their life before they were turned into deadly assassins. Action is a major part of this movie and they sure have it in plenty. Those scenes are really fun and entertaining but a lot of it suffers from poor editing. Editing in general is not the strongest aspect of this movie. The visuals effects and cinematography were top-notch as expected from a marvel flick. The score and song choices were also nice.The cast, lead by Scarlett Johansson, does quite a good job with what she was given. Natasha Romanoff shines really well, especially in the silent moments. Among the new additions, Florence Pugh stands out the most. In this film she steals it from Johansson based on her personality and raw acting skills. Not only is she competent with the fight scenes, but she is the most emotionally engaging and also funniest character in the film. I'd go as far as to say this is barely even the Black Widow solo movie fans have been shouting for. This is absolutely Yelena's movie. There is a post-credit scene which suggests we'll be seeing more of her pretty soon; and that I am 100% here for. O-T Fegbenle's Rick Mason is not a character you'd expect much from but he was really fun. His scenes with Natasha were one of the better parts of this movie. David Harbour was having fun with character but I'd have loved to see him do some serious stuff or get involved in a cool fight scene. Rachel Weisz was good but wasn't utilised to her full potential. However one of the major disappointment that has to do with this movie is the villain(s). Ray Wintone's Dreykov was given nowhere near enough backstory. We barely learn about his motivations. Taskmaster was far less intimidating that I was led to believe they'd be. The character is supposed to be able to learn and mimic the fighting styles of their opponents - including multiple Avengers. This Taskmaster could barely contend with Black Widow (a human) or her out of shape and past his prime father. This Taskmaster was more like a supermarket own brand Terminator. The movie ends on a high note in the third act. The high octane high scale action sequence sprinkled with some genuinely good character moments really sealed the job.On the whole, BW is a grand action adventure movie that tells us more about Natasha. Besides her story, there was sibling rivalry and family humour.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

S. government. When a mysterious new foe known as Taskmaster appears out of the shadows, Natasha must face her past and round up new characters from her past to take care of the unfinished business she thought she put behind her. So first off, Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow definitely gives this her best portrayal of her character that she has ever given. Although as much as it is her film, the standout character of the entire film is hands down Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova. She is astonishing while also stunning in the role and the film wouldn't be what it is without her character. David Harbour's Red Guardian is also a highlight of the film. Rachel Weisz's Melina is also a fine addition to the film, although I wish we would of gotten more screen time with her character. Ray Winstone's Dreykov was alright, but definitely didn't feel like he was a established enough villain for audiences to actually care about who his villain is as he doesn't have as much screen time. Taskmaster was also a huge let down by the end and I was not huge fan of the character choices they chose for the character. Besides that, some of the fight scenes were absolutely great in this film as well as the cinematography. Overall, Black Widow is a proper sendoff for the character Natasha Roman, while also passing the torch to a new Black Widow, making audiences look forward to what's to come. Rating. 7.5/10.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not without it's merits Black Widow quickly devolves into Marvel formula checklists.As many people are saying Florence Pugh is the highlight of the film though that can be said for every movie she stars in. Not sure if it was intended to have Yelena be the most interesting character instead of Natasha? The chemistry with between Pugh and Johansson is decent enough, and the initial fight between widow and task master was cool.The family drama is forced. The dinner table scene moves from flat comedy to drama in order to create artificial conflict with the main cast.However Task Master eventually takes a back seat to the forced family drama and the reveal at the end is predictable. The action itself is one of the most disappointing aspects of the film. None of it was exciting and it's been done better in other marvel movies. Every fight is quick cuts to hide the stunt-double. All of these A list actors take big money but don't put in the effort to learn choreography so we can understand what the heck is going on in a fight. The constant reminder I'm watching a stunt double took me out of every fight in the movie. When the Marvel 3rd act CGI battle happens Natasha turns full CGI and it's boring. All the action is dull and lifeless. Another problem with the action is how slick and boring the style of the movie is. There is no grit in Black Widow. Marvel and Disney are too afraid to take any chances with a tone or style of the movie. Instead of making this solo film something suspense filled and grounded we have a marvel movie we have already seen a million times before. A missed opportunity to make a grounded superhero feel real. Sort of like what Nolan did with his Batman trilogy.Eventually everything ends in Black Widow after the overlong final battle and everyone is super happy. Natasha changes her hair color and everyone can be happy leaving the theatre. Yawn! Black Widow is pure formula. Never taking any chances to deviate from the path set by ten years of previous marvel films. Everything is so convenient and tidy that I want to roll my eyes. Black Widow never made me gasp in excitement, tremble with suspense or tear up because I become so invested in the characters. Comfort food is what Black Widow is and if that is your thing you're most likely very easy to please and right dumb reviews like the Top review for this movie, or your as sad as anyone who looks at reviews on IMDB and dislikes them because they have differing opinions than you. If you fit into either of those categories I'm sure Black Widow is the movie for you. High production values does not equal substance. You love Black Widow but Hate F9? What is the difference here?","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

The film is directed by Cate Shortland, the director of Lore and Berlin Syndrome.In the film, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run from the government after violating the Sokovia Accord. She goes into hiding in areas where she has lived in her past and is trained to be a super spy Black Widow. By visiting these places, she is confronted by her past and encounters old acquaintances. She crosses paths with Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), who also completed the Black Widow training. Together, they try to stop the organization behind the Black Widow training sessions, but to do so must face spies of their level and the mysterious Taskmaster.This film was Cate Shortland's first directing work of a major action film. She had even rejected the film as a director at first, but Scarlett Johansson managed to persuade her to direct the film anyway. The fact that this is her first directing work of an action film is unfortunately reflected in the quality of the film. Despite the fact that most of the action scenes are entertaining, they also come across a bit too moving and a bit juxtaposed. The last action scenes also clearly show that the actors are standing in front of a green screen and that the explosions, like many other explosions in the film, have been placed in the film with CGI.The story of the film also comes across as a standard spy movie, but here at a slow pace. In the story, unfortunately, they also choose to overshadow the drama moments with comedy. This also makes the film lose its depth. The film also has some nice links for the fans with other Marvel films, but at one point also chooses to copy other Marvel films, so that moments can come across as familiar to Marvel fans.The acting is fortunately well done by the film cast. This is Scarlett Johansson's ninth time playing the Black Widow character in the Marvel film series. Despite her character playing the lead role in this movie, she plays the role better in most other Marvel movies. Florence Pugh is best portrayed in the film. Together with Scarlett Johansson, they create a nice mutual chemistry, which comes across as the love-hate relationship between two sisters. Viewers who have siblings of their own can relate to some of the moments the two bring out together in the film. David Harbor provides most of the comedic moments in the film, but does not get much else to do in the film. Rachel Weisz also has a small role in the film, which only helps the story move forward.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was the first movie I had seen in theaters since lockdown, and I was excited to see these new and interesting characters be introduced into the MCU. But, this movie just doesn't work. It would have been far more interesting to see Natasha's origin in the red room and her original mission to kill Dreykov. But instead, the movie focuses on the period between ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"" and it is significantly less interesting. Additionally, the villains in this movie are some of the worst in the MCU. Dreykov has no real motivation and Taskmaster isn't a threatening enough villain to justify the lack of personality. While some side characters such as Yelena and Red Guardian are enjoyable, it doesn't save the movie. To put it plainly this was not a great way to kick off the New phase four marvel movies, and does little to justify its existence.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I thought it was going to be a forced effort, soaked in PC bull. It is a good action movie, with the sequences as good as you could hope for, and its family drama part at least resembles an effort of a human being. What I'm most impressed about is that Shortland managed to put her personal stamp on the project and still make a movie that belongs to the MCU (some of the indoor stuff reminded me of the Soviet cinema). Story and characters are believable enough that you care, which is, I think, a rare feat nowadays, especially in something as mainstream as Marvel. Harbour is a cliche, but an adorable one, Weisz is charming as always and Pugh continues to be a revelation and one of the better actresses to emerge over the past half a decade or so. The accent play left me ambivalent (Florence's hard 'r' comes and goes and I, as a Slav, am allowed to be a snob about it). I also don't know what to do with Dreykov's daughter (on that note -- when are we going to have an actual Russian criminal play a movie Russian criminal instead of all these Winstons and Brannaghs? I'm just messing with you -- I'm mocking these voices that have gained steam which suggest you can't do anything outside of what you are (if you're white, at least). Well, woke ladies and gentlemen of 2021, that's called acting and Ray makes for a convincing Russian roughneck (he even looks like one!) It's good to have a small-scale (super)hero stuff here and there -- it brings the things down to Earth, everything slows down and you can enjoy (and appreciate) the details (something I liked about the 1st season of DAREDEVIL). At the end, I send my love to Scarlett -- a dozen years in this universe is madness.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Personally, I find spy films to be shallow, overly complex and wayyy to serious.Not rewatchable in the slightest but the passing of the torch to Florence Pugh's Yelena and post-credit scene fills you with the same potent anticipation for future films that every marvel movie is able to conjure, no matter how bad the film is.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Casting and performances were decent, and the soundtrack had some really good remixes. But I expected much more for the 133 min runtime. The pacing was slow in some parts, and had many long and dragged out scenes. There was just too much filler and not enough substance in the story. The writers needed a little more imagination; the concept was there, but the execution wasn't as good as it could've been. Had it been trimmed down to 90-100 mins, I may have enjoyed it more. It also had lame attempts at humor - probably the worst of all MCU films, and it's not like there weren't opportunities to throw in some comic relief. For me, the most suspenseful and interesting part of the entire film, was the post-credits scene. It's a decent one-time watch.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

Finally we get some back story to Natasha, the story was obviously the core and mostly it was a throughly entertainment and in depth story about her family and past. Action as usual was great, and the use of sound in the Dolby atmos theatre was superb. Comedic moments were great in the film, audience had great reactions. The music was great as well. One particular choice of song stood out for me. (Watch and you'll find out I hope) I liked how you are able to connect to the characters more since it's a more grounded film. It's essentially a spy espionage film in a very well known universe. Only other issue I had with the film was the villain, wasn't very convincing and I would say opposed to being frightened for Natasha because of the villain.

The film takes place after 'Captain America: Civil War' and Col Ross (William Hurt) is arresting all the naughty avengers. On the run, she hears from her estranged assassin sister (Pugh) and they get together and seek out their father and mother and decide to take on the evil Dreykov (Winstone) and his Red Room.Featuring what you'd expect from a Marvel film, high emotional drama, good character mockery (Pugh refers to the 'main' Avengers in front of Natasha) and spectacular action scenes. The four main characters are all great with Johansson strong in the lead, but Pugh effortlessly stealing the film from her. Nice to see Rachel Weitz having fun and it is surely not the last time we'll see David Harbour in this role.On the downside the story is a relatively familiar one climaxing with the inevitable, but what else can you do, spectacular crash bang wallop set piece, Ray Winstone's Russian baddie strays into half awake East End villain too often and some of the lively camera work during the fight sequences sent me boss eyed.Overall though a good solid effort, lots of fun and nice that they did a full film for Black Widow. Watch out as always for the interesting post credit sequence.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Specifically: great storyline: took time to set the scene & on character development; clear & easy to follow -- good pacing (for the most part) -- great action scenes & I'm in awe of the stunt team! -- casting on point: all the cast fit the roles well; notably I loved the fact the cast was heavily female & they also did well on the diversity front -- beautiful filming locations & cinematography.*Minor critiques* I would have given a higher rating if not for the following reasons: Storyline: at the end I kinda felt unfulfilled & I can't put my finger on why. Perhaps they could have done more to make us despise the villian (him sitting in his office pressing a button, doesn't feel that ruthless for a marvel villain); which would have perhaps made the ending more satisfying. -- Pacing: there were some scenes that I think could have gone more quickly, such as the segment with everyone at the mum's house. -- Casting: happy with this generally, although I found the forced accents really distracting; and I think it would have been better to either cast people who actually have that accent, or find a reason for the character to have their own accent. -- Cringy script: I could sense the pauses in the script for when we were meant to laugh. But it's not a big deal :')Overall, I really enjoyed it. I would suggest to watch it if you don't mind a slower paced movie & you're a marvel fan.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

You expect something. It gives you that path then suddenly it goes way more far. It was a tenacious but yet fragile movie to disappoint me in the story but the main memorable scene isn't action or typical mcu moment but a more intimate thing. They took exactly the opposite of what i would have done or expected of that movie. Instead of showing, it's characters centered. To not spoil but yet guide you. Remember the Famous scene of the youth of romanof when she get manipulated in Age of Ultron. Well this movie is more close to the dialogue between bruce banner and Romanoff instead. It makes you think instead of seeing things. It's the imagination used most of the time. Appart that beginning. Well it could have been that intro a movie but it's an amazing opening and it throws you quickly on the excitement of a new adventure but with very familiar vibe.If Spider man far from home officially close the phases we know. I think in terms of release date, this one is legitimately ends the MCU phases started in 2008.Few long moment and sometimes out of the move but overall a great MCU movie again and actors top notch, fight scene are mindblowing and the effect teams did a brilliant jobs.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Luckily, this runs throughout the whole film, because without it, I think it'd be completely forgettable.The opening is fantastic, and immediately gave me Winter Soldier vibes. Safe to say, I was excited for a darker spy/espionage movie...The cons: ...Sadly that movie never came.What starts great, quickly descends into stock standard Marvel-style drivel. The plot is fairly predictable, and the characters 'plans' are incredible dumb.Some of the action scenes are okay, but most are ruined with quick cuts that make everything feel like watching marbles going through a blender.Worst still, is the total underutilization of the characters abilities.At one stage we're told Pughs character is the best assassin in the world ...but we're never shown that?We're told Black Widow is the best spy in the world... but she doesn't do any spy work throughout the film?Worst yet, they had Taskmaster - a character with such an amazing and formidable ability, but they squander it for stock standard fight scenes we've scene a million times.Overall: Like I say, It's enjoyable enough to warrant a watch, but it could have been so much more with a little bit of competence.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

And why on earth was this director given a 200million dollar movie to direct, despite not having ever made a good movie? This director has made 3 previous movies and all of them are mediocre. I seriously, seriously don't know why they gave such a MASSIVE movie, to such an inexperienced director. Marvel literally only have themselves to blame... they are the cause for this movie being bad.So, let's move on from the terrible director choice. The movie has several highly unrealistic scenes, and by 'unrealistic' I mean 'impossible'. When the viewer sees an impossible thing happen on screen, the viewer is immediately snapped back to reality and realizes that they're watching a movie instead of watching an epic fantasy saga play out. And ontop of the huge plot holes in the movie, I also for the love of me can't figure out how on earth a movie with a 200million dollar budget, has such bad CGI. The CGI in this movie is seriously 2nd-rate. I've seen movies with $20million budgets have better CGI than this movie has.It's a pity because I wanted Black Widow's movie to be good, but Marvel simply ensured that this movie could never be better than a 6/10 no matter what anyone did, even with a 200million dollar budget. It's sad, but this movie doesn't even warrant a single viewing, nevermind any repeated ones. 5/10, bad movie.","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

The movie is heavy on the Familial bonds and the results of them. It has a lot of depth uncommon in super hero movies. Lots of heart warming moments with Natasha and her family. The movie has the perfect blend of slow and deep moments, and the fast paced high action scenes. I have watched this movie at least 8 times since it's release. It has easily become one of my favorite MCU movies! A great movie for the whole family!!

Scarlett Johansson is finally enabled to astonish and entertain her audience with sheer skill, ability, and heart! This is such a refreshing but on-your-feet film that FINALLY does not capitalize on exploiting sexuality or sex appeal! I'm talking, a family friendly, Jason Bourne equivalent in Black Widow. But don't let ""Family friendly"" sound cliche here. The cast cohesion was breathtaking and natural. Florence Pugh met, matched, and completed Johansson's character as well, with the entire cast giving the audience such amazing charisma, strength, and grit. Incredible choices that fully brought the film to life. There was much wonder about how Black Widow would be brought to the screen with such a dark backstory, but Director Cate Shortland and her team, brought more than the story. It is incredible how, with this film, major milestones are met in trafficking awareness, women's equality, and human kindness. Not falling short with action and cinematography, Black Widow is raw, thrilling, and inspiring, that regardless the path, regardless the person, there is always a way forward.A must-see, watch again and again, amazing action film. This movie was meant to be, and meant to be now. Absolutely loyal to the Marvel name and reputation, while providing everything that could be hoped for, and not lacking in anything. Black Widow is legendary.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

My biggest issue with this movie was the pacing of the movie. To me, there never really was a moment where the movie never really picked up for me and it just felt really slow. I know this movie wasn't meant to be fully action-packed but the family dynamic just didn't work for me at all. When the movie ended I legit just thought wow nothing really happened in this and was disappointed by it. On the topic of the family dynamic, I will say it definitely wasn't because of the acting since you can see all four of them really trying their best in this movie. Florence Pugh, who plays Yelena Belova, for me personally was the real stand out of the actors in this movie. Whenever you see the ""family"" on screen together you can easily see and tell how everybody feels about this. Marvel has not been known to have the best villains but in recent movies, we've been getting some better villains but, ""Black Widow"" just brought back the terrible villain. The villain in this movie is just so boring and lacks motivation. It also doesn't help that the audience never sees them. I feel like the biggest reason why this movie just didn't work for me is because of the story. The story didn't feel like it flowed very well from beginning to end and needed some tweaking. In the end, Black Widow just isn't a memorable movie and I will easily forget about it.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's not a good indication that the lawsuit its star, Scarlett Johansson, brought against Disney is more interesting than the movie ""Black Widow"" itself. It could've been different. It could've been a movie without any future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe of endless sequels. Like its deceased Avenger who's not even an Avenger at this point of a prequel. Like the sterilization the character was forced to undergo in her past. The selection of a genetically-gifted and trained life free from subjugation, with an individual identity, free will beyond procreation and the cycle of slavery, rebellion, and slavery again. Alas, Disney and Marvel have no interest in quality, stand-alone productions. They care about setting up the next episode, about copyright-extended brands, fecund intellectual property that may reproduce ad infinitum. Johansson's contract may be finished, but as the villain says, women are the one resource of the world in overabundance. Disney is that villain. It shouldn't take an incompetent publicity statement in response to a lawsuit to figure that out. Heck, it almost seems intentional that the villain resembles Harvey Weinstein, and Disney did own Miramax at one point.Despite the MCU having only two female-led superhero installments out of, what, 25 movies now and having still let the shambolic DCEU beat them to the punch with the first one, ""Wonder Woman"" (2017)--not to even count the two such DC movies before this cinematic universe stuff, I'm not saying Disney is particularly misogynistic. I'm not saying that here, at least. The corporate disdain for people is more general than that. People are the abundant resource, and they're in markets across the globe. Look at the generic map on the screen as the also-generic Bond villain elaborates on his evil, Soviet Hydra plan--I think the tvtropes website calls this the ""spreading disaster map graphic"" trope--it might as well be Disney's distribution blueprint: plant these ""Widows"" of no free will around the world to wreak havoc, effect the stock market, an' such. Speaking of tropes, too, the outcry over supposed ""fridging"" of Black Widow in ""Endgame"" (2019) was silly, but they really did it this time and in her own movie.Had the filmmakers realized and intended this, it'd be a different story, but I suspect as with the scenario of sleeper cells and the antidote freeing them, for a movie released during a pandemic, it was happenstance. Albeit, Jac Schaeffer wrote the story here, and she was the head writer behind the intelligently reflexive ""WandaVision"" (2021), tailor-made for its episodic TV medium. Not this time, though. The results are merely the usual MCU junk at lower stakes and the fight choreography is literally mirrored, as is the rest with a lot of ""The Winter Soldier"" (2014) recycling, like SHIELD another secret lair in the sky, climaxing in a jump that's hardly even as impressive as when done at the beginning of ""Iron Man 2"" (2010), a found family throughline that might as well have been ripped-off from the maudlin ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017), communists instead of Nazis for the aforementioned ham-fisted Hydra variation, even a prison break and an avalanche and throw in some ""Mission: Impossible"" while you're at (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it), for crying out loud, and an opening act that looks like it was made for TV, but not even the TV that did it better--i.e. ""The Americans.""I mean, look at those opening credits; that's a thematic TV-show montage. It's hideous. It's not surprising that a lot of the filmmakers behind this have TV experience. Heck, they cast that guy, O. T. Fagbenle, who plays the sensitive man in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" to essentially play the same role here, and that other guy, David Harbour, from ""Stranger Things"" where he plays the gallant father figure to a superheroic girl does that again here, too. And, that's not even to describe the end-credits scene.Rachel Weisz is too good for this, as is Johansson, so I'm glad she's out. How is this family-bonding schmaltz supposed to be heartwarming anyways--nonchalantly abandoning their children to be sterilized, mind-controlled and turned assassins for most of their lives, but, oh, they spent three happy years together in Ohio? Get out of here. At least the sisterly bond works well enough, and Florence Pugh's Black Widow 2 mocking Black Widow's being a poser is the only joke here that lands (heh, get it?). Besides, the dysfunctional family junk isn't even the most oblivious thing about another Disney-MCU corporatist abomination that pretends it's solved another societal ill. Sexism this time; racism and squatting, or borders, or something, the outing before last with ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" (2020). Throw $20 million at the problem; that'll fix it, right.On second thought, the worst thing about this might be that it also ruins the Budapest MCU story we never got, where now we're told that Black Widow and Hawkeye spent days confined together in cramped quarters and what they did was play tic-tac-toe. Overbred but sexless. That is unless counting the so-called (by Laura Mulvey, that is) ""male gaze"" despite a female director, with camera setups seemingly going out of their way to copiously focus on Johansson's posterior. Black Widow exits the MCU the same way she entered it. What a pity.","30 out of 70 found this helpful.

I was invested throughout. I love the characters, especially the new additions of Yelena and Alexei. The characters have great chemistry. And I laughed a lot.Florence Pugh and David Harbour rock in this movie. Florence Pugh continues to impress me. Her acting skills are top-notch (see Midsommar) and I already knew she could kick butt (see Fighting with My Family). There are a couple of acting moments she has where I was like, damn. One literally brought me to tears and I felt exactly what the character felt. And David Harbour plays his role amazingly. So funny. Likeable in an unlikeable way, if that makes sense.There are two things this movie almost does that could have made it amazing. One is to go for a darker tone. And I don't mean like the ominous feeling of Infinity War. But a genuinely dark tone that would work perfectly with the dark thematic background of the main character. And the start of the movie made me think they were going that route. It was pretty messed up. But the rest of the movie felt exactly like the template MCU movie. I love that template, but it would have been cool to see something different here.The second thing that could have made it stand out is the musical score. I've complained so many times that the weakest part of the MCU is the music. There are a few scores I like, but most are unimpactful. The new MCU shows have stepped it up (Wandavision, Falcon Winty, and especially Loki).When black widow started, I loved the musical score. It was immediately impactful and elevated the prologue. It gave the movie character. And then the credits show that it's composed by Lorne Balfe, who has become one of my favorite composers. But as usual in the MCU, the music is kept mostly in the background and has very little impact on the scenes. Think of the music played during the final fight in Civil War or during the funeral scene in Thor 2. The music owns me. And it could have in Black Widow. But I barely noticed it for the rest of the movie.The action is pretty awesome. A couple of moments in the fight scenes were unclear, but it was mostly well-done. Overall I had a great time with this movie, and I liked it even more the second time.(3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/8/2021, 12/1/2021, 4/28/2023)","15 out of 39 found this helpful.

Featuring a standalone story that unfolds between the events of Civil War & Infinity War, the film is a late entry in the saga and there is simply nothing about it that's refreshing or even worth the wait.Directed by Cate Shortland, the story digs into the human attributes of Natasha Romanoff way better than previous chapters ever did and even packs a more compact & structurally sound plot that navigates into her past & unresolved trauma & broken relationships. The opening credits do hint at a darker, riskier premise & even set up the tone for the same but then the narrative takes a different route that's safer & more akin to Marvel formula.As expected, fast paced action, overblown CGI & familiar wit go hand in hand with the drama but the story is self-contained & stakes are smaller this time around. The family dynamic while promising at first isn't explored to its full potential but the siblings bonding adds some weight to the film's emotional requirements. Scarlett Johansson is terrific in her final outing as Black Widow yet she is outshined & overshadowed by Florence Pugh who's an absolute live-wire in her role.Overall, Black Widow arguably is better focused than many other entries in the MCU but other than Pugh's stellar debut in this shared universe, there's nothing in here that's impressive or noteworthy. There are no money shots, no memorable segments & no revelations that leave a lasting mark. Nothing to help the film separate itself from the crowd. And it also fails to justify its spot in Marvel's new phase. An arrival that's unfortunately too little too late, Black Widow is a middling effort at best.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

It's actually rather forgettable, to be honest. Set after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War (2016)', the film follows its eponymous hero as she teams up with her long-lost sister to take down the people in charge of the 'red room', the brain-washing facility that Natasha herself was forced into as a child. The picture starts out feeling quite different to the other entries in its franchise, with a somewhat dark tone and a 'Bourne'-esque vibe. Eventually, though, it deteriorates into the same formulaic sort of thing we've seen countless times from Marvel Studios, with big CGI set-pieces and forced-in humour. The comedy often clashes with the flick's tone and is, frankly, sometimes quite annoying, whereas the action is far too infrequent and intangible to be fully satisfying. Ray Winston's villain is also the most bland and uninteresting of any baddie in the MCU and, yes, that even includes Malekith the dark elf from 'Thor: The Dark World (2011)'. The film isn't bad, don't get me wrong. There are a few entertaining action scenes, the performances are all on point and the story is generally engaging. It just feels like a pretty passive experience, though. It isn't massively compelling and quite a few of its plot points fall totally flat. Still, it's enjoyable enough to be worth a watch once. However, I can't see myself revisiting it any time soon and, because of where it falls in the MCU's chronology, I don't think I really need to. 6/10.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

Actually, with a little rewriting, this could easily have come out an entire decade ago. Regardless of any other aspect, the fact that this stars a woman in the titular role has had people saying for years that it would automatically be bad. It's hard to argue that this would have come out upwards of 10 years ago, if not for that one aspect. I think a lot of people would have, and many, I'm sure, did, advise that it not rock the boat any more than that. So it's hard for me to overstate my relief and joy at finding that the movie is unapologetically feminist. It uses the spy training, which includes kidnapping girls when they are children, to explore trauma caused by men against women(obviously, the specifics of what they experience is extremely rare, and the details are hard to relate to. But the notion that some people, if not stopped, are simply going to keep hurting any female they can, really resonates). Ultimately, it could go even further. And it definitely would have been able to go deeper, if not for the trusted MCU formula demanding frequent action scenes. Thankfully, immensely talented director Cate Shortland does what she can (and that's a lot) to keep those scenes as intense and impactful as possible, by keeping the camera close, letting us feel every blow. There are some issues with the pacing and editing, that are most likely down to the movie not being completely done shooting before Corona restrictions were put in place, and a reluctance by the studio to postpone release until those rules were lifted. A decision which, honestly, is completely understandable. I won't spend long talking about Taskmaster, other than to say that, given what they clearly wanted to do there, they should simply have come up with a new character, or picked one that actually suited their needs, since now, they have frustrated(when that wasn't necessary or intentional at all) many who hoped for a more direct interpretation, and now merely distracts from a powerful and carefully thought-out depiction(as far as the ideas that this is exploring, they got it 100-percent spot-on).A little visible blood, and lasting wounds, push the PG-13 rating. I recommend this to any fan of Scarlett, her depiction of the role, of spy thrillers, and of comic book adaptations. 7/10.","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

But if you sit back and let the story unfold, it's a good one - with some great performances (especially by Pugh) - and enough adrenaline to make the 2 hours go by fast!","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

My main entertainment in movies and tv shows, and I remember seeing taskmaster for the first time when I was younger and thinking, ""this guy is badass."" In the movie, they never went into depth with powers or anything and was only in 2-3 moments of an overly long movie. I would've cut maybe 5-10mins. Now, taskmaster will probably be done with.I will say that hearing that marvel music in a movie theater at the beginning really made me happy.

But since Marvel took so long to develop this film, audiences finally get their Black Widow solo movie far too late, after we already know the fate of the character. Regardless, this is a perfectly entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it could have been so much more. The film is at its best when it is focused on its characters and the performances of the actors, and when it tries to be a spy thriller rather than just another big-budget MCU tentpole.The best parts of this movie all involve either Florence Pugh or David Harbour, who play the sister and father of Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow). They both give charismatic performances that supercede some of the more generic aspects of the plot. The stunt work is also quite fantastic for much of the movie, especially in the first two-thirds. A car chase scene and a sister-to-sister fight scene are both choreographed excellently and are thrilling from start to finish.For the first two acts of BLACK WIDOW, I was invested in the storyline and was thoroughly enjoying myself due to the action and the different approach on a Marvel film. However, the final act reverts back to the absolute ridiculousness that Hollywood money-makers such as this are known for, and the movie lost me at that point. Once the characters arrive to the location for the emotional climax and final major CGI fight scene, the writing becomes annoyingly trite and boring, and the action becomes overblown and mind-numbing. I even ceased to be invested in the story and character arcs, and stopped caring at all about how the movie concludes.BLACK WIDOW may be another watchable action movie from Marvel, but at this point they need to turn things up a notch and deliver something truly different. This film will not be regularly talked about in a year's time, and Disney/Marvel needs to start making more movies that stick in viewers' brains more than just another sci-fi CGI fight scene.

Sadly Black Widow falls into the latter category but as one of the Founding Members of Avengers, she deserved a much better Send Off. The film's promising opening scene indicates this would be a very personal & emotional experience but it never becomes that mostly due to Marvel's obnoxious tendency to force stupid jokes into every scene. Scar Jo does okay for her role but I expected to see a new dimension in her character and it never happened & she often got overshadowed by Florence Pugh's Eleyna who was just amazing & I am looking forward to her future in MCU. David Harbor's character is just a bumbling idiot & Rachel Weisz offers nothing. The Villains are once again very boring. Some of the Action sequences are good.

It was an enjoyable action thriller set in the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, filling in some details of what Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow got up to while the Avengers weren't exactly getting on. It has heaps of comedy and excellent performances from Scarlett Johansson as Natasha, scene-stealing Florence Pugh as her ""little sister"" Yelena, and hammy but hilarious David Harbour and morally ambiguous Rachel Weisz as her ""parents"". The setup was wonderfully done, with a young Nat and her ""family"" embedded as sleeper agents in the US but broken up when their mission ends. But while on paper the stakes were high, with Nat battling the resurgence of the Widow programme that produced her, which despite her previous efforts has come back stronger and even more exploitative, the story somehow still felt too slight to do the character justice when even on first watch we know what happens down the line. Still it was lovely to know that Nat had refound this family and particularly her little sister, and it was a great introduction to Yelena who we meet again in Hawkeye and will hopefully see much more of in future. And if you're lucky enough to have the opportunity to watch this before you've seen all the MCU Phase 3 movies, I'd recommend watching it immediately after Captain America: Civil War, and at least before Infinity War and definitely before Endgame.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie, however, was everything I wanted, plus! Great storytelling, great action, great offbeat (or should I say on beat) humour. All the cast were on point. Welcome, Romanoffs, to the Avenger family! Great international locations and crews. I can't say enough about how good this movie was. Unsurprisingly, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10 and am so happy that movies of this caliber can be seen, once again, on the big screen! {Action, Adventure, Superheroes}","133 out of 275 found this helpful.

There's also the strange habit of characters switching between Russian and English with no real reason- IE someone says something in english and the other responds in russian instead.My biggest issue is the fact that somehow nobody thought to stop them from putting a Twilight Sparkle doll from the 2011 MLP:FiM show (I actually own the exact same one) in 1995.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

They have the perfect character to do a spy/espionage, drama thriller a la Jason Bourne or James Bond but instead they are complacent to just hash out a typical action packed Marvel film. Which is entertaining but this film could've been more. Admittedly the beginning does do a lot of these spy/espionage themes but drops them almost immediately in favor for the Marvel formula.While like Shang-Chi it is more of the same I do not expect the same level of innovation from a standalone film on a already established character versus that of one who is making his debut. So Black Widow gets a little leeway from me on that point. Moving on... Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh have fantastic chemistry as sisters and both give terrific performances. Rachel Weisz and David Harbor are also great in their supporting roles.While I would've wished Marvel chose to go a different way with this film it was still entertaining and one that connected to and filled gaps between Civil War and Infinity War very well.IMDb: 7/10

The characters that don't really have any powers or interesting abilities other than just kind of being there.This movie is absolutely true to it's roots as it fits in with ""Black Widows"" persona. There is no over the top super villains with magic or mystical abilities. These movie is mainly melee and bullets.I most of the time forgot I was watching a Marvel movie. It feel like a good action flick. The fight choreography was beautifully amazing. The story line was actually funny. It was a different tone from the usually serious Black Widow we see in the Marvel Movies.This movie has a ""girl power"" theme to it which I find you either take or leave. All the men in this film are either evil or incompetent and one primary comic book character had a gender change. I don't know what that was all about.What I liked about this movie is that it felt more like a Spy movie... like a James Bond ""Gold Finger"" type of feel to it. Which makes a lot of sense given Black Widow's role. I liked that approach to the Black Widows character because it was very fitting.There is quite a bit of action in the film. A lot of very cool on the edge sequences especially towards the end of the film. It delivers highly in that department.The only really bad part of the movie is that you know it's about a character that died so it's this kind of sad feeling as you watch it knowing that this character won't be back in the Marvel universe as far as we know.Overall this was a pretty good movie. Black Widow is more ""basic"" that the other Super Heroes on the Avenger squad so the film felt more normal than the other ones like Thor or Dr. Strange. Black Widow doesn't have any special powers just good fighting abilities which made this what some would consider a bad super hero film but for others it was a fun action movie.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

What we get here is an action flick on a higher scale. Not as High as say Captain America: The Winter soldier, but that's the level they were reaching for, but never get thereThat has a lot to do with the fact that Black Widow could have done some more action in the action film. In films with other Avengers Black Widow gives a superb action sequence. Some of the sequences here felt incomplete. Too much cutting in-between the action and the talking (not something you want to do in an action film really).There was a lot of talking. A lot of understandable talking, yes, but at the same time I wanted to see Red Guardian do some more Captain America stuff.Not sure how I feel about Florence Pugh. Good as a fellow Black Window. Funny when it comes to poking fun of Natasha Romanoff and her being an Avenger, but the chemistry between Pugh and Johansson did not hold the movie as needed.Ray Winstone's Villainy is a step back (maybe purposely as the movie takes place in the past). Not his fault for his portrayal of General Dreykov, it just that once Marvel reached perfection with Thanos its hard to watch them turn back to only the hero's journey matters and not the foil they face.I was waiting for the Task Master to make it onto the silver screen for a minute. Not what I was expecting but not fully disappointed. Just left me wanting more.I want to point out that this movie is one step up from Captain Marvel. I know it should mean nothing, but there was a very little thing in Black Widow that I was expecting Captain Marvel to be all about.I have to admit though I did love this action movie, but as a Marvel movie I just felt it was missing a lot of parts. It was cool when they referenced things talked about in other movies but then you had things in the movie that needed to be addressed more.Overall, I thought Scarlett Johansson showed a mastery of the character. It may not look like it but she was everything I expected from Black Widow. Plus we got to see her origin played out,and as such it was a fond farewell to the character.","10 out of 26 found this helpful.

Regardless if she would seem too young to play the role she would have done more justice than Johansson's fame!There is absolutely nothing special about this film.

Frankly I found the movie a bit slow moving and tedious at times, the fight scenes were cool but nothing too spectacular. The Red Guardian and Task Master were totally wasted ! I looked forward to their fight but it was so anti climatic.

I think that Black Widow is rated lower than I would think since people had massive expectations, after waiting a LONG time. But if Black Widow came out when it was supposed to, (in may 2020) then it would be rated higher on IMDb.Firstly it has very good action and is super action packed. The story line is good, but could have been better. The characters are ok, but some people such as the villain had no background story whatsoever. The acting is really good, especially the sister and dad who are super funny and amazing in the action sequences. Good comedy, good effects, and ok drama.Overall this is a great movie, that I would recommend.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Such a poser","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7326381/?ref_=tt_urv","snoozejonc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120966602/?ref_=tt_urv","10 September 2021","The origin of Natasha Romanoff is explored in an action packed reunion with her lost family.I think Black Widow is an okay entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that has some decent cinematic moments, good character work, but also some key elements that let it down.I liked the basic plot and character arcs, which are set up well by a brilliant opening sequence, highly reminiscent of 'The Americans'. After that I think it gets a bit stop-start and hit-miss. Also, some scenes feel a bit too close to movies like Bourne and Kill Bill at times.I like the dynamic between Natasha and Yelena. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh have excellent chemistry and both give strong performances. It takes a lot to rival Johansson's presence, but Pugh certainly shares the stage with strong charisma. There are some great feminist themes, plus other allegories about the oppression of freedom, with the two lead characters plus others written well to translate them on screen.David Harbour and Rachel Weisz are both solid, particularly Harbour who adds some decent humour to a number of scenes. Not all of the jokes land, but he works as a bit of a comic relief in the midst of the more serious family dramatics.This is a matter of personal taste, but Ray Winstone does not work as a Russian villain for me. I guess there's somewhat of a Bond tribute going on, but the mumbled cockney-Russian dialogue felt endless at times. A bizarre casting decision.Another problem, and for me the biggest one, is the length and volume of action spectacle. Characters fall off multi-story buildings, have fights to look cool, suffer horrific car crashes, move in clichéd slow motion in front of massive explosions, jump off more things and fall and fall and fall and there's barely a scratch on anyone. There is a lot of extended, ridiculous moments of cartoonish action that disrupt the flow of the story.Outside of the excessive CGI spectacle, the imagery is mostly good. The cinematography, editing, colour grading and visual storytelling is all high quality.Overall I am disappointed as I think the Black Widow character deserves a better solo outing, but it is saved from disaster by the two leading ladies.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

IE in a normal Marvel movie the special effects are just there. In this movie they jump out at you, and are very noticeable. The one thing I hated the most was the flashbacks. These are not typical flash backs in that they show motivation or background information. These flash backs show you how they accomplished certain things, and comes across more as an ass pull.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's not down the bottom end of the MCU movies like Ultron, Iron Man 3 and Thor 2!! But it's nowhere near to top end either.The beginning/opening credits was pretty good at making us care about this family.Although some times the action sequences were so over the top, it was veering into F&F territory and that took me out of the chase sequencesSome moments could have been played dark and dramatically, and I think it would have elevated the movie, but they are played for laughs in the MCU.Scarlet Johansson is as reliable as always in the role of Natasha Romanov, and I really liked Florence Pugh as her sister, but the stand out for me was David Harbour, he isn't given much to do, be here steals the show when he is on screen.Task Master is a huge disappointment. Do not read the names in the opening credits, as movie fans should recognise the name, like I did and when something happens, you realise who it is very easily.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Except for Hawkeye, she was the only one from that OG Avengers team who hadn't got a movie dedicated to them hitherto. Having said that, I'm afraid it's not what we've been waiting for.Right from the beginning, I was noticing some incongruities in its narrative disposition. Which appeared to have an acute scarcity in terms of consistency and integrality. While it did have subtexts regarding Misogyny, Male Chauvinism, and all the other stuff of social relevance; the Screenplay bristled with its own quandaries had not been able to generate acceptable outcomes I reckon!I volitionally got myself invested in all this whacky family drama at the early stages in hopes of getting onto something more substantial. However; down the line in a quite befuddling manner, things started to get redundant and unimaginative! Only then I realized, this is not going to work out. Superficial character depictions and Incompetent Writing; these two main factors are to be blamed for. As a consequence; the entire narration fell flat and was unable to capitalize on the sentimental sides of the storyline.Such a constrictive way of storytelling reigns supreme anytime there's a bit of action going. Chase sequences, Fist Fights, Guns, Explosions, quick-witted Humor; all very conventional Marvel stuff but that's when it achieves the most. Not to mention, it has largely benefited from a bunch of impressive visual effects (for the most part) and a stimulating Score along the same lines.Speaking of Performances; Scarlett Johansson as the leading protagonist did the best she could, as expected. She's been consistently doing the same for years now, so no real surprise there. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz were welcome additions but they were gravely underutilized, serviceable at best. The standout was definitely Florence Pugh; without a doubt! I strongly believe her portrayal of Yelena soon gonna end up being a fan favorite.At the end of the day; I just wanna ask, is this even relevant at this point? As we are all aware of the fact that they have already eradicated the character of Black Widow from their Cinematic Universe. Therefore, she won't be playing any part in the next phase (Phase IV) whatsoever! So, Why now? Why not a couple of years back? Isn't it too late?","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

I also loved the bond between Yelena and Natasha (Scarlett) as they are sarcastic yet charismatic together. Alongside with the chemistry between Rachel Weisz and David Harbour (who is hilarious in the film). But my big issue with Black Widow is that it mostly feels like what you expect from a Marvel movie. With some of the over-the-top action scenes with fights, explosions, and epic orchestral's. Including teaming up with people at a secret base and having them help the protagonist in the climax. There also is humor as you would expect from a Marvel movie, I laughed at some of the jokes and implied humor but it felt a little too constant. Overall I wouldn't say Black Widow is one of the best superhero movies (unfortunately), but I still would recommend it to Marvel fans!","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An overdue Black Widow solo film that delivers more on character than spectacle; Florence Pugh steals the show!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7131840/?ref_=tt_urv","ObsessiveCinemaDisorder","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77520024/?ref_=tt_urv","17 July 2021","Black Widow is a grounded, quieter origin story for Natasha Romanoff which will satisfy fans of the character. It is smaller-scaled in terms of action spectacle, but fans who care about Black Widow will appreciate the character development.Black Widow fills in the missing narrative gaps for its title character between all the Avengers films. We learn about Natasha Romanoff's dark past in Russia before she joined the Avengers. In the first Avengers, Black Widow talks about having red on her ledger and that is dealt with here in a dramatically satisfying manner which retroactively deepens her story arc from Infinity War. The idealist in me wishes this origin story was told earlier and wasn't an afterthought on the Marvel timeline.Director Cate Shortland, who has a background in indie dramas, brings a more delicate touch that veers away from the usual Marvel aesthetic. The cinematography is shot in an intimate fashion that pulls up close to the actor's faces, which translates to a Bourne Identity shaky quick-cut style in the fight scenes. The musical score takes its cue from old political thrillers. Overall, the film feels more intimate and hand-made.There are fewer jokes, something which I appreciated. Black Widow is not a comedy. In fact, it's one of the more tonally serious Marvel installments. The few gags that are there do land and function more like tension breakers than comedic quips.Scarlett Johansson delivers a solid performance in her final outing. Her portrayal here feels like Johannson's own vision of the character. Natasha is not dressed or photographed in an overtly sexual way. She just is a capable Avenger solving her own problems. The Natasha in this film is much more vulnerable than we've seen before. It seems like the note Johannson wants to leave on and she accomplishes that.David Harbour as the Red Guardian, a Russian version of Captain America who is forsaken by his country, was funny as the comedy relief. His character left more to be desired.It is Florence Pugh who steals the show as Yelena Belova. She brings gravitas and communicates her character's dimensions under limited screentime, quickly establishing herself as the most compelling new Marvel character post-Infinity War. The sister story between Natasha and Yelena was well-executed. I look forward to seeing Pugh's next outing as Yelena.Like in most superhero fare, Black Widow struggles between what the film is thematically about versus the commercial expectations it has to deliver. The family drama between Johansson, Pugh, Harbour, and Weisz is easily the best part. With all the commercial box-ticking, the film is too overwhelmed to sink its teeth in exploring this broken family dynamic.At one point, William Hurt's Thaddeus Ross, who is chasing Natasha Romanoff for crimes against the Sokova Accords, feels more like a representation of the Disney-Marvel conglomerate chasing down Scarlett Johansson as she sneakily weaves an arthouse family drama beneath this superhero movie.The film could have used fewer action sequences and traded that time for more dramatic scenes of the family working out their issues. There were a few fights that seemed unmotivated and I am sure the director would undoubtedly agree.Marvel Studios has gotten the whole world to care about all these characters now. Everybody now sits so obediently waiting for the end credits scene. We've seen science, aliens, gods, and magic. Marvel has us in the seats already. They can really wow us with more feels.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Due to the fact that we've had to wait for it fir over a year because of Covid it made expecations even higher. Not all of the films in the MCU are masterpieces but most of them are entertaining and somewhat memorable. Black Widow for me has been one of the best characters in the Marvel Universe and I don't understand why she never got her own stand alone film until after we know her fate in Avengers: Endgame. But we finally get this film and unfortunately it is one of the weakest MCU films since it started in 2008 with Iron Man.Scarlett Johanssen is credited as an executive producer on the film so I think she had some say in the direction the film but she should have gotten a better script. The film is set in after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Natasha Romanoff is on tge run because The Avengers are all being hunted. We get some backstort with Natasha as a kid with her sister Yekelana and her supposed parents Melina and Alexei. The movie is not really an origin story but it deals with some of the things that formed Natasha into the woman she is. The film feels very jokey and lazy at the same time. There is a good chemistry between Scarlet Johanssen and Florence Pugh who plays Yelena. Pugh gives the best performance in the film. She is very funny and fleshes out her character well. Rachel Weisz
Is and David Harbour are good in their roles but are really just comic relief. The action is not particularly exciting. Nothing we've never seen before. The main villain Dreykov is also very weak. As fantastical as these types of films are they work when they involve us is what's happening. We get invested in the story. It did not feel invested. The action is over the top as expected but is really just average. There is no sense of danger. The CGI dominates so much that it just isn't exciting. It's disappointing that such a great Marvel character would get such an average and uninspired film.One of the worst in the series.Grade: C-","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

In this case, the villain guy Dreykov is supposed to be this evil genius but somehow gives away all the secrets for no reasons. Father (Alexei) is a babbling idiot the whole movie, acting like all Russian men are clowns who drink vodka, possess superhero power but never uses it. Natasha's assistant (Mason) basically a male servant, who needs kind words from her to feel better about himself, gets hurt when girls make fun of him. The government guy (Secretary Ross) another idiot with a lot of power that he can't use to catch a single woman WITHOUT superhuman powers.Why men would ever pay money to go see this in theaters???Yelena acted like a man the whole movie more or less. And that's why everybody saying that she carries the whole film, while Natasha had this sad/confused look on her face the whole time.What makes Natasha the Avenger in the first place? There're hundreds of girls just like her.I love watching movies with female leads, and always enjoy a good story, but why to make all men a bunch of idiots? It's sets a bad example for young men who watch it.Go watch Anna (2019) and you'll see the difference.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

Definitely nat deserves this. All the lead cast was awesome Especially Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh. Both had great chemistry and acting was superb. Action and fight scenes were good too. The opening was definitely dark and there were many emotional moments in this film.One of the main problem with this movie was taskmaster. That twist was very lame. He should be terrifying like in the comics but I'm not happy with this version. Marvel should introduce another taskmaster in the future movies.Overall movie was great. For me it was so far the best female led superhero movie beating WW1 with slightly better story. So I think I will rank these movies as BW>WW1>CM>BOP>WW84>Catwoman>Electra> if there is one any left idk.I think Instead of Captain marvel Disney and marvel should have considered black widow to release in theaters before endgame without the end credits and worked on CM movie to be a better version than what we saw in theaters.Still I am satisfied with this movie as it gives our nat aka black widow a perfect ending to her story and the respect that she deserves. I am really gonna miss Scarlett Johansson as black widow. 1 woman in a group of 6 avengers. She was amazing. If we could get to see some more of her flashbacks in some upcoming MCU projects than it would be great.Just want to say I am happy that this happened.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

Of course, Natasha got a big advantage because she got family.As expected from a Marvel movie, the action scenes were fun to watch. All the fights were well choreographed, and the camera shots were decent and not choppy. Also, there were tons of explosion and characters got thrown around. I was amazed that Natasha was still able to walk after all the stunts she pulled. It felt kinda like fast and furious.One of the big question surrounding this movie a while ago was whether there is a reason for this movie to exist since Black Widow already died in Endgame (Endgame spoiler). And honestly, I don't think there is. The story itself was straightforward with a villain who was just a typical bad guy who wanted control the world. We got a little bit of what Budapest was about, but not enough to answer what Hawkeye was referring to in the first Avengers. The movie mostly exists as a summer blockbuster. Well it did pushed the story forward a bit with the post-credit scene (you need to watch Falcon and Winter Soldier and Endgame to understand the post-credit).The family dynamic was fun tho. David Harbour mostly played a goofy dad and enjoyed the comedy from his character. Natasha and her sister, Yelena, played wonderfully by Florence Pugh, also had funny moments and the sister dynamic was great. Even though the parents didn't get a lot of moments, Yelena had many awesome scenes. She had the best joke in the movie, which was the one about posing.Overall, I think it was still an entertaining action thriller, despite how mediocre the story was. 7.5/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film is the first and only solo story for Scarlett Johansson's character that she has been playing since 2010's 'Iron Man 2'. It is chronologically set between 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Infinity War' and is directed by Cate Shortland.As mentioned, it stars Scarlett Johansson as the titular character in her ninth outing as the hero. Along with Johansson this movie stars MCU newcomers Florence Pugh as 'Yelena Belova' and David Harbour as 'Alexei Shostakov'. This film is carried by Pugh and Harbour. They are brilliant and hilarious in their roles along with having great chemistry. Yelena Bolova's introduction into this franchise gives hope for the upcoming titles in which she will appear.Main villains have always been an issue for the MCU, most of them being fairly lacklustre, with very few breaking the mould set but the previous titles. This film follows that same formula with the character of 'Taskmaster'. In the source material, 'Taskmaster' is Tony Masters, a mercenary with photographic reflexes, meaning he can replicate the physical skills of anyone. However, in this film they changed him to Antonia, personally I don't care about the filmmakers changing the gender of the character but I really don't like them turning the villain into a mere henchwoman instead of the badass mercenary that he was in the comics. Taskmaster wasn't the only poor villain, Ray Winstone's 'Dreykov' is positioned as the main adversary for Johansson's protagonist. His Russian accent is abysmal and his character is equally nonsensical. I don't understand making him the main villain when you have the potential of a huge fan favourite character like 'Taskmaster'.This film could've been so much more than it eventually was. If this was made back in 2016 after 'Captain America: Civil War', when it is set, than it could've taken more risks with the plot, and change the fate of some of the minor characters. This movie could've been a really lovely story about family and a family coming together after a long time, a plot that would've been very relatable with many people. However, it turns into a classic Marvel film in the third act and it becomes a normal CGI centric picture that takes the audience out of the grounded story they were previously telling.Overall, 'Black Widow' is an average Marvel picture which takes minimal risks and doesn't live up to what this film could've been. It was carried by most of the cast but was severely let down by the flat and uninspired antagonists.6.5/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger.To be honest I had to keep my expectations in check because I was anticipating this film for so long any film would be hard to live up to my expectations . Gladly , Black Widow for the most part ,was worth the wait :) A fully-fledged female-led adventure ! The film has an excellent cast of Oscar and Emmy nominated talent . Harbour (Stranger Things) and Pugh's (Little Women), delightful turns puncture the film brilliantly. As does ""mother"" Melina Rachel Weisz (The Favourite) .The film has got some incredible set-pieces an excellent cinematography. Including an impressive helicopter sequence that gets your adrenaline pumping and heart racing. The motorcycle chase scene is epic. Some of the fight scene and hand-to-hand combat are truly entertaining ! Black Widow is seriously an action-packed summer blockbuster.Rachel Weisz delivers the most restrained performance in the film as the cold and calculating Melina. She does a great job in a role.David Harbour nails absolutely Alexi aka Red Guardian. Harbour's able to make the character into a goofy, likable dude.Black Widow is Florence Pugh's launching pad into the Marvel world, with her next appearance as Yelena set to be in the Hawkeye series. Johansson passed the baton to Pugh and the Oscar nominee proves she's more than up to the task. Pugh's got the most impressive deadpan delivery and even simple lines of dialogue have depth and bite. There's some really effective sisterly banter between Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh regarding Scarlett Johansson striking a perfect superhero-landing pose as Black Widow. It is quite charming and funny.As good as the ensemble is ; this is Scarlett Johansson's movie and she truly delivers , big time ! Black Widow is not only Scarlett Johansson's final outing in the MCU but also her best of the lot. We find Romanoff in unfamiliar territory, on her own and without any form of a support structure. She's vulnerable in a way that we haven't really seen before, something Johansson portrays beautifully. Scarlett Johansson, the charismatic queen of Marvel science fiction. There's no doubt about it I'm definitely going to miss her Super Hero character.Natasha Romanoff's last hurrah is an action-packed and emotional thrill ride from start to finish. 7.5/10.","12 out of 19 found this helpful.

Too many action scenes, and fake emotional ones, poor humour. Also, there is again the old story of ""bad Russia"" and ""good USA"", and I thought the cold war is over. Russian accents are ridiculous and fake even to me and I am not Russian. I mean no Russian would ever pronounce Jelena and Natasha as they did in a movie... The list is endless... I expect the rating to fall around 5 as the time is passing by. Perhaps it is still ok for the audience who is bellow 15 years old, but then again for them it's too much violence, so not sure for whom is this movie made then? Good point - I like that it is filmed on different locations and that is a unique opportunity to see a glimpse of those for people who don't get the chance to travel. Also actresses are handsome.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

While I respect them massively, I don't read comics, I never have, and I think it's okay for movies to take creative licence when basing a story on comics. People get so angry over things that movies change! It is a movie! Not a comic. I liked Taskmaster in general! I wish they won more fights, but apart from they they seemed pretty badass.Anyway to the plot. I enjoyed it. The twists are nice and unexpected throughout, the acting is great, the fight scenes are creative for the MCU, and the CGI is outstanding as always. I really enjoyed this movie, more than a lot of other Marvel Movies, like Thor 1 and 2, Iron man 2, Captain America, etc etc.So many people base their reviews off of the comics. JUST ENJOY THE MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS, A MOVIE!I think it's great.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

If you do not then you will be sitting in your seat reliving your whole life asking yourself where did it all go wrong? That's how boring the film is, before the film even started there was a advertisement for Black Widow the film I was about to watch. This reminded me of how Disney owns majority of popular franchises and have control of the film industry. There was a opening sequence where they played a altered version of the song ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by artist Kurt Cobain. Hearing this was surreal as Smells Like Teen Spirit was one of there most disliked songs by Kurt Cobain that he made yet they used it. I know why they used it, even though there are better songs which could of worked they could possibly offend someone. Thats why they used the most safe and most popular song of theirs, even if it adds no substance.This can describe the film in itself as it does nothing new and nothing interesting. I just wish that these film will stay on streaming platforms and not cinemas.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Other than that, there's not much to say. The third act was the best, but the end was... underwhelming. Not in a bad way, just... Not in the way that I would've liked.It's difficult, because, as you hopefully know by now, Natasha is not alive anymore. I truthfully don't even know why they made this movie to begin with. Scarlett Johansson was great as Black Widow, but Florence Pugh outshined her. Rachel Weisz was in the movie. David Harbor was kinda funny, but also kinda annoying at times, which was probably the point.But yeah. I feel like this film should've been released after Civil War, and not after Endgame. Knowing what happens in Endgame, it's kinda difficult to be on edge or even be concerned for the character.Either way, I really liked the film. It was somewhat predictable, but the third act had some surprises. Visuals were, at times, a bit wonky, but overall very good. I am a simp for Marvel in general, so I'll get behind most of what they do. Though, again, this film should've been the film released after Civil War.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But something this strange warrants noting.First, the pacing. The pacing of the earlier films was mostly impeccable. Fight scenes didn't last too long and were broken up by cool CGI and character turns. Here? Endless chase/fight sequences, glazed-eyed-boring to everyone other than 11 year old boys who are truly jazzed up by cars flipping through the air. Bang, pow, screech, crash, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, my god it's 30 minutes now .... After a while I muted it and started skimming the news on my phone. Missed nothing. Why abandon a famously winning formula for a juvenile hackneyed one? Strange.Second, characters. The Black Widow was fascinating in the earlier films for her combination of uncanny fighting skill and a complex personality that's almost completely missing here. After waiting for this film with great anticipation, I found myself not caring about her at all. I don't recall the last time I so completely lost interest in a character; I never want to see her again. Wiping out interest in an Avenger ... have to credit the director and writers with that strange achievement.Finally, and worst, there's no fun here! The Marvel movies have been marvelous fun in combining real suspense with wit, originality with splashes of satire, danger with warmth. You laughed moments before you held your breath. Here I did neither. If that bit about a chopped up uterus was supposed to be comic relief, jeez, no. If dad congratulating his daughters on all their murders was supposed to be funny, jeez, no. Black Widow is more like a gritty cold war film from the 1960s: brooding, dark, depressed, gruesome, grim. Maybe it's partly the unrelentingly gloomy score.What a strange turn... take a great party and pour dirty ice water over the whole thing.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The amount of plot details derived from this effort just crams up especially throughout the first half of the runtime, making it near impossible to keep up with the already complicated plot. Moreover, the main concept of the movie being really solid and grounded, it feels like the whole sci fi marvel tone just didn't fit in. Had the protagonist a different name, and the filmmakers not the need to satisfy the franchise needs, the movie would instantly become a near-masterpiece. And here's why.The technical aspect of the film is excellent (precisely what one should expect from a 200 million production). The cinematography is spicy yet coherent, doing an excellent job at creating both the suitable atmosphere and a brilliant looking piece of video. The visual effects well stand up to a modern big-budget action movie, with well-executed set extensions and proper simulations.As for the plot, the idea of bringing the aftermath of the cold war to the present day is meticulously interwoven with the topic of family, the latter definitely better executed than the average budget-driven cinematic disaster of our times. The characters feature well-written and distinct personalities, and for the most part decent arcs as well. The acting does no bad job of helping out in this area.To mention some barely significant downsides, the directing does fall behind at particular action sequences, where it gets hard to even tell the two opponents apart. Moreover, despite the plot being well-structured, there flow of information is not, resulting in the first half of the movie sounding more like an online lecture and the second half being pure chaos.Finally, we all know killing a protagonist off in-between installments is not a good thing, but killing them off in the final credits, that's a whole new level of a weird choice. Anyway, a ticket to the sequel would probably be a good buy for me.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

That in itself is tragic feat - result is THIS film. Scarlett Johanson was well cast & acted as Black Widow in Avengers films with her Hawkeye. This film has NO resemblance to the Black Widow in Avengers films.Plot : ALL Pettit under 24 thin, model like FEMALES are secret ""heroes"" with enhanced genes & training who live @off the grid."" They're better than ""John Wick"" who needs decades of training &!bulletproof suit, & girls are more skilled than Cruise's ""Ethan Hunt & team"" of MI franchise. Here, Scarlet Bkack Widow & her Russian sister sporting bad blonde dye job, wear REGULAR CLOTHES withstanding ZERO injuries during thrown out :
1. Speeding car glass windows;
2. Skyscrapers windows & falling over 5 stories onto concrete ground.3. Both posses ability to throw any heavy object like Hulk
4. Both can easily win CLOSE hand to hand combat against heavily armored larger widows.5. Both can withstand huge bombs exploding few feet away, & NEITHER Scarlet nor her blonde sister sustain even 1 scratch, nor 1 stain on pure white clothing. LOL!!!Scarlett should he in heavyweight boxing ring since she can take 4 direct close fisted punches to her face from heavy Serb middle aged man. She doesn't suffer a cut lip, pink cheek, or swollen face. Spiderman suffered physical injuries under his mask. Plus, Scarlet can talk & laugh during brutal facial assault - zero blood in her perfect white teeth, of course.Real life consequences: Disney / Marvel does GREAT DISSERVICE to real females who ARE battered by men- 1 solid punch from average guy can break woman's jaw.Science proven films desensitize young viewers. Here, boys / young teens watching THIS film, witness ALL females globally want to be hit bc it's ""fun"" & ""thin pretty girls cannot be injured"". As Marvel releases same predictedable formula, ""hitting females of any age is acceptable""' bc it's a ""new age for girls who are born tougher than males.."" Yet, same impressionable boys will see ALL MALES are easily injured. Result: boys be hitting girls bc SHE is impervious to physical injury from male. Disastrous in real life.Last, Disney is determined to reverse genders in past superior Marvel films true to comic bookd by creating only FEMALE heroes for empowerment. ThennWHY does THIS film showcase following female sexual stereotypes Women's Lib battled for generations by show casing following facts:1. Females (widows) are all in early 20s;
petite model thin bodies; attractive face & full bust, teen boy size model like rear.2. No muscles shown in upper body, esp long scenes displaying widows bare arms & shoulders; Thor is rippling with muscles, as are real life females in pro sports or fight clubs.3. Female ""widows"" incl Scarlet wear full heavy makeup, false eye lashes; contact lenses; long hair; all have facials, manicure nails with noticeable color polish ; wear multiple earrings n 1 ear that was not done during this film's pre cell phone time period.ALL above = highlights supposed sexual stereotypes, esp in repeated clips showing only TEEN girls of every race. However Asians, not Indians from India, still have NO speaking lines in Marvel films - just wallflowers decorations. So much for equality Disney.I fell asleep during the ending action scene after fast forwarding the middle of the film. I couldn't bear watching the boring acting, dialogue & plot after enduring first 45 min. No plot ending except to set up more insipid sequels to Martel / Disney cookie cutter film machine.Def SKIP IT- do NOT waste one's time nor $$. I saw this on streaming bc theater trailers already looked predictable & dull like most Marvel films in past 7 years.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The best was Yelena (Florence Pugh), she was a great addition to the MCU and very funny.

I definitely feel like she should have been the first female superhero to get her own film, as she obviously had more relevance to the on-going story compared to 'Captain Marvel'. However, this film was well worth the wait for me personally!I loved the new characters that were introduced, particularly Yelena and the Red Guardian. I felt like nearly every actor pulled off the diverse accents required for this film. Also, the opening scene for this film was one of the best I've seen in a while. It was so suspenseful and thrilling! One criticism I can think of is one of the main antagonists is not really explored, despite having an interesting twist involving their identity.

A movie that works without any knowledge of what has gone on before or what will happen next? I would argue that it can work. Of course having some knowledge of the timeline is not a bad thing to have. And while this starts off before other big events, it mainly plays between Civil War (which was an Captain America movie, even though all the Avengers were in it) and Infinity War.And it sort of literally closes a gap and gives us more Black Widow. Yes this movie was something a lot of people wanted to see a long time ago. But the way they put and the story they are telling - it works quite fine. It is more of spy thriller kind of thing rather than a superhero movie (a lot of superhero kind of stuff still happens) - there is even a clip on the telly (TV) showing us James Bond.But amongst all the action and all the frenzy and all the becoming or growing as a character (Black Widow but also her allies), there is a lot of family stuff happening. Which is funny, considering that the family thing is a front. Now I am not alone in saying that this is an allegory not just on family life but the American (way of) Life. And while the addition of the American Pie song might have been an ad lib or last minute addition, it sums it up really good in more than one way. And just when you least expect it, the song also might get a tear out of you. Or at least make you sentimental.The performances are great and the way a big machine like Marvel still allows performers to do and bring their own ideas shows on screen. The chemistry between the characters and the fun they are having on set. And then there are pigs - a friend was reminded of Bullets of Justice ... I have to admit, this could work as a prequel to that too (this is a violent movie, do not seek it out if you are easily offended and squeamish).All that aside, yes there are ridiculous things happening, yes many things are removed from reality, but it has quite the courage to go places, that you may not expect - for a Marvel movie and all that. And when towards the end ... well a certain piece of music/theme is playing ... if you have been a fan of the Avengers universe and the movies before, you will get emotional. I can guarantee you that.And as always there is something in the credits. Actually after the credits (this time no one left the theatre, they have been trained well like myself) - one little scene that sets up a ""future project"" ... which is not that far in the future, but you'll know once you see it.","44 out of 86 found this helpful.

Instead we got a jumbled mess with a boring plot and the titular character wasn't even the star of the movie. I found red guardian, yelena, and the mother much better characters in this movie which was shocking considering Scarlet has had over 10 years of experience playing the character, yet she gave by far the worst performance in the whole movie. Now I understand why Marvel was hesitant to give black widow a solo film, she does not command the same screen presence as other characters such as RDJ's Ironman, or Chris Evan's Captain America. If this is the quality of movie we get from here on out, I am very worried about the future of the MCU. But I am hopeful that this movie is just a miss and not indicative of the future of the franchise.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I liked Florence Pugh as she did deadly killer/little sister very well, Olga Kurylenko needn't have been in it, Ray Winston (who I love usually) was an odd choice and was under used, Rachel Weisz seemed bored and David Harbour did well with what he was given but was basically an idiot.The story was fine, if a little silly and the first half was a lot better than the second half.Overall, it was an entertaining (if not gripping) way to spend a couple of hours and feel that if it was released 4 or 5 years ago then it would have had the benefit of the MCU hype but as this is now in essence a stand alone movie it was very average.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

3) I was really engaged by the emotional conflict between the four members of the ""family"" and their complicated relationships they have with each other and their pastsNEGATIVES:1) Taskmaster made no sense to me - does it ever explain how they are able to perfectly copy everyone else's moves? Also, although the identity reveal was surprising, I found Taskmaster far less intimidating after the identity reveal
2) The film suffers from a common MCU problem; it has very dark themes but they are frequently undermined by the out of place humour and jokes

I was hoping for/expecting a spy movie with lots of secrecy, sneaking, and growth for Natasha. I got a bit of growth and a 'family movie'. I liked her family actually. It wasn't too forced. The intro was awesome with the rendition of smells like teen spirit. She did take a beating like captain America which made her seem super soldiery, that and the falling fighting scene at the climax.

Actually there are a lot of negative points to talk about but I'll just include these which I see most important
1. Rachel Weisz character (Melina) was such a waste! They could certainly use her as a mother figure in a way that could add more drama to most of the scenes.2. Speaking of drama, the movie has a huge lack of that, It is one of a few MCU movies that I couldn't relate to its characters or even feel sad for them and their story.3. I never really felt like that I should be afraid that something bad is gonna happen to the team because, simply, even they didn't, I'm not from the people who complain about the comedic scenes that ruin marvel movies but that movie's comedic scenes REALLY ruined the movie.4. Last but certainly not the least, the villain in that movie is so bad, actually he's now the 1st one on my list of the worst MCU villains, I think that's the only MCU villain that we didn't even know his motives, he just wants to control the whole world all 90s bad guys style. Yeah and if you're excited to see Taskmaster in that movie because you like the character from the comics, then you'll really be disappointed, and I mean REALLY disappointed.But hey, the movie wasn't the worst of all time after all, what do you think that 6 is for?! So, let's move to the good points!1. Florence Pugh and David Harbour's comedic roles were pretty good, especially Pugh's, the girl literally stole the movie from everybody else even Scarlett.2 The CGI is, as usual, pretty good and the movie is a pleasant visual experience.3. The movie, as a whole, is entertaining to watch, I mean that's why movies are made, right?To make it short and sweet Black Widow is a meh movie with a solid plot, a little drama and nice comedic scenes. Yeah and I gotta say that it shouldn't even exist because simply it doesn't matter now because Nat actually (SPOILER ALERT FOR AVENGERS: ENDGAME)
died, the only reason that movie exists is for its post-credit scene so, be sure to check that out.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But basically that's what Black Widow is. It further explores the background of Black Widow, one the earliest and most human of the Avengers. And since this character is an ass-kicking former spy with a murky past, comparison with the Bourne franchise is quickly made. Except that this is a MCU superhero film and therefore the action setpieces are totally over the top and somehow doesn't really suit the basic material. The interesting parts of the film are the more realistic scenes where we get to know Romanoff's past and some more down to earth fight scenes (and not the overblown finale). Johansson does a solid job but it are newcomers Pugh and Harbour that steal the show. It all does feel a bit ""haven't we seen this before"" and particularly after such a great ending of MCU's phase 3 feels like an extra dessert you didn't order.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's probably the most realistically violent in the entire series. There is a lot of blood and broken bones. Which doesn't mean it skimps on the humor!

So I didn't have high hopes for this movie at all. But after finishing it, it was surprisingly good. The acting was good, the actions scenes were very well made. I think the director did a really good job. I've never heard of her before, but she did a way better job than the directors of Captain Marvel.Scarlett and Florence both are amazing in this movie, and play off each other well. The main villian is....ok, I would say he was amazing, but we didn't really get to see much of him. The other side characters weren't all that good either; David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz are more or less shoved at the sideline.This movie is very much similar to the Mission Impossible saga, from the action, cinematography, and even the music sounds the same (which isn't a shock considering it's the same composer). But this seems to work for the film.Black Widow is good, it's far from one of the best, but it was good to see a decent send off to Black Widow. I feel like this movie is several years too late. Can't believe we got Captain Marvel before this movie. Ridiculous.7/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I liked how we dive a little deeper into Natasha's origins and her family. It's the film we've been waiting for for 10 years. It was cool seeing her family and their traits. One downside is that even if it's a Black Widow movie, Yelena, Natasha's sister, steals the show a lot during the film. It's nice to see her, but I would've liked more Black Widow in the film. Really, whenever Yelena or Alexi are on screen, they steal the spotlight. The villain was develop ok, sort of, and so was Natasha's family. The action scenes in this film don't need some magic for sci-fi. It's like action from a James Bond movie, and it works well with this movie. Another issue I have with the film was that the start was pretty good, but the rest of the film just kind of falls. I also hated how they portrayed Red Guardian in this movie. They treat him like he's an idiot, and I wish there was one moment where he had a chance to shine as Red Guardian I just hope not to see any Black Widow family memes. Overall a decent MCU return to the big screen.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

The sister twist story was well played and did not push too far on the reunification side so the movie was able to start pretty quick. The prison sequence was quite long and useless to my opinion, nothing fun to watch there.Some of the plot twists have also been well shown with some slight hint of surprise. I just hate the long monologues and useless battles such as Black Widow against a bunch of other widows, receiving that many hits, I'd be on the ground without moving anymore and with a blown nose, unable to fight too. As I said in my Shang-Chi review, having a sens of inner strength battle is a good thing but the females seem way too overpowered for simple human beings.We also have no real clue about what is happening between Black Widow and Shield and we have no real answer to it. Even if the answer is maybe in previous movies, a refresher would have been nice because there is no explanation to the final scene and movie with an ending sequence unexplainable to me is worth at least 2 good stars off knowing that this is Marvel. It's also quite boring to see all of the heros fail miserably in their combats with barely a small scratch and lumping from one leg. The movie misses the feeling of hero satisfaction and story fulfillment and leaves us with a sens of Good action but I don't mind not following the story, the movie is just a movie.Enjoyable, fun to watch ---- ONCE!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The actors did the best job they could do with this decent script however they can all do a lot more if given the chance.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The problem is the script and it's tone. I like the director in her previous work, but she has no feel for this type of material. Black Widow was always going to be hard to adapt on her own, because she's always been a supporting character in the comics. She doesn't have great material to draw from. The story in the movie is ambitious, but not well written. It tries too hard to mean something, when it's unearned in the script. The action scenes were well choreographed and filmed, but it suffered from a lack of suspense, because the villains are so terrible. Marvel has always had mostly two dimensional villains, but here they are one dimensional. They serve as plot devices, rather than as a true nemesis.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first 30 minute on this was like a non-stop action because it's action packed. The whole film tells a story about Natasha 5 years ago about Natasha going back to her haunted past. Now the villain wasn't that great. Some moments in this film is very thrilling especially Taskmaster it actually made the action scene look alot more thrilling. The film is also like PG-13 Mature with some dark tone, this is probably one of the most darkest film in the MCU. The action in this film makes the whole film like full with action. Well it's not for kids under 13 to watch because the action does have some violence in it. Another thing that I really love is the character, the character is the reason why the MCU franchise is a successful franchise. The character backstory looks satisfying, emotional, with some thrilling moments and the family reunion was also emotional. The whole film wasn't too little, it's not too small the whole film is just a journey for Natasha going back to her past. The villain doesn't have any super evil plan. Now the way they tell a story about Natasha 5 years ago does feels kind of late but I don't really care much.Verdict: 8.5/10.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

The biggest crux of this film is its importance to the MCU. I can't say this movie really impacts the MCU very much or was even that necessary at this point given the events of Endgame. It also felt more like set up for Yelena than a solo Black Widow movie at times.The biggest highlight, besides Pugh (very Villanelle-like in the role) and Harbour, is the family dynamic. Taking cues from The Americans, the Russian spy family story was compelling stuff. The action was pretty brutal and what I wanted from this film. The opening sequence and credits were excellent and I was hoping that tone would keep up for the rest of the movie.For negatives, Marvel really needs to get out of their own way. The constant jokes during serious moments really undercuts the drama and actual character development. This is a continuing issue and this movie may be the worst example yet. Taskmaster might take the cake for most disappointing MCU villain, which is saying something, so I really hope they do more with that character. The other villain was pretty generic too.I definitely have a lot of issues with this film, but it's hard to not enjoy the Marvel formula at this point.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

It's basically a distaff James Bond with more childhood trauma, but for that it's generally good.Like a lot of MCU movies, Black Widow assumes you've watched all the other movies and remember who everyone is. It seems to also assume we'll understand the little story it tells in the credits, which is more impressionistic than informative. I was pretty much at a loss for the first 1/2 hour.At first this movie felt like I'd already seen it. There's a fight scene on a bridge that I could have sworn I'd already seen, even though the movie just came out, and it really took a while before that sense of Deja Vu ended.At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep going, but once the excellent Florence Pugh shows up as the protagonist's sister and the movie starts delving into the nature of family and some moral grey zones things get more interesting. And the final half hour of explosions and twists and hurtling through the sky is impressively action-y, even if no one has x-ray vision.While this movie's insistence on not explaining things to non-MCU fanatics (a practice it returns to in a final coda) and some rote early scenes keep this from being as good as it could have been, overall this is an entertaining movie. Recommended.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

And knowing the release date just added to the anticipation. I know a lot of us were worried that this movie wouldn't live up to our lofty expectations, but it absolutely exceeded them!Black Widow was amusing, intense, and entertaining. It possesses its own gritty distinctiveness while appearing to blend in well with the rest of the MCU. Scarlett Johansson then delivered an outstanding performance. It truly saddens me that this will be her final appearance on the big screen as Natasha Romanoff. As for Florence Pugh, as Yelena, it was just chef's kiss. She gave her all to this charming character. I gonna love seeing Yelena more in the MCU.Not to mention Rachel Weisz and David Harbour. They were also fantastic on-screen, contributing to the family-like dynamic with Scarlett and Florence.Overall, this is a film that everyone should see. It features an excellent soundtrack, CGI, and combat sequences.

It made me want to see more of these characters. On the downside, there are some cliche lines that are a bit annoying and the villain/s are quite bland, unoriginal and un-compelling. I've heard people complaining that they don't like the movie as it doesn't feel necessary, which kind of makes sense, but why does it need to be? Just enjoy it for what it is. I would definitely still recommend seeing this.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Check. Badass female characters (including a strong performance by Pugh)? Check. Humorous one-liners? Check. Compelling origin story? Almost a check.The film seems to be in a bit of an identity crisis where it can't quite make up its mind if it wants to be easy, fun superhero entertainment (think Deadpool) or a grim, darker biopic about a superhero (think Logan). To its demise, it seems like the film decided to fall somewhere in the middle. So whether you go in wanting pure fantastical fun or go in wanting authentic and moving storytelling, you're left with this feeling of ""man that was almost really good.""You almost cry, you almost laugh out loud, and you almost really like the movie. For what it's worth, it also feels like a missed opportunity to create something unique.

I was laughing at that goofy line for 30 seconds. Couldn't they hire better writers? It was one of the goofiest lines I've ever heard.The movie was disappointing enough, but it's still fun to watch.At least I'd rather watch this again than Captain Marvel!

Here she's either swinging around like Spiderman or out running a greenscreen. But isn't she supose to be a mere human character? I supose this is how she's been portrayed so far so they had to keep going with it.

Had it been released in 2014 or before timeline, the entire setup and rage for black widow would've been way higher. Keeping this aside, I won't say it is one of MCU""s best, but I enjoyed BW barring few hiccups in the middle with patchy cgi in couple of scenes. CGI part could've been lot better in the last act as it spoiled the real fun. Grounded fight sequences would've made this one more effective, as we are pretty aware of BW's strengths.Scarlet is Black widow and she served it right all these years being an avenger and seeing her in action again for the last time is really different feeling. I don't know about others but whenever she is in action mode with her "" kickass pose "" , it gave me good vibes and when Yelena uttered "" you're a poser"" I was like...yeah she is and we love it when she does it. Of course Jo excelled in her role as usual, i wanted more of Natasha stuff here as it is the last movie but fine, kind of satisfied. Young Nat protecting her little sister Yelena in the beginning is indeed a beautiful scene. Loved jo and Florence bonding , such a delight !!!Florence Pugh got a great debut in MCU , she literally grabbed the opportunity and showcased her talent with her fierce performance and attitude as Yelena, loved her. One of the finest additions to the MCU, no doubt and I'm pumped up to see her in future marvel projects . LET'S PROTECT YELENA AND KATE BISHOP (Hailee) <3Lovely Rachel Weisz, good to see her and did her part as Melina along with David as red guardian. Expected a lot with taskmaster part but it is a letdown. Over all, Nat - yelena show all the way and it is a good ride.

I wanted to find out about the next adventure of the Black Widow and maybe dot the ""e"" in the story of the character.The film focuses on Natasha's past and simultaneously introduces us to new characters. New only for the audience. In the life of a Widow, they have been and are for a long time. A kind of family that reunites again to solve the puzzle and deal with the notorious Red Room and its creator once and for all.The plot is driving and dynamic, the characters are interesting and lively. However, throughout the whole picture, a persistent unpleasant feeling does not leave that events are being adjusted to the already long-existing and formed universe of superheroes. And from this ""fitting"", the events that are taking place seem somehow artificial and unnatural. A fly in the ointment adds a shift in emphasis from the main character to her follower Elena Belova, who will become a future Widow and one of the main characters in future Marvel projects. There are no complaints about the actress Florence Pugh, who plays Elena. She plays great, but it often seems that her presence is far-fetched.Funny are the Red Guardian and Melina. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz look organic and even comical in these roles from scene to scene. In a sense, the film goes out on them, leaving a smile on their face after watching episodes with these characters. Scarlett and her Natasha are still good. It's nice to see the heroine on the screen.The main antagonist General Drake, played by the charismatic Ray Winston, appears in the picture as a kind of image of pressure and infringement of the female half of humanity. Angry and arrogant, he is the personification of evil, oppressing in every possible way numerous girls who become black widows and are under the heel of a man. The theme of gender discrimination in society is clearly traced, and the picture is designed to show that women in the face of black widows are strong and independent, ready to fight for the rights of all women. Of course, this is not directly mentioned in the picture, but the bias in this topic is clearly traced.The picture is designed to once again remind women around the world that they are able to achieve everything. This has been clear to everyone for a long time, but often such projects clearly want to play on the eternal theme of gender inequality.The visual range and sound are decent. The amount of action is sufficient. A lot of cranberries, which seemed to be stuck somewhere at the level of thirty years ago. It seems that in the imagination of the creators of the picture, Russians still live in the dashing 90s, they always drink vodka when they are going to have lunch/ dinner / breakfast, and of course a bear with a balalaika is about to appear around the corner. It seems to be funny, but it doesn't seem to be very.Nevertheless, the picture looks good. The film will give some answers to those events that were once mentioned in the film universe and concerned Natasha Romanoff. Was the conclusion of the Black Widow's story worthy? Everyone decides for himself. For myself, I concluded that although the project is close in my understanding to the category of ""passing"", as a fan of Scarlett Johansson and her heroine, I will be happy to watch the film again.7 out of 10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Iron Man presses a button and the bad guys fall down, here it's more like a series of dance moves showing off their amazing training, and there are some well choreographed interactions.It sadly doesn't pull off the same level of comedy as Ragnarok; Red Guardian is just a buffoon in comparison to Korg and Co, while Natashas fixer seems to spend much of his screen time asleep, but it has some good lines that keeps it moving along at a good speed.Prequels are tricky for a series character; you can explore extra details to their lives - such as Natasha talking a bit more about her history with Clint - but ultimately they have to end in a situation that links to something that's been filmed before. You can't have a character die in a prequel, when you know they're alive in a previous film that takes place later in the characters timeline (unless the future character is actually a clone or has some other subtle change made to them). This does seem to reduce the risk to life here - Yelena is listed in the Hawkeye series - though in what capacity this Widow will take is still to be decided.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The plot is banal and forgettable relying on the crashy smashy action scenes to hold the audiences attention.Just like Logan's backstory was teased in the X-Men franchise, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had a past that was touched upon in the Avengers movies. Her scene with a captured Loki in 'Avengers Assemble' was most intriguing and begged for a spin off film to explore Romanoff's past. Like The Wolverine's solo outing 'Black Widow' doesn't deliver.No where nearly as bad as the X-Men Origins movie but still a flawed piece of story telling and a missed opportunity.'Black Widow' is entertaining and offers some excellent performances by the cast involved. Except perhaps Ray Winstone who's Russian accent drops in and out more often than a dodgy WI-FI connection. Set pieces are grand as you'd expect in a Marvel movie but the end product lacks venom (and I don't mean the Marvel character played by Tom Hardy).There's no depth to this movie. Unlike 'Logan' the redeeming Wolverine movie, 'Black Widow' is all polish and garnish. There's some nice character interaction. The family scenes are comical and well played out but I constantly got the sense that all this had been done before in better movies. The car chase scene was lifted straight from 'Mission Impossible'. The prison break reminded me of 'Deadpool 2' and the falling fortress in the sky was done better in the Captain America sequel. Even the fight choreography had whiffs of John Wick and Jason Bourne. That said for all this films flaws I was still immensely entertained. Whilst I won't be rushing to shell out for the 4K Blu-ray I will once again indulge when the movie becomes available for free as part of my subscription on Disney Plus.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The entire story on ""Free choice vs. Control"" was well written and produced. Scarlett Johansson excelled in her last role as Black Widow. Florence Pugh, on the other hand, stole the show. Rachel Weisz was also fantastic. Loved the dinner table scene! David Harbour's role was funny and enjoyable. The post-credits, which were originally supposed to occur before ""Falcon & Winter Soldier"", still worked very well and it doesn't confuse the audience. Scarlett is going to be missed, but Pugh has shown that she's more than capable of filling her shoes in MCU ventures.The actions sequences were amazing. In addition, the film's general plot is incredibly relatable. Anyone who believes that an action picture with a predominantly female cast and a female lead can't be exciting and spectacular should keep their mouth shut. Among ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Captain Marvel"", Black Widow establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt that a female lead in an action film can provide flawless performance.However, there are few points I'd like to make:
1. Taskmaster could have been used more effectively.2. Some scenes in the film felt rushed, but that's fine because fans of the MCU are familiar with Johansson's character and can overlook the rushed scenes.3. While this film was definitely worth the wait and the delays, I believe that the standalone Black Widow feature should be released much sooner and should have been part of the Infinity Saga timeline rather than being the Phase 4 opening.Still, it's clear so far in Phase 4 that Marvel isn't losing any steps. Great film and it looks Marvel is getting better and better!","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The trailer really got me and I thought that Marvel was attempting to make some kind of spy story. There is even a short quote to the classic 007 in the film, but it doesn't even come close to Fleming's work. I am always happy when a company decides to make a franchise flick about a secondary character, that may expand the narrative universe, but in this case nothing is really added to the MCU and this was a perfectly avoidable movie for several reasons:The narration is below expectations. Natasha's story is not really deepened, if not for a short intro that is clearly not enough to develop this character. There are way too many shootouts, fights and chases to the point where it becomes very chaotic and out of line. The few dialogues are, in most cases, ridiculous. Tons of situations that do not make any sense: Natasha and Yelena are human beings that received special training, not superheroes. Nevertheless they are completely immune to explosions or car accidents. They always get out with very few scratches, and they always win with no much effort. There is no tension, no real struggling moments for Romanoff's family. The plot twist during the last section of the movie is pretty much disappointing. As always there are also tons of forced comedy moments that nobody asked for.Considering the 200 millions dollars budget, the CGI is not good enough: fire and explosions animations are awful, the quality level of special effects in some sequences is comparable to the one of Matrix Reloaded, which was released in 2003. Seems like that there was no technology advancement in these last 20 years. Most of the scenes are over the top and completely unrealistic. I wonder who studied the physics and the dynamics for this movie, because the job done in this department is clearly very sloppy.""Black Widow"" could have been a different movie, a spy story with intrigues and more practical stunt sequences, like ""John Wick"". Marvel here just went lazy and they lost a big opportunity, but they clearly do not care, as this was in fact a commercial success. Results may not be astonishing like ""Endgame"", but they still managed to cover production costs, so why even care about fans?","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Was it worth it.... Just about, but it definitely feels like a lesser entry into the MCU.On the run having participate in breaking the Sokovia accords with Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is in hiding. This is broken when a package reaches her from a former safe house, that makes her a target for Taskmaster, a villain capable of copying and besting the fighting style of any opponent. Her investigation into the package brings her back into contact with Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) another trained assassin who once operated as her sister on a lengthy undercover operation. Together the pair investigate whether the fabled Red Room operation is still taking place, or whether it died with Dreykov (Ray Winstone) on a mission in Budapest several years earlier.I suppose, for me, the problem with ""Black Widow"" is not so much that the film itself does anything wrong, it's more than it feels a touch below the obscenely high standards that Marvel have set for themselves in the last few years. Performances are good, visual effects are great. I've always really liked Florence Pugh and I hope that the MCU will run with her for a while, as the post credits scene suggests they will.I didn't care as much for some of the action scenes as I have in other Marvel films. . . There appeared to be a regression back to that shaky cam/Bourne style fights where there is lots of movement and not a great deal of logic. But mostly my problem was that the story was just standard. I'd have liked it to be a more of a spy thriller and not just another, I'll get captured by the villain and sort my problems from there plot.Again, it's not a bad film, not by any stretch, but relatively to the best films in the MCU, ""Winter's Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Ragnarok"" it's definitely less than.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Natasha was always my favorite in avengers. I was sad after Endgame as many of us surely. Its very basic marvel action movie good as any Captain America. If you haven't seen avengers/captain america or its been long time. Then I recommend to watch them before see this or after.Scarlett don't even look any older. Action and story is good enough to entertain any marvel or action movie fans. Avengers: Endgame I give 9.0/10, but sadly this one I give 7/10. 7 is very basic points for marvel movie. Not bad, but masterpiece. I can recommend this to see in cinema. I am happy that Marvel studios return well in Covid-19 time to cinema.

Is it however a perfectly good and enjoyable film that can't quite match the hype of titles that preceded it...yes. Part spy thriller part bonkers action film it does a good job of merging the too. Performances are great throughout with perhaps certain supporting cast members outshining the titular character at times. It gives you a back story,some action and if u watch the post credits a hint at what's to come. Watching the film already knowing how it ends for black widow does take something away from the film but isn't detrimental enough to stop it being fully enjoyable. The fight sequences are very good and adequate airtime given to other characters,the only real exception being taskmaster who I felt could have been utilised better. Overall a very entertaining film and a nice farewell to character we have spent the last decade with. Don't believe the haters but equally don't expect an endgame level experience. A solid contribution to an amazing universe.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I say this as a man myself; They'll praise male heroes for having very simple plot lines, but the same ones say this movie had a 'boring' plot. Black Widow had themes of human trafficking & the dehumanization of young women, and apparently that's boring for them because it's advocating for real global issues and not a story about something cheesy..Anyways, action sequels were top notch that was not a surprise considering the well-known stunt coordinators they hired. Casting was close to perfect, Scarlett's had 10 years to truly embody Natasha & this film was a perfect send off, it actually made me like Natasha more, she was never one of my favourites always just in the back for me but after the movie I was proven wrong. Helena as everyone else says was FANTASTIC, I am very excited to see her future in the MCU what a great addition! The opening credit was different from any Marvel movie we've seen, soundtrack was spot on.Only reason I give it a 9 is because Taskmaster was a wasted potential, he was such a well-written Villian in the comics they could've done much more with him.When reading bad reviews, remember that most of people's opinions are formulated on other's opinions - it's a hate chain, it's not real. Watch the movie for yourself first and then decide, but I personally do think the hate is biased. Iron Man 2 was not a good movie, weak Villian & story but didn't get nearly as much hate as this because it Tony Stark/Iron Man, but this film doesn't come CLOSE to that movie. Well-directed, perfect cast, great plot, good pace, overall such an enjoyable film and the feel of it was so different from other MCU movies. Loved it.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

You'd think with people couped up indoors and limited diversions that they'd focus on the few things they're allowed to do, such as making movies. Yet even with all that time and focus, they still come up with mediocre movies like this.There are a few possible reasons as to why. One reason is Hollywood simply got lazy and took it's audience for granted, assuming because of the lockdowns, the audience would have little choice but to watch more movies. Another could be the depressingly lengthy lockdowns caused many filmmakers to be less inspired to create anything new and exciting. And finally, perhaps the current politically correct environment forced producers to hire filmmakers not based on merit but on superficial attributes in a superficial attempt to conform. But most likely it's some combination of the above.Anyway, about the film. Right off the bat, the movie had a tough task to make an uninteresting character interesting. But Marvel is no stranger to this. Two of the best films in their franchise were about previously little known superheroes, Iron Man and Thor. If they could work their magic on this film, perhaps they could capture our interest in the Black Widow, as they did about a guy and his special suit or a guy and his magical hammer.Unfortunately, Marvel's magic ended with Captain America. Black Widow stumbled out of the gate with an incredibly silly action sequence in which Natasha and her family escape trouble by taking off in their plane with her father hanging on one of the wings. Then it was all downhill from there. Poor character development, lack of chemistry and a familiar plot pretty much did this film in. Let's put it this way. If Black Widow had been released first instead of Iron Man, no way the other Marvel films would've been made.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Except I'm not the one that's on the cover of a magazine. I'm not the killer little girls call their hero.""Finally, it has come. The MCU's newest addition Black Widow has Natasha Romanoff confronting the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger. This isn't necessarily an origin story or prequel. It's an interquel right after the events of Civil War and before Infinity War. Why Marvel decided for this to be the movie for phase 4? The world will never know. It's a mistake that I will hold for the rest of their days. This isn't by any means a bad movie, I'm just disappointed that it took so long to get a Black Widow movie, and now that everything has built up to it, we got this final product. Black Widow is good, but not great. And part of the issue was waiting too long. The writers on this one weren't all experienced Marvel writers except for one who did Thor: Ragnarok and helped with continuity with a few more. This branched away from the classic fantasy element we're used to, but managed to fall back into place of predictability. Most of the story is how you'd expect it to play out, especially in the ladder half. All of the family aspect is strong. There's a sense of character and place when all of them are together. As usual, the acting is great. For it being a Black Widow movie, though, Florence Pugh steals the whole thing. She's one, if not, my favorite recent actress to make a mark, so some might think I'm bias. But Yelena is such a great character and she makes the most out of it. Almost all of the character development went to her since we've already got a good portrait from Natasha at this point. David Harbour is also eccentric and funny as Alexei. Those two have some of the funniest scenes.Marvel has gotten better with comedic timing and jokes, mainly after Guardians. All of them land here. Even though the story may not be the most compelling of the universe, there's that classic charm to it that makes it a solid action flick. The action scenes don't disappoint and are full of fight scenes out of a spy movie. The VFX may not be the best, and that might be because they have bigger projects coming up, but it does the job. Many aspects of this are good, but just not quite up to par, and I don't mean to complain or anything. Had some changes been made, this could've been great. I guess my main problem comes from some of the writing, throw-awayable villains, and third act. The third act, once again, took an easy route. Once we get to where we need, everything was simplified into something we've seen before. When it comes to the villains, the main one is an evil man which obviously doesn't do a whole lot. Taskmaster could've been a good one with a little more development, but there wasn't enough time with them. The conclusion is just another fun action movie and nothing more. (Side note: I hated the title sequence for this and I don't think I'm the only one). Marvel has been on a roll with the past few additions, and maybe my expectations were too high. The family aspect and delving into family history works well in its favor. Maybe with more thought in the story, this wouldn't be underwhelming. Let me reiterate, I did enjoy Black Widow. It's easier to pick out problems with where my expectations were at. Right now it sits in the middle of my MCU additions ranked. If you liked it, good for you. If you didn't, I can completely understand. More than two watched might be needed for this one, but I'll enjoy it for now.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Black Widow presents a terrible outcome for the character of Scarlett Johansson and totally bad and forgettable villains. The Trainer was MASSACRED to the extreme by the script and reduced to an ""Exterminator"" project. The script is very punctured and very weak. Crisp cuts and a very shallow and very forgettable soundtrack, like most Marvel movies. The second arc is totally sluggish and slow, getting tedious to watch. The third act is totally messed up and the Plot involving the Trainer's revelation gets to be pathetic and horrible, which makes him one of the worst villains in the cinematographic universe of Marvel. The final CGI is pretty bad. But, the film has mostly good visual decisions, an in-depth look at Natasha and Yelena and great action scenes, as well as being well-placed in the context between Civil War and Infinite War. Unfortunately, other characters like the Red Guardian are very poorly explored and show a horrible development, in addition to excessive cuts in some action scenes and continuity of the same. The feeling when you finish watching, is that you just watched another clichéd Marvel movie and a worse version of ""The Winter Soldier"".Film viewed on July 24, 2021.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

I really wanted to form an emotional connection with Natasha and it was hard to- but maybe it's meant to be hard because that's how she was raised and trained?! Maybe it's my internalised misogyny that is making me feel disappointed in another of MCU's female led movies or they're just not doing the female characters justice. I didn't feel this way about WandaVision though- that was outstanding. Florence Pugh was phenomenal- so excited that she's going to be in the MCU universe. I'm still convincing myself that Black Widow isn't dead though. Here's hoping. Overall, it was enjoyable but I think after the successful WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki, this had big boots to fill and it just didn't quite do it for me.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

All the elements are there for greatness, and really, Black Widow is just a few scenes short of awesomeness. But no, it is the overall lackluster concerning the film. No one seems to be invested on-screen or behind the camera. It feels as if everyone just showed up to collect a paycheck.However Black Widow is not without merit - the action scenes are just great. A nice blend of live action and cgi, which is rare these days. And Ms Johansson, burdened with the bulk of the acting in the film, holds her own like the action star that she is. Actors David Harbour and Rachel Weisz do their very best to keep us engaged with their limited time on screen, I would have loved to have seen more of them.As much as we all love Scarlett Johansson, her presence cannot save this film from being just an also-ran. It gets a participation ribbon. It's checked off the list, so to speak. Which is kind of bittersweet really, Black Widow finally gets her own movie but it seems the venture is just a going-through-the-motions type of movie. But hey, they did get my money, and if Scarlett does another Marvel movie ever, I will spend money on that one too.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Black Widow has everything a classic Marvel fan would enjoy, yet is easily understood by viewers with no prior knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Behind all the superhero cowls is fantastic character development. Each character experiences a different emotional journey, finding themself in an extremely different emotional place compared to the beginning of the film.Black Widow serves as a prequel to Avengers: Infinity War, shining light on plot lines we had no clue occurred. The film picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War where Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run from the U. S. government. When Natasha is attacked by the iconic villain Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), she is led to confront her past. When she learns the Red Room is still functioning (kidnapping and training widows), she must team up with unlikely allies to defeat the organization once and for all.For comic book junkies there is always a worry that superhero movies will sometimes be a bore, because you already know the story so well. Black Widow abolishes this worry with multiple twists and turns that are new to comic book fans, yet are very respectful to classic superhero origins. When people think of the character Black Widow, they extremely undermine the grittiness of her backstory. Director Cate Shortland is marvelous at mixing in Natasha's dark past to boost her character development and show what drives her day today.Black Widow is one of the darkest Marvel movies to date. Throughout the film, rough and sensitive topics present themselves such as child trafficking, drug use and suicide. The film also includes multiple curse words and many different instances of intense action. Despite the gloomy tone, the film explores themes of family and reminiscence. Morals are taught to younger viewers demonstrating the message that people can change; you just need to give them a chance.I give Black Widow 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. You can stream Black Widow on Disney+ with premiere access or watch it in your local theater on July 9, 2021. Make sure to check it out!Reviewed by Jude A., KIDS FIRST!","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

But as my movie theater had a great sound at least I had a great technical cinematic experience. And Scarlet, Florence and Rachel are gorgeous and try their best, so that made the movie tolerable. Still, if someone hasn't seen Captain America: Civil War, or doesn't know what the future of the MCU looks like with the TV series, the references to the Avengers and the post credits scene won't make sense, so the movie doesn't stand on its own.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I usually see every one of the movies in there debut. This was first ever exception. There was just so many mixed reviews. I honestly just avoided seeing it for little. Upon conclusion however I personally felt it was good movie although there were things I diddn't like.First I felt the film almost lacked superhero feel. The movie played as more of Mission Impossible. With the plane jumping, explosions, car chases, etc. Also contributing to that was the super villian Taskmaster was severly under-utilized and lackluster. Secondly I diddn't really enjoy the entire family dynamic at all and felt at times it was cheesy and if anything detracted more from Black Widows story then it helped the movie along.With that said though I did think the visuals and sound effects in this movie were out of this world. I thought Scarlett Johansson continued her role of Black Widow very well. Also I found the movies pacing to be good especially for 2 hours I felt it breezed by and did enough to keep audience entertained without ever feeling draggy at all.Would I rewatch the movie ever again? Most likely not to be honest. Would I recommend it to others? I would say absolutely its worth a watch, but mainly to Marvel fans. The movie can be little confusing to those who haven't seen the prior films.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Most of all I love that it wasn't trying too hard to be something bigger than other MCU movies - this was seamless and perfect. Also the end credits got me really excited. Thank you Marvel! My note is 10/10To all the negative reviews and trolls - stop watching movies on your phones.P. S. If you want to know what Black Widow's sister will do, she will soon appear in the Disney + Hawkeye series. And to stop all those with negative comments if you still can't think for yourself or give stupid reasons to hate a good movie, check out The Canadian Lad for more details on other marvel movies and series maybe if you explain them you'll understand better.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

The CGI and VFX in general looked very cheap, it looked like a series in some scenes. The costumes in some scenes looked really bad, usually marvel has the best looking Super Hero costumes on screen.The script was terrible, or possible the execution of the script was terrible. The actors were all great, they did their part.

It feels like Captain Marvel. It is a Marvel movie that, neutered with a lack of a connection to the other characters we have grown to love and the future of The MCU. The acting is great; the team assembled in order to expand on The Black Widow methos should be infused in future movies. It is emotional, funny, and political. Human-trafficking is the major theme of this movie, and that lends it's self to the more serious scope of a 'Falcon and Winter Soldier,"" and how they chose to address racism in The USA. It feels drawn out and should have been more condensed. It would feel more action packed if that were the case.

The franchise is by no means perfect, but when you look back on every film collectively, culminating with Avengers: Endgame, you can't really do anything but praise the effort and the outcome. Ever since they announced they were making a Black Widow movie, I was honestly scratching my head as to why they would go backwards, seeing as the character had died during the events of the massive climax. Well, after a year of delays, it has now been released, but I'm still wondering that same question. Even though this film is good overall, it just feels like it should've been released about three or four years ago.Taking place in between the events of Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, Natasha Romanoff finds herself on the run from the government and is being pursued by something directly related to her past. This in turn provides the backstory for the character, which was nice but also felt like just an elaboration of things we learned about her slowly throughout the franchise. Again, I was entertained by Black Widow from start to finish, but it just kind of felt unnecessary. Where this film surprisingly shines is in the supporting cast.Scarlett Johansson has always been likeable as this character, but I honestly feel that the family dynamic between her sister and parents was the best stuff in the film. Her sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) and father Alexei (David Harbour) stole the movie every time either of them was on-screen. David Harbour is clearly just having a blast with this character and it's very fun to watch. On the other side, Florence Pugh was easily the best part of the movie for me. Her performance, along with her bond with her sister just elevated the film for me. If Black Widow was simply about Natasha confronting her past, alone, this movie would have been incredibly boring. Sadly though, it does become slightly boring at times.There were a few instances where things kind of feel like they're happening because nothing exciting is going on. It really just feels like Marvel wanted to give Scarlett Johanssen her own movie before saying goodbye to the character, but also leaving the door open for someone else to take up the Black Widow title. It's also kind of difficult to dive into the villain subplot without giving anything away, but when it's revealed who is under the Task Master outfit, I both enjoyed and hated it. It has a nice payoff but the character until that point always felt underused. Marvel has had a pretty solid track record lately with their villains, but even though a threat is present here, there never really seems to be any big stakes.Overall, I enjoyed watching Black Widow because I like the character, I like Scarlett Johansson, and I loved the family aspect, mainly a couple of notable scenes in the second half of the film. Even after this film explored her past, I still feel like we didn't quite get enough from this character before saying goodbye. On top of that, since everything else in the series seems to be building on or moving past the events of Avengers: Endgame, this movie deserved to be released during the time period it takes place in. A film like Captain Marvel jumped back far enough that it wasn't really an issue and it was a brand new character as well. This film felt like it was trying to accomplish the same thing but ultimately felt like I was sitting in the theatre around 2017. In the end, I still give this film a positive grade and recommend checking it out if you have followed the franchise until this point, but other than introducing one or two new characters that we definitely haven't seen the last of, Black Widow feels a little too distant from the currently Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it stands now.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

An added plus is that they are both gorgeous.The story is well-written. Natasha has a chance to settle scores and quiet demons from her past, as well as reunite with those she thought she'd lost. Underneath it all is a sobering fictional example of the all-too-real international problem of human trafficking.If you love Marvel movies, you'll have a blast watching this one (unless, of course, you are a misogynist like some reviewers I've read on this site.)","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

Turns out, hardcore Marvel fans are super disappointed with it but I haven't read any of the original storylines, so I don't care. And if you're like me, you'll also enjoy this movie as long as you give it the cinematic liberty that every Marvel movie needs. The action was epic in the first half of the movie, think Jason Bourne. The OST was good.That said, the plot...you can tell that this was written because people wanted it, because Marvel/Disney could make more money off of it. I so wish it had released after Civil War, the impact of the events of Infinity War/End Game would have been very different. I don't think the plot does justice to any of the other characters, so that was a let down, the good ones and the bad.Natasha Romanoff isn't spoken about enough, an earlier release might have done some justice, especially to Scarlett. She's usually in the conversation for her looks first and then everything else, when she's actually a badass and deserves more props. Better late than never, I guess.Florence Pugh did a really good job as well. Her work in ""Fighting with my family"" was really good too, check it out if you haven't. Speaking of ""Family"", they mention the word SO MANY TIMES in Black Widow as well, couldn't take it xDOverall, totally worth a watch. Don't care much about the original storyline. Maybe it could have been better but didn't mind it. One time watch, though.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, in the case of Black Widow, the amazing production seems to forgot a key aspect of the film (two, to be exact): plots and characters. Don't get me wrong, it is emotionally impactful to see Natasha confronts her past and put a resolve into it. However, the film didn't seem to dive deep with their plots and characters and just basically touch the surface. The result is an entertaining blockbuster that constantly makes the audience feel that something is missing.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Pugh totally steals Johansson's spotlight. Don't get me wrong: though I'm not a fan of Johansson herself, I always felt weirdly sympathetic to her character, though in this movie the Widow feels more shallow and uninteresting than ever before. Liked the more griddy style of the movie that is set up right at the opening credits and keeps pretty steady throughout the runtime. Also cool to see women carry the plot and the villain's goons being only women for a change. Music and CGI could have been better. Also would have wished for the Taskmaster to be on screen more.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Filler but not necessarily bad...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7312077/?ref_=tt_urv","dylanmortiz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur72707340/?ref_=tt_urv","5 September 2021","This film is getting review bombed. I find people's criticisms to be very exaggerated if not incredibly subjective.This movie is a filler film. The way the MCU is written, they really had no choice. I do not think the movie is bad. I think Scarlett Johansson has played balck widow very well for the past 12 years. I found the dynamic between her, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz to be entertaining and believable. I particularly enjoyed Florence Pugh in this film.Is the premise a little silly? Yes, but what MCU film isn't. Suspension of disbelief is required for all of these films. And I find people love to pick and choose which MCU films they would like to apply that concept to. They typically apply it unjustly.Without trying to spoil anything, I think a majority of people's criticisms around the film fall into a few categories. The first may be the villain plot twist. If you do not follow comics religiously, I don't think the twost will bother you that much. The second may be the $30 asking price for the movie on Disney Plus. $30 is a lot for one film temporarily. But some people may be shocked to learn that they can actually watch this in a movie theatre for cheaper if they do not want to watch the movie at home. Or even better, they could split that $30 cost with friends. The third reason may be the fact that Scarlett Johansson feels like a side-kick in her own movie. I feel this may be partially true. In all honesty, this movie should have come years ago.In any case, I think that if you turn your brain off and let yourself have a little fun, you will probably enjoy this film. There has been some bad films this year, but I really don't think this films deseves to be on that list. The production quality is top notch and the cast is more than capable of holding their own. In addition to this, the fight choreography is above average in my honest opinion. There is no reason this movie should be rated similarly to the likes of MCU films like The Incredible Hulk or Thor the Dark World. I feel it has a lot more heart than those two films combined.I don't know. Listen to me, don't listen to me. Whatever. Just trying to take as an objective approach to this film that may be currently viewed unfairly.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is a short (57s) filmmaker introduction to the film (under Extras) where Director Cate Shortland describes her overall vision of the film that she set out to direct. She mentions that she wants viewers to see another side of Natasha that we haven't seen before, and Natasha's role within her fantastic family. I found this film to have a lot more dramatic depth of characters and their relationships with each other than maybe any other MCU film so far. So anyone claiming that this is a formulaic Disney film is wrong about that. The family component, and what a family really means, is the key takeaway form this film. The Marvel universe is just the backdrop. On top of that, the story, action and humor are up to par with the best MCU films. Kudos to the director for pulling it off.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

This film feels like a lazy cocaine filled F9 (Fast and Furious film). It's horrendous. Story and characters are convoluted and nonsensical. The dialogue hurts my ears. The comedy is absent (it's there but there is no time where I laughed or even half chuckled), the cinematography is choppy, and the cgi is laughably bad.To showcase I will describe a scene from the film which is a great example of the absurdity in this film and why I'm comparing this to fast and furious:
The two protagonists get in a car and are in this very high speed chase. Their car then gets in a crash where it flips over multiple times, hits many objects, then lands upside down and skids down a flight of stairs. The protagonists just get out of the car seconds later with nothing but a scratch on the head. This accompanied by horrendous cgi made me laugh out loud in the theater. It was absolutely absurd and very unrealistic. Of course we can't forget that they had to have been driving at least 50mph. There are many more instances of this throughout film taking me out causing me to make jokes about it instead of pulling me in and causing me to be invested. The MCU is unrealistic, I mean it's superheroes but these protagonists are human with no super abilities. Every other MCU film I've seen had limits but this film not only took of the seatbelt but rode on top of the hood while drinking caffeine. It's insane.This whole movie screams lazy and cheap, yet this is a massive multi million dollar blockbuster from Marvel and Disney. Pathetic.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Preferably right after Civil War and definitely before Infinity War. The fact that we only got it now is... a whole bag of issues.Putting that aside, I liked the film a lot. Johansson is still amazing as Natasha, although I do have to admit that some of the side characters ended up stealing this film from her. Florence Pugh as Yelena, another Black Widow, was a riot and a hoot. I'm definitely hoping that we will see more of her in the MCU. David Harbour as Red Guardian, Captain America's Russian counterpart, was also a great character and I'd like to know more about his past and his fixation on Steve.Aside from that, the movie contained the usual amount of Marvel goodness. Great action scenes, top of the line visual effects, clever quips, one mindblowing end battle. You know, the usual. What we've come to expect from Marvel, in the best possible way.Is it the best Marvel film ever made? No. Should it have been made before Endgame? Yes. Was it still worth the wait? Very much so.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Florence Pugh is awesome in both comedy and emotion, Rachel Wiesz can convey every emotion with a sinle glance, Scarlett Johansson is fragile and forceful, and even the guy playing their dad was funny. There is a big part of this movie that is actually a movie (not just fights and stuff blowing up), and that part was excellent. Good dialogue, connection to characters.Then there was the big final battle, and that just went overboard. Felt like there were levels, and every win made a restart in a lose position on another level. The CGI was not all that fabulous either. I was really sick of the fight sequence when it was coming to the end - too long, too unrealistic, neverending. Thank god they stuck a piece of actual movie at the end of it! Still the Red Room storyline has a little too much of a dystopian feel for my taste. Kinda depressing.Florence Pugh's character really should be developed in further films - she is excellent and her dialogue delivery in the Russian accent is to die for!Is there any way she and Jensen Ackles can be cast together in a flick with a good script? They would be so fantastic as they are the same kind of comedy/drama geniuses.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

A shame considering the groundwork leading up to it.Final Say -The first Marvel film in many a moon is more of the same solid stuff from a company that has perfected its offering into a finely tuned machine, Black Widow isn't necessary or groundbreaking but its a winner for comic book fans and those seeking quality made blockbuster entertainment.3 1/2 mind controlled pigs out of 5.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

I like marvel films don't get me wrong, but I just watch the ones I like the look of and want to be simply entertained by it. And to be honest it was a decent watch. It has flaws don't get me wrong, but I feel the rating is a little low here.So my issue is the title. We needed more Ray Winstone. He did his role brilliantly, as per. But he's barely in it. He's there for the final stage of the film and that's it. Considering he's the main villain, he just wasn't there enough. It seemed like the director wasn't too sure who should be the villain. Him or the daughter. So it was just combined, but not done overly well.I have to say as well, considering it's called Black Widow. The star of the show is Florence Pugh. She did her role so well and really carried this film. She was the one I was really rooting for throughout, really good character to get behind.Other than that though, the plot is okay. It's not going to blow your socks off, but it's still an entertaining watch. And the characters are fun and have good arcs to get involved in. So yeah, overall I enjoyed this watch.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Such a diverse actress. This movie had serious moments as well as very humorous moments that hits home with a growing number of families. Not sure a better family story with deeper meaning has been written with any Marvel movies. I consider this one to be the least action filled but one of my favorites.

Now I did have my expectations pretty low but it surprised me. The story isn't all that great or anything, there's some good little turns to make it more unique but overall pretty straight forward. There are some pacing issues but nothing that drags you out of the movie. The action, I mean it's high budget it was bound to be good, although some effects looked a bit , the action scenes are very well organised and choreographed. The movie does look nice overall, some odd placed camera angles, but visually impressive. Some of the comedy was put in wrong, it still got some laughs from the back row. The characters are meh, there is no real development for the character 'Black Widow', the development is based around the families relationship. Now this works pretty well actually, their chemistry is enjoyable to watch. I will say there are definitely some parts that rely on you to have seen the other movies, just a warning. And the end credits scene sets it up for future marvel things as always, but I don't know if I like where it is headings. Overall I did actually enjoy this movie despite being so critical.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

First Marvel movie I was impatient for it to end. I just don't get how Disney is making around 60M with Disney+ and 150M in theater with that disappointment of a movie.I would recommend only for educational purpose just to know what happened but it wont affect in any way your understanding of Marvel Storyline since the movie is after Civil war events and black widow died in End game so if you don't want to watch it it's really fine I deeply regret those 2h of my life ..... I mean since End game I don't get what Marvel is trying to do with WandaVision, Captain America and the winter soldier or Loki I really don't get it except making money cause the effort put on those stories are really poor it's nothing like everything before End game(except captain marvel that was hard to watch) I really hope they'll stop thinking about money they already have and focus on what kind of story they're giving out there.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Scarlett Johansson first marvel actress to produce and direct her own film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7546131/?ref_=tt_urv","moviesfilmsreviewsinc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59184301/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2021","There's an added poignancy to the year-plus delay of Marvel's ""Black Widow,"" finally ending July 9th when the film will be in theaters and available for a premium charge on Disney+. And there's a palpable sense that this story would have felt a little delayed even in May 2020. After all, why did Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man get three standalone films before Natasha Romanoff got one? Fans complained long before the pandemic that it felt like Black Widow was getting pushed aside, only given her own adventure after the end of her story in ""Avengers: Endgame."" Director Cate Shortland's movie confirms that Black Widow could have carried her own flick ages ago. They seemed like a normal family, but 'mom' and 'dad' were really Russian spies, and the girls were only being prepped for their coming induction in a super soldier program back in the homeland. After an explosive opening, the credits for ""Black Widow"" reveal that Natasha and Yelena were turned from average girls to killing machines, separated when Romanoff murdered the head of the program, Dreykov (Ray Winstone), and destroyed his Red Room. Or did she??. Jump ahead to just after ""Captain America: Civil War,"" when Natasha is on the run from her own government, underground after violating the Sokovia Accords. While she's off the grid, she receives a package from Yelena, who is suffering through her own forced exile after discovering a substance that releases the Widows from their chemical subjugation. As with a lot of the MCU, the third act here gets a little cluttered and repetitive but then the film recovers with a remarkable final action sequence that sends characters and debris hurtling through the sky (an MCU staple but Shortland's choreography makes it feel urgent again). It's ultimately a film that works on its own terms, a long-delayed enriching of the story of a beloved character that will make her ultimate sacrifice in ""Avengers: Endgame"" feel even more powerful in hindsight. Every blockbuster this Summer is being touted as the sign that the world is back to normal-""Black Widow"" is more a reminder of what fans loved before it shifted off its axis.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

It showed a brief backstory for Nat and I was fine with it. Then the movie starts and well I don't wanna go into more details in order to keep this review spoiler free :)The acting was fine, the writing could have been done better, dialogues sometimes felt off and I can't lie that I'm disappointed in what taskmaster turned out to be. Still I liked the main villain.As I said, it was an enjoyable movie and I liked some scenes (especially the family gathering ones). The action scenes were good but in my opinion there was too many of them and some of them were pointless and kinda predictable. The post credit scene was something I expected to see and I'm happy it was included in the movie.I feel like if this movie was released after civil war and not in phase 4, it would have been so much better so the ending wouldn't be that predictable but still, I say it is worth watching once. You shouldn't expect a very deep or emotional story. As a prequal movie, you will probably like it.

Usually, Marvel's action scenes have little weight, seeing as almost nobody dies (or visibly runs the risk), and so when even someone bland and disposable like Quicksilver gets axed, fangirls will start a petition to revive him (yes, this seriously happened).You can imagine, then, the tears that came when Avengers: Infinity War dropped and its villain proved to be a serious threat, only to have most of his victims return by the time we got Avengers: Endgame. Even their worst and most heartbreaking wasn't too bad.However, one death that still meant something was that of Natasha ""Black Widow"" Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in the latter production. What must we do to help the fanboys cope, I wonder? Simple: include her in a midquel set after Civil War, featuring bit characters that are absent and unmentioned by the time Infinity War's plot comes along. The MCU canon has always seemed remarkably well-thought-out, but as proven by Captain Marvel, it gets tricky when they start adding major events ""in the middle"". Some of you already know what I think of Loki and TFATWS but let's focus on just the movies for now.The plot: after the events of Civil War, self-exiled Avenger and former S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Natasha Romanoff finds that her troubled past in the KGB (briefly alluded to in Age of Ultron) is catching up with her, as she reconnects with other ""Black Widows"" (Florence Pugh as her adoptive sister; Rachel Weisz as her adoptive mother) and The Red Guardian (David Harbour), Russia's equivalent to Captain America. There's also Natasha's former S. H. I. E. L. D. colleague, played by O-T Fagbenle - a name I am not 100% sure I'm actually allowed to say.I liked the prologue more than anything else. We see younger versions of both Natasha and Yelena (the Pugh character, whose younger self looks more like the Johansson character and vice versa) as their Black Widow lives truly, hauntingly begin. The subsequent credits montage is a visual feast (though the spooky lullaby cover of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" won't be universally adored) and nothing else in the film compares to it.Still, this long-overdue solo adventure is occasionally gripping and uses its classic spy-movie tropes charmingly - even if some concepts are too dumb for even Austin Powers. But considering how wild and ""out there"" the rest of MCU Phase Four is getting (with multiverses, Time Keepers, et al.), this comparatively vanilla comic-book movie may be too little too late for most geeks, barring the hardcore Black Widow fans. Some of it gets pretty dark, then punctuated (and deflated) by the typical MCU comedy, which gets way worse halfway through. The effects and shoddy greenscreens won't be a huge draw either. All of this is a shame, considering this is the first proper MCU film release since 2019.Disney, along with the usual journalists, have admittedly done their damndest to generate juicy PR. There was a fruitful attempt to get a rise out of angry nerds with articles claiming men will be ""put in their place"" by this movie and outright squeam (sic) at the sight of women kicking ass, which the other side was naturally meant to laud as the most empowering thing since Ghostbusters, Ocean's 8, and the all-female reboot of Die Zombiejäger that I just decided to make.But people are getting smarter, at least when it comes to films like Charlie's Angels, Wonder Woman 1984, and now this. Even Twitter feminists can see through the narrative that these movies were hated purely because they star/celebrate women. Bad movies are bad movies, no matter what the message is (or pretends to be) or who you can spite by supporting it. Yes, some dudebros still got mad at the article, but even then, many of them just seemed weary of the same old spiel and how transparent it's getting. While I'm sure Disney coaxed one or two angry videos out of The Quartering and Geeks+Gamers, fighting like toddlers over big-studio cinema just isn't what it used to be.The movie itself is, simply put, pretty lame. It isn't outlandish enough to compete with the rest of the Phase Four media and it doesn't even play like something out of Phase 3 where things started getting ambitious and/or weird - with retro oddities like Thor: Ragnarok and visual marvels like Black Panther, give or take the odd CG rhino. Instead, this would be at home amongst the lame, contrived sequels of Phase Two. You know, back when people were excited about the idea of a Black Widow movie?I've also been told the character of Taskmaster constitutes another Mandarin scenario (à la Iron Man 3, also from Phase Two) but I don't know enough about the original comics' character to judge. My mind is all Watchers and Time Keepers at the moment; you think I have time to worry about some Russian spies and a creepy incel in a sky castle? Dosvedanya, Romanoff.","18 out of 46 found this helpful.

Unfortunately the third act let the film down by going all out action with lacklustre visual effects and it took away from what was built up between the main characters in the early parts of the film. The interactions between Natasha & the villain were great to see and paid homage to the power of Black Widow we have seen in early MCU films!Yelena, Melania & Red Guardian are interesting additions to the MCU and I am looking forward to seeing them appear in future projects if they are able to show up again! I though Florence Pugh was fantastic in this and it was a great passing the torch movie from Natasha to Yelena.I was laughing out loud at small moments between Yelena & Natasha and enjoyed the family dynamics set up in the movie. If they had not separated all the characters for the final action scenes I reckon this movie would have had a better overall feel for me. The action throughout the movie was great with some of the best hand to hand combat we have seen so far (Shang-Chi is out later this year which will top this movie) in the MCU.I was disappointed by the cut at the end of the movie as it felt like a bit of a plot hole for me. On the other hand, the after credit scene was the perfect closure of the story and start of a new chapter for what has been one of the best characters (Black Widow) in the MCU so far.An enjoyable movie but not one I want to watch again and again like some marvel films. For me, this is because it falls victim to the large CGI action set piece which detracts from the rest of the story. If they were not falling through the sky at the end of this film it would have been a better movie which is not something you can say often.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Her chemistry with Johansson is electric and makes you buy into the sisters' journey and shared pain easily.David Harbour is incredible as the 'Red Guardian'', the weathered the former Russian counterpart to Captain America. Rachel Weisz and him are spot on as the parental figures, essaying the pain and suffering they have undergone with authenticity and realism. Ray Winstone is his icy, brutish best as the main antagonist.The key standout element of the film was the excellently choreographed hand-to-hand combat sequences, really raising the level of Marvel movies to Bourne-esque realms.Watch out for not one but two surprise guest appearances that not only tie into the upcoming MCU films but also continue the intricate world-building happening through the Disney+ series' Loki, TFATWS and Wanda Vision.Black Widow is a Natasha Romanoff show through and through, a fitting tribute to a founding Avenger and a role that has been portrayed with such perfection by Scarlett Johansson for over a decade now.Highly recommended! Marvel's first movie of 2021 is a surefire blockbuster!","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Giving some backstory to the character and a setting that takes place after Captain America Civil War. Before the character faces her fate. Its a in between installment which adds a few new characters additions and some exciting action sequences. I did find the plot to be weak and a underdeveloped villain.What worked? It was great to see a little backstory of Black Widow. The opening scene with Natasha and her sister being little with the family. Only to be separated. The girls are trained to be super assassins through a Russian experimental training. The film feels more like an esponiage action movie than a superhero. With skilled assassins that are controlled. Natasha and her sister goal through the movie is to go after the leader of the program to kill him. Which is also the weakest part of the movie is the plot.The action sequences are awesome. It has chases. Fighting. And aerial combat as characters are free falling and fighting at the same time. And a snow setting prison compound that has an avalanche crashing down.The cast ensemble is also good. Scarlett Johanson is great. Florence Pugh stole the spotlight playing her sister. A character who always wanted to have a normal life and a family but all is stripped away during there childhood. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz were great playing there parents.What did not work?The pacing of the film. The first hour is fast moving with chases and action set pieces back to back. After the family gets together. Things slow down and loses its steam. Until the climax comes around. The film also plays itself seriously compared to other mcu films which had the fun tone.I also found the villain Taskmaster to be underdeveloped. It gives a challenge to Natasha and her sister. As it chases them down through a tank vehicle or when he is on foot. It mimicks there combat style. Very brief story goes behind Taskmaster. That character just feels like it is there to give reason behind all the action. Dreykov played by Ray Winstone who is another bad guy behind the red room experiment is kind of tedious as the villain.Overall, Black Widow is a fair entry in the mcu.

But let me tell you, in all honesty I was so disappointed with this movie, and this is coming from someone who was anxiously waiting for a Black Widow movie. The action scenes were way too forced and tremendously exaggerated, and on top of that the CGI is just meh. The plot is so predictable and sloppy, very flat storytelling.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Scarlett Johansson is the best (this being her last Marvel movie) and the movie is pretty flawless and fresh. It details Natasha's origin and presents us with a spectacular story of her facing her past in a reunion with her sister and her guardians. Its only flaw is that it was made after Endgame since it should have been done years before, but it's an acceptable movie. My final rating for this film is 9/10.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Natasha's sister and ""father"" are the highlights of the film and that's really it. They wasted a great character in Task Master, the villain, played by a fantastic actor was also a wasted opportunity.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Fresh from my MCU marathon ending with Endgame, I was skeptical of shows like WandaVision or Falcon & Winter Soldier, which had premises that didn't sound interesting to me but I ended up really liking. Black Widow was a movie I also had little interest in, but from my recent experiences I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and hope it would get some of that MCU magic.Alas, there is very little about that movie I liked. First and foremost, the fake Russian accents coming and going for no reason really irked me. It really didn't help what I thought were subpar acting performances from actors I know can deliver a ton more than they do here (Johansson, Harbour, Weisz, etc.). The directing was all over the place, action scenes were a hot mess, and some of the special effects were a disgrace for something with the MCU stamp on it. The story and writing have so many plot holes and things that don't make sense I'm not going to even try and count them.Very disappointing overall, and by far the weakest MCU movie to date. Just skip that one.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

What we got is a middling Marvel effort with a rehashed spy thriller story and its affiliated action set-pieces and plot clichés. Granted, that very spy flavour that bleeds into each act more and more evidently endows us with a couple of slick action sequences that are pulled off with aplomb. It's just unfortunate all of them are devoid of the slightest tension. While on the subject, there's no real sense of danger I feel each time either Natasha or Yelena are supposedly at risk, and The Taskmaster completely fails to prove an imposing threat, that's not to mention it's a villain that's clearly merely skimmed over, with the result of falling victim to the plot's mishmash of clichés. The humour isn't the worst, largely due to Pugh and Harbour whose chemistry elevates each scene they share a great deal. The third act feels the most superhero-y, with a fair share of explosions and CGI-heavy scenes that almost feel incongruous with the relatively small-scope MCU installment Black Widow aims to be. However, It's also here when we get some emotionally-charged moments where Pugh - yup, once again - and Scarlett get there moments to shine, serving a fitting send-off for our titular superhero. Moreover, all of these shortcomings can be tolerated given the joy one gets out of this movie. I was surprised how much time flew by minutes before reaching its post-credit scene that got me really pumped up to see what's coming next.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It clearly had potential but misses the mark.When I saw the 7 of 10 rating, I was surprised but considering 'grading on a curve ' I took a peek at the Hulk 2008 movie and saw that it was currently at 6.7 of 10. There is no way in H*** this movie is better by any metric. This would be a 5.5 if half scores were available - but not a 6.Of course it still has worthwhile moments. It's not a complete dud and no doubt its watchable if not entirely entertaining or immersive or a visual spectacle. And no. My rating is not a result of comparative expectations vs. Other Marvel movies. It's simply weak on its on merits of plot/story.It almost feels like it was made more out of an obligation to the character (and to make money) rather than because they had a good story to tell.This review is deliberately vague on details only because people should watch it in its entirety without focusing on particular singular points I could use as examples. No spoilers here.I'll watch it again in about a month and see if I have a change of heart.But I doubt it.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

With some problems of rhythm and some poorly filmed action sequences (combined with other good ones like the big end piece), the best thing of the film are the comedy sequences, the prologue and some of the acting (especially of Florence Pugh and an hilarious and over the top David Harbour). Still, much better than ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"".","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The cast works well together, and each one of the family brings something good to the table with challenges to overcome.

In a world of soul stones and biology-altering serums, it's easy enough to put reality aside.The action shows how Widow went toe to toe with enhanced all these years. The setup for the Red Room will give MCU fans plenty to play with for years to come.My only real complaint is two spots where the music doesn't fit. It reminds me of the score from the second Matrix film: The was nothing technically wrong, but it stood out enough in an early motorcycle chase and part of the sky fall that I was distracted wondering why nobody changed that instead of paying attention to the eye-catching action.It's great to see more of SJ just being Natasha. Now with all of the age-shifting tech they've developed, they need to go back and do a Hawkeye + Black Widow TV spy serial.Last word? I never expected Budapest to look so nice.

Hence, I was somewhat disappointed as 'Black Widow' really had the potential to be one of Marvel's best (ever) movies, and yet did not meet my expectations. Although I have to admit that my (and many others') expectations were probably too high, after waiting so long for a new Marvel film (nearly 2 years) and with all the hype that's been building up.

I wonder if Marvel Studios does however. I mean we all know ScarJo was not their first choice to play the character, and she was regulated to being the only woman in the original male ensemble.She was also really the weakest of the characters, with arguably her ability to calm the Hulk being one of her stronger powers. This movie had a chance to tell her back story, but really only alluded to 3 years of it, 3 mainly unimportant years. We know more about the Winter Soldier's back story then Black Widow's.So this movie was about her former associates and Florence Pugh is by far the more interesting character with David Harbour being a distance 2nd. Rachel Weiz's character is really inconsistent, and then we have 3 or 4 really great action set pieces. Finally that leads to BW, who doesn't say a lot, doesn't do a lot except expose us to these other characters, and plays straight man for the villains and the cast.Sorry to break it to you Scarjo, but you're final starring vehicle/swansong vehicle was hijacked to set up a tv series and Pugh's future. They even added a pseudo Cap'n America character because they didn't think you alone could carry the flick. Hulk got his own movie, and half another when they changed actors. Hawkeye got his own series. You get your name at the top of a movie to play second banana. I do understand you got a bunch of cash, not as much as Downey Jr., but a nice some as a runner up trophy. Hope you spend it well.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This Johnny-come-lately Marvel saga starts off strongly and features a few well-choreographed, intense hand-to-hand fight scenes, some amusing familial squabbles, and an exciting climax, but even with all the anticipation and over-the-top action it doesn't quite dig deep enough into the central character's backstory to make it a very tense or compelling yarn, despite the efforts of Johansson who (expectedly) holds her own, or a good role for Pugh as Romanoff's sister figure. **½","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Marvel does James Bond! and an overdue sendoff for Black Widow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7159631/?ref_=tt_urv","gcsman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66541531/?ref_=tt_urv","24 July 2021","I managed to see this on an IMAX screen and I think generally it was worth it. Big scenery and big action need a big stage. I see that on the IMDb rating scale, female viewers give it a 7.5, almost a full point higher than the male viewers, and I don't have any problem siding with the women. On screen, they're the ones who get almost all the action (including the expected confrontation with a whole room full of Red Room trainees).It must have been frustrating for Scarlett Johansson, who's a good actor, to have seen her Black Widow character treated so inconsistently in the MCU. In the previous Avengers, Iron Man, and Captain America films first she's a SHIELD deep-cover operative in Stark Industries, then a former spy coupled with Hawkeye, then on the run with Steve Rogers, then a love interest with Bruce Banner, then the one keeping the lights on at Avengers headquarters post-Snap, and finally the one to make the ultimate sacrifice so that the Big Guys can save the universe. So this film is long overdue -- the Marvel Studios suits really don't have any excuse for stalling this long to make a female-centered superhero movie (the first one being Captain Marvel, but that was already TEN YEARS after The Guys had the field all to themselves). Black Widow should have had a setup pre-Avengers film just like Tony Stark, Cap, Thor, or Hulk. This film gives Natasha much of the backstory she deserves along with a good-if-not-great standalone adventure.So the basic model for this Black Widow solo is a James Bond style film. Fair enough -- her character isn't superpowered, she was trained as a spy,and there's lots of international intrigue, so it matches well enough. Just like any Bond film, it's a thin cover for scenery-hopping, lots of hand-to-hand combat, guns, cars, motorcycles, aircraft, and over-the-top stunts. There's all of that you might want and the production values are high. The added value is to see Natasha in the context of her adopted ""family"" of former Russian spies (sister, father, mother played by Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz). Their interactions are fun and I think the movie would have improved with a bit more of that and a bit less of the stuntwork. Beyond those central four players, unfortunately there are just stock villains and side characters. Ray Winstone's role as the slimy bad guy behind the Red Room operation never gets beyond one-dimensional. Florence Pugh does well -- and looking ahead, she'll be in the Hawkeye limited series later this year -- though physically she doesn't quite have the stature that Johansson does for this type of role.Scene-by-scene, Black Widow is very involving to watch, even if you don't know all the previous MCU history. But when you think about it later, it kind of disconnects into a bunch of set pieces that don't fit very smoothly. Why exactly did we jump to Morocco? Budapest? Then somewhere in Russia? Finally the famous Red Room turns out to be a fortress in the clouds, I guess because why not. It goes smash so much better that way at the end. Also we watch Natasha go through cycle after cycle of taking (and dishing out) ferocious punishment and keep on ticking. At the end she isn't even limping a bit. So it's action fulfilment for the devout fans, but I don't think scaling it down just a little bit would have done any harm.And about the post-credits scene: well done at the start, but then took a jarring sideways turn that left a bad taste in my mouth. It really broke the mood that the whole movie had worked to establish.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Black Widow's character doesn't have all that room to grow within her own movie, due to her having to be the same person/character with previous Marvel films that are set in a future timeline - Infinity War and Endgame. Florence Pugh is always a delight even if the Russian accent is noticeable but not too out of place - it's better than Ray Winstones attempt (can't quite brake the cockney)The last half an hour is a headache, breaks the films more grounded first hour and a half in favour of explosions, fight scene after fight scene, five different plot threads with each individual character, sky castles and set ups for future films/seriesBetter than expected but ends with the usual ""save the world"" plot that almost feels put of place.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Cate Shortland did a good job on clarifying events and ideas from the prior MCU films, while also doing a decent job on elaborating on a fan favorite character like Natasha Romanoff, but she definitely could've fleshed out the plot a lot more, making this film feel a little bit like a filler/setup, to the saga. With the events Shortland was telling, I feel as if this film was released a few years ago, it would've been more hard-hitting, and relevant, more than feeling a little redundant with not a lot of consequences. Black Widow had a pretty solid pace, up until the second act, where it seemed to slow down, and really drag out that two hour and fifteen minute runtime.The protagonists are what really carried this film to be as good as it is, having wonderful performances across the board, from Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour. Everyone was balanced well, and had really good chemistry together, especially Johansson and Pugh. My biggest issue with the film, is how they handled the Black Widow character. Yes, we received some decent input on her character, but she didn't really do too much, reminding me a lot of Prince T'Challa, from Black Panther. Another issue I had, was that they didn't make a strong, present villain. Shortland decided to make the villain more of a ""talked about threat"" (if you will), falling into the trap a lot of the MCU films have, and that's not having a strong villain.The action in the film is a mixed bag. There were some scenes that worked for me, being very entertaining to watch, but there was a surplus of action that was butchered up in the editing room, and gave it a silly, video game feel.Overall, I would definitely see this film at least once, because of the importance it has to the saga, but this falls in line with the middle of the pack films for the MCU Saga.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

We got more of a look with Age of Ultron but Black Widow represents that payoff. The story of Natasha and Yelena's reunion and her teaming up with her adopted family to challenge the Widows is fine and deftly delivered. The implications of the other Widows being enslaved with mind control raises a few interesting questions as well. So while the overall arc of Black Widow doesn't reinvent the wheel but it's up to snuff for your typical MCU fare.Scarlett Johansson has been playing Black Widow for years, she's got the character down pat and she's consistent in her solo movie. She's slips into the steely and emotionless Natasha like a glove and she's a competent/believable action hero. Everyone knows David Harbour for his more dramatic work or his blockbuster adventures but he's got real comedic chops when he's given the opportunity. He's pretty funny as Alexei, his character was made to be the Soviet version of Captain America (Red Guardian) so I also believe he could have pulled back a little. It gets to the point he's such a buffoon that you question whether he was a competent soldier at any point in time. But that's not his performance, that's the script. Rachel Weisz was a nice inclusion to the cast, she gets a few nice moments as the girl's pseudo mother Melina. Her character is a little withdrawn in the same way Natasha is but also like Scarlett, there's some humanity and emotion underneath. Hopefully she gets more of this kind of projects, she's been mainly operating in the indie scene for years. I've been beating around the bush a little but for me, Florence Pugh far and away gave the best performance as Yelena. She's not brand new on the scene, she's an Oscar nominated actress but this was a different kind of project for her. She's capable in the action scenes, emotional for the dramatic moments but unlike Natasha, Yelena is very funny on top of that. It's easy to see why the studio tabbed Florence as a possible major player going forward. If her work here is any indication of what she can do, she could easily take over for Scarlett and possibly even elevate the character. The only performance I didn't even like came from Ray Winstone as Dreykov. Ray's a great character actor but he largely growls his way through this movie and there's little to no dimension to his character other than a general lust for power. This isn't just a Black Widow problem however, it's a recurring stumbling block in a fair amount of the MCU's filmography.Marvel has reset the bar again and again for blockbuster entertainment. It can't be easy to make something revolutionary every time action is called on set. Some adventures are going to be hits but just not quite on the bullseye. Black Widow is one of those projects. One of the aspects that it stumbles on is that it feels like a weird fit from a chronological perspective. Setting it between Civil War and Endgame makes it feel dated and late to the party. It also feels off that it would be now that Natasha chooses to go back to help disband the Widows and we never hear her speak about Yelena in any of the other movies or even spend a moment thinking about her old life. The puzzle pieces dealing with her character motivation don't quite fit. This may come across as a nitpick but this movie also features one of my least favourite tropes in any big budget movie. The whole ""let's stop the movie so I can tell you my evil plan for NO REASON instead of easily dispatching the hero"" cliche has been done to death and although there's a reason it's always included, it still feels lazy and unnecessary.Black Widow has got all the trappings and the eye candy you expect from the MCU. The CGI all passes the eye test, the Red Room looks cool and the visuals help sell some of the more outlandish stuff in the plot. The action fits the bill as well, there's some nice close quarters combat But the visual sensibility is more good than truly exceptional. You're getting the expected value with the $10-15 ticket you shelled out for.The drama surrounding Widow's release and the ensuing fallout was almost more interesting than the actual movie. All kidding aside, Black Widow is a decent entry in the MCU and it is a fine swan song for Natasha Romanoff. It's just not going to be a particularly memorable movie in the larger Marvel library. I'm excited to see what Florence will do with Yelena moving ahead and despite nothing earth-shaking being present, I wouldn't want to dissuade you from checking this out on Disney Plus. Lowered expectations would be a good idea however.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The cinematography is fine, the actors are fine, the issue comes with the villain. It seems like the script writers were a little too focused on women good, white man bad, that they forgot to give the villain literally any motivation at all.

Johansson and Pugh play up their feminist credentials constantly, with endless shows of strength and no reliance on men, and yet they're constantly sexualised in those body suits. What gives? I'm not sure Pugh was a great fit for this anyway, as her doubling is far too obvious throughout. The plot is as generic as they come but there are a lot of decent CGI effects and fun action sequences, which count for something.

In short, does this movie do black widow justice? No. And how could it? This is basically an origin movie to a side kick character that we already know dies... If this movie was launched when it should have... After Civil War, the impact would have been much different. And this is how I took it. I saw this movie, as if she was still alive in MCU, and this was a representation of what Natasha has always been... A support, a rock to anyone fighting beside her, while she struggles to make right for her past. Except that in this movie.. she finally does ( and we finally know what happened in Budapest). I think this is why so many take it as if she is the sidekick. Also, I wont lie, this movie is meant to give us a ""replacement"" to black widow. But Yelena is a badass and will be very exciting to see. Still the fighting/action scenes are quite nice. People are complaining but let's be honest.. weren't many Marvel movies predictable? CGI heavy?? Finally, the complaints about the villain... This villain isn't meant to transpire outside this single movie... People are asking Loki level.. Thanos level villains.. are you crazy?? You dont put a villain that literally required the Avengers to be formed, or reborned.. in comparisson to a simple human-villain, that in fact exists (which makes people just generally uncomfortable, unlike an alien villain-human trafficking is the no 1 business in the world and most are girls). At the end, the movie is great, it just gives us more of Natasha being Natasha, it gives us a release to know that she was loved by a family before the Avengers, it gives us fun action and a bit of that Marvel comedy sequences. She would've deserved this movie after civil war and a proper send off with a sequel but alas... Female hero movies are still an uphill battle. NOTHING to do with Wonder Women 2 (that was an embarrassment)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In my mind Scarlett Johansson had every right to sue Disney over the streaming rights of this movie. The sound and special effects in this movie clearly separate it from the previous movies of Marvel past. This movie dives deep into the backstory of ""Black Widow"" something we only learned bits and pieces of during the progression of the Marvel story-line. This movie takes place after ""Civil War"" and answers a lot of questions between then and ""Infinity War"". The movie is action packed with some amazing fight scenes as well as heart felt. Actor David Harbour makes his Marvel Screen debut in this movie and his personality is seen very similar to that of what we see on ""Stranger Things"" he is the comedic relief in a more serious action movie. This movie themes around family, what it truly means to have one. An amazing film that is a must see for ANY Marvel fans out there. Of course your not a true Marvel fan if you don't stick around till the end of the credits.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought that it started out actually really good but as it went along, it got worse and worse. Like at the beginning, it was everything i could've hoped for. It had great pacing, pretty good cinematography and fight choreography, and I actually really liked the music. It's just that...as it went along, it started to get really dull and honestly, by the end, it just gave me headache. I was just so not that invested in the story and it didn't do a really good job at actually making me care for the characters. It wasn't bad or anything...it was just weird and it didn't really do anything new. It was pretty tonally inconsistent too and it made me think to myself ""wait what am I watching again?"". By the end, it just became a huge mess as the music started blaring louder and louder with every explosion...there were a lot of explosions and it got really loud. Honestly, i'm not even annoyed or anything because the movie's still watchable and you can still have a good time with it...it just felt really weird and something felt really off with it. It actually had some great ideas too but the film executed them really strangely and honestly, it just left me really really confused throughout the entire third act. Like there was no substance or anything, there was no plot twist, no crazy reveals or anything, just a few moments that made me go ""hey, that's pretty cool"" before reverting back to my neutral state of not really knowing how to react. I don't think it's as bad as everyone's saying it is, it was honestly fine. I just wouldn't go to the theatre to watch it and it's really more the kind of thing you can watch just on your computer at 1AM because you have nothing better to do. So yeah, it was fun and I really liked it at times but all together, objectively as a film, it was really dull and pretty boring honestly. One could say it was the definition of mediocre.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Black Widow's past was always shrouded in mystery and pain, but she was finally receiving the attention the hero deserved to dive into her past and celebrate Scarlett Johansson's super spy. With hopes high and fans wanting a Captain America: The Winter Soldier-type superhero espionage film, Black Widow, unfortunately, fell short. Nothing was particularly disappointing about the film. I had just hoped for so much more for the character and Scarlett Johansson at this point in the MCU's journey. The effects and action were decent. The villain was forgettable. The big defining Budapest incident was passed by with hardly any impact or emotional weight. Black Widow gets lost in all of the chaos of the film. The best part of the movie by far was the new characters played by Florence Pugh and David Harbor. They were highly entertaining, funny, and endearing. I hope to see Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova in many more Marvel films. Black Widow really was a decent entry in the Marvel universe and one of the better Phase 4 movies. Still, it didn't do Natasha Romanoff the justice she deserved leaving the character's best moments in other Marvel films that focused on other heroes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

She has ""sisters in the same destiny"" and how this movie is coming up the main story that Black Widow community is wrong, is quite entertaining. This movie perhaps is not good as the comic book, but please appreciate the art in film making, that is not always perfectly like the book.

Some people are blaming disney for milking the brand like they did star wars and making too much subpar content too quickly. I don't know, disney can't ALWAYS be the bad guy, can they?The fact that some (""guardians of the galaxy"" and some of the thor films) have a single director's vision through a couple of movies means they are able to get into the heart of the character, and tease a bit of comedy and humanity from flat, 2-d comic book charcters is appealing . I never read superhero comic books as a kid (i went more for the horror stuff) so i'm definitely not in the demographic. Also, i'm really old.David harbour makes this movie. Scarlett is good in the role that basically carries the film (florence is also quite understated and impressinve), but i couldn't look anyplace else when he was onscreen.

+Is a Marvel Movie
+Isn't WW84 (worst super hero movie, ever)Now the downsides
-Movie took 1h 20min to get to main plot
-Tried to be too much like Borne series
-Tried to be too much like MI2 with fake faces
-Weak antagonist
-Acting on par with Home Alone 3This has been by far the weakest installment in the Marvel MCU. I've never actually seen Hulk but I imagine that movie is somehow better. Hopefully this isn't a sign of things to come.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

My expectations where that of a family-dynamic Winter Soldier. Instead the film doesn't lean hard enough on the espionage and consequences of Natasha's past. While the action can - at times- be well choreographed, the set pieces and moment to moment storytelling felt generic. I found myself predicting events before they unfolded. It could be because I've seen many films, or it could be because the scripts predictable. I, however, enjoyed the family dynamic the most; that's where the film shines. I also have to commend Harbour and Pugh. Their performances stood out to me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sadly, this was short lived and Black Widow was turned into what she always was: a badass female assassin with guns.Is that bad? No it's not, but it's also no more than that, and (unfortunately?) this movie doesn't change any of it.If anything, this movie is a marketing ad for the new Hawkeye series, with perhaps a little too much screentime for Black Widow's ""sister"" Yelena.Florence Pugh nails her role, though, which is clearly better written than Black Widow's role in her own movie.Scarlett Johansson performs equally fine, but the writers really did her a disservice with what they gave her, in a movie that would have been way better suited to fit exactly where it plays out in the timeline.Making this 5 years later, when we all know what happened in Endgame, turns this into a tasty dessert that gets wasted because we're already full from the main course. A real shame.The movie itself is fine for what it is. It has a bit of everything you might expect from Marvel. The jokes, the action, good CGI; it's all there. Just not much of a villain.All in all: 7,5/10, rounding up to an 8.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

While the action it has is very high octane and Avenger-ish, the scenes are scarce when compared to the thick melodrama, emphasized by an exaggerated sad music. Twista are abound once or twice and insane predictable for anyone with half a brain. Unfortunately I was looking forward to an origin story movie for Natasha Romanoff but instead we get a family drama with more focus on her ""little sister"" character and an allegory of the Patriarchy. The biggest saving grace, aside from the action when present, is the comedy scattered throughout, which, as in any Marvel movie, can be quite hit or miss, but in this one they mostly landed for me. I'm also a big fan of David Harbour, so that helped.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, the feverish fans are. Instead of the usual endless chock a block CGI army battles the Avengers series suffers from, ""Black Widow"" concentrates more on back story, comedic touches and a healthy dose of James Bondish intrigue. Heck, they even pay proper homage by having Roger Moore as 007 on the telly in an opening sequence. Bravo!That means less cataclysmic explosions, and no destruction of civilizations. Less is more. Less destruction, but still plenty on a more psychological level, if you get the drift. We even have Ray Winstone as a deliciously sleazy Bond type villain, slurping his salacious world domination lines. Where's the white pussy? Black Widow is more acrobat and firearm expert than sheHulk, and thus the action has to be paired down to almost reasonable levels, where agility and smarts will win the day. Cool.Yet alas, this is Marvel, and thus there are issues. These are not really films, they are entertainment vehicles that fill a coupla hours with fantasy escapism. Accents come and go. Continuity seems like a costly premium. Bone crushing blows are quickly brushed off. Bad dudesses come crashing through the ceiling for no apparent reason other than it is super cool. This is action Hollywood damn it, do not question reason! You know the score. And yes, there is some crazy CGI explosive awesomeness for the comic book diehards. Thankfully ""Black Widow"" is entertaining enough to gloss over the silliness; it is quite easy to sit back with a giant bag of popcorn and eat it all up.Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the sexy (yet asexual), clever and self-effacing lead, martial arting her way through robotic foes (one at a time of course), and handling a motorbike through ridiculous traffic like, well, you know who.As a nice bonus David Harbour playing the bad father and failed super hero, threatens to steal the movie, but he is discretely inserted for just the right amount of kicks. The ideal supporting character, part of an insistent dysfunctional family reunion that gives our heroine a muddled history tree to trim as she attempts to save the world while sorting out some family strife.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm afraid it was hardly worth the wait.The story could have been good, if it was properly devleoped; the characters are good, but the film is confusingly handled by its director; many of the plot reveals are thrown away, and I felt, in the end, a certain exasperation with this movie. The farm scene is the most boring thing in the MCU so far - it goes on forever, and then we have flashbacks to if for plot reveals that just fall flat. It could have been great. In the end merely so so. A film that felt passe the moment it came out. Given the delays surely Marvel could have done reshoots to improve the flow of the story.Scarlet is a bad, pouty actress. Ray Winstone made for an awful villian, with a bad Russian accent that he borrowed from Cate Blanchette in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The family theme is half-decent, and the reason I gave it a 6 rather than a 4.Still, it was better than Aquaman, which I watched a couple of days' later. Only just. Comic book movies are going downhill recently.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

She has just sued the Disney company for daring to market the film not only in cinemas but also in streaming. Let's hope that Miss Johansson wasn't just interested in a few million more, but rather in the interests of cinema enjoyment itself. :-)In the film she doesn't beat up Mickey Mouse, but rather old cadres from the collapsed Soviet Union who have gone mad. It's also entertaining to watch, also thanks to a fantastic performance by Florence Pugh.The direction was taken over by the promising Cate Shortland. The Australian, who was born in 1968, can almost pass for a German director after her successful films ""Lore"" (2012) with Saskia Rosendahl and ""Berlin Syndrome"" (2017) with Max Riemelt. :-)Also recommended for film fans who don't like superhero films that much!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When dad comes home, he announces that the family needs to leave, and leave right now. Dad, mom and the 2 girls fly out and next we are in ""Cuba"", where it is revealed that mom and dad were part of a Russian spy cell planted in Ohio. The 2 girls are separated from mom and dad... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.Couple of comments: let me state upfront that I have never seen a Marvel Universe film... until now! I simply am not all that interested in all those superheroes movies. But there was something about ""Black Widow"" that made me think this film might be a little different. And as it turns out, I ended up enjoying this quite a bit. There are several reasons for that: great story line (even though some of the Marvel Universe references were lost on me); nice pacing of the movie, with a good dose of action scenes, and some humor, and some quiet(er) moments. Plus of course a great all-star cast, headed by Scarlett Johansson. Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, etc. Bottom line: director Cate Shortland (whose 2012 film ""Lore"" was outstanding) has delivered a surprisingly solid and entertaining film that stands on its own within the Marvel Universe, and I am the very proof that one doesn't need to have seen any of the previous Marvel Universe films to enjoy this one.""Black Widow"" was supposed to have been released in theaters in May, 2020. COVID-10 had other plans, pushing the movie to July, 2021. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (about 15-20 people, keep in mind the movie has been out for 4 weeks mow). If you, like myself, have never seen a Marvel Universe film but are curious, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Her character Yelena had a fun relationship with Natasha but also was the best character in the movie. David Harbour was also very good and made for a really fun character. Even tho Yelena and Red Guardian were great they took focus off of Black widow/Natasha. This is a problem because the whole point of the movie was to let Natasha finally shine but with the introduction to the new characters she ended up splitting the spotlight 3 ways.Since I know what happened in Endgame it took away from the action involving Black Widow. There wasn't a sense of urgency since I know in the end she'll be ok.Marvel has this theme of using comedy in poor places and it showed in this movie. Yelena and Red Guardian share a scene that potential to be really emotional but they threw some comedy in there and it took away from the significance.TaskMaster sucked. As someone who knows a little bit about the comics and has seen taskmaster in smaller tv adaptations she was extremely disappointing. Nothing but a goon with a not so interesting background.7.5/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

H. I. E. L. D after the Sokovian Accords deal, the fun fact is most of the movie takes place between the airport fight and escaping the raft scene in the Civil War. The movie doesn't linearly focus solely on the character Black Widow but also on the introduction of several characters and how it lays the foundation for the next phase. The family saga was very good at the beginning and they all had very good chemistry and the comedic relief was brilliant. The antagonist was like always the cliche MCU one where he has the picture of destroying the whole world and pocket it, the problem was the power of the antagonist was let down in a weird way. Had an okayish ending and a satisfactory post-credit scene.I was really impressed with the directing, the acting was just superb(special mention to Pugh and Harbour), the comedy was spot on, and really great opening credits.

At this point in time you know what you are getting from Marvel, above average entertainment that is ultimately pretty forgettable but fun because everyone else watches it and its fun to talk about. Some of the characters here will surely tie into more events going forward and Disney is still doing a good job of keeping the universe consistent and playing off other shows/movies to create a good overarching story.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Where do I begin? This movie feels really out of date and completely unnecessary. The film deals with her past instead of making a methodical movie that breaks down the Black Widow program and its psyche. It does an MCU formula of big set pieces and end of the world stuff. This movie barely builds Black Widow. It tries to make her mistakes haunt her but fails. They tried to bring more compassion to her with her ""family"" but failed. The plot, in general, was never going to work. Instead of the story being character-focused, it decided to be politically focused. And I don't mind politics in movies, but the politics here aren't so well thought out. It's not only pandering, but it's straight-up bad. A woman antagonist would've been better, showing what Black Widow could've been if she wasn't an Avenger, a cold-hearted killer. The other characters are a waste of space in the movie, utterly useless, some plot-wise and some Black Widow-wise. The reason why it's not so rated low is cause some action sequences are impressive. The prison cell, the safe house, and even scenes with Taskmaster should never go unnoticed. This movie may not be an insult to the MCU or Black Widow herself cause there are previous Marvel movies that lift Natasha. This movie is still the worst MCU film.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I think the reason I liked this movie is that I'm not at all a fan of the newer MCU movies.I am, or was, a fan of super-hero movies. I think the best era was 2000 - 2012. I loved the first two X-Men, the Sam Raimi Spider-Man, the Nolan Trilogy, the first Iron Man & Captain America movies from Marvel Studios.Around the time that the first Avengers movie came out is when I started to think the MCU movies were going downhill fast. The DC movies were no better but I'm only going to talk about Marvel for obvious reasons. They turned into mindless CGI team mash-ups with no character development, no back story and way too many cheesy & unfunny one liners. I honestly started to wonder why these movies kept making money at all.Black Widow feels like a return to the style of super-hero movie that I enjoy. It had back story, character development, characters pursuing real values rather than just ""good vs evil"" with endless drawn-out boring CGI action sequences. The humour was mostly well placed. The action sequences, while over the top at the climax, were actually enjoyable throughout the film since they furthered the plot and didn't drag on too long. A lot of the action reminded me of The Bourne Identity films which I loved.I can't believe that Marvel managed to put out a film that I absolutely loved after a decade of mediocrity but here it is alas. Great job.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

ALMOST NO SPOILERTHIS IS A James Bond ESQUE ESPIONAGE THRILLER WITH FAMILY TWIST. This movie is directed by Cate Shortland. It has Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Rachel Weisz as Melina Vostokoff, David Harbour as Alexei Shostak, Ray Winstone as Dreykov and Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster.The movie is a prequel to the story of Natasha Romanoff of the time between the movie Captain America: Civil War and Avengers Infinity War. The movie shows her past activities and her relation to the Red Room fellows and her ""family""This movie is overhyped unnecessarily. An expensive homage to a character that could've been rectified in the Endgame. But they did not. This being a MCU movie will have dramatic showing of how women are underestimated and traumatized in the world. However this movie also shows the MCU definition of family where anybody could be family who is worth fighting for. The story was so predictable that what I imagined came to be true with a little very twist. The family was created for accomplishing a task and after the task the family was broken and they were punished in a different way than regular way. But defeating all odds, the family got together and defeated their boss. This is what happened but with all the action shenanigans and drama bits. What disappointed me was the real face of Taskmaster. They pulled another Wanda Vision scheme for Taskmaster. However I have to appraise the opening credits which is one of the best if not one of the best opening scenes of MCU. The action was excellent. And the end credits were very important for future of MCU.Black Widow is a shakeup in the Marvel slate. It's more of a spy thriller than a superhero movie and another proof that anything is possible with family. The actions were super synchronized and awesome. However it struggles to strike a balance between family and drama. But Natasha got a befitting end for her story.Personal Review: 7/10

"6","/10","A refreshing breather after the events of Avengers: Endgame","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7792962/?ref_=tt_urv","dmansel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tt_urv","23 January 2022","What's the best way to handle a movie where the lead character has already died in a previous film? Why should audiences care about the stakes when we've already seen some form of resolution? Black Widow as a film is a slippery story to shoehorn into an interconnected universe where the narrative is mostly moving forward, not stopping to give pause for past adventures. Some could say this circumstance is of Marvel Studio's (read: Ike Perlmutter) own doing: had we gotten a Black Widow film sooner, it can be almost conclusively agreed on that the story would've hit in a different way. While the movie serves to fill a gap of time between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, there's still some odd decisions made in the telling of the story, especially in the final scenes. Bracketed by scenes featuring the seemingly ever-present Secretary of State General Thunderbolt Ross, Black Widow is a story firmly centered on Marvel's second greatest spy: Natasha Romanoff. After being contacted by Yelena Belova, another product of the same Red Room we get glimpses of in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Natasha must simultaneously flee capture at the hands of Ross while working to bring down the establishment that made her.At its core, Black Widow shares most of its DNA with the other spy thriller in the MCU, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (which also stars Johansson). No world-ending event, no invading aliens, no angry gods to be smote in this film, just some good old fashioned bad guys: Black Widow is a pure action spectacle from beginning to end. Incredible chase scenes, strong character work, and a bit of clever storytelling make this one of the stronger entries into the overall MCU canon.With this likely being her swan song in the MCU, Scarlett Johansson brings her best portrayal to the character ever. With almost a decade of time and numerous appearances large and small to hone and perfect the character, Black Widow has her at her most locked in and nailed down. As Johansson is easily one of the finest actors within the MCU stable (she was nominated for an Oscar twice in the same year, a rare feat), she's finally given the opportunity to shine as the lead, handling the weightier moments of the film. Conversely, Florence Pugh's first entry into the universe lands her a huge splash as audiences are introduced to Yelena Belova, another member of the infamous Red Room. While Pugh's Belova doesn't quite have the same amount of screen time as Natasha has, it's clear that part of the purpose of this movie was to introduce Belova as a potential ally/foil for another character later on down the road. While some are upset that Johansson has to share large chunks of the screen with her replacement in her final film, the interactions between the two are some of the most enjoyable moments of the movie. Belova is used to remind Johansson not just of who she used to be, but what she's become and how far she's progressed. Rachael Weiss and David Harbour as Natasha and Yelena's parental figures each get a little time to shine on their own as well.Unfortunately, Black Widow falls into the same trap as some Phase 1 and Phase 2 MCU movies did of having a weak villain. Ray Winstone's Dreykov, head of the Red Room isn't revealed until late in the second act and when he is, there's little about him that sets him up to be a worthy adversary for Natasha; in the end he's mostly all talk and swagger and easily dispatched of, similar to Iron Man's Obadiah Stane or Ant-Man's Darren Cross. Possibly the largest disappointment of the film was the lack of Taskmaster doing what audiences came to see the character do: kick ass. As one of Marvel Comic's beloved lesser-known villains, Taskmaster's ability to mimic any movement that results in Natasha having to basically fight any possible combination of her Avengers teammates is a concept that falls flat of being fully explored. While the character is a fun watch in the action scenes we get, the possibility of getting some real juicy stunts featuring the moves of heroes we've come to love seemed to be chopped, perhaps due to trimming down the runtime.Director Cate Shortland has become yet another in the staple of MCU directors either plucked from obscurity (Chloe Zhao's name did not have the heat it does now when Eternals was announced) or a complete surprise (""the guys who did Community?""). Even more incredulous, each one of her three previous full feature length films failed to recoup their production budget, making her nomination to helm a long-awaited film set in an unprecedented box office bonanza franchise one of the riskiest decisions Disney and Marvel Studios have made yet. Shortland's direction on Black Widow is nothing short of top notch. Beautiful imagery, meticulously planned action scenes, and character work both subtle and overt all weave together to make the 134 minute runtime feel like a fun breeze. The assignment to give Natasha a good sendoff as well as introduce Yelena Belova into the overall world was a tricky task to handle and Shortland delivers. The interactions between Romanoff and Belova are believable and heartfelt and the underlying theme of a family strongest when together isn't preachy or heavy-handed. Amazing cinematography from Germain McMicking includes both dazzling shot compositions as well as chaotic action that's still easy for the audience's eye to follow. Great editing which leads to a good pace for the film keeps viewers interested and invested throughout.Overall, Black Widow stands apart as one of the finest standalone movies within the MCU. While this only increases the frustrations of previous year's wondering what took us so long to get it, the film was well worth the weight. Dynamic action setpieces, strong acting, and sure, confident directing from Shortland combine to create the feeling of an old school spy thriller set within the superhero universe. While Black Widow has no overall earth-shattering impact on future events of the MCU (that we know of yet), it still serves as a refreshing breather after the events of Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Even with the elements that don't fully work, the overall enjoyment of having an MCU flick back on the big screen and the pleasure of hearing the flipping pages over the opening fanfare herald a return to form for the juggernaut that dominated our theaters for a decade. If this truly is Scarlett Johansson's final performance as Natasha Romanoff the Black Widow, the character went out on an explosive high note that is sure to delight audiences the world over. Black Widow is in theaters July 9th.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Instead of a formulaic origin movie, Black Widow becomes a women versus men story without a decent villain and disappointing action.As great as it is that female heroes get their chance to shine, Black Widow takes this too far, as this film turns into a flick that is all about women, fighting to escape the men who control them. Even the reveal of the villain Taskmaster and the film's conclusion is a testament to the fact that Black Widow chooses ""symbolism all over the place"" instead of action/entertainment.Although there is nothing wrong with a deeper layer, there is none of that in Black Widow. Besides the very likable Florence Pugh who might one day replace Scarlett Johansson, there are no memorable characters or actors/actresses in this movie. Not even The Red Guardian who brings some light moments, has a memorable part. And the climax, incl. The fight scenes, is forgettable.That's not to say Black Widow is a bad movie. The judgement is far worse: Black Widow as a movie was boring and unnecessary. If you appreciate superheroine movies (and you should), than Captain Marvel is the better choice.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am a big fan of 007 movie opening credit sequences, they get me excited. However, for this movie the opening credit sequence hits you like a train, from the first second it starts till the end, the haunting images and an absolute breathtaking rendition of smells like teen spirit just keeps pulling you in, until it smacks you right across the face and makes you question the world we live in.At that point you'd think, Marvel is not playing around, this is going to be something new, something dark but alas, just another Marvel movie with jokes in serious situation and physics defying action sequences.They did not utilize the villain properly for this film. What could've been a dark, impactful movie that would've been talked about for years, became just another semi-superhero action movie.Its a good watch though, watched it with friends and we enjoyed it, but it just leaves you wanting more.

Although appreciated more than many other MCU films due to constant postponements, the film seemed old compared to the phase and type of storytelling Marvel would be in (as the same would seem from the trailers for the Shang-Chi film (happy to wrong)) and this would inevitably lead to a low level of interest in the film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Soaring Spy Adventure is One of MCU's Most Action-Packed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7105274/?ref_=tt_urv","jedi-jones","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8105927/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2021","I saw Black Widow in Regal's 4DX format on opening night. It was an incredible showcase for 4DX, with all of its car crashes, hand-to-hand combat and explosions. The chairs almost throw you out onto the floor at some points. One particular segment ended with an audible ""wow"" from the audience, and laughs after the violently shaking chairs finally stopped. I saw my first 4DX ""snow,"" thanks to one scene set in a wintery locale. At one point, the 4DX put out a giant plume of smoke that was just too much. It obscured half the screen for a couple of minutes. The smoke's the only part of 4DX I would do away with. The 3D also looked very pleasing to the eye, with a lot of shots with noticeable depth. I think Godzilla: King of the Monsters was the only 4DX I've seen that was more intense than this one.It looks like Marvel Studios might've spent the year-long delay of this movie polishing up the effects and tightening up the editing, because this is one of the MCU's most technically flawless movies. Kevin Feige clearly has a well-oiled machine in place to produce these films. The movie's credited director has only directed three no-budget films before, so it's inconceivable to me that she could pull off a production this massive with so little experience without a lot of help.I thought that overall this was one of the strongest MCU movies. It was a welcome change of pace to see a down-to-earth spy thriller after the heavy sci-fi and superhero storyline in Endgame. This, at different times, felt like the 1980s G. I. Joe cartoon, the James Bond franchise and the Mission: Impossible movies. My two favorite MCU movies are Winter Soldier and Endgame. I enjoyed this one just about as much as Winter Soldier. It was definitely much more entertaining than their other recent film Captain Marvel, a dull, dry outing that is one of my least favorite MCU movies.Black Widow probably has plot holes, but it's so fast-paced and action-packed that you don't have a lot of spare time to think about the plot. This movie functions on the level of pure action, making it almost a pointless exercise to analyze the story. Therefore, I also wasn't too concerned about what any of the ""reveals"" were going to be. There isn't a lot of time to think during this movie. There's only one three-minute scene in the middle when the momentum grinds to a halt, and half the theater seemed to be checking their phones or muttering to each other. Then things pick right back up. There's a lot of backstory in the film covered in flashbacks and dialogue exchanges. I think I understood MOST of it, which is a laudable achievement for the film considering how incomprehensible a lot of spy thrillers can get.As it goes on, the movie loses some of its down-to-earth grit and gets more over-the-top and less plausible. By the end, it starts to feel more like a comic book and less like an adult spy thriller, because of the incredible feats of derring-do that the characters are able to pull off. But I can't really complain about that, because I knew going in this is based on a comic book, and not on the grittiest or most hard-boiled source material. Still, maybe there are some difficult situations that the characters get out of just a little too smoothly and easily at times.Florence Pugh was the most interesting actor to watch in the film. As the ""other"" Black Widow in the movie, she was the second most important character to pull off, and she achieved that to the maximum extent possible. She's the one character in the movie I would eagerly anticipate seeing more of, if possible. As for ScarJo, this is probably her best performance as Black Widow, but I still feel she was miscast in the role from the beginning. Emily Blunt would've nailed this part in a way ScarJo just isn't capable of. I feel satisfied now that I've seen enough of ScarJo in the MCU, and she can be retired. I didn't recognize Ray Winstone in this film. I'm not that familiar with him, but he sure gave a different, and better, performance here than he did in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The Red Guardian character, as indicated in the trailers, is largely here to provide comic relief. He was something of a caricature and not the best part of the movie by a long shot. I enjoyed him more when he was given some moments of dignity.I feel like this movie leaves wide open the possibility that we may get a similar Captain America movie, set between Civil War and Infinity War. If I recall, what Steve Rogers was doing during that time was left just as vague as what Natasha was doing. For any new fans to the MCU, I think this movie should be watched in chronological order after Civil War, EXCEPT for the post-credits epilogue. The home video release ought to move that to a bonus feature with spoiler warnings.On an unrelated note, as a G. I. Joe franchise fan, I'm greatly disappointed that the G. I. Joe movies don't feel a lot more like Winter Soldier and Black Widow. 1980s G. I. Joe was based right off of the Marvel Avengers comics in many ways, but the people making the G. I. Joe movies don't have 1% of the understanding that Marvel Studios does of how these kinds of stylized action-adventure stories are supposed to be done.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

The problem is, they took one of the most interesting villains from the Marvel Universe and reduced him into something so pedestrian that he can barely be even called a character.Scarlett Johansson also fails to shine in her own movie. Instead much of the focus is given to building up Florence Pugh's character, which pretty much defeats the purpose of giving Johansson's character a solo movie in the first place. Speaking of which, it's apparent that this movie was 5-10 years too late. It hardly adds anything to the character and doesn't hold any relevancy considering we already know the character's fate.It's blatantly obvious that it's only a cash grab and a feeble attempt at claiming a piece of the woke agenda cake. It fails to offer anything new or interesting. Its narrative and characters have no depth. Instead it's so shallow, just like most of the MCU, that it evades meaningful moments of characterization by wrapping it up with comedy.Comedy is pretty much what these Disney flicks are capable of. However, watching Cuties loving ""professional"" critics justify this trash movie is more hilarious than any of this movie's jokes.Avoid this movie at all costs. Or watch it when you're high.","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A lot of good that contains some bumps throughout","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7111353/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2021","I think Kevin Feige is an amazing producer, but I always felt it was so dumb that it took so long for Black Widow to have her film. What is more jarring that this came out after Endgame which concluded her story. Nevertheless, it is here and I was still kind of hype for it despite it all. The premise is ""Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger"". So is this another MCU hit or a miss?Firstly, the supporting cast is all stellar. David Harbour as Red Guardian was hilarious and he was incredibly charming even if his character was kind of an ass. Rachel Weisz was also great as Melina, the fake mother of Natasha, as she gives a performance that conveys the conflict her character is going through yet also being quite lovable. Florence Pugh as Yelena, Natasha's sister, is the true stand out in this film. Her performance is so charismatic and charming while also being a proper badass. Her character has the most vulnerability compared to everyone else and Florence's shows this by really delivering on the emotional performance. She also has great chemistry with Scarlett Johansson so the interaction between Yelena and Natasha are some of the biggest highlights of Black Widow. Scarlett is also still phenomenal as Natasha and she still delivers here as well. We get to see more emotion from her character which allows Scarlett to do a lot more and shine in these scenes.The music score is composed by legendary composer Lorne Balfe and he continues to make another amazing score for Black Widow. Every action scene feels more hype whenever his score is being blasted and it's just awesome. The emotional scenes become more emotional and the tense scenes become more tense thanks to his score. I also really love the action scenes, for the most part. The hand-to-hand fights felt gritty and brutal which made it very entertaining to watch. There is also a pretty cool car chase and a fight where Black Widow has to fight countless other Red Room assassins which were very enjoyable as well.However, the story is quite a mixed bag for me thanks to how it is executed. The movie does a lot of telling of her past rather than showing which is kind of disappointing. I think seeing the red ledger stuff she did as a Red Room assassin would've given the ending more impact. Additionally, Black Widow explores the theme of family but handles it quite poorly. Natasha confronting her fake family is emotional stuff and the movie does show it but it would then deflect it with a silly joke which did get annoying. This is terrible when it came to the dad, Red Guardian. The movie treats him like a joke even though he did an incredibly terrible thing that caused his fake daughters to dislike him. There is a moment where he does start trying to repair his relationship with his daughters which was very sweet but the story doesn't stay long enough on this. He also doesn't get a moment to show how much he cares for his daughter which disappointed me. I did have my issue with how jokes are used in MCU movies but I think it is more annoying here than it is in previous MCU movies. The story is also very low stakes and because of Endgame, there doesn't feel like there is much danger to our main characters.The action scenes near the end are quite disappointing as well. There is a fight between the Red Guardian and Taskmaster which sounds on paper cool as both have some kind of superpower. However, the editing had lots of cuts with also constantly cutting away to something else which made it jarring. Additionally, Red Guardian, despite having super strength, never gets to show this in the fight. There is also a final fight between Black Widow and Taskmaster at the end which is mostly a CGI fest but is also incredibly short as well. It was a disappointing final fight for sure. On that note, the villains in Black Widow are also very disappointing. Dreykov, the leader of the Red Room, doesn't even have much of a presence on the plot until 40 minutes in. Even when they start appearing, they still have no presence as the plot is more focused on getting the family together than villains doing something. Taskmaster may be the most disappointing villain in MCU history. They are such a deviation from the comic as Taskmaster never speaks ever. There is also a reveal about Taskmaster that is just lame.Overall, Black Widow is a movie I feel so incredibly conflicted about. The story and villains are quite poor but there are moments in it that are very good. The characters and performances by actors are all great but some characters don't get enough to shine. The action scenes are entertaining but it does stumble near the end. Black Widow is a movie with a lot of good that contains some bumps throughout. In the end, I am glad it finally came out and I enjoyed watching it even though it does feel a bit too late.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But when it came to Black Widow I put it off for a week and I don't even feel bad about it.Scarlett Johansson's black widow is still just a supporting character. Florence's character Yelena on the other hand actually got me cracking up at parts. Overall the acting was pretty good all round but the best acting I would say came from David Harbour & Florence Pugh(Thou I may be slightly biased here as I really like the actress xD)The storyline was honestly the weakest I've come across in a marvel movie and the villain was just boring. Like seriously it was just so boring listening to him talk or just basically any scene with the villain in it. The fake family and their drama was more entertaining to watch in all honesty. I miss when MCU villains were of the caliber of Loki, Thanos etc.All in all, I give Black Widow a 7/10. Without David Harbour and Florence Pugh I would probably rate it a 4 or 5 out of 10.I still did enjoy the film but it didn't have me wanting more with the appetite I normally have around marvel movies. One of the things I was most hyped to see in the film was what happened in Budapest between Barton and Natasha but it turns out it was just another shoot out... nothing really special really...Anyway I think the director's inexperience and lack of marvel know
how is what caused a lot of the problems. Yelena seems cool though and I'll probably watch out for her future appearances if only to see if she is wearing a sexy outfit 😂.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And, I like Scarlett Johansen as an actress. While Black Widow is by no means my favorite character, I was looking forward to a well produced MCU movie (vs the TV series nonsense).It's a good thing Black Widow isn't my favorite character because this movie wasn't really about her. This movie seemed to be all about her sister who is played by. Florence Pugh and WOW does she do an awesome job at the role. Scarlett Johansen does a good job but whoever was writing the movie seemed to forget about the title being named after her. It seems as-if they are pushing to introduce Pugh as a new superhero and forgot about Black Widow in the making.So, if you tuned in for a Black Widow movie, you'll be disappointed because this really isn't it. You don't really discover anything about Black Widow then you really knew before. For that reason this one kind of confused me and resulted in a lower rating. Had the title been 'Yelena' it would probably rank up another star. David Harbor's character was pointless and a waste of dialogue. But, he got to play the Communist he's always wanted to be!Aside from the above, it was a decently produced movie. Directing was good. Acting was good. Story writing was MEH. First half of the movie is great! Second half feels like it was written by someone else and drags on then goes into easy explanations. All in all, a good movie that could have been great with a better conclusion and someone deciding who the movie was really about and sticking to it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Black widow is a fantastic character, and delving into the realm of an agent might result in some intriguing scenes. However, due to the length of the film, some scenes dragged on, which drew me out of the experience. Many of the jokes fell flat, and the MCU can't seem to make a film without include cringey quips in otherwise serious scenarios.The performances of all of the actors were excellent, and few fans will have any complaints in that regard. However, some people may be disappointed by the lack of use of certain characters.The lack of realism established in the movie is my biggest criticism. This is a superhero film, so it's understandably unrealistic, but there are a few instances where you can only suspend your disbelief so long before rolling your eyes. Throughout the film, the characters never felt like they were in any actual danger.Despite these flaws, the film still has some enjoyable action and cool sequences that should keep you entertained.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Positives, negatives, conclusionPositives:
Solid performances overall. Although it's perhaps not Scarlett's best as Natasha. Florence Pugh's performance was worth mentioning as well, she was good in this one.Unlike most of the previous Marvel films, this one doesn't reflect the serious moments with jokes the whole time, resulting in a movie with deeper characters and more emotions. That's why I consider the second act to be the best part of the movie.Well choreographed battle scenes as expected, but they can get a bit repetitive sometimes.Negatives:
It's no secret that Marvel movies are as popular as they are because of their entertainment value. And I thought this one lacks that, to keep it brief let's say that it had pacing issues.The MCU's villain problem continues, Taskmaster was well introduced in the first act but poorly handled throughout the rest of the film, and the plot twist sort of wasted the character for me. A very disappointing side villain. And the main villain was perhaps the worst part in the movie. Very generic and not interesting at all.The dialogue can be cheesy sometimes and filled with cliches, especially in the third act.Conclusion:
I thought Black Widow would have served the story and the universe a lot better if it was released in 2017. With that said, I don't think the movie offers anything special. 6/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A fairly standard MCU film that stands by itself.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7298153/?ref_=tt_urv","Benjamin-M-Weilert","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100116496/?ref_=tt_urv","2 September 2021","After the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), it was difficult to perceive where a Black Widow movie would fit in the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fortunately, even though there are over 20 films in this cinematic juggernaut, there is still room to fill gaps in the overall story. Taking place after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Widow (2021) follows Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johannson) as she takes some ""personal time"" to put to bed the demons from her past. It's a little weird to have such a standalone film in the MCU, but it's the only way something like this could work.Almost a decade after the ""Budapest"" incident was first mentioned in an offhand remark in The Avengers (2012), Black Widow finally shows us the details of this significant event-even if it was played as a joke in previous films. Natasha's past was brought up in other parts of various MCU films, but this movie finally stitches them all together into a coherent narrative. Of course, while it does give some much-needed background to one of the franchise's most secretive characters, it feels a little like a moot point by now.Regardless of its relevance to the MCU as a whole, two performances stand out in my mind. David Harbour makes the film endlessly entertaining as he chews the scenery, but Florence Pugh nails it with the back-and-forth comedy between the two ""sisters."" It's no wonder that I have enjoyed her acting as of late (especially in Little Women (2019)). And while most of the MCU movies that bookend this film's chronology explain what happens afterward, it's the post-credits scene that made me roll my eyes as Disney tries to push more of their Disney+ programming into the greater MCU framework.A fairly standard MCU film that stands by itself, I give Black Widow 3.5 stars out of 5.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

The film, especially CGI/special effects and action sequences, doesn't add much new to the Marvel cinematic universe but the story moves along and there is some amusing meta-humour at the expense of well-worn hero-tropes (notably the three point power-landing) and on the oft ridiculed contribution of master assassin, but otherwise mundane, 'Black Widow' to 'The Avengers', a team that includes omnipotent supernatural beings, Gods, and Hulks. The script is a bit light-weight and quippy, especially when Romanov's father shows up, which makes some of the 'family bonding' scenes a bit uneven, but the two 'sisters' seem to have fun with their roles (Florence Pugh is quite good as Yelena). The opening sequence and credits are excellent as is much of the first half but the film falters somewhat when the action moves to the villain's improbable aerial secret-base and resorts to the much parodied shtick of the evil-doer carefully explaining his nefarious plans before an overly-long and physics-defying climatic fight. Other than some heavy-handed 'sister-hood' bonding at the end, I failed to see the 'feminist agenda' that some IMDB commentators seem fixated on. Having read a lot of on-line amateur reviews (such as the one I am writing), I was prepared for pretentious crap at the level of 'Captain Marvel' (2019) , so was presently surprised by this entertaining, if not outstanding, CGI-fest.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

Costumes are well designed with the exception of Taskmaster, who looks like a walking Nerf gun. Johanssen feels strangely out of place in the film, which has a lot to do with the fact that they shelved her to make way for her sister. Pugh does a great job, with a not so great script. The comedy in the script gets out of hand as comedy and jokes appear at bad times. It's as if a boardroom made this film at times. For a film with what Marvel described as more real and visceral action, this film does not deliver on that promise. The car being shot down the street in Budapest was ridiculous.

His interesting ""power"" of mimic could have been used much more effectively, but they barely scratched it and just skipped right over it. Lorne Balfe's soundtracks lifted movie's scenes with its cold and eerily melodies. It is clear that Black Widow should have come out years ago and was only made to satisfy strenuous fans that have been constantly asking for it.

The fire/explosions look really weird, and they often don't even shine light on the environments. They're also way too dark for the scenes, and they always move in slow motion for some reason. Also, some of the green-screening is great, but some of it looks really weird, too.Aside from some other minor gripes with the story and consistent physics rules, it was enjoyable.

The main villains motive is lazily written too. My last big complaint is the action. It's pretty lazy and unappealing for the most part. The editing in these scenes is also pretty bad. Now, onto the positives.The biggest positive is act one. The opening sequence is great attention grabber. The entirety of act one also felt more serious than an MCU movie. It was refreshing and great to experience. Another positive is Florence Pugh. I personally enjoyed her more than Scarlett. The final major positive is that it did a good job at balancing the scenes with action and without action.Overall, Black Widow is alright. It's another movie that'll get lost in the oversaturated genre of comic book movies. As for the MCU, it's probably one of the weaker entries into the franchise.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

While unfortunately not as ravishingly beautiful as Milla was as a pup, I literally recognized her as Milla's child and had never even seen her before, and looked it up and sure enough, tada. WOW. Some very genetic Milla eyes! (I always felt Milla should have been cloned) . I also appreciate what they tried to do casting Natasha's sister, you want to get someone similarly proportioned, but don't want to outshine her, which could be difficult given Scarlett isn't your typical supermodel build or beauty. It would have been interesting to have seen Oleysa Rulin in the role. I tried my best to invest myself in the story, but it was a little simplistic and linear, and by the time they got around to doing anything significant I just didn't really care what was happening anymore. This sort of storyline concept would have done much better if it was drawn out into a longer television series, you could have put a lot more stakes on the whole ""mind control"" thing and ultimately made the rest of the ""widows"" into characters worth fighting, fighting for, and saving. Here they try to condense the concept into a film, but what happens is just volley of plot information followed by a bunch of action sequences and there is never much investment aside from the very forced attempt at the familiy drama surrounding Black Widow, Red Guardian and the fam. One of my biggest beefs with the decisions made making this film was opting to make all the characters speak with a poorly-imitated Russian accent - honestly, at that point, just have everyone speak English with their normal accents or whatever, because the accents were so poorly acted that none of the characters could develop any semblance of nuance, making them very cardboard-like. I really wanted to enjoy this far more than WW1984, but it was very comparably mediocre. It's like they just want to throw budgets at fluff and see who comes to pay for it, particularly with films of the superhero variety these days. Honestly, post-Avengers/X-Men/Thor it feels like the well has run dry and sadly the best of the superhero films from the major comic companies are behind us, and we're sliding into another superhero film dark age as the best the genre has to offer has now taken the form of TV series like The Boys and Jupiter's Legacy, which follow in the footsteps of great series like Heroes, Playstation Network's Powers and Netflix's Daredevil. Honestly Black Widow should have been a series, same budget, longer investment and more depth to the story. As is, it wasn't very interesting, and certainly was no better than one of the Hulk films, which were widely considered a bust (though personally I still very much enjoyed Ang Lee's).","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In fact, it's sometimes the quite opposite - the sisters (and the whole ""family"") portray their emotions and attitude to the past quite dramatically and believably, so there's a good deal of drama there. The action in the first 2/3 of the movie is also quite good, while it's limited to fights and less futuristic equipment.What's less amusing IMO is the main villain, the evil plot and the final battle - it's too generic, too made-up and too ""common futuristic fighting scene with heroes gloriously surviving through impossible odds"". Surprisingly dull comparing to the first part of the movie.Overall it's quite good and amusing from (most of) the characters perspective, but has some irritating downsides.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

We can see a fantastic piece of work being done and the next movie is simply mediocre.I do take my hat off since lately Marvel seems to have found its pace and has been on a high note, both in movies and TV, but Black Widow undoes all that work.For starters, I don't know if it's only me but I am a Scarlett Johansson's fan overall as an actor so I usually don't point out flaws in that department, but in this movie she didn't quite seem to be in character, it's hard to figure out if it was potentially made on purpose to showcase a different side of Natasha, but for me it simply feels odd, one thing is to show humanity other completely different is changing the character's personality, it didn't feel like the Black Widow we see portrayed in the other movies (as an example in Endgame we do see a changed Natasha, but there it feels organic, like a good development).Then we start to see where the bigger problems are, the action scenes feel completely off and the editing is very poorly made, filled with fast changing sequences where we can't see half of what's happening, and then there's also the very bad CGI which is something that you for sure do not expect from a big budget Marvel movie.Although the story does have potential and it kind of makes sense giving the period where it takes place, I didn't buy the whole ""family"" dynamic, it feels very forced and there is absolutely no chemistry there, I didn't care for any of the characters aside from Natasha and her sister and also I don't care how good David Harbour as a performer, as the ""comedy relief"" in this movie it's just blend and unfunny, nothing against the actor or his portrayal I just don't think the character is good, feels completely irrelevant.The movie as a whole as some interesting aspects to it and it's not an overall terrible film, Florence Pugh is without a doubt the best thing that comes out of this, a very solid a believable performance, good character and I have this strong suspicion that it's not by accident as we most likely will see more of her very very soon.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But sadly after that the movie took a turn to a ""classic, normal, unsepectecular"" action movie and didn't used the potential the story would have had.

Viewed: July 31st, 2021In the ever changing landscape that is Hollywood, no matter what kind of film you are doing, usually the results fall to ticket sales. So, if you are the MCU, you also have to look beyond the film itself and look ahead at franchise preservation. As you know 2019s Avengers: End Game (with an epilogue companion film in Spiderman: Far From Home - 2019), ended a three phase, 11 year, 24 film run, which ended in a critically acclaimed, fan supported, general audience box office smash. How do you top that? Well, for now, you don't.When accomplishing a feat that Kevin Feige was able to pull off, you need to understand your audience and fanbase well, which he does. In order to accomplish your success a second time you need to pull back and reign in your audience's expectations a little. You want to recreate that build up that made the first three phases so successful. That also includes tempering expectations for the audience. This is where things go off the rails for Black Widow (2021), when looking at it as a stand alone film. As part of a franchise, it does what it needs to do.Black Widow (2021), is meticulously and painfully crafted as a quiet entry in the MCU canon. As the first film of phase four, it tries not to dazzle or even really entertain, but more than anything else, it wants to tell the missing story of one of the Avengers' legendary characters. The film slowly begins the next Marvel saga off to a future, much bigger build up, over the next 10 years, which will hopefully dazzle us again, like Avengers: End Game (2019), did. It is the sacrifice that Black Widow (2021), has to do for the greater overall picture. As fun, enjoyable and pioneering that the first Ironman (2008), was, it still was mediocre fare by the time we got to End Game. Weather it was intentional or not, the early MCU build up from the early films, is what was needed for the overall spectacular event that happened at the end of the Infinity Saga.Now let's look at Black Widow (2021), on its own. Being as it is an established character, the legendary Black Widow/Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson), what we need to learn from the film, we do. In flashbacks we learn about Natasha's early childhood. We meet her pseudo-family, who are actually Russian spies, posing as her and her sister's (not related by blood), parents, who end up being on assignment a little too long and when the time comes for them to go home, the years have added way too many emotions and feelings to the girls psyche. So how do these assigned parents break free to return to the motherland without crushing the feelings and beliefs of their ""daughters"" Natasha and Yelena (Florence Pugh)?Intertwined between the flashbacks to the mid-1990s, was the time period that the Marvel fans really came to see. The film actually takes place in 2016 and contains the information that filled in the early missing years between Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Widow is on the run from the Sokovia Accords and after a few safe houses, she manages to track down her pseudo-family again in order to take down the Taskmaster and a handful of rogue Widows. We also get to learn more about the Red Room, the society that takes in the young women to be trained as Black Widows and what implications this life had on Natasha and Yelena. Their father is an aged, over-the-hill, ex-superhero himself, the Red Guardian (David Harbour), who is the Russian version of Captain America. Their mother is an original Black Widow (Rachel Weisz).The film accomplishes what it needed to at the expense of its own critical success. It needed to pay full attention to the character's history, her overall story arc and not worry about dazzle and flair. The film looks just as professional and polished as any other MCU film, it's just boring. I am giving this film a 6/10, which to me is still a good enough film to go see in the theaters. It should be seen in the theaters, because it does contain some big screen moments, it's just slow. As a Marvel fan I did not like the approach that they took with Taskmaster, but I'll let you decide if you care about that. It is important that the film paid homage to Natasha, considering what we know of her final fate. That feeling hangs over the film like a shroud though and may impact the overall quality of the film, because it might be that shroud that creates the overall feeling of an empty, dull script. Add in the fact that Scarlett Johansson is now suing Disney for streaming rights compensations just adds more to the shroud that seems to be hanging over this film. Did I mention the year and a half COVID delay on this film too? We probably needed more from the film and unfortunately the producers can't deliver that, because we have the overall picture to worry about.6.4 (D+ MyGrade) = 6 IMDB.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

She also has one of the coolest fight styles out of all the Avengers. She had no superhuman abilities but still manages to hold her own battling genetic enhanced or supernatural villains. She has always had the best fight sequences, except for in her own movie! BW came across inferior in this movie when battling other widows, including her sister. I also wish they would have used this movie to give us a more in depth backstory instead of a recycled marvel movie. Would have loved if they showed more of her experience in the red room and her path to redemption. I would have also liked to see how she got involved with SHIELD and became so close with Hawkeye. Instead, we got a generic storyline that basically didn't contribute much to BW's legacy. Watched an interview with Scarlett stating that this movie has done things that other movies have never done before. I felt like it was like every other marvel movie. Entertaining but a missed opportunity for greatness.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The other supporting characters are forgettable. Taskmaster isn't even worth mentioning, looking like the illegitimate child of Captain America and one of the Aliens from John Carpenters 'They Live' but without the character development. The action choreography and CGI were dodgy and poorly constructed. The forced humor was cringe, as was the use of 'Smells like Teen Spirit' in a Marvel movie for what feels like the 100th time (can we at least use another Nirvana song please?)Black Widow is right up there with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2 as the worst MCU movie. Probably the worse.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The actions scenes were good, some of them were unrealistic at times which I'm not a fan of, but I guess that's normal in movies.

One complaint would be Ray Winstone as a fairly one dimensional villain who rarely featured, but other than that would highly recommend this movie.An issue with some other reviews appears to be downgrading this film because ""it's just another movie saying women are better than men"". Firstly, a completely wrong take, and secondly, did you expect a solo film about a female Avenger and her sister to feature male heroes?All in, thoroughly enjoyable and good to be back in the cinema. Can also appreciate the work from Marvel and Disney to tie this in to the franchise so it's not a standalone films.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Black Widow is on the same level (if not better than some) as all Marvel movies up to this point. I mean you have some cool action scenes, comedic moments and some great new characters so what the hell did you expect that left you so underwhelmed? Also there's no blatant ""women good men bad"" ideology or forced diversity pushed down your throat every few minutes so for a MCU Phase 4 that's a great success (honestly those disastrous miniseries made my standards drop by miles), characters aren't just two-dimensional woke checkpoints and the plot is intruguing and actually makes sense. All in all this is undoubtedly 153 times better than those ridiculous Disney + shows and is actually a decent movie so if you're looking for a fun popcorn ride with friends look no further.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was expecting this to be a swan song for Natasha Romanoff, and the Avengers-centric era of MCU. Finally, I thought to myself, THE Black Widow, the only female Avenger, the world's most deadly assassin (well maybe next to Winter Soldier) and dangerous spy is finally getting her OWN film. We finally get to explore her backstory and see her kick ass as the main character.Unfortunately, what I saw wasn't a Black Widow film, it was, I don't know how to descibe it, but think of a children's action-comedy focusing on a nuclear family, like the Incredibles, but with Natasha Romanoff set as the ""big sister"".The film focuses way too heavily on Yelena (the kid sister played by Pugh) and Romanoff's ""Family"", which is introduced for the first time in the MCU. You have the goofy strong man dad who's a washed up loser but has a good heart, the smart scientist mom, and the smart-alecky kid sister, The ""sister jokes"" between Pugh and Johansson fall completely flat. Hahaha, forced hysterectomy on young girls, hilarious...""Red Defender"" played by David Harbour was kinda funny, but completely out of place. So now the Soviets made another Super Soldier besides the Winter Soldier and the failed experiments in Siberia? They had their own version of Captain America and yet this is the first time we're hearing of it. Is he lying about knowing Captain America, or was his aging slowed like Bucky? We'll never know, but then again, I came too see a movie about the Black Widow, not the dollar store Russian knock-off Avengers.The Red Room, where other Black Widows are trained, along with the Taskmaster and the villain who created them, could've been so much more interesting, but they're just plot devices used to show us more of the MCU bad fake-Russian accent, action Hero Simpsons episode.I was hoping to see Black Widow, the elite lone assassin, with a story reminiscient of La Femme Nikita. Instead I got this goofy family comedy from Disney. If you stay for the post-credit scene, you'll realize this whole thing is a setup for the upcoming Hawkeye series on Disney Plus.In other words, the reason Pugh gets so much screen time, and the ""kid sister"" gets so much dialogue, is because this whole movie was an advertisement for another show.ScarJo and Natasaha Romanoff deserved better.","15 out of 41 found this helpful.

A Russian super soldier that's obsessed with being back in his costume could've had extremely fun fight scenes with violence and extreme uses of strength but instead ends ups being the comic relief and the butt of the joke.) another example of characters not used properly is the villain Taskmaster.

After seeing the trailer, so long ago, I had my doubts about this film - especially since Marvel is making a lot of recent garbage.This movie will surprise you. While it is not going to be considered in the upper echelon of Marvel movies; it falls in the middle of the pack. No where near as bad as Captain Marvel or Black Panther.There are flaws in the movie, but they do not tear it down to a bad level - they just keep it from rising to a better rating.Scarlett. Johansson had always been a rather average performer. Another reason to doubt this film. The surrounding cast pushes the film ahead and makes it work.Is it anything new? No - and in the beginning the same old car/motorcycle chase you have seen over and over makes you think that the film would crash. Once the film gets the crew (the four characters from the first ten minutes) back together is when the film becomes interesting.The one glaring weakness was the portrayal of Taskmaster. He was always a Captain America antagonist for one thing - but that doesn't take away.

"7","/10","Plenty to like in Natasha Romanoff's solo adventure! [+69%]","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7109539/?ref_=tt_urv","arungeorge13","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2021","Natasha Romanoff gets a befitting origin story and an extremely gratifying arc in her MCU sendoff film. I loved all the lead characters in this - Florence Pugh (as Yelena) is amazing as always; David Harbour (as Alexei) provides great comic relief; Rachel Weisz (as Melina) continues kicking arse as she did a couple of decades ago. Scarlett Johansson leads the pack here, in a stellar show that leads us to believe how she sacrificed herself in Endgame. The screenplay (by Eric Pearson) is packed with the right doses of situational humour, expensive set-pieces, and a worthwhile plot. On one hand, it feels as if it shouldn't have taken so many years for Natasha's standalone adventure, after watching the film. On the other, it also feels like it came out in the right decade when feminist movements are globally peaking.Especially in Pugh and Harbour, director Cate Shortland finds characters worth investing time, energy, and screenspace in. Sisterhood is used as a powerful storytelling device here - it helps establish the emotions and even a few running gags. The scene where Yelena mocks Natasha's signature poses was a scream. The same goes for the scene where Alexei tries to make Yelena feel better after an uncomfortable revelation during their family reunion. The good thing is that Cate Shortland's vision fits like a glove within the MCU, even when it is devoid of Avenger cameos or Easter eggs. She devotes sufficient time to the expository scenes between set pieces, gradually building effective connections between the film's protagonists.What I found unnecessary is Shortland's hand-holding of the audience when it comes to the twists. And just like Mandarin in Iron Man 3, TaskMaster (Olga Kurylenko) feels very underutilized as an antagonist. The CGI, for a $200 mn budget, looks stunning for the most part, except in a few shots where it looks tacky. Even with said issues, Black Widow ends on an action-packed, emotional high. As a star, Johansson clearly knows when to play lead and when to let others around her shine and have their moments. I look forward to seeing Pugh become a key figure in the next phase of the MCU. She's just that damn good and deserves a solo film of her own in the near future!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"10","/10","An Action-Packed Entertainer From Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh !!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7323032/?ref_=tt_urv","cs_rahul_prasad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104563194/?ref_=tt_urv","9 September 2021","Finally, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) gets a story that is dedicated entirely to her and the one that takes us back to her childhood and the make-believe world that she called family. And she is not alone. Her younger sister Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), a Black Widow herself is still with the Red Room, but now she wants out and it's her elder sister to the rescue. In their quest to destroy a common enemy, they end up with their faux parents, Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) and Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz). This 'family reunion' is marked by double-crosses and an inevitable danger that could be the end of the road for Romanoff.Director Cate Shortland goes for the human story behind Black Widow's past and present and drives it well with all the action, peppered throughout. This is the reason why the film's high-tech and complex narrative feels relatable. Amidst all the mumbo-jumbo about the mind-controlling gadgetry and elite technology, capable of bringing in the new world order, what really hits home, is the simple connection between the two sisters and the longing they feel for a family that never was.While Scarlett Johansson plays her part with seasoned finesse, giving us a protagonist that is always easy to root for, Florence Pugh is extremely adorable. Pugh is a perfect fit as a slightly brash and spoilt younger sister, who despite all the elite training to become a Black Widow, retains her child-like innocence and charm. She also brings in plenty of sass and comedy, delivering effective punches, both comical and actual. David Harbour is a bit of a drag, thanks to his annoying character - a loose cannon, you know will spell trouble. Much unlike his onscreen partner Rachel Weisz, who is classy and understated as the unpredictable Melina Vostokoff. But collectively, it's their chemistry and the performances that work. Action wise, there is enough to hold genre fans and MCU followers and most of the chase scenes are edge-of-the seat. The action is slick and comes at opportune times. And all of this in a film led by women is even more commendable. Although the special effects, at times, don't match up to the standards we expect from this affluent franchise.Overall, Black Widow justifies its place in the MCU with an entertaining story that has drama, action and comedy, making it a Hollywood potboiler worth your time, all the way to the post end-credits scene that cannot be missed.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Scarlett never stops surprising with her amazing acting skills, but Florence carried her character like no one else, it so fun and amazing to watch her play Yelena.The taskmaster story was not so developed but it made sense.I also liked the fact that they talked about important matters such as human tracking, and women not having a choice on having kids or not.Last but not least, the extra scene, I do have to admit it gave me tears, but it was good to somehow close her story, and move Yelena deeper into the MCU.It was great to see Scarlett Johansson play Natasha Romanoff one more time!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I'm assuming these are the same bitter incels who tried to bring Captain Marvel down. It's as if their fragile masculinity is threatened by a comic book movie that isn't full of shirtless muscle men. Maybe these reviewers have other issues they're working through. It'll be ok, little buddy.As far as the movie goes, is it Marvel's best movie? Absolutely not. Is it the worst? Not even close.The movie is cast perfectly, with Pugh and Harbour as standouts. The action sequences are great when they're on the ground. Some of the aerial stuff was very over-the-top CGI; however, scenes contained excellent fight choreo and great stunt work - reminiscent of the Bourne series. There were effective smatterings of humor and some heavier moments when Natasha and Yelena discussed their Red Room training.A lot of Marvel purists were disappointed by the re-working of Taskmaster, and while I do see this as the waste of an opportunity to introduce a more comic-faithful version of him in the MCU, I do feel that the villain was fairly effective within the plot of the movie.I think the ending and post-credits scene leave some interesting avenues for the MCU to explore, and I look forward to seeing where they lead.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Says more about the attention span of the individual than the film itself. For the movie I loved the build up and showing black widows whole family, you know because its her movie. The whole point of this is to show her back story and we get that. It is funny in parts, the script isn't 100% perfect, but its a big dumb action movie, what are people expecting?

It's a shame we know the fate of Natasha in End Game, but anything in the Marvel universe can happen.This Movie as been said by many film review sites, has one of the best opening credit scenes of any Marvel Movie, watch it! It's so creepy and relevant to todays society of child trafficking and her initial red room training!I kept a close eye on this movie production for a while and boy did everybody got it completely wrong about the TaskMaster ...everybody I mean every body thought it was to be O. T. Fagbenle!. No body knew it was to be. Olga Kurylenk..... shows how miss-information can be spread!Natasha is like a cat, as if anyone has noticed as in the Avengers and this after a fall she always seems to land on her feet, or in a stance, ' poser' ha..!David Harbour, was the humour of the movie, Florence provided the great one liners, Scarlett gave a superb acting and action performance!I thought one of the best scenes of the movie was the 'family dinner reunion' in Melinas farm house. It was very funny, yet there was a great sadness to the characters and it was truly emotional.Florence Pugh literally stole the scene here and it was very emotional..Such a very simple scene at the dinner table can create a emotional stir within the context of the movie. It was very strong!Florence Pugh, gave a brilliant performance!Black Widow, is never really dead...
Avengers'End Game'. Gave the clues away, in the time travel sequence!Just one question: where did the red room crash?Also did you know that in every shot Natasha ends in a fight or fall she always seems to end up on her feet or in a position that gives her a good vantage point!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

First of all there aren't any good men to see here. Guys are either stupid, antagonistic or outright evil.On the other side there is the ""Sisterhood"" feeling which the movie even explicitly mentions. There were two men and around a twentysome women in the theatre. My young friend dragged me into it and I wanted her to be happy.So, there I sat and I wondered who would make such an imbalanced type of movie? Having a strange idea of genders is one thing, but it was also about character development and character interaction.Johanssons performance and storyline was fine, but that of her family far less so. There was no chemistry between the members at time although the story has a few explanations. I loved to see Rachel Weisz again, but I felt she lacked screentime. Florence Pugh is different generation and the youngest of the three. And I felt reminiscences of the usual teenage flick out there. Something I try to avoid in my spare time. It's not bad acting but I can't stand the mix of sassiness, sarcasm and negativity.The whole movie was written in James Bond style. It had it all and there was no need for having superheroes in it, with just a few adjustments to the script. It was a Bond script in disguise of a Marvel superhero movie. Let's just add that there are a only a few cross references to other Marvel content. Bond movies have the disadvantage that they are both stereotypical and predictable. Likewise we get to see expensive sets and locations. The chase gets a bit old though after a while.When it comes to style and editing, this is state of the art. It's all beautiful and well colored. But just as already stated: there are about one or two sets more than it's good.To sum it up, it was at once entertaining but it also drained my nerves to watch anything like this in the future.One last thing: in times of Covid, we're forced to wear masks. This contradicts movies in 3D. Yet, it can be hard to see anything with foggy glasses. The effects weren't bad but they were not needed either.This one is for the girls.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Black Window delivers a fulfilling action flick despite messy climax and MCEU's weakest character.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7112815/?ref_=tt_urv","SAMTHEBESTEST","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50463365/?ref_=tt_urv","11 July 2021","Black Widow (2021) :
Movie Review -It's been over 2 years now that we experienced the biggest superhero saga of all time through Marvel's Avengers : Endgame. Since that film some people really thought that now there would no more fun coming from MCEU but they were proven wrong with Spider Man : Far From Home. The makers had advantage of following the events after Endgame and so that Spidy flick came out really well, actually, even better than its predecessor. With Black Widow, MCEU has gone back to the time before Endgame amd Infinity War therefore the excitement of seeing something new was neve bulit up. Though, Marvel was smart enough to make a film on the character who had left the fans teary eyed so the sentimental back-up was there for sure. Thankfully, Black Widow is shaped well enough for the one time viewing even though it has made quite a mess out there with the weakest superhero present in the MCEU.Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront a conspiracy tied to her past. To be honest, Black Widow always looked the weakest in superheroes team because she doesn't hold any superpowers alongside HawkEye and so, having a film entirely carried by such a weak superhero was never meant to have a solid outcome. Of course, we aren't watching Christopher Nolan's Batman who had even less powers than RomanOff but Nolan is huge genius and that makes a big difference in the quality of filmmaking. Black Window kicks-off brilliantly and halfway through it surpasses all the normal expectations. But then it seems little dragged somewhere down the end and the overall excitement of solid content gets spoiled. But seriously before that dragging, it looked a fantastic film with superb action sequences and less use of larger-than-life explosion.Black Window is not a standalone film even with the characters of the film. If someone says that the lead superhero is sidekicked by a new character then you gotto agree. Performance wise, Scarlett Johansson is as good as she was in any Marvel film before but the real surprise here is Yelena. Florence Pugh plays this part and she looks hotter than Scarlett. Unfortunately, she didn't get as much action sequences as Scarlett or else she would have overshadowed her completely. David Harbour, Ray Winstone and Rachel Weisz are fine in whatever scenes they have got. The visual effects are not that great but the action sequences are. With technical aspects, Black Widow is neither dull not too good.The film do have some promising scenes that could stay with you for a while and it also have a good start given to HawkEye series we are gonna see in future. Cate Shortland's direction is worthy enough to make this flick one time watchable for fans and neutral audience as well. However, there was a scope for betterment which is surely wasted by the team. Overall, another action entertainer in MCEU that can be enjoyed by Fans as well as neutral movie lovers if they are not expecting something outstanding.RATING - 6.5/10*","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

To be honest, I expected rather little from this film. Considering all that's happened in the MCU recently with her character, and it's incredibly delayed release, I felt like the time had passed for a Black Widow solo film. Surprisingly though, I found myself quite entertained and moved by some of the moments of the film, and although it wasn't great, it did prove to be better than I had anticipated. By far the best thing about the film is Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena, aka Natasha's sister. Through her character we get a greater depth not only into a magnificently written character, but also the world of Natasha herself, and the pains that have burdened each of them for a long time. Strangely enough, in this marvel movie, by far the best moments are when it slows down and takes a time to tell it's story- as well as clear up the emotional depth each character has had to deal with. The action scenes are decent, nothing too special. I adore the costumes and really liked the films score. Towards the final act of the film, we seen to have a deterioration in quality though- it being just a bit too convoluted to have as much fun or as much as an impact as it could have had. In the end, I enjoyed Black Widow, it has its problems and it could have been better, but it also was much more refreshing than I anticipated- and that for me is a win alone.My Rating: 7.7/10.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

She is also forced not only to face her past but also to close some unfinished business.I enjoyed this movie because it contained many good action scenes that were combined very well with comedy. The plot was interesting and not boring while the visual effects gave a beautiful touch in the movie and lifted even more. The direction which was made by Cate Shortland was good and she did a nice job on the way she presented the story behind Natasha Romanoff. The interpretations of both Scarlett Johansson who played as Natasha Romanoff and Florence Pugh who played as Yelena Belova were very good and their combination worked very well too. Rachel Weisz who played as Melina and David Harbour who played as Alexei gave a different touch in the movie and also helped to the evolution of the main characters. To sum up, I have to say that if you are a fan of Marvel then I am definitely sure that you will love ""Black Widow"" but even if you are not this movie is a good opportunity for you to become.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

No complaints with the casting choice, except for Ray Winstone. He looked like a chunkier version Geoffrey Rush. I think Rush would've made the character much more interesting. Props to Florence Pugh and David Harbour for standing out. Harbour, IMO, stole every scene he was in!

"6","/10","Entertaining but unnecessary","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7121415/?ref_=tt_urv","eddieruks","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132810519/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2021","Black Widow is finally out. In 2021. But I strongly believe that it should have been released somewhere between 2010 and 2012, which then makes me ask myself, why? What was the point of this movie? We already know how Black Widow goes out in Endgame, so there was little to no tension as to the fate of the character. I am not sure how this movie will ultimately build up into a much larger phase 4 of the marvel universe, but I guess we just wait and see. There are some ideas here and there and some few things they might do in the future, but generally, this movie can be easily scrapped out and nothing will lack in the grand scale of the universe. But I am getting ahead of myself.I know I sound so negative towards the movie but I actually enjoyed it. I found it entertaining and at no point did I switch my mind off from it. It has good things going on for it, but it has its flaws, flaws that too big to ignore and to some extent, have affected my overall rating of the film. Before I begin though, there are some things I would like to put across first. There are two ways to look at this movie, as a spy action film and as a marvel movie. This review will focus on the latter because that's what the movie was made to be, a marvel movie. And probably because it would fail hilariously as an actual spy movie. Another thing is that I have watched this movie only twice and so, maybe in future some of my opinions may change. Lastly, this review is only my opinion and what I thought about the movie on a personal note, so feel free to disagree.To start off, I will go through some of the positives. The acting was solid in this movie. Scarlet Johansson is Black Widow the way we know Black Widow. She plays the role to perfection like she always has. Florence Pugh is brilliant as Yelena. In the hands of another actress, the character may have easily come out as cocky and annoying, but Florence handles it perfectly well, and the character is actually likable. But the highlight is David Harbour's Alexei. This guy steals the show, literally in every scene he is in. He is what you might say is the comic relief of the movie, but has a decent amount of story that he does not feel shoehorned into the movie.Another thing I respect this movie for is that it does not pander to a certain demography of people. Despite the lead roles being females, the movie does not feel like it is entitled and it actually worked very in portrayal of the main characters as human being and not instruments of agenda. Unlike other recent pieces of media like Ghostbusters (2016), the Batwoman TV show and Captain Marvel.However, the biggest positive I saw in this movie was the action scenes. I really loved the action sequences. The fights were well choreographed, despite the obviously noticeable stunt doubles. Those scenes were the most engaging scenes in the movie for me. The action scenes were well done and it felt like a marvel movie, in a positive way. I wish to also add that this film is also technically brilliant and it looks impressive. The score of the movie is also solid.Oh, and before I forget, this might be minor, but I really loved the post credit scene. That's the much I can say about it without spoiling any if it. But I really loved it and I am waiting to see how they advance with that certain plotline.Now we go to the negatives, which unfortunately are more that there were positives.First, I didn't like the setting of the movie. This movie is set after the events of Captain America: Civil War and before the events of Infinity War. But maybe I missed something in the marketing, but I was expecting a story that took place before Natasha joined the Avengers of even SHIELD. So how weird it was to see one of the original Avengers getting a solo movie after we got a couple of ensemble movies. And to make the matters worse, we already know that Black Widow dies in endgame, making this movie just a product of fan demands. Another thing is that, by playing around with the timeline, a lot of things don't make sense. Like I said earlier, the movie would have been better if it came out in phase 1 of marvel films. As it stands, there are some plot holes. For instance, all the destruction that supposedly takes place in this movie will reasonably attract a lot of attention from the world or at least the Avengers or even SHIELD. And you would expect for such things to be mentioned in Infinity War. Well, that is if there was a plan, but we now all know that this movie was just a mere afterthought. Another thing is, where was Tony Stark? I mean, Natasha chose to fight for Tony's side in Civil War, so you would expect that he would be there for her when she needed him too, but too bad RDJ has no more contracts with marvel. Last but not least, I remember the ending of civil war, just right about the time Tony was reading Steve's letter, he was notified that the imprisoned avengers were escaping and then we saw Steve Rogers in the facilities where they were being held, suggesting that he was the one orchestrating the operation. But at the end of Black Widow, she says that she has to head and break out the other Avengers from prison. So, who did what? Was it Steve or Natasha? Or both? I get that this movie explains how they got the aircraft they had, and maybe they did it together, but it all feels forced. It didn't feel planned and even if you watch this movie immediately after Civil War, it still wouldn't make sense. Even more the reason I felt like this movie was an unnecessary entry in the franchise. I am sure there would be a lot more inconsistencies if carefully examined, but you get the point.The other thing I didn't like about this movie was the protagonist. Don't get me wrong, Johansson does a really good job with what she had, but the character of Black Widow has some flaws when it comes to the writing. First, I don't know if it is only me, what made Black Widow so cool was the mystery that was the person. We didn't know who she was, where she came from, how she got all the skills she has and what her personal motivations were. She was more of the person who got things done and she was such a badass. I had even thought that Natasha Romanov was her alias and not her real name. So, a movie like this may decide to go one of two ways. Either keep Black Widow a mystery that she was, or explore her origins. If you choose the latter, you should go all the way and explore the depths of the character. This movie seems to linger in between. It attempts to explore the origins but does not give enough depth, which ended up making me feel empty. The movie is somewhere between being an origin and being an action adventure and unfortunately it does not give enough of both. There were a lot of good ideas that were unfortunately not well developed. For instance, I would have loved to see the dynamics between the Red Room and SHIELD. Also, this was a movie where Nick Fury would have perfectly fitted. There is also a lot of mention of a past mission between Black Widow and Hawkeye whose outcome played a huge role in the plot of this film. I honestly would have preferred to see that movie instead of what we got here. The Hungarian mission would have made a perfect adventure movie. Another thing is that the movie establishes huge world changing stakes, the plot with all the widows, that I couldn't help but think that this mission would have been something for the entire Avengers team and not just one character, especially not this late in the franchise.Still on the point of the protagonist, the main character felt shallow. There was no personal motivation, no personal driving force for her to undertake the task like she did and the character does not change. She is the same when the movie ends as she was when the movie began. She doesn't learn or unlearn anything and this was a letdown. Let's compare to the other solo movies for the original avengers. Tony in Iron Man had to deal with the fact that his own weapons were being used for war and destruction mostly among innocent people, Steve Rogers in Captain America was all about standing up against bullies, Thor learnt how to be noble and worthy and even Bruce in the Incredible Hulk had to learn to control the monster inside which he did by the end of the movie. Then we have Black Widow, who ends up being the same as she was in the other previous movies.The next problem I had with this movie is the antagonist. The main antagonist is barely existent save for the third act. They say a movie is as good as its villain. Well, we don't see the villain until late in the film. This is detrimental as there is no sense of conflict in the movie. They attempt to fit in a lot of interaction between the hero and the villain in their brief encounter towards the end but it doesn't make up for his absence throughout the entire film. There is however, Taskmaster. I hear this villain has a lot of depth in the comics and is widely criticized for being disappointing in this film. I am not well familiar with the Taskmaster in the comics, so for me, I felt like she was a tool to keep the plot moving. Its like a programmed robot chasing our main characters around. It's a spectacle to see the fight scenes involving the Taskmaster, but that is it. She adds nothing else to the movie and actually doesn't even cause any real damage. She had no development at all and therefore I ended up not caring.Another issue I had with the film is that in lacked some originality. To me, the final battle was too similar to the final battle of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Even the relationship between Steve and Bucky in Captain America was too similar to Natasha and Antonia in Black Widow. Not only the final scene but the entire movie gave the Winter Soldier vibes and that is not all good despite The Winter Soldier being one of the best marvel movies. I felt like this movie didn't have an identity to stand on its own.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was like placing apples instead of pineapples on hawaiian pizza (though not everyone likes pineapples on their pizza). But seriously, if I were to choose who should have don the Taskmaster costume - it would be the long lost brother of Natasha Romanoff - I mean the story was all about family and the backstory of the Natasha - then why not make someone from her unknown past join into the MCU. In the comics Natasha had a brother named Vindiktor Romanov (it would definitely be an exciting story to know more about this storyline).The movie could have Vindiktor transformed into the Taskmaster by Dreykov as part of his revenge to Natasha for killing his daughter back in Budapest (with all of the brain washing experiments the red room has - this would be an interesting story to venture on). Yelena's story won't be sidelined to the story as she is the sister Natasha have grown to know with - thus making a sibling competition going into the story.The ending would even be interesting as Natasha finds out who the Taskmaster is (thanks to Dreykov), they fight in the end and Taskmaster dies at the hands of Natasha - or did he? - this will make a new story as a future villain for Yelena's Widow character or even better as a team partner in the future Thunderbolts team - the character of Taskmaster would have not gone into waste by poor storytelling for Dreykov's revenge. Natasha still dies in the Infinity War, Yelena becomes the new Black Widow, and Vindiktor (or maybe just rename him as Viktor) resurfaces with the Taskmaster character in the future MCU story.Yes the movie was good - but seems rushed and was not fully intended for Natasha's backstory but simply to introduce Yelena into the MCU. It could have been better with Nat's biological brother as the Taskmaster - but MCU missed this chance.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The interpersonal relationships are some of the most compelling and raw that Marvel has produced and had me drawn to the screen for the first two acts. Black Widow and her extremely dysfunctional family are incredibly engaging and the actors do a good job bouncing off of each other. Unfortunately, a movie that would have benefited from a smaller scale is hurt by the studios need to have big stakes and thus the third act turns into a real mess as all the well done character work takes a back seat to action that is at times hard to follow and mess. It can also be riveting, as one fight scene showed. As well, a few good character moments are undercut by Marvel's continuous need to add in humor because they think the same joke told 50 times is still funny. As well, the main villain isn't too captivating and his main minion suffers from the same lack of personality that the Winter Soldier had. The CGI at the end also looks really dodge and hurts the movie. And finally, this movie should have come out years ago, not after this character was already gone. Now, all that being said, this is still fun and humorous movie that is brimming with good character work it's first two acts and the last act is merely mediocre. It's a good movie that could have been more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

genre have been crying out for ages, for her MCU character, Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, to do.And Black Widow does not disappoint. I've just purchased the 4K Blu-ray steel-book edition,
and the overall production values; set & costume design of the action sequences
(as expected from an MCU movie), are all top-notch.Black Widow is a most enjoyable spy-thriller-fantasy-romp.Made even more the enjoyable by several standout performances by obviously,
Scarlett Johansson - herself, but also, Florence Pugh and David Harbour,
are both absolutely terrific.And in spite of the most recent furore and controversy surrounding Scarlett & the Disney
corporation. What I really liked the most about this Black Widow movie is the many
levels of representation. Something which Kevin Feige/Disney/the MCU are finally
catching up to speed on. Especially since, several of the other streaming networks,
as well as, other film studios are all going to great lengths to readdress now.After all, there is only so many ""White orientated Male saviour films & tv shows""
that the global international market, can actually stomach.So Black Widow manages (quite successfully) to represent it's excellent female
lead characters as strong and intelligent women. And not everything has to
fall under the often creepy and pervy stereotype of the male gaze.Of course Black Widow will not be something that's best suited for everybody's liking.But what I really appreciated the most here, is the fact that, even if it is several year's
too late (this movie should have been made 5 or 6yrs ago), finally we've got
the kind of send-off, that, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow more than deserved.My only gripes are mainly to do with the fact that, Ray Winstone/Dreykov, was
unfortunately totally miscast as a villain. Mind you, the MCU, has a whole back
history of casting some very weak, extremely poor villains.And yes. Black Widow is a solid 8-out-of-10 movie.One cannot help but notice that, any movie that has been simultaneously released
via Disney+ premiere access, has also received several negative reviews.Anytime some people have to pay extra to watch something, then they
feel the need to vehemently complain and whinge about it.However a prime example of just how so many angry negative reviewers get
so easily triggered is, the superb animated movie, 'Raya and the Last Dragon'.Which is actually an outstanding work of art. And 'Raya' has since
been very highly praised.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I hope you're all doing great and watching outstanding movies and reading amazing books.So, recently Marvel's most awaited movie Black Widow released on the 9th July on Disney Plus and in theatres and as a self-certified Marvel geek I was too damn excited about this movie as it has been delaying for like a year, so it was the time for this movie to bust in, but to be honest it didn't meet my expectations. I was expecting something good and emotional. I'm not saying that there wasn't any action sequence, there was, but it felt like pushed-action. There wasn't for any need for that type of action.Back story wasn't that good either, I was expecting to feel connected with Nat's back story but that thing never happened. The story building wasn't good, the storyline felt a little boring, the action sequence wasn't that great. The only thing that I loved about the movie was Yelena. She was the only character in the movie that had some funny and humorous elements.So, for me this movie was a biggest disappointment. Well before this movie I only hated Thor: The dark world in the MCU but now I have my second most disappointed movie ever, i.e. Black Widow.For all my Marvel fans out there, this movie is not really the part of the MCU (according to me it was just a tribute to Black Widow's character and Scarlett Johansson) and if you are skipping it, then it's not much of a big deal, but you shouldn't miss the end credit scene as it's directly connected to Flacon and the winter soldier series and it will directly relate to Clint Barton aka Hawkeye in the upcoming Hawkeye series.So, that was all about this movie. If you want to watch it, then rock it on and if you're struggling with your work, then I'll recommend you shouldn't waste your precious time in this movie.To summarize, if you have time then watch it and if you don't, then it's better to skip it.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Honestly, I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure why there was so much hate.Sure, it didn't feel like a typical Marvel movie. There wasn't nearly the amount of superpowered action that we've gotten used to. It felt much more slow-paced and introspective. I supposed, then, I can see why it wasn't maybe what people were expecting.I thought that the movie feeling very different actually really aided it. It felt much less like a superhero movie and more like a fun and entertaining spy-thriller. The action was exciting and entertaining, and aesthetically it was very enjoyable as well. And I think the longer periods of introspection and thoughtfulness were a nice change from the usual breakneck pace of Marvel movies.It dealt with themes of family, both who you were raised with and found family. I loved how, instead of building up this super long, detailed explicit backstory for Black Widow and Yelena, we had to figure a lot of stuff out from just context clues. Sure, there was the intro scene (which I thought was very well written and fittingly confusing) but other than that we were left to fill in the gaps to imagine what exactly happened to Natasha and co. After that opening scene.Overall, what I really liked about this film was that it trusts its audience. Instead of having a whole lot of exposition and backstory, we are instead forced to consider what we know about the MCU and Natasha to fill in the plot. In reality, this story is the climax of a long story that has been Natasha's whole life.It was definitely a little slow in places. And of course, the villain was not that interesting. That's true of most MCU movies, though, so it's to be expected. At least they did a good job of making him more loathsome and hateable than some other Marvel villains.Ultimately, I am excited for where this movie takes the MCU. I hope to see more of these characters in the future.(this is more like a 7.5 for me but I rounded up)","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Have looked forward to seeing this. Unfortunately it does not live up to the hyped-up expectations. The set-up is long and drawn out in a protracted opening where nothing happens until an explosion and a fight over the 'magic potion McGuffin'.The strongest feature of the movie is the introduction of Florence Pugh as the pseudo-sister. Pugh's poking at Widow is relentless especially with the running 'poser' gag, 'cool way to die' etc. The dynamic between Johansson and Pugh works well, but the dysfunctional pretend family is strained and unnatural. Ray Winstone is cast as Ray Winstone with a terrible Russian accent and is absent throughout. Don't get me started on the pheromones nonsense, although Widow's solution to this is hilarious.Sad-to-say this is a travesty of what could and should have been a fabulous movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's good! Go see it. Action out the yin yang, humor, family drama and it even has room for a rug pull or two. Marvel is back, baby!The Boring and Pretentious ReviewIt's been a while, huh? The 'rona put the brakes on Marvel's Phase 4 designs and it's taken more than a year to get back on track. Damn you, 'ronaaaaaaaaa! Was it worth the wait? Well that depends on your own perso-oh the hell with it, hell yeah it was worth the wait! Black Widow comes roaring into theaters this month to remind us what makes Marvel movies so damn fun and, boy, has it been about damn time.Ostensibly an origin story, this functions more as an expansion of Natasha Romanov, aka the Black Widow character history but the operating word here is action, action and dare I say it, even more action.Not quite a sequel, not a quite prequel (a midquel?) the film is set immediately after the events of Captain America: Civil War but follows more closely The Winter Soldier both in style and tone and could well serve as that film's spiritual successor. Like in Winter Soldier, director Cate Shortland and writers have opted for a cold war era style spy thriller. Don't worry if you haven't the director's name before, I hadn't either. After this she will become a household name joining the likes of Patty Jenkins from Wonder Woman giving the boys' a run for their money in directing comic book movies. And she ain't the only one. The ladies are running the show here with Florence Pugh and Rachel Weisz joining Johansson and a stellar cast that includes David Barbour (Hopper from Stranger Things) and Ray Winston, just in case you thought this was merely a filler film until the heavyweights arrive later in the year. This Widow is punching well above her weight class.Johansson always dominated her MCU scenes with Cap and the Avengers and here she is given chance to flesh out her character. But the entire cast displays a strong showing with Pugh, Weisz and Barbour in particular clearly enjoying themselves. They do such a great job it would be a shame if Marvel and The Mouse don't keep using these characters in the future.The film opens with a wholesome scene of Americana before cleverly setting up its spy thriller conceit that extends right into the opening credits. The action hijinks start early and they are frantic and non-stop with fight scenes that look choreographed by somebody that studied their Jason Borne well. Fights that feel desperate and immediate and make use of whatever household items happen to be around in order to subdue or kill an opponent. Violent gun fights, car chases, martial arts, it's all here.But besides all of that, Marvel's genius continues to be in the menacing villains it continues to come up with to antagonize the heroes. In The Taskmaster, they have another memorable one, a fighting power house that can imitate anybody's fighting style just by looking at them. The scenes featuring him are some of the best in the whole movie.To be fair, the film is not without its flaws. The plot gets a little convoluted at times and some of the action seem over-the-top compared to the tight groundedness of The Winter Soldier. And depending on your taste, its denouement will come across as trite but these are minor quibbles for a film that was such fun getting you there. A self-aware, action packed Marvel flick with maybe more than a hint of #metoo commentary, this injects a rejuvenating shot into a character that was by all means supposed to have been over and done with. Can't wait to see what else Marvel has in store. And of course, don't forget about that after credits scene!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They dont showcase much on the street level heroes, so having Widow her on time in the big screen, is a must see for me. Street level heroes tend to be more realistic from all usual the power blasting fantasy like with Punisher and Daredevil. My expectation is the story and action sequences should be similar to Winter Soldier. Applying the same street level formula of the MCU.So I thought.Well, for the action scenes, it was as I suspected, and that ride in Budapest was for the books! But the latter part or finale, it was so so. Storywise, I wish they could have dig deeper to her time as an assassin and the red room. Darker, given she's an assassin. Felt more like a family spy movie, Spy kids anyone? It's a let down. Making this your one of the few non-epicn mcu movies.P. S. What's the deal with Taskmaster, is she like an evil Capt? There are a lot of weapons out there you know. Forget that tiny shield. LOL.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The score by Lorne Balfe (Lego Batman Movie) is unexpectedly haunting as well as wonderfully Marvel-esque 😁 and the use of American Pie by Don McLean is put to great emotional use in the family storyline at the centre of the movie. This integral storyline spearheaded by Johannson, Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz is performed so sweetly and directed greatly by Cate Shortland (Berlin Syndrome).The details of the Widows' indoctrination early in life are extremely dark but the film balances gritty realism and superhero adventure with mixed results. The antagonism is genuinely violent and menacing (led by Ray Winstone) making the threat to our titular hero all the more real and I was invested in the character we all know and love for the most part. However, the first half is pretty slow with too much uninteresting filler; the film could easily have had 30 minutes cut out which would've made it more impactful as a whole. But with emotional heft for all Marvel fans, an exciting last half and great performances all round, this is worth the watch 😊 stay seated for the awesome post credit scene too!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can't say I had particularly high expectations, nor can I say I was particularly disappointed. At the end of the day it's still a Marvel movie, and even the worst of them are hugely enjoyable experiences. Thankfully Black Widow, despite its problems, doesn't hit too close to the likes of Iron Man 3. It's still a thoroughly entertaining movie full of thrilling action, hilarious comedy (especially if you like Marvel's style), enthralling characters, fantastic performances, and reasonably dark subtext. In some ways it feels like a Phase 2 movie, but in others you can tell they're starting to attempt new things. I'm not familiar with Cate Shortland, but it's clear to see where her input ended and the Marvel machine's second unit took over, and her slower moments were absolutely the film's strongest points. The over-reliance on CGI and superhuman physics meant that as entertaining as the action was, it was just more generic Marvel affair that had no real consideration for characters' power levels or fighting styles (Taskmaster is all about mirroring moves, and yet we don't see any of this actually on display, for instance). I give Black Widow a very conflicted 7/10, with a high chance of it falling as it gets rewatched.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Excellent CGI/Effects, Good and funny dialogue, Great Actors, Great Story, Soundtrack and a 2,5 hour movie that feels like a 1 hour movie because you love every second and the time goes by so fast.This movie is all of this, - but in the bad way.The dialogue is horrible. I mean come on. What did the writers think when they wrote this?I was shocked, because I love the funny but still honest kind of dialogue in marvel movies. But in this movie, the dialogue was not only just unfunny, but it was so cringe, that you couldn't even believe what they said. I've never seen something that bad and I am very sorry to say that about a marvel movie.The story is also really weird. I wouldn't call it bad, but I, personally, just didn't like it. Nothing really lead up and everything was kind of not fitting to the rest. I also felt like they tried too hard to make this a ""women power"" movie. Also: A big bad man who controls many women until they are set free? Did they want to make this a political statement? I am not sure and I did not like it.The actors picked for this movie... I don't know. Maybe it was the dialogue that ruined their honesty for me, but I am not buying their acting/roles.Music decision was also very cringe. They kind of tried to pick music that would've been in an Iron Man movie, but it just didn't fit.This movie also felt like it would never end.And the most shocking thing is the CGI/effects at the end of the movie. What the heck are you doing Marvel???? Marvel movies always had the best CGI on the market, but in the last 10 minutes of this movie.... jesus christ. If you want to know what I am talking about, just look at the scenes where Black Widow jumps out of the window and all the scenes where you can see her floating in the air (without her face shown). The lightning on her suit... did the internships do the effects of the last minutes or did you guys drink something???Never watching this movie again. This movie should just be forgotten. This is the first Marvel movie I am not watching a second time. (And I've watched all of them 6 times already, because they were so good.)","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a very average spy movie, it goes back to a generic boring villain similar to what we saw in early MCU films and it's an average boring one even for a spy movie.

So you should know that I'm not the number one Black Widow fan and so does the majority of people because she has never been introduced as a main character on the silver screen before.So if this was not an MCU movie, I wouldn't watch itBut let put that beside and let's talk cinema.The action was lousy, and I blame whoever put Cate Shortland in this project, she has never made action movies before and that's her first time to be on a blockbuster movie, and unfortunately, she failed to give us a single good action sequence.There's a scene, Scarlett Johansson's stunt double face is fully clear and much more stupid things.Editing was trying to hide the actresses' laziness and the director's lack of experience by fast cutting the scenes to hide stunt doubles faces but that made the action sequences experience even worse, I almost had a headache.The movie's CGI is cheap, it really can harm your eyes, in 2021 and they did that how come? Hands down it's one of the worst.I saw a lot of people talking about Florence Pugh's performance, and that surprised me, not if she was bad or something but you guys saw better performance than David Harbour's? He stole the show
He's the best thing in the movie, his comedy scenes killed me, honestly without him I'd rate the movie 4/10
Scarlett Johansson's performance is Scarlett doing Black Widow, not Scarlett doing Nicole from ""Marriage Story"": A lot of superhero poses and 0% effort of doing action scenes without a stunt double.Rachel Weisz's performance was just meh.In any movie -especially a superhero one- I'd love to see a good villain like Thanos or Loki and so on.In this movie, I saw a bad-written one, he has absolutely no motive for his actions, I know he's a metaphor for masculinity and how a lot of men shutting females' mouths and control their actions, but the metaphor wasn't enough, I wished for more, I wished for a better character with real motive.In the end, it's not a bad movie, but it shall have been a better one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At the time of writing, it's the newest entry in the MCU, but feels like one that should have been made 5 years ago. It's a spy thriller, but with twists and turns that can be seen from a mile away. It's meant to finally put the spotlight on Johansson's Black Widow, but her character takes a back seat whenever Florence Pugh or David Harbour come on screen...Unfortunately there's not much to offer here in terms of story, thanks in large part to the fact that we know how Natasha's journey plays out in previous films. After the exciting prologue, the 1st act of the movie is a bit forgettable and what happens in the 2nd and 3rd doesn't feel like it has much impact. We're told how bad the bad guy is, but the writers never provide a sense of urgency or give the audience a demonstration of why he needs to be stopped (aside from, you know, him being a bad guy). On top of that, and without spoilers, the most interesting nugget of story is handled as contextual dialogue between two characters, where this particular beat would have been great to actually see on screen. With all this in mind, by the end it left me feeling like there was so much wasted potential here for a truly great spy thriller.Speaking of ""thrills"", it's not an MCU movie without big 'ol action scenes. The best set pieces here, came in the form of impressively choreographed, Bourne-inspired, ""street level"" brawls. They felt hard hitting (pun intended) and visceral. Ironically though, the bigger the scope gets later in the film, the less impressed I was. A demonstration that more doesn't always equal better.Aside from the wanting plot, twists and 'splosions, the movie succeeds in its characterisation, particularly with MCU newcomers, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) and Alexei (David Harbour). These two steal the show and provide a much needed boost of energy and heart to an otherwise artificial experience. That's not to say Scar Jo doesn't bring her A-game: she goes above and beyond what she was given to work with, but at times it feels like an injustice that her character is written as the one to reel in the more quirky and exciting characters, and always in control of the situation - never quite letting the audience buy into any kind of ""struggle"" the protagonist is facing.All in all, the ""quieter"" moments in between set pieces is really where the movie shines and entertains the most. The MCU always succeeds in making us excited for what comes next, which is definitely the case here with some of the new characters introduced. I just wish we were given a bit more to chew on with this outing, especially considering how long audiences have been waiting to see it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

-After 2 years, we finally got a new MCU movie and overall it's a good movie. It has its flaws and it didn't meet my expectations. Mostly it works and it feels like something that Disney produced and that could be even a good or a bad thing.-The strongest positive of the movie it's the cast. I think the chemistry everyone had was excellent. It seemed that you've seen them interact before. By far Florence Pugh was the best one (I might have fallen in love with her). This is something that Disney does most of the time. Hire good actors that will have a good relationship with the fans in the future. Not only the chemistry, the acting was truly good. Better than in some other MCU movies.-Most of the characters are pretty good. I loved Yelena and Alexei. They were extremely funny and didn't feel forced. I'm truly hyped to see more of Yelena in the future. The rest of the characters were good. I would've liked to see more from Melina and even Natasha. I didn't feel closure for Natahsa's character and all she represented for the MCU in previous movies.-The action is excellent. There is no doubt that action scenes in Marvel have been improving with the years to a point that they became this epic and badass. The incredible action is thanks to beautiful visual effects. I didn't see many scenes where the CGI failed. It felt like a John Wick movie but with even more fantastic and unreal action which I love.-I loved the tone of the movie. A mystery and spy movie about Natasha escaping which connects with her past and a vengeance to be completed and allows us to meet new characters from her story. Characters that we'll see in the future and will be filling the hole that the ending of Scarlett's character left on a lot of fans. Something I liked was the way they connect it with movies like Civil War without feeling forced or the introduction of new characters without feeling like they could and should have appeared before.-I liked the comedy of the movie. I had an actual laugh at some parts of the movie. Let's say that only 15% of the jokes felt forced. Florence Pugh was G. O. A. T. I loved his character and his performance. She made me laugh a lot and without her this movie would easily be a 5 out of 10.-The post credit scene was the best part of the movie. It connects with other Disney shows and it opens a world of possibilities. I really want to see how it'll be handled and what direction will be taken.-I really liked Lorne Balfe's soundtrack. I loved him in M. I. Fallout and he killed it for Black Widow.Negatives
-Black Widow is not even close to being perfect. It has a lot of flaws that are common in most MCU movies.-My biggest problem with the movie is the villain. Dreykov reminds me of the first MCU villains. Generic, boring, uninteresting, stupid and normal. I didn't like him at all and it's probably because it's a vengeance story which it's truly personal for Natasha's character but I just got to know this important part of her life. Plus the villain appears for no more than 15 minutes. Also Taskmaster was amazingly wasted. Why couldn't they go with the original story of Tony Masters and use him in the future to fight other heroes, because I don't see this character fighting Spiderman. This Taskmaster has no personality and lacks one of his best things which is his narcissism and his pride. He was pretty menacing until the ""big reveal"".-It was pretty predictable and the plot twists were meh. The only two I liked were the post credit scene and one more but the rest were unnecessary and too elaborated.-I keep thinking that this movie should've been made and presented before Infinity War. Knowing how the character's future ends makes you not worry about her and just focus on the rest.-A few plot holes that luckily weren't important.Conclusion
I really liked Black Widow. I think it's a product that works and is successful in what they want, which is to introduce you to new characters that will participate in the future and will have a bigger role. The action was excellent and the style of the movie making it seem like a Jason Bourne movie was pretty good. The cast did a great job and I would love to see them again in the future. It fails in the villain aspect but at least that wasn't the focus. There is a villain because it's a superhero movie. And then there are the normal errors like some plot holes and how predictable it is. It's a movie that I recommend but I would say that if you are a true fan of Natasha you should watch it with low expectations because if not, you could dislike how the spotlight was focussed to the other characters. I would say that Black Widow is a John Wick movie with steroids.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I missed the chance as I don't necessarily prioritize comic book ones anymore. I'm a fan of Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour. Also seeing that this had Ray Winstone, Violet McGraw, William Hurt and Olga Kurylenko made this more intriguing.We start this in the past. We see Natasha Romanoff as a girl with her sister Yelena, her mother Melina (Weisz) and father of Alexei (Harbour). They live in Ohio in what seems to be a normal family. They are spying though. The girls don't know it. Once they complete their mission, they go back to Russia.From there, we get a montage seeing how Natasha was trained to become Black Widow before defecting and becoming an Avenger. Yelena is now an assassin like Natasha. She is portrayed by Pugh. She goes to kill her target who is Oksana (Michelle Lee) and a gas is released. This frees Yelena from the mind control that was done to make her into what she is.The villain here is Taskmaster. They are after this serum which is in the possession of Yelena. She goes to Natasha for help. The target is Dreykov (Winstone) who is supposed to be dead. Natasha will need to reconnect with those from her past to figure out who or what is behind this villain who seems to know all their moves before they do.That should recap what I need from the movie and where I want to start is that this feels in the vein of the Captain America movies. Part of that is Natasha working so closely with that character. This movie takes heavy themes as well. There first is the geo-political ideas of espionage and having sleeper cells in the United States. There is also the horrible crimes of human trafficking. The only positive is that they're not using them for sex work from what I could tell. That isn't to say there isn't horrible things being done to them.This also features good acting. Johansson does so well in this role and just owns it for me. I liked seeing Pugh even though they don't give her a lot to work with. I'm glad she got the paycheck though. Weisz and Harbour are fine as well. McGraw gets a nice cameo as the younger Yelena. We also get an appearance from Hurt who is solid. I also liked the roles from Winstone, Kurylenko and even Ryan Kiera Armstrong who has a cameo as well. The acting is fine for what is needed here.What we get here is solid. I think this tries to tackle heavier issues than it can. It is well made. It does use CGI, but I come to expect that. It isn't as heavy others from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This just feels a bit out of place. This one is more grounded and feels like they're trying to cash into a group that doesn't love superhero movies. The problem is that those people will turn up their nose to a movie like this. Still worth a watch if you want to complete the series. Can also be watched on its own as well.My Rating: 6 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even more pointless to watch this failed attempt at a movie. There's action but no real story. Conflict, but no emotion, save for the occasional attempt at comedy. Captain America, The First Avenger had everything you'd want...characters you coiuld care for and a story you could understand. In my mind, the series has gone steadily downhill ever since. I'd find it more watchable if there were a limit to the number of characters. I wish they'd stick to basic values and emotions.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

One of the bigger problems that seem consistent across all Marvel Studios productions, is how they add humor inappropriately during points of the film where it tries to deal with serious topics. In Black Widow, a saving grace is that the comedy was fairly enjoyable.Black Widow also suffers from Marvel Studios' villain problem, where its primary antagonists are barely characters and more so plot points that exist for a conflict to occur. We learn very little about Natasha's rivals and they ultimately felt like unnecessary and uninteresting additions to the MCU.The best aspect of the film to me was the cast. Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Natasha Romanoff and does an excellent job in the role as usual. Joining her are Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour who make up the most enjoyable and heartfelt moments in the film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

To a certain extent that may be true, but there is no doubt that Johansen holds her own throughout. Pugh plays Natashia's ""Sister"" - at least for several years they were raised together with a Mom and a Dad, the opening scene is in a cofy surburban home in Ohio. Things descend quickly and we pick up the ""sisters,"" long seperated, many years later. Lots of action, as to be expected from a marvel film, and do hang aroud for the tag after the credits, which lets us know there is another film in the works.

As if it should have been at the beginning of 'Avengers Assemble' (2012) to show Black Widow's origins as they had with the other characters, instead of lumped on at the end of the ""Infinity Stone"" story arc with no real purpose.And it still seemed like they didn't have faith in her on her own and I don't know why, because they made that terrible 'Captain Marvel' (2019) film and Widow is a much more interesting and likeable character, played by a much better actress, as well as an established character with history to build on (I know that there is a catalogue of comics with information too).However, in this film, for some reason, the producers felt the need for this strong independent woman, famous for working best on her own and renowned on film, so far, for her singular past, to be furnished with a family.As such it didn't really feel like it was her own origin story as much as a ""What I did on my holidays"" essay to explain what she got up to while she was on the run after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016).In fact, all they did was refer to ""The Avengers"" all the time, suggesting to us that she was nothing without a team behind her. It wasn't their film!It might have actually worked better if she was sending a message to Steve Rogers to get her actions off of her chest, if only they were worth talking about. Just at the start or the end to indicate where it stood in the timeline more clearly and get the ""Avengers"" part out of the way.If there had been more about her origins it would have been good too, as that was all very quickly swept over. That's what the fans all wanted to see anyway from this film, but it was a bit half hearted.Instead, we got a filler film with only hints of her past, as a way to introduce new characters and set up the 'Hawkeye' (2022) series and a potential replacement for her in future Avengers productions.If it hadn't been a film about an existing character and hadn't been set in the Marvel universe that we have already invested in, it might have been a good film in its own right, like a 'Bourne Identity' (2002) or something but as a follow up to 'Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame' (2018/19) it fell quite flat.That is to say that it IS a good film, but it just doesn't have the wow that Scarlett as The Widow or the fans deserved or enough oomph to come after the other much more epic adventure.I actually rate Scarlett really highly and think that she is underrated along with her character. Let's hope that they find a way to bring her back in future instalments and give her a script worthy of her excellence.As for the supporting actors, I found them acceptable, but not outstanding.I usually love Rachel Weisz, but found her a bit flat too and Ray's accent was patchy at best and I can only imagine that they used David Harbour to try and bring in the 'Stranger Things' audience. He was a bit too comedic for me and unnecessarily so, like 'Fat Thor' in Endgame.It's definitely watchable and my comments are harsh, but we have come to expect better from Marvel, it's not DC after all. I hope this isn't an example of what Disney is going to do with the franchise going forward.615.22/1000.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Of course, a decent script and plenty of mind-blowing action also helps and I'm glad to say that Black Widow delivers both a strong story and lots of incredible, special effects packed set-pieces. For those not overly familiar with every entry in the MCU, the film might prove a little confusing at first, but it all eventually slots into place and ultimately proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster comic-book adventure.As children, Natasha and Yelena are part of a Russian sleeper cell based in Ohio, their 'father' Alexei (David Harbour) and 'mother' Melina (Rachel Weisz) working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone), who oversees the Red Room academy where young girls are trained to be assassins: Black Widows. After completing their mission, the family escape the U. S. and the girls are sent to Dreykov for training. Twenty-one years later, Natasha (Johansson) has defected to America to become a member of the Avengers, and is now on the run as a fugitive (can't remember why); meanwhile, Yelena (Pugh) is still working as a killer, under the influence of a powerful mind control serum. When she inhales an antidote and regains her free will, Yelena contacts her 'sister' and together they endeavour to kill Dreykov and destroy the Red Room, all the while avoiding deadly killing machine Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko).I don't know who Cate Shortland is, or how she got this plum directing gig (there's nothing in her resumé to suggest that she could handle a movie of this type), but she does a surprisingly good job, combining action, comedy, and drama to good effect, with a decent pace sustained throughout the two-and-a-quarter hour runtime. The performances are solid (although Winstone's Russian accent occasionally slips), with particularly good turns from Pugh (who makes amends for Midsommar) and Harbour (who provides much of the humour), the fight choreography and CGI is very impressive, and, perhaps most importantly, the film is a whole lot of fun, from the white-knuckle opening scene to the spectacular explosive final act.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Cate Shortland and Eric Pearson put together an MCU installment that doesn't really compare to any of the other origin flicks, profoundly examining the protagonist's dark past and her complex ""family"" through distinctly compelling storytelling. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time, interpreting the most impactful role of her career, but Florence Pugh comes close to stealing the spotlight by giving an absolutely phenomenal display. Boasting highly entertaining, mostly well-filmed action sequences, the main narrative follows a path with no surprises, as well as a generic villain, but the emotionally investing storylines regarding Natasha's personal motivations and Yelena's complex feelings keep the film remarkably captivating. The ending is as satisfying as I could have ever wished for.

It should have been better. They wasted such a great villain (those who read the comics may know). The character of Dreykov was plain and boring. Atleast after doing all this he could have been interesting. Don't get me wrong I didn't wanted a all powerful supervillain, I just wanted a better villain just like zemo.

This felt more of like a ""Lunch-Time"" movie, than a Friday-Night movie. And by that I mean it's one you don't plan your evening around. But one you sit to watch while you munch-down just to not stare at the wall.Not to say it's bad. If you've read most Marvel comic books, then this is like one of many average side stories they make throughout the year. A good comparison would be the ""prelude"" comics they make for the movies. People can just ignore them and they would be fine! Or they can read them, and still feel unprepared and unimpressed. Specially considering the weird time it was released in (both in reality, and in the context of the MCU).Nevertheless, it has great choreographies, and good portrayal of character emotions (both Scarlett and Florence are very good on their roles, at least when they are actually acting and talking). The premise is a bit overblown, and dumb at times. It also feels structurally weird for a movie! Some things aren't paid off enough and just are. Though it lacks in importance (like Captain Marvel did) and doesn't build anything on top of what we already have (specially not for Natasha). You could skip it without issues.I'm also not a fan of the treatment the Ghost character received in Ant-Man 2. Sadly, Task Master is adapted similarly. Relegated to the side, and lacking in development. Personally, I had expectations, and so.. I felt disappointed with another wasted character.And in all, I sure watched it! But, expected more.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Florence Pugh is really cool!For those who have been paying attention for a while now, that shouldn't come as a surprise, but this being my main take-away from this movie is rather sad.Black Widow deserved a better entry. She's been kicking ass ever since Iron Man 2, and became a bit of a fan favorite. This movie is a perfect example of too little, too late. We've already seen some of her origin story scattered among other entries in the MCU, and then End Game happened, which was a rather definitive ending to the story arc of the original Avengers. But they promised us a Black Widow movie, so here it is I guess.Pro's: Action's done quite well, they take time to introduce the characters and as I said earlier Pugh's awesome.Con's: No real character arc for Black Widow in her own movie, supporting cast of Harbour and Weisz underused, the plot isn't very interesting, underwhelming finale.This one's hard to recommend. I had an okay time watching it, and it's competently enough made, but it doesn't have many selling points. And if you want more Florence Pugh, there's the new Little Women movie, which is a much stronger flick.Okay movie. Nothing more.

I saw my excitement flash before my eyes during the opening credits as my dreams of what I wanted to see was skipped over for a silly lazy Marvel film. It really seems this film was churned out to give the fanbase a Black Widow film in which it asked, simply to get it out the way. Parts were funny, some intense action scenes, some emotion. One thing in the whole film stood out and it has nothing to do with Black Widow - the person the film is based on. It has everything to do with Florence Pugh. I liked her in this film and I am excited for her involvement in future films and TV shows. To this date she seems to be the only reason to watch Black Widow not just because she's the best part but everything else is disposable. In everything since, she's the only thing that's been recognised in the Universe so far with importance. I'm sure this film will be forgotten. Just another below average film from Marvel. I don't know why they do it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Black Widow has been in Marvel movies since 'Iron Man 2' in 2010, and while all the other founding avengers got origin stories, and sequels, Natasha Romanoff has even been pipped to first Marvel female-led movie by Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, never mind having J-Law & co do a Black Widow movie in all but name with 'Red Sparrow'.Maybe this is not the place to go over the executive misogyny and perceptions about what or would not ""sell"" that led to this situation but, watching this, one cannot help but remember this is not the next in a series of ongoing Black Widow adventures, but instead a belated salute to one of the MCU's key characters.In that sense, we can be pleased this exists, and that progress has been made, but we can also acknowledge how bloody long it has taken, and hope for more in the future.The movie then has a multiple missions; to serve as a kind-of origin story for the Black Widow, to give her a final send-off, to introduce us to characters who will continue to appear in the MCU (notably Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova), and maybe also comment on how women have been used by men to serve their interests for a very long time. All while delivering on the expected superhero action.It's a lot for any movie to accomplish and 'Black Widow' does some elements better than others.The script is by Jac Schaeffer (who created 'WandaVision') and Eric Pearson (who co-wrote 'Thor: Ragnarok', and who worked on the under-seen 'Agent Carter' tv series which also looked at the Red Room.)Romanoff is a spy by training. Spies (at least in the popular imagination) operate in murky, trust-no-one, shadows that take a toll not just professionally, but on their personal life. In the most recent 'Black Widow' solo comic series, Mark Waid embraced this side of her character, sending her on a series of impossible lone missions in which she had to heart-breakingly betray those closest to her for the greater good.The MCU has in the past alluded to Romanoff's need to atone for the red in her ledger, and the fact that she defected to America and SHIELD from Russia. We might imagine then that she wouldn't have many friends left in that part of the world. Given we know her ultimate fate in 'Avengers: Endgame', the movie wants to lift some of those burdens from Natasha's shoulders and assure her (and us) that she was loved, giving us some retrospective comfort about her sacrifice. To give her that, this movie is actually about Natasha putting her old family back together and reclaiming her place as a surrogate daughter and sister. She's does this to take down the still-operational Red Room in which kidnapped children are turned into mind-controlled deadly assassins.Putting the band back together is a well-worn movie trope and it works brilliantly here with Florence Pugh proving continuing the phenomenal hot streak she has been following 'Fighting With My Family', 'Midsommar' and 'Little Women'. She goes toe-to-toe with Johansson in the action scenes, and has great fun with her in the downtime between punches.David Harbour provides many laughs as Alexei AKA the Red Guardian - Russia's answer to Captain America. Harbour takes an insecure braggart who can't say the right thing and turns him into a decent guy who discovered too late what was important.The problem with all this is that it leaves Natasha sharing the limelight in her own movie. Where we could have had a fuller account and insight into what makes Natasha the Black Widow, we instead spend a lot of time understanding the wounded, bitterness of Yelena, and the out-to-pasture history of Rachel Weisz's under-written Melina.There's a definite feeling that if this movie had come ten years ago, it would have focused more tightly on Natasha and her history with the Red Room, but now, the MCU has more to think about, and the multiple missions can't all be fulfilled even in the two and a quarter hour runtime.Marvel is a well honed machine when it comes to action. From early on the film drops us into action, and it rarely lets up. From Norway to Budapest and on into Russia, there are one-on-one duels, car chases, aerial escapes and shoot-outs aplenty. They are all done with the usual level of breath-taking CGI, stunt work, and quips. I had only seen one previous film of director Cate Shortland - her debut feature, 'Somersault'. That is a lovely, touching piece of work about a girl trying to find her place in the world but it didn't prepare me for the level of mayhem in this movie. What is recognisable is her concern for the difficulty for a woman of trying to find her place in the world, and the importance of a decent support system.The evil villain's (played with a nice snarl by Ray Winstone) plot is woefully undercooked. He's manipulating countless women but his ultimate plan is a very vague, off-the-peg ""world domination"". His deadly right-hand, Taskmaster, is similarly underserved.It's admirable to want to allude to women breaking free of the control of monstrous men but when the method of that breaking free is a near magical red dust, it undercuts the work and effort it takes for women to actually get out from under either the literal trauma of an abuser, or the more pervasive patriarchal culture.By the end, 'Black Widow' has achieved a little of all the missions it set itself but had not truly completed any of them. A modest success then. Something that was enjoyable and a pleasure to see on the big screen but not the all-out storming of the cinemas we had wanted for Scarlett.Random thoughts:
* First time back in an Imax screen post-pandemic - it was great to have those awesome visuals and sounds wrap around us once again.* There was at least one gratuitous butt shot, and I don't know how to feel about that in a film about female empowerment.* Loved the cheeky snippet of 'Moonraker'. Another movie about a spy facing a world-conquering villain but which is even more ridiculous than this one.* Speaking of Bond, Olga Kurylenko provides another connection as she had a big role in 'Quantum of Solace'
* I know all action movies engage in a level of suspension of disbelief but there is a car crash in this in which Natasha's car roof is practically caved in as the car is bounced about, but she runs out as if it weren't no thing.* The Red Guardian was Russia's answer to Captain America and they sent him on an undercover mission for three years???!!! Hmmm.* If the Red Room is in Russia, how the hell is General Ross zipping about there in a very large, very not-secret convoy???* And speaking of General Ross, why even bother showing him towards the end if you're going to hand wave away what happened next with a ""two weeks later""?* That post-credits scene did a lot of work - pushing the narrative forward by five-ish years, shedding some tears for Natasha, teasing the Contessa, and setting up the forthcoming 'Hawkeye'.* I love Marvel and I will go to see everything they put out from here until it all falls down, but I continue to be impressed by the level of care and craft that goes into making all of these movies and tv shows, and occasionally uniting them into one sweeping story. It really hasn't been done before on this scale in movies and tv and Kevin Feige has really got the secret sauce.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

First off, this movie should have come out after Captain America: Civil War, which was released in 2016 and before Avengers: Infinity War (2018), to fit into the Marvel Universe timeline. The cast was made up of some of the best in the business, but failed to let the actors and actresses develop their roles. Why have Olga Kurylenko play a role that a stunt double could do hidden behind a mask? Insulting Olga's professional abilities further by requiring no lines or acting! If Stan Lee had been involved with this production, the plot would have been rewritten and the cast more involved in acting. Clearly this was more pulp fiction quality writing than Marvel Universe. Where is Nick Fury? Where is Ironman? Seems they pop up in all the Marvel Universe productions, but not this one. It is as if they ran out of creative ideas and dug through the trash bin for the scripts Stan Lee through out.

It is much more of a family story. All the actors and actresses in this movie are amazing. Especially Florence Pugh is giving a stellar performance. I really hope we get to see more of her character.I also liked that the pace of the movie was occasionally much slower than other Marvel movies. There are longer stretches where the acting and the story carry the movie. I became aware of this when I noticed that there was basically no CGI during these scenes. Thanks to the cast, these scenes were never boring or felt unnecessary.The humor is well-placed and entertaining without turning the movie into a comedy. Also, the 3D worked well and elevated several scenes.Note that (most of) the story takes place in 2016, after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"". However, the movie completely stands on its own feet. There are, of course, some references to Captain America and the Avengers but you don't need to know these movies to understand or follow ""Black Widow"".9/10.

Lets make more widows instead !!""
that's Exactly what happens
Black Widow isn't the main character - the Comedian scenes in this movie better than the Action scenes -The villain Character is Weak role - the CGI Graphics is Poor.-the main key to make action scenes success in marvel world is Graphical Effects and CGI Quality ( and that something you wont find in this movie ...at all )finally you may love this movie for only 3 Reasons
1- the comedian Scenes
2- the Black widow Reputation that built through all
3 - you may love that because you miss Marvel Movies .since last one was 2019 ( But also you may get disappointed many ways )
and don't forget to wait to the after credit scene of courseHope you enjoyed my Review and Get Masked - be Safe .","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Enjoyable, but I Expected Much More","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7101963/?ref_=tt_urv","chanshundik","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur102939761/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2021","Overall, the film was enjoyable and straight forward. Natasha's future death in End Game does not reduce the stakes of the plot at all. Her sister, Yelena's complex feelings is very well portrayed by Florence Pugh. She has to switch between innocence and vengence throughout the movie and the duality of her character is the best part of the film. The 'pose' joke also made me laugh. I like how the outfits of hers aren't hypersexualised for the male gaze. Taskmaster felt intimating and terrifying in the first two acts. Throughout the film, I'm constantly intrigued.However, the film fails to meet up my expectations. It is common knowledge that the movie should have released after Civil War. When we finally got her solo film, it even got delayed for a year. Additionally, it was marketed as a spy thriller action movie that resembles Captain America: the Winter Soldier (aka the best MCU film). Perhaps it's due to these premises that I had my hopes up. The plot was not memorable and the editing of the action scenes were sometimes confusing to me. The third act felt poorly designed and predictable. During the confrontation with the villain, there is an 'obstacle' that was dealt a minute later with a flashback scene, it seemed very straightforward and childish. Scenes with Black Widow's private contractor male friend also seemed pointless and dragged. It's another generic superhero film which the good guys beats the bad guys, and this brings nothing new to the table. A darke, serious tone would have suited Black Widow more. Sadly, she had a greater spotlight in Winter Soldier than in her own solo movie.Considering this is Scarlett Johansson's last Marvel movie, it is more focused on others rather than Black Widow herself. I expected a heartfelt, emotional ending but instead we got an abrupt one. I enjoyed the film, yet I recall myself walking out of the cinema with disappointment.6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A mixed bag with power levels all over the place. Wish Marvel would have taken more risks with this one","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7477017/?ref_=tt_urv","VoiceOfTreason","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132773093/?ref_=tt_urv","24 October 2021","First of all, this movie should have been released right after Civil War. It would have helped the movie tremendously since there is no actual danger or threat to Black Widow. Apart from that, they could have set up her sacrifice in Endgame with this movie and give it even more emotional weight, instead of having it as a marginalia overshadowed by Tony Starks sacrifice.Now to the movie itself. The first hour is disjointed, boring, even a little bit confusing at times (how did she get there? Why did she go there? How did she know she must go there? Etc.). The action is lackluster, illogical and everything just drags on and on and on and I was very close to just watch something else. I'm glad I didn't. The middle of the movie is extremely well written and very emotional (The ""family"" was well casted and I especially liked the character of Yelena. The dynamic between the two Black Widows was great) .This was by far the best part of the movie and the only part which actually worked brilliantly. Marvel should have gone the Logan route with this one and focus mainly on the emotional and character part (and keep the action grounded). Would have worked a lot better and I believe it would have given Scarlett Johansson the farewell from Marvel she actually deserved. The last part of the movie was okay but also quite generic. At this point we should also talk about the power levels. They are all over the place and highly illogical. Is Black Widow a normal trained person with skill or actually a superhuman? (Yes, I know the answer, but I get a feeling the makers of this film didn't). Black Widow should have been dead, crippled and unconscious more than once in this movie. Yes I'm aware this is fiction, but it was so blatantly ridiculous that it was hard to overlook. The action in itself is quite generic the whole movie. There are no real surprises.Overall I'm not sure if I can recomment Black Widow. If you are looking for great action then I guess look somewhere else, but if you want to know a little bit more about Natasha's past and about the character Black Widow itself and you don't mind watching generic action, then I can recommend this movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Scarlett Johansson takes the role as Black Widow, who is an epic Marvel protagonist without any superpowers. The fight sequences in the film are stylish and the movement is skilful, but the ""acceptable"" story can be flat at times. However, fans of Marvel action flicks will surely adore Black Widow, despite the fact that it took a while for the character to have her own film.The film delivers a promising opening with a nicely-produced title card and credits. Although it does feel quite long and extended, it's usually entertaining when the story approaches the explosions, gunfire and action. Even though Black Widow doesn't have any superpowers like most other Marvel heroes, the film still keeps a similar pace for Marvel fans.This action/adventure tale also just isn't as great as expected. Even though the acting and effects are stunning, it isn't a fast-moving film and is occasionally just uninteresting. Thanks to the performances, action and fairly constructed story, Black Widow is another decent cinema-worthy movie that'll impress those who adore the epic action stories that Marvel provides.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We have waited so long for a black widow movie and when it is finally here, I can't help but to feel a little bit disappointed. Tough the action wasn't very good the classic marvel comedy held up to its high standards. It is in fact a very funny movie and the dialogue between Natasha and her family is often hilarious.Overall this movie is pretty mediocre and it kind of felt like the whole thing was just filler.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There were many things that bothered me with this movie to the point where I actually checked my watch a few times. I usually praise Marvel for their clever funny jokes but in this movie things are different. The jokes were not funny at all, a more adequate term would be lame. The concept of the story seems appealing but they messed it up big time to the point where I had no interest in the story anymore. There are huge problems with the pacing, the emotional connection and the overall plot is weak. There is a lot of talking and explaining stuff so when you finally get to the action scenes it's just some average random 0 emotional invested fights. The movie never actually takes the time to build a strong emotional side and this mistake backfires hard.Black Widow (2021) is a wasted opportunity of a great movie. It's a sloppy work. The important good parts are missing or are way too short and rushed while the bad parts are overly drawn out. Any attempt of building emotional connection is cut with a lame joke turning Black Widow (2021) into an empty shell.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A little slow at first. This type of movies however impress with graphics and audio. The picture quality is good and the action scenes are decent, but the audio is still a big miss. Central channel again gets the most audio when clearly much more could be played thru surround and Atmos. Sadly, Atmos is little represented. The directors should think how an action scene would sound from different angles in the real world. They can intentionally change the angle of view to incorporate off-center sound points. This will be more interactive. The viewer will feel more involved. When a movie has that many scenes with surround and overhead sound, it's truly a waste of opportunity not to be mastered the right way.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Strong Solo Film for Natasha, Except for one Character...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7111739/?ref_=tt_urv","jaredkjacoby","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur111679790/?ref_=tt_urv","11 July 2021","The story for Black Widow takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) is on the run after violating Sokovia Accords. When she flees to Norway, she encounters her sister, Yelena Belova. When they reunite, they have to escape other Black Widows who are trying to kill them as well as the Taskmaster who is after Natasha for carrying a substance called Red Dust. Natasha and Yelena are forced to face the past involving their parents as well as how they became to be the ""killers"" they are in the present day.This is the first Marvel movie that I have seen in theaters since Avengers Infinity War and it is also the first one that I saw on opening weekend. Not the best theater experience I ever had, but I do not think it affects my opinion of this film. I have always wondered why Black Widow never got her own film until today. She is such a cool character and she has the potential to have an interesting backstory and personality. She is also not as well known compared to the other Marvel characters. I only know Black Widow from the MCU. However, we finally have her solo film. How does Natasha fare in her solo story?Black Widow is ultimately a movie about Natasha's family. It is no normal family though. Natasha's family goes on an ""adventure"" that leads to her and her sister getting sent to Dreykov who puts them through training hell. Nat's story on how she became Black Widow is a lot more depressing and creepy than I thought it would be. It shows why she is one of the more serious and deadpan characters in the Avengers. It explores her inner demons well. The movie touches on the consequences of morally questionable actions. Nat has to confront her past and it is not pretty. She has to see her family again after not even looking for them for years. Worst of all, she has to deal with how she became Black Widow and what she did to the villain's daughter. This movie made me think about her as a person and not just a hero. It made her much more human and more of an anti-hero for better or worse.The tone of the film is pretty grim because of the themes it tackles, but there is plenty of comedy thanks to the family dynamic. One of my favorite scenes was Yelena making fun of Nat's ""heroic"" pose. That had me rolling. There is also some black comedy here to make sure the tone does not become too lighthearted. Overall, the story is good because it is a slow-burner that focuses on Nat's inner demons.Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance as Natasha to date. She is much more conflicted and emotive in the role, while still being the strong and stoic character she was in past Marvel films. She lets herself have a bit more humility with the character in both humorous and serious scenes. She even has a scene where she taunts the bad guy and it is great to watch. The movie along with Johansson's performance made me respect Natasha's character much more. You can tell she loves this character with all her heart. Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova is another standout. In fact, she is arguably the standout. She is so funny and charismatic in this role. Pugh is a natural and her character is incredibly charming while being really sympathetic. She is also the one to question Natasha's morality for good reasons. Pugh's chemistry with Johansson is spot on. They are so convincing that they act like sisters in real life. I would not be surprised if they are good friends in real life. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour play as their parents and they make for great characters as well. Harbour plays as such an over-the-top dad, that he feels like a parody of the bumbling dad archetype. Even in the climax, he is the only humorous part for better or worse.Then there are the villains. Both of them give me mixed thoughts. There is Dreykov who is easily one of the most despicable villains ever put in a Marvel film. The way he trains other women or even girls to become killing machines is creepy and disturbing and that is putting it lightly. He is also a smug coward who only gets into a fight when he is protected. He is only shown for a few minutes, but he has a big role and the actor playing as him makes the most out of his screen time to make him as loathsome as possible. Great job Ray Winstone! He is not the best villain, but he is fun to root against. The Taskmaster on the other hand is a horrible villain. I cannot say too much about them without spoiling the film, but the biggest problem (aside from comic book inaccuracies) is that the character feels like wasted potential. They could have been a great tragic villain, but they come off as too flat. The cast is great and most of the characters are good, but some of the villains could have been better.As for technical aspects, the biggest problem is the lighting, especially towards the beginning. There are some scenes with lighting that is too dim for the action scenes and in the opening scene as well. It gets better by the second act though. The costumes look solid, though Taskmaster's design looks generic. The action scenes are as good as you would expect from a Marvel film. My favorite sequence is the climactic battle where there is a free fall fight. It is a truly awesome sequence with great cinematography and slick fighting. The chase in Budapest is no slouch either. The scene where Natasha and Yelena break their father out of prison is great too. These three set pieces in particular are all beautifully-shot and fast-paced. These set pieces remind me why I like the action in MCU films so much. The first fight between Natasha and Taskmaster however is not so great. It is shot in the dark and it comes across as weak compared to the rest of the awesome action that comes later. Some of the cinematography is stunning, especially the scenes in the Red Room or in that whole ship. The musical score is one of the best in a Marvel film. It is pretty memorable and it adds to the tension in the film.Black Widow is a solid entry to the MCU. While it is far from the best Marvel film, it is a movie that fleshes out Natasha's flaws, provides solid action and brings an awesome family together. It also does a good job with its themes of family and morality. It makes you wonder how heroic Nat is, but the script succeeds in making her sympathetic. It was nice seeing a Marvel movie in theaters again and I hope that this new wave of Marvel films continue to deliver. This was a nice sendoff to a great MCU character.Stay through the credits! Trust me, it is a good one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I loved the portrayal of the father (Red Guardian) and sister (Yelena). The comedy was pretty much on point where it was needed - and usually Marvel movies are too messy with this.However, the action scenes removed too much off the topping... As another IMDb reviewer wrote; the editor(s) struggled too much with covering the stunt-double from the camera, making the sequences giving headaches...this is probably one of the most unsatisfying movies when it comes to that; action. Though I at least have to give them credit for the ""intro sequence""...loved that, very iconic.But they overdid the music...as if they had to use every song on the soundtrack in order to not piss off the composer. Empty and slow sequences are often the build-up an emotional scene needs, but here they went all out trying to fill in as much as possible.But when it comes to the villain..? Where is the intimidation! Where is the build-up we as an audience expected? It was so lousily portrayed I felt like he was inevitably going to lose. With Thanos for example; we had no idea. He was so terrifying because his goals were so clearly set with meaning, I felt my jaw dropping.Yet, with all these psychological pasts of the main characters that felt like had to be redeemed in some way, this villain removes this satisfaction.And not to mention the villain's powerful minion who is pretty much only used for the action sequences.Felt like 7/10 was too generous...here you go Marvel (6/10).Love the poster tho.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Most of the action sequences could have been trimmed way down and not lost any of their impact.Glad to see marvel give us a straight up villain who isn't complicated. He's a bad guy who needs to be defeated. Nice change from the TV shows.The weirdness with the Taskmaster being played by two different people thing was annoying. They should have matched the physical sizes of them better or spent some of the CGI budget fixing difference.It's a shame the we didn't get a Black Widow movie until it didn't matter in the story line and that Marvel felt the need to bury some really good acting under so much CGI spentabulousness.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Marvel movies are not my cup of tea, but someone is very successful, like Iron Man, The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. The other films of the saga very often fall into the very forgettable. We do not know how touches their subject in an interesting way, as was the case at times with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Black Window is on this point above, almost reaching the top of the basket, a story sometimes unexpected, sometimes unsurprising. A tribute to james bond femme fatale version, we feel the potential to touch strong subjects such as the abyss of destructive patriarchy. Yet full of good ideas, the film does not really manage to treat the whole and become a master stallion, whereas with a little more time and less unsightly spectacular, when the family reunites before the final confrontation, the film shows that he could have been very strong. Instead, he hovers over, gives compelling reasons to connect the pieces with the saga and ticks the boxes of the blockbuster marvel without conviction. This is how the film scuttles itself, not knowing how to take these distances with Avenger. In fact it's a bit of a mess, but at times it offers a real good time, special mention to Yelena Belova, actress Florence Pugh is really what we will remember.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I really missed watching one of Marvel's good superhero movies, especially a hero from the original six, who we haven't seen its film yet. However, I had lost interest in the movie because of the long break, and I did not have many expectations. I thought that it would be a classic and average Marvel movie. Unfortunately, the film was even less than I expected.If we divide the movie into two halves, I would say that the first half satisfied me. Even though there were still things that I didn't like as a whole, which I will come back to them, the first half of the movie had a clear story and goal. Taskmaster was also looking cool and scary; it reminded me of the WinterSoldier. It was what I define as a classic Marvel movie.On the other hand, the second half of the movie lost its focus. Many weird things start to happen one after the other. There were moments (for example, the flashbacks of the original plan) that felt very cliche. The Taskmaster also turned out to be not the guy many of us thought.Now, let's talk about the things that I did not like in general. I think the movie failed to introduce the main bad guy of the film, Dreykov, and the story of BlackWidow. As I told you, I liked the first half. Nevertheless, these things troubled me mainly in the first half. The film has brief scenes that are about the past of BlackWidow and Dreykov (flashbacks that are like a maximum of 5 minutes). I believe that it does not give us the necessary back story of the Red Room. And because the film revolves around those lacked scenes, I just started to not give a damn about what they were talking about and what was happening towards the end. In my opinion, the main reason behind this is that they focused on Yelena and that family issue more than BlackWidow itself. I think they could have reduced some of the dialogue scenes to show us more flashbacks, but still, it wouldn't be enough. It would be much better if they just focused on BlackWidow and the RedRoom. I also think that Natasha is not the same person that we know from the other movies. I believe the reason for this is also because the film is not focused on her. In addition, it would be cooler if Taskmaster was the master of the RedRoom and the main villain of the movie.I normally would have given 5.5, but there isn't such an option, and because of my respect for Marvel itself, I will give 6.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Things looked really good in the beginning but soon all the excitement starts to wash away by the end of first half. The major highlight of the movie are the opening credits with a good song which flashes through childhood of Natasha. Action sequences are the main thing to watch in the film which are watchable although they fail to be engaging. The movie has a good plot, some twists and a red room fight sequence which classify it to be a one time watchable action entertainer.Coming to cons,The cringe jokes were totally unnecessary and misplaced. The movie is plot driven rather than focussing on characters so most of them including the protagonist feels useless at times. Rachel Weisz and Scarlet are the only characters who somehow make their presence felt. Last but not the least the third act fight is the main factor that degrades the movie. The third act opened pretty neat but soon we are introduced to a over vfx-cgi driven sequence which only helped in reducing the effect of the movie. The post credits too felt degenerated which is unusual in MCU.In the end, Black Widow is a watchable movie from MCU but below par compared to usual MCU standard.Rating:62%","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

First, even tho Black Widow has been around for like 10 years in the MCU, she still isn't one of my favorite characters. Second, because they released it after the character have died in the previous movie (Avengers: Endgame). This movie could make me more excited if they released it on the same timeline as the movie take place, 2016/2017. It just feel kinda weird that they put this as the first movie of MCU Phase 4.The film starts off very strong with establishing Natasha Romanoff's childhood and her family. And reveal how Nat ended up being a Black Widow. Actually one of the best opening from all Marvel movies in my opinion.Many people don't like how Marvel use Taskmaster in this movie. But I'm actually agree with that. My problem with the villain is that he just got small screentime and seems not threatening at all. I thought Taskmaster will be the next Winter Soldier kind of villain when I watch the trailers and then I was wrong. For the third act, yeah Marvel really have a problem with this. CGI fight scene is fine, but if they fail, it makes the whole scene and sequence look terrible.But beside all of that, this movie was doing great on telling the backstory of Nat and the way they respecting the character's death. If I'm making my version of MCU movie ranking, maybe I'll put this in number 13/14/15 out of 24 movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film takes place between ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Avengers: Infinity War""; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.This is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her ""family"" as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.Since Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.Natasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.Despite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha's insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.With Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former ""Father"" the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.What follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.Marvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.While many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.""Black Widow"" fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.From the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; ""Black Widow"" was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.4 stars out of 5.","16 out of 39 found this helpful.

If it werent for all the users giving this movie 8 or 9 stars then i would put its actual imdb rating at 5.0. This movie is one of those long and boring action movies. Explosions and fights scenes CAN NOT make up for bad writing!Hollywood really needs to rethink how women are cast in traditionally male roles. You can't just put any actor in any role. Bad casting makes it difficult to believe the character and makes the movie hard to sit through.Every 15 minutes I found myself checking how much time i had left before this movie was over.","13 out of 36 found this helpful.

Scarlett Johansson was solid. Florence Plugh made a delightful little sister. I love Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour does the best he can with what he has been given.The problem is the story.The action scenes don't carry a lot of weight since the audience always knows that Natasha will live (Avengers: Infinity War comes later chronologically), so the sense of suspense needs to come from sources other than the protagonist being in peril. Unfortunately, the audience just gets a whole lot of sequences were Natasha really shouldn't have survived falling or wrecks but miraculously does - no idea how (plot armour?).The bigger issue is accountability. There are a couple of characters that have committed atrocities. One conveys no remorse whatsoever and the second abruptly has a change of heart after decades of knowingly committing crimes against humanity. After everything they've done and with no real reason to trust them, Black Widow not only trusts them but leaves them in charge of a bunch of highly vulnerable people. It feels out of character for Natasha and makes her seem foolish.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It did, however, feel like a typical post cold war romp like Mission: Impossible. That isn't meant as a criticism, it's just an observation.Having not been on the big screen for so long, what was really needed here was a dose of fantasy-derived escapism and not something more akin to The Manchurian Candidate with added costumes and explosions. Good - possibly very good! - but not great.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

But I guess going back in time is what the MCU does best now.(Just a clarification, that's not a spoiler for this movie. It's just part of the MCU that she passes in Avengers: Endgame and that's acknowledged here.)To put my feeling for the MCU in perspective, none of the 24 Avenger movies fall into my top 20 action movies of all time. Not that they were bad, plenty of them were good to great. It's just, most of them are comedies first and action/comic book movies second...or third. Such in the case of both Iron Man 3 and Thor: Ragnarok. Both were 80% comedies with a smidge of action.Mercifully, Black Widow is less of a comedy, although the one running gag (Posing) was funny and creative and a few other jokes landed. Not terribly funny, but luckily, this isn't meant to be funny. Nope, in this case: it's 80% drama and 20% action.Don't get me wrong; 2 of the 3-4 action scenes were good, the now-overused, yet still fun climax being the best, but the action was so few and far in-between and sadly, I just didn't connect with the ""drama"" and ""sad-scenes"" very well. I never felt bad for these people, even when kids were involved. Maybe it's because the movie was SO COLD, little heart could be felt.After a solid cold opening showing our infamous Natasha Romanoff, aka The Title Character, as a kid about to become said Title Character, we fast-forward to her well-established as the Black Widow. Well, one of them, anyways. There we see her go on a very basic and simple mission with her estranged sister and family.Oh, and they probably mentioned the word ""Avengers"" more times in this movie and her connection to them than all 4 actual Avenger movies combined.My biggest problem with this movie is that I wanted to see either A: An Origin Story of her trials and tribulations of becoming my 2nd favorite Avenger behind Captain Steve Rogers or B: she's already Black Widow and she smartly kicks as much ass as she's done with every other appearance of hers in the MCU. Well, I did get about 7 minutes of that origin story and about 10 minutes of her actually being the kick-ass super-spy we all love. Those 10 minutes are the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie, and here's the problem, SHE IS BLACK WIDOW throughout the movie, sans those original 7 minutes in the cold-open. So...why do they make her so oh-hum throughout? She's not learning to become Black Widow; she's been that way since the opening credits. We just finally get her bad-assery in the closing and by then I was incredibly bored with so many overly dramatic and predictable, drawn-out scenes.But, that was my biggest issue. In truth, it wasn't that bad of the movie, even though a ton of it was generic action scenes or family drama never reaching tension. I did enjoy Scarlett, as always, but here she just felt like Sean Connery coming back for Never Say Never Again. Like this was just a paycheck for her.While it's a mild recommendation, it's not at all necessary to see this movie in connection with the others except for the weak-post credit scene (all the way at the end of the 20 minutes of credits.) It felt so much like a mid-season storyline/couple of episodes of a TV season - never as great as the first 2 episodes and definitely less fun/excitement as the season finale's last few episodes. Think of it as episode 4-6 of a 9-part TV season.***Final Thoughts: Here's my updated ranking of all the MCU movies with stars, Best to WORST:1 Marvel's The Avengers (4½/5 Stars.)

One of the things they did is they made the whole movie bleak, and I mean that literally, from start to finish this word that keeps running through my head is ""dystopian"". And I understand they wanted to give it this atmosphere of helplessness, but what happened instead is it translated as a miserable time the entire movie.The other thing that really bothered me is they had this kind of broken humor where it never quite hit the mark, and again I think they were going for a family that wasn't a real family thing, but it just came off as bland and fell flat.Having said that, there was something very real about the way they presented the lives of spies where they would just have to pack up and leave in an instant. And an authenticity to the fact that afterward their entire family kind of fell apart without a sense of home.I don't think this went far enough into the avengers side of the movie and too far into a past that didn't really play correctly in this particular universe.8/10 great acting, great directing, the plot was just very hit and miss for me.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Thought everything was perfect for an action movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean I don't read comics plus the lawsuit I think might cause other people to hate on this I guess but as a movie, just taking that into account with no outside issues then I don't get how this is any less than an 8.3. It proved yet again females can be seemless badass leads and can have great chemistry without desperately needing love angles, also this idea that women can't beat men up is silly, strength wise I get but if your a trained fighter, like top top level unless the guy is that level he's getting beat, don't get the problem with that, I'm also content with blokes being the bad guys but not for being men but just the casting, I'm cool with that, it's when it becomes man hating I reject it.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I can't wait to see it again.From start to finish I was hooked. The action scenes were balanced with heartfelt and comedic ones perfectly. The story itself was brilliant too, the idea behind the controlling villain was done really well and his connections to the family were also well thought out and made the story much more intricate than it otherwise would have been.Yelena comes in as a new character but honestly was fantastic opposite Natasha. The sisterly bond was done to perfection and I can't wait to see where Yelena goes next...maybe she'll get her own film too? One can only hope that's the case and that she isn't sidelined to the t.v series as I think she deserves more than that.This all may sound a little enthusiastic but I have been waiting for this film for so long and it was exactly what I wanted. I'm not sure why people are review bombing it to be honest. Maybe people expected something more Thor or Iron man like but Natasha is Natasha and this film explored her character arc perfectly for me.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The movie is okay. The 134-minute runtime didn't drag like I thought it would, but it wasn't particularly good either. The comedic moments are fine, and the action is fast. However, the action does nothing new, and it can be a bit bland. The villain of the movie is also pretty lame.As an exploration of Natasha's character, it's ok, despite being years too late (spoiler alert: don't get too attached to her...). I guess it tells the story of her troubled past well, but it doesn't really add anything interesting to her personality. I don't feel any more of a connection to her character now than I did before watching. It essentially feels like the purpose of the movie is to bring Florence Pugh's character into the MCU, rather than coming from a genuine desire to tell Natasha's story. The multi-billion dollar MCU pushing industrialized, uninspired media out? It's crazy to think about, I know.As far as the acting goes, everyone was fine, although I thought the Russian accents were kind of awful. It's kind of disappointing to see Florence Pugh take her career in this direction though... At least Scarlett Johansson is free now.4.8/10Also, Jeremy Renner should have been in this movie.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

David Harbour and Florence Pugh absolutely run the show here and honestly I wish that they were introduced earlier. This film is all about family and where Black Widow came from and honestly I love that aspect and what they were able to do with it all. The action is filmed in a way in which I really love and is a film that just keeps going and never has a slow moment.The Bad- I wish it came out after Civil War instead of Endgame. I also didn't like Taskmaster, he just felt like a throwaway character compared to how big of a character he is in the comics. In the final battle a lot of the special effects just looked chap or you can tell straight away that it is green screened. Now these are only small issues I had with the film and didn't take away from any enjoyment from the film.Overall Thoughts- Cate Shortland made an almost perfect Black Widow film with amazing performances, wonderful action I just wished it came out a couple of years earlier. Overall I'm going to give 'Black Widow' a 9/10.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Too many reviewers think that if the film they're watching isn't the best film ever then it must be the worst. This film occupies neither end of the scale. Yes it's all action, the plot is aimed at the brain-dead, the script is all too predictably formulaic, the effects are very cgi heavy and it's unlikely to ever win any awards for anything. It's a superhero movie and they all follow the same pattern so you ought to know what to expect. It's certainly not the best superhero movie ever and it's equally not the worst. It occupies that glut of movies in the middle that are adequate to pass a couple of hours with but you'll be unlikely to ever care enough to watch it twice. It actually has more a feel of an old Bond movie seeing as the titular heroine has no actual superpowers and the villain would look equally at home in a dormant volcano stroking his cat.When a movie is this average it's hard to actually find things to praise or hate.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

And this family emotional bonding continues throughout the movie all the way to the end of the credits - definitely continue to watch past the End Credits like with all Marvel movies.There are some funny comic relief - especially when Black Widow's little sister pokes fun of how Black Widow always poses when she lands. And this poking fun is repeated a few times. I love it.Setting: very nice settings around the world. Love it.Plot: nice plot with some twists
Character development: great to see the characters develop. This movie is character-driven.Climax/Resolution: nicely done.The action, like most actions movies, are very good. Great special effects.PQ: Reference quality as expected since the movie was shot using 8K digital cameras.SQ: Typical of about 99% of Marvel movies. Overall SQ is very good. There are some decent Atmos overhead effects, but nowhere near reference quality for Atmos.I definitely want ""Black Widow"" in 4K Atmos. This is the type of movie I would re-watch repeatedly.I can see potential ""Black Widow"" sequels.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

The only character with any kind of development was David Harbour, but when your comic relief is a better thought out character and has more charisma than your lead then you have a problem.There was no drama or any sense of risk in the film, not only do you not care about the characters but you know whatever happens to them physically they'll just get back up and carry on. The action set pieces were fine but at times the editing didn't seem to make sense and characters started to do something and then in the next shot they are back where they were before. It all felt a bit slap dash and half hearted. In a sea of bad Russian accents though Ray Winstone does shine and deserves special mention.There is nothing even remotely original here, overall it feels like a knock off Marvel movie with better effects. I think this is the problem when you commit to this kind of production line of films and interlinked TV shows, things become more about making product than making a good film.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Fun to watch with surprises and great fight scenes. It fills all the gaps with the black widow character. Not sure why people gave it a bad rating. I enjoyed it and looking forward to more MCU movies. Where is the Hawkeye movie for his disturbing time after the blip happened. Each main character needs to have their own movie not just tv series. Looking forward to the Hawkeye series and what's next for Falcon & Winter Soldier. Keep it coming MCU and stop making us wait too long for the next MCU movie, the actors and I are not getting any younger.Signed big MCU fan from New Zealand.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Where is that richness, creamy of the butter, that suppose to melt my fragile little heart.This scrambled egg itself is mediocre, not to mention the woven basket it is served in, along with a pastry brush. All the aspects don't work together to become a distinctive, delicious and nutritious dish.As a friendly customer of the MCU restaurant, I am truly disappointed and regret eating this horrible so call scrambled egg.Note: The villain is a joke and Black Widow is lacking a bit of everything.Give it a five not a four because it could have been better.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sure, it did have its very minimal flaws, but in my opinion, it had more pros. The one thing I really liked was the family dynamics in the movie. Even though non of them are related, they all acted like a family in the funny, dysfunctional way most families do. A great example of that was the scene where they were eating dinner together after reuniting, it was hilarious. I also liked the bantering sibling rivalry Natasha and Yelena had, that was also very funny and reminded me of how I act with my sibling. I also though the supporting cast in this movie was some of the best in the MCU. I loved hearing all of them with their Russian accents. David Harbor was hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing at his scenes, Rachel Weisz was also great, but Florence Pugh stole the show, she was amazing, I can't wait to see what her future holds in the MCU. Another pro this movie had was its action. It was amazing. The fight scenes we some of the best in the MCU. This is my personal opinion, but I liked how this followed Civil War, and ended before Infinity War. This movie did a great job filling the gap in Natasha's story between those movies. This movies was also unique in a way. Almost every Marvel movie has cool animated closing credits at the end of the movie before the credits role. This movie did not, instead they decided to do something that hasn't been done since The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 did it. They had opening credits. I had goosebumps watching the opening credits in this movie. It was so good, I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel movie, I felt like I was watching a war movie. The way they made it look so real was breathtaking, it was definitely one of the stronger points of the movie, it was also important to the story. The last thing I liked about this film was Ray Winstone's portrayal of Dreykov. The character is so truly evil, and the role was played to perfection. The one con to this movie was that it was a little slow, but other than that, it was great.All in all, I am just happy Marvel movies are back, but sadly, theaters aren't open in my area so I couldn't get the true experience. I don't know anything about Taskmaster, so I can't comment on why people hate what happened so much, but I thought Taskmaster was very cool. The Credit Scene in this movie was crazy, and sets up the Hawkeye show perfectly, I can't wait for that show, and I can't wait till Wednesday and the final part of the Marvelous week with Loki!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

A lot of people are complaining about her not having a ""full role"" or being a ""sidekick"", the thing to really embrace about this movie is, that it isn't a traditional ""superhero movie"" it's an action packed hallmark filled with these small details that make it feel melancholiac. When it comes to The film , it's easy to sit there and criticize it. But alas that doesn't do this splendid film any justice. Everyone who complains, is looking at its face value, they're most likely not drawing parallels to the Marvel Comics Universe. I honestly liked the format and story direction in the movie, me being one who was always curious about her involvement in the MCU, let's just say I was pleased. And I hope Scarlet Johansson gets roles that amount to the great pleasure she gave dedicated MCU fans. She will always be our Black Widow.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Why hire a British actor to play the villain and he still sounds british. Why not hire the eons of Russian actors that can act the part. John Wick series shows one how to properly hire Russian actors.It is by far the worst Marvel film i have seen and still confused why they hired the Indy director but it is not her fault that the script sucked.

Not a bad thing, by any means, but it would've been cool to see this movie kinda take the trend of Ant-Man and be a different breed of MCU movie. It just felt like it kept bouncing between wanting to be a spy movie and an action heavy summer blockbuster. They still pulled it off, in my opinion. Also, while it was cool to see Taskmaster used in the MCU, that character felt very underutilized. Those are really my only two critiques.I've always loved Scar Jo as Black Widow, but Florence Pugh smashed this role out of the park and seeing her in the MCU makes my heart happy (she is forever my May Queen). David Harbour was also very good and sorta acts as the comic relief, alongside Florence. It was also very nice to see Rachel Weisz back in a major movie (I loved her in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, so seeing her in a badass role like this was almost nostalgic for me).All in all, this might be my favorite SOLO Marvel film since Thor Rangnarok (if that counts) or Black Panther (if Ragnarok doesn't count).Black Widow finally got her solo film and Marvel did her justice. Well worth the wait, though we shouldn't have had to wait this long.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I found it too portentous, way too long and narratively lazy. The combined forces of that and COVID kept me away. Then Disney+ arrive in my lounge, I want something new but not taxing on a bad Long Covid day. This was just the ticket. It's the love child of Marvel and Mission:Impossible, complete with terrific stunts and action set pieces. The central villain's plot may seem hard to pin down, but Johansson is good and it's lovely to see the always excellent Florence Pugh given a key role in a film like this. There's a pleasing lack of the meaningless cityscape destruction that so often features in superhero films, and Marvel's trademark style of wit fits well in the action spy context. Fans of the tv show Alias like me may spot some of its influence also, and it seemed to me that there's more than sniff of a feminist take about this that works pleasingly (though of course women should critique that). Yes it's still quite generic (and, of course, overlong ... but not Endgame overlong at least), but the mix of genres definitely gives it a different feel throughout, to the extent that even Ray Winstone's absurd attempt at an accent doesn't jar too much. Terrific entertainment just when I needed it, I'm freshly motivated to try catching up with the rest of the MCU films I've missed.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So the trailer dropped and it looked interesting as they were talking about the Red Room which is very key to Black Widow in her comic book storyline and I was like, ""We finally going to see her connection to the Red Room and the brutality she had to go through"", so this got me hyped and excited to see it. So finally the movie came around and was ready to see it and had real high hopes for it. My god, I wish I never had high hopes. What a train wreck of a movie that was like completely pointless, completely pointless and not needed. If you are going to make a Black Widow movie, do it about her origin and the Red Room, that is what every fan wanted, to see her origin in the Red Room. But Disney was like no let's not do that let's make pointless film set between Civil War and Infinity War, which story and saga is done and over. It was pointless and Nat wasn't even the main character in her movie, it was Yelena then Red Guardian then Nat, like I'm not even joking.

Spy thrillers are a dime a dozen. Did we really need another? This was so much better.Scarlett Johansson always shines brightest in truly dramatic roles. Apparently, Natasha does too, because she's never shined brighter. From her dealings with her long-lost family to the way she handled her adversaries, we got to finally understand what makes Natasha tick and why she truly was the glue holding the Avengers together.The pacing was great. I enjoyed the hand-to-hand and even the CGI stuff, mandatory for a Marvel blockbuster, but the family moments made the movie. It's all heart.No one showed more heart than the star herself..
While many actors might have been tempted to use the executive producer title to insure themselves the spotlight, Scarlett opted to use hers to just make the best movie possible, even setting up a bright future for those who'd take her place. She surrounded herself with first-class talent and made sure everyone had a chance to shine.My only complaint is that this will be our last Black Widow movie with Natasha front and center, but I'm willing to wager all the infinity stones at the TVA that Black Widow 2 will have Scarlett Johansson's name listed among the executive producers.This was a perfect send-off for a beloved character.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I went into the cinema expecting standard Avenger flick, and left god-smack as how mature, well-written and highly performed this movie was. From characters, to written plot; from fight scenes, to directing; from plot to great humour; from scenery to set designs. Every single box is a big fat tick. You do not even have to be a fan of the Avenger series, as the movie successfully stands on its own two feet. Yet, it also starts to suttlely place the foundation for next phase of the Avengers franchise. This movie was such a surprise. A 10 is usually reserve for my absolute favourite movies of all time, so a rating 9 is impressive.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

The quality of the Captain Marvel movie may be an unexpected problem, because that character is so powerful, but Black Widow? No, no, she has a world of potential to explore, but what I just watched could really be thrown in the trash right away. The action scenes are acceptable, by Marvel standards, but the plot is really bad, is Natasha the main character or not? I don't see anything to prove that. How does she change throughout the film? Nothing. Oh I know that's her hair color. The music is so annoying, the supporting characters appear like scarecrows, it's really sad that the studio treats Natasha like that. Bland, sexualized, uninteresting. If only I had the rights to edit the script, I would have Yelena and Natasha talk about a garden she likes somewhere in the middle of the movie, corresponding to where Natasha's tombstone is placed at the end of the movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Clearly they are upset women are getting more of a push, The funniest review i saw had someone complaining that it has men shown as evil pigs or whatever and thats why he hated the movie LoL but lets be real ?? In the comics 90% of the villains are males so what they cryin about.Another complained Black Widow wasnt using her beauty and Sexy charm to seduce n charm her enemies but like cmon you know how much backlash could occur if the directors went on that direction? Suddenly many would complain its sexist or such historical Manly views on women. Their trying to change things from the comics cause the comics was all written back then during a different era in how things were :
Example being all characters mostly were white, or females with busty hourglass bodies dressed in revealing outfits, etc.Marvel and DC is now in a new era and thus their are kany changes from the comics.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

When watching a movie you can sometimes tell how it's going to play out, the MCU trope is definitely the one you can see in a mile away, but it works when they have a good story and Black Widow doesn't have one. Especially when the characters they give you, you don't care about. There's so many flaws in the movie, and it's surprising that they still greenlit this one. It's more of a fan service but other than that the film is whatever. The villain is surprisingly bad and the way they tried to make the character connect within the story is just lazy writing. There goes a villain, Taskmaster, that I was anticipating to see just turn to a lame sheet paper written character right next to other villains that MCU didn't do justice.Throughout the film you get a bit of both, which some might call it story and action, but it's layered with bad pacing and editing to which you don't care much of what is happening. There's a point in the movie that the filmmakers try to give you a glimpse of the ""family reunion"" by doing a catch up, and making you understand more so of WHO these characters are. Trying to give you emotional feeling but it sure does go on for a little too long which makes the scene overwhelming.Finally, some of the action sequences are too wonky, which is mainly the editing that makes it feel out of place. Although, there's a specific scene that I enjoyed was when Black Widow and Taskmaster first fought, which is surprisingly baffling that they gave you these other action sequences that are too crappy.The ""best"" part is the after credits, which showcase what's going to happen in the following MCU story giving it a full circle. Other than that the movie falls flat becoming abysmal.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some spoilersPros:
The new characters! Not only does everyone already love Natasha aka the Black Widow but the Marvel Universe brought in a new cast to love, specifically Yelena (Pugh) and Alexei (Harbour). These new characters brought out not only their own fun and strength but depth in Natasha's character as well. Definite scene stealers!The depth of the film. This movie touches on Natasha's childhood and a brief history of the Black Widows and how they are basically all human trafficked. You get a glimpse of the industry of girls trafficked and the abuse that goes on. It makes Natasha's story a lot more impactful, it wasn't only her that was sterilized and suffered a lot of pain.Great directing and action scenes! The director of this film did a great job, she captured a perfect combination of action, depth, sadness, intensity, lightness and humor. There are some scenes where the fighting and aftermath of the fight scenes is more realistic but yet some moments so huge it could never be realistic! Congrats to a job well done.Cons:
Villains. The villain of this film is not captivating whatsoever. With comic book movies today the villain needs to be just as interesting half the time as the hero. In this case, it's not. You are more interested in the main characters by far. They needed a more personal touch to the villain and the impact on Natasha.Some violence was brutal. The fight scenes can be extremely violent and sometimes it's not really for any important reason. It would have been better if they saved extreme fight scenes for the important scenes. It would have been more meaningful.No cameos. If you were hoping for a big Marvel character cameo you will be disappointed. This movie takes place during Captain America Civil War and Avengers Infinity War when the Avengers are going through a rough patch, so we know they are off doing their own thing. Natasha does mention them being her family though.8/10.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

It often feels like they added Scenes as an afterthought to explain some action in the movie, what disappoints me the most. Often I got the feeling that the main Characters were constantly jumping between Coldhearted, Over natural fighters and then to light-hearted, maybe even ""fragile"" woman with big hearts. While booth are okay to use in a Story, the mixture just feels forced and bad. I'm sure that Cinema Sins will have a fun time picking on all the plot holes!In total, this move has some nice strong scenes, especially in empowering female Heroes, but its story completely disappoints.I ah sure that the movie would have gotten better reviews if it would not be in the MCU, as this means an obvious comparison to the Other movies in the MCU and in this regard the Movie is disappointing for me as I feel like it neither follows up on the Characters already established nor the general tone of the MCU. This film tries too hard to build its own closed of Story and does not pick up any existing Story of the MCU.I had high hopes for this Movie, and I sadly got disappointed.TL;DR: at best average film, disappointing for MCU standard. 3/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie put me on the edge of my seat! I adored it. Nice to finally have this movie after getting delayed constantly due to the global pandemic.Now, don't go in expecting this to be a big, Avengers scale. It's a prequel and a side adventure paying tribute to Black Widow after her death in Endgame. This entire film was a total spy thriller!! It didnt feel like your typical MCU superhero film and that's what I really dug about!! Great scenes and dialogue with the family!! And I'll say the family dynamic is the best part. Natasha has to deal with things that happened in her past before she was an Avenger and there is also a fantastic cover of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit in the prologue that really set the movie's tone. That's my reviewOne last thing, stay til after the end credits for an epic bonus.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I was definitely getting Bourne flashbacks but was really keen to see where that went. Well it threw that out the window pretty quickly and resorted back to MCU tropes of ridiculous action scenes and mega-explosions, the final 30 mins especially were just so outrageous and over-the-top. I also found the accents really off-putting, the faux-Russian voices often gave a comedic element to what was meant to be gritty or emotional dialogue and really undermined the performance of otherwise incredible actors. I feel like this was a real missed opportunity to depart from MCU expectations and deliver a darker, more realistic film without the overload of superheroes, alas...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film would have been A LOT better if it had :Florence Pugh as Yelena Bolova is a fantastic addition to the MCU, I need her in every film even if it doesn't make any sense. There was a lot of great potential in exploring Natasha's past and present, both of which have her experiencing a fallout with her foster and found families, it would've been a great psychological character study on the world that she has been brought up in.But instead, the film goes with the most generic choices available, a mash-up of different espionage films and stories seen a hundred times before with some terrible writing, overlong action set-pieces, and laughably bad CGI. It's a not good sign when the story (Budapest) within the story is more interesting than the actual story.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Cheesey in parts formulaic in most. Frances Pugh, Scarlett Johansson and Rachel Weisz carried this badly written story, that had so much Cgi it had a Tombraider game feel.Ray Winstone's part was written from some 6 yr old's comic, and unlike the women, he didnt carry it off. I'm sure the pay was worth it, hopefully between Frances and the other two, they can put their money behind a beter script next time.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie is full of action scenes, especially the hunt with the BMW X3 through the streets of Budapest is fun to watch. This makes this movie really for the big screen. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh play well off each other. David Harbour is very loose and funny as the Red Guardian. And Ray Winstone is viscerally effective as the megalomaniacal villain Dreykov.Light, humorous and uplifting, this film touches on themes of sibling rivalry, grievances with estranged parents and female defiance in the face of gender-based exploitation. An all around substantive and likeable film. Strongly recommended to devout MCU fans and even neophytes to the franchise.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The comic version. She is a character that has deep roots in the comic universe and they were wasted in the Avengers movies and when she had a chance to become something bigger they had the wrong actress. So when you have this actress in a vehicle that is supposed to be her origin/swam song you expect a huge kick ass movie. FAIL!!!!! Scarlett Johansson is wooden and just not what you expect as her final movie to be present in the role. She is carried by her cute/funny as hell co-star Florence Pugh. This girl carried the movie and when she shows up down the road in the MCU will be well received and will be a force to be reckoned with.Overall, I went because I wanted it to be good. I will be forced to buy it because I am a slave to the Disney/Marvel machine. I will not enjoy it though.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's like story should start at a point and end at another point. Just mix some dialogues and special effects in the middle.

Sadly I never thought I would say this as a massive die hard marvel fan but this was the most boring and pointless MCU film to date. The first hour was extremely boring and this film added nothing new to the MCU. Having established its time frame, we knew the ending before it even got going and that added to it being even more boring and predictable. Evan the action scenes were boring and predictable and nothing new to add to the experience. On the plus was nice seeing william HURT again and made us really want him back chasing the hulk. This may have been better coming out a few years ago, say maybe before infinity war but not now. Sorry marvel but this film is the weakest of the MCU and maybe a few years to late to arrive.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

To quote the god father ""look how they massacred my boy"" if you are a fan of the character you will be severely disappointed in this portrayal if you know nothing about this character than you will still probably be severely disappointed for how they cop out with the conclusion of the character they establish the second biggest sin of the film is they revel an absolutely amazing gut punch character decision through a back flash but once again the film cops out and pulls it punches the only pro this film has is the family dynamic involving Natasha and the supporting cast in conclusion the film advertised itself as gritty spy thriller like the newer bond films but in reality it just comes off campy and cheesy like the classic bond films minus the charm just go back and rewatch winter soldier.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A case of too much hype? Regardless, I hardly think this movie deserves to be torn apart.The action sequences in this film were intricate and awesome. I do wish that they would've toned it down a little. Since Natasha doesn't have super powers, some of it was pretty unbelievable that she could get up again. But I had a lot of fun during the action scenes.I loved the cinematography and production. The cast also did a great job, Pugh was pretty standout. But Scarlet did a great job playing a more vulnerable version of Natasha. She's on the run away from her Avenger family and back facing the man who ruined her entire life. She's not smug or putting on a show for Tony and the gang. I thought she was excellent.I will agree with some complaints that the villain aspect of this could've been stronger. It did sometimes feel like they were fighting a ghost due to the lack of scenes he was physically in.Overall I think the over-hype has sadly been this film's enemy. It's still a good, enjoyable installation to the MCU.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

By the way, the identity of Taskmaster was predictable for me.Don't understand why it received so many negative reviews. It's funny, entertaining and very emotional. Many were complaining about the weak villain. But, I think as Natasha is just a trained agent and not a super soldier or a God or has power of any infinity stone, it was good decision to take a not so strong villain.

And what's up with making her father a comic relief? That just didn't fit with the movie at all.Natasha as a character is so iconic and the movie had so much potential, but that all is wasted in a predictable storyline, boring antagonist, forced and unlikable humor, bad CGI and choppy pacing. I was hoping for a true origin story that actually centered around her youth and Budapest in the soviet times. Not the copy-paste modern times semi-scifi garbage it was.I give it 2 stars, but only because of Scarlet Johanson. Her acting is good.

Considering that the main character doesn't have superpowers, there is no option but to focus on good action sequences, chases, and spectacular rescues in the purest 90s action movie style. This works if you are looking for a film to leave in the background while you're cooking some delicious bolognese pasta. Entertaining if you don't pay too much attention to the plot and if you manage to avoid sentimentality.The bad:
Marvel Studios wanted to go out and brag about their Ferrari, but they didn't realize that the gasoline tank was almost empty. This story is really like the Ferrari. It looks pretty on the outside, following the tone of the entire MCU, but it doesn't work, because the spark to turn it on isn't useful enough.If we look at it from the perspective of the entire saga, it doesn't contribute anything that could not have been justified in a brief scene from another future canon film. The main character's arc is unaffected at all, it doesn't sort out loose ends from chronologically subsequent movies (if there are any), and it doesn't focus on Nat's real origin, other than a couple of conversations. They could have included tons of different cameos, or introduced iconic characters for the rest of the series, but sadly none of that is here (and don't make up tales saying that Valentina Allegra de Fontaine will be iconic).If we see it from the particular perspective, as an isolated product, it does not work either. If it were just another Bourne-style spy action movie, it would have been a total flop. And the villains? They are not convincing at all. Taskmaster, having enormous potential, is a real waste of character here.This movie is skippable, even more than the first 2 TV series of the MCU.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

There is much action throughout, the characters are spectacular, and the post-credit scene gave me chills. Although I believe Taskmaster could have had more potential, it is still a wonderful movie and was worth seeing in the theater. I feel like the scenes with the Red Room could have been improved but overall it's a movie I would see again!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Marvel has spent nearly a decade building up the mysterious black widow character's backstory only to have it unraveled and crumbled in an awkward-paced and unnecessarily long standalone film. The inorganic and too often forced sentiments demonstrate nothing more than inferior character development. Marvel had all the time in the world to do justice for a fan-favorite female superhero, but no... and what's even worse? Black widow (AS THE TITLE SUGGESTS) was just that much less of a protagonist, than her little sister.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

While by no means a bad film (what marvel movie is?) ""Black Widow"" is an action packed spy drama somewhere in the realm of Mission: Impossible. The Actors are all phenomenal in this film with the core ""family"" Johansson, Pugh, Weisz, and Harbour giving it their respective best. The film also has a nice lighting design and well choreographed action if not always well shot. Shortland's direction is great and I hope to see more from her in the future. This doesn't rank among Marvels best, but it's not supposed to. This is a good movie and a welcome return to the films of the MCU. I look forward to see if Pugh's character will grow from this point.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

For over a decade now, that kind of gap in MCU movies was unheard of (we really are spoiled aren't we?), and while the good folks at Marvel been tiding us over with a plethora of mini-series over on Disney+, fans have been chomping at the bit for the silver screen experience once again.Obviously, Black Widow was not designed to shoulder the expectations of Marvel's big return to the movies, and I think fans would be right to keep that in mind. Nonetheless, this is a great blockbuster and standalone outing for the MCU's first female superhero - one who's been long overdue to headline a movie of her own.Black Widow follows the titular hero after the events of the MCU's ""Civil War."" Already in a precarious situation, Natasha's life gets further complictaed when her distant past gets unexpectedly thrust back into her life.Black Widow was somehow more serious than I expected and more funny than I expected simultaneously. As far as Marvel movies go, this is most comparable to ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" in its tone and style. That's fitting, given that the spy thriller genre fits the character like a glove. Still, I think viewers' mileage with the plot may vary. This is due mainly to the villains, whom I found to kind of be duds that could have had greater potential. Additionally, while not an issue per se, the plotting is not overly complex or full of the twists that you might expect given the genre.Where the movie really shines is in the family dynamic that it creates for Natasha. The supporting cast that comprises this odd little unit is fantastic. Florence Pugh in particular, whose other work I have never seen before, was especially endearing and a real standout. The relationships were the best part of the movie for me. They are funny and emotional all at once, and are used to great effect to explore Natasha's past and what makes her tick. Almost since her introduction to these movies 10 years ago, the character has been talking about doing what she does to atone for the mistakes of her past, and we finally get that fleshed out in a way that makes her character arc more substantive.Coming as a surprise to very few, Marvel yet again nails the action. It's full of great set pieces and visceral hand-to-hand combat. One complaint I do have is that our heroes walk away from a couple of situations more easily than they should have, given that they are regular, non-superpowered humans in this universe; this noticeably lowered the tension for me by the end.All in all, I give ""Black Widow"" a 7.5 - it's a flawed but highly entertaining blockbuster that doesn't change the fabric of the MCU, but does finally flesh out one of its more prominent figures.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sure, she ain't my favorite actress, but I liked her in Lucy (2014) and Spongebob movie (2004). And Black widow seems to be the most well known role of hers. And a spin-off movie was inevitable. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as most fans and non fans would expect.The plot is very boring and doesn't know what exactly to focus on. It goes from Natasha Romanoff leaving the avengers and looking for her family members, then it suddenly about some sort of a villain that wants to take over the world by hypnotizing women aka other black widows with some special mind control gas. I must say, the orgin story of Natasha was actually well done. It explains how she became one of the avengers. And it happened because of herself being separated from her family.Not to mention that the soundtrack really sets up the suspenseful and dramatic feeling with the cover of a popular rock song by Nirvana. Also, the action scenes were not bad at first, but it after a couple of times, you easily get bored of them. What makes me upset, is that the film has a lot of bad dialogue. And there was a rather disgusting one about removing reproductive organs. Honestly, I tried my best to make this sentence less disgusting. But it was very pointless and distracting.None of the characters are memorable. Natasha Romanoff was just the strong female character that tries to save the world. But her performance by Johansson wasn't too bad and her stunts were done realistically! Her sister Yelena is just generic. The only thing that I remember about her is that she has her strong Russian accent. And that's it. The villain Dreykov seems to have potential at being a mind controlling villain that is upset about his loved one's death. But due to it's weak execution and bad acting, he was just dull. The Red guardian character is the old type that still wants to be a superhero. Sadly, he was forgettable as others. Even if he tried to be more comical than others, he was still bad.Still, this movie had some well done scenes, like the car chase. Honestly, I'm a big fan of such scenes, since they give an adrenaline rush that will boost up the mood. However, there were other films that did this stunt better.Honestly, it's better to skip this film for non Marvel fans. Not sure about fanboys and fangirls who would binge every single film, maybe there's a chance that they will enjoy it. However, it was as bad as Maleficent 2 and Interview with the vampire. It probably has potential and if it was done in the right hands, then it would've been enjoyable. Sadly, it turned out to be a very dull and confusing feature.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

What can you expect though? The Black Widow is not a true hero in my honest opinion so this is just another basic Spy/Espionage plot. It's also cheaper to do these kinds of films and not incorporate a lot of CGI so I understand the financial factors and profit margins. Pretty conventional story though.On a positive note, this film is definitely better than Morbius, The Fantastic Four (2015), X-Men: Dark Phoenix, The New Mutants and the Eternals (possibly Black Panther as well, that film was just a mess).The movie wasn't worth going to the theaters for (like I did out of boredom and an excuse to go out) but it might be worth watching at home if you have absolutely nothing else to pass the time with.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

To care about the story, I must first care about the characters. Unfortunately, knowing Natasha's fate at the end of Avengers Endgame made my interest in her character falter.The film took a blind stab at Natasha's past while also trying to introduce new characters to the MCU. Unfortunately, nothing substantial was added to the story of Black Widow. The gravity of Budapest was lacking, the truth behind the Black Widows was ill-conceived and I was just bored throughout.There were a few unique moments of storytelling and some clever callbacks to other entries in the MCU. Florence Pugh was great, though all the fake Russian accents were grating at times.Had this movie come out right after Civil War, I would have enjoyed it more. Unfortunately, knowing the fate of the main character makes this film seem like an afterthought.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It dispenses with the world saving high stakes of her Avengers ensemble films and has a much smaller scale, with a greater character focus which I loved. In style and tone this is more akin to The Winter Soldier, functioning as a more gritty spy movie than big superhero blockbuster.Her character arc and transformation from her previous appearances is explored more fully in this film, as we return to the oft alluded to dark past she thought she had left behind. We explore the inner workings of the Widows and all of this is done so well, feeling quite James Bondy at times. Getting this exploration of Natasha was long overdue and very welcome.The plot is good, with lots of emotional beats and solid action throughout. They really do just know how to tell stories on film over at Marvel Studios. The pacing is always spot on and Black Widow was no exception. The action was expertly crafted and the set pieces looked great up on the IMAX screen.The Marvel casting team very rarely miss, and aside from a slightly dodgy Russian accent from Ray Winstone, the cast were spot on. Florence Pugh is easily one of the best actresses working right now and her introduction to the MCU was triumphant. Everything about her character was perfect, from the emotion and backstory to the trademark Marvel humour, they nailed it all. David Harbour was equally brilliant and I do hope we get to see his Red Guardian again, I would be interested to see a Disney Plus show with him as our protagonist. Rachel Weisz I could have done with more of, but that's a small gripe. Scarlett was of course great in the role, she knows this character back to front by now and did her justice. The interactions between all 4 of these characters were so fun to watch.As with any great Marvel film, we also see some connections forming with other characters and MCU projects. Phase 4 is well and truly underway and I can't wait to see how everything comes together.Black Widow may not reach the heights of Marvel's best like Infinity War, but it has so much going for it and it is a most welcome addition to the MCU. Primarily this is due to its gritty action and superb cast of characters. If this really is the end for Black Widow in the MCU, then it was a glorious exit and a fitting end to the MCU's original female badass.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

I'm not gonna say it's wrong. Personally though, I have no clue why Marvel feels the need to start tackling political topics. I get it, they want to be informative, and that's great, I respect that; but they're a company which makes superhero films. I can't speak for other people, but I don't have fictional characters as my idols now, but as a child I would. But even then, how am I going to understand the fact that the Falcon gets racial discrimination? I just don't see the point. Why would I go to watch a film about a superhero to learn to respect women, and why would I watch something because its main attraction for audiences is the fact that it's left wing and politically sound with decent human standards? It's not a bad thing, but I don't want to be lectured when I already understand that women should have equal rights no questions asked. In short, while I liked the action and thought it was more structured than the Falcon and the Winter borefest, it annoys me that Marvel can't just let women and men and all races and sexualities be equal in a regular way (normalising it) rather than having to go out their way to say ""Hey look, it's a female! Now we should all know being a female is cool, but females go through a struggle every day!"" It isn't appealing to me certainly, and judging by the reviews, it appeals to some people, but not everyone, which seems to be different from most Marvel Films. If you want a good classic Marvel show or film with a female protagonist , just go and watch WandaVision and save your money.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

That is the single creation that was actually created in the MCU. Yes, like all the other Avengers she was also originally created in the comics books, but unlike all the others Black Widow of the comics books is a collection of fragments that sometime contradict previous ones, not a real living breathing creature like Captain America, The Hulk, Iron Man. Even The Vision and the Scarlet Witch got more character built for them in the comics books (which the MCU failed to use, but TV seems to be taking it over now). But the Black Widow we come to know and love is the creation of the movies the directors, the writers and more than anyone else - the creation of Scarlett Johansson who made Natasha Romanoff her own.Now there are two possible reasons for her demise at the Avengers Endgame - either she didn't want to keep on doing this role or the directors producers decided they didn't want her anymore. I've been thinking a lot about this issue. I've listened very carefully to Scarlett own words regarding her role as the Black Widow. I can't believe she didn't want to keep on doing it. She probably won't say a thing, she's a professional and she knows the rules of the game, but she knows she still had more to give as the fiery spy she created. The problem is why would the creative team of the Marvel MCU want to finish her off? Well, as I said I thought a lot about this question and I personally believe she became too big for her own good. They never thought of her as anything more than a secondary role and were surprised themselves by her growing popularity, popularity that forced them to give her a full size movie dedicated to her exploits. But they couldn't let it grow any further, so they killed her and I personally hate it more than any other stupid thing they did in Endgame in order to surprise us.Now, lets examine this movie for itself. It doesn't always make sense. Like I wouldn't advise anyone to try severing a nerve to the brain for a minor example. But on the other hand it has wonderful roles and superlative acting by the entire cast. Even if some of them don't really have the complete character making sense like Natasha Romanoff does or like the great complete roles written down for Florence Pugh and for David Harbour. Ray Winstone gets a very good villain role to play, and he plays it well. They all do even, the incomplete ones like Rachel Weisz. So we get an action film with a very big heart and a very big moral issue carried with it. It may not be to everybody's liking but I personally loved it, and I don't think Scarlett Johansson would have taken it any other way. I'm not going to discuss anything else regarding this movie - it's all done very professionally and it's all beside the point.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I definitely think this compares well with ""Winter Soldier"".","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Finally we get to see her ARC. Unfortunately the mark was missed. The story line was weak and predictable. I kind of had an idea what the movie was going to be by the trailers and sure enough it was. Rachel Weiss , while I love her, was wasted in this movie. David Harbour, is awesome, but his character was again predictable and while he did provide some comedic relief, it was in a way out of place. Newcomer Florence Pugh was good, but also a novice and well Scarlett Johansson was good but I've seen her do better.Disappointing, weak story...don't waste your money.

Loved to see her in a individual Marvel space. Expecting more in the continuation and can already connect the dots on where it is going with bucky, new cap and Yelena.There is a big BUT. I couldn't connect with her emotinally. I wish they could show her past more. The family reunion was good but it was too fast to connect. The story has loop holes in many places. Not convincing at all. I watched the movie in 3-4 breaks. And finished watching just to see post credit scenes.As usual Marvel always find ways to put humor in scenes, kudos to the writers.The action sequences are pretty much super heroic it would have definitely give great experiance in theater. But on OTT platform it is missing that spark.In the end it is a good bye to a great Marvel character who has shown emence potential to overcome from any situation. Without having any superpower blackwidow survived and gave great life lessons. It could have been much better send off. I Would love to see Scarlet in different roles in the Marvel Universe.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The plot is just decent, the villains are just alright and some jokes hit better than others, but the movie manages to be more than the sum of its parts; dark, often understated for a Marvel movie (though not the finale, for sure) and emotionally resonant in the moments where it tries. Think Winter Soldier but channelled through AMC's Killing Eve.The biggest plus by far is Florence Pugh, who manages to bring exactly the type of wild chaotic nonchallant energy to the movie that Jodie Cormer brings to Killing Eve's Villanelle. If she is indeed the the successor to Romanof's Black Widow, then I honestly can't wait to see her alongside the new and remaining Avengers cast.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ahh, yes. The beginning.A movie that never seems to get better as you keep watching, it very quickly becomes a MCU near carbon copy of every MCU movie made. There is nothing that sets it apart IMO. All the best action scenes are in the front half & best light moments are also you guessed it, in the front half. The acting is very bland, no heart as expected in these ""superhero"" movies. Apart from Pugh who was very solid all around. Black Widow is a very predictable movie that seems like it doesn't fit into the larger scale of the MCU. It seems it's a good way to get Scarlett Johansson into the MCU for a bigger role later on. Disappointing & boring. Some action scenes are good & well done. But save you money & watch it when it's on streaming sites instead of at the movies IMO. You wouldn't remember this movie in a few months time. If I could describe the movie in 1 word.

So, before the logos I had already thought to myself ""I'm gonna love this movie"". I enjoy more grounded Marvel films (that feel like they are set in the real world). For me the question that drew me into Marvel films was ""what do comic book superheroes look like in real life"" so I love the more earth based, limited superheroes (that if you squint they could be real) and fights that involve guns and cars blowing up (not vague space things). The action was satisfying, and gave me ""old school action movie"" vibes. The ""heart "" of the film (it's characters and relationships) was it's greatest strength. It's deadpan, cold humour was also great. Although in one sense new characters stole the show, the way there stories and Romanoff's were grown together made it a fitting send off for her (and gave us new supers to root for).Just to help you out my top Marvel films ranking goes
1. Black Panther
2. GOTG
3, Black Widow
4. Avengers (1)
5. Winter Soldier.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sure no crazy gadgets but the action was amazing.They did an amazing job using such short time to build up the backstory of Natasha and Yelena and then the beginning intro credits they started flashing through many scenes/images that all connected to how the upbringing/emotional/mentality of both Of them. It was very effective thats for sure.It gives u all these emotions as u watch the flashing scenes which brings u a sense of understanding of what they may have went through or experienced.The chemistry between Yelena and Natasha was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it very much as well as the Red Guardian too.Many funny moments and insane action packed crazy stunt work.I use to think a marvel comics movie has to have powers for the lead character or it will suck but this movie has made me consider differently. Some might say but Punisher had no powers but the action scenes werent as good even though it was just a tv show while this is a movie.Overall this movie has made me excited to watch Shang Chi thats coming out soon because if they can make this movie with lead character with no powers so successful then that movie surely will be amazing too.I really hope they bring back black widow in the future because Scarlet Johansson is the best!! Maybe they may try to bring white widow to replace ? But either way i hope they do! Cause it wouldnt be avengers without a hero with no powers on the team (not to mention shes got a nice fit booty whoops i mean body ^_^","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Black Widow shows the story of one of our favourite character from MCU our beloved Black Widow. This movie answers almost all the question we earlier had about Natasha's character. We finally got to know the origin of Black Widow, we now know Clint and Nat were hiding in a small place in Budapest for two days & now we know what Red Room is.Talking about the merits and demerits of this movie, here I would clearly like to mention that I loved this movie a lot more then Wonder Woman 1984. I was already emotionally attached with the character of Black Widow, and this movie introduced us with her second family. Few may find the emotional portion of the movie a little low but for me it was beautiful. The action scenes and its cinematography is top notch and the background music gives it more life. The CGI of the movie matches the level MCU has made for themselves. Scarlet Johanson is so perfect as Black Widow and we are going to miss her a lot as Black Widow. Florence Pugh as Yelena is so perfect hats off to the casting directors. It will be a delight to see Florence portraying Yelena and how she fits the shoe of Natasha. David Harbour as Alexi is so convincing that he makes us believe this funny character to be the nemesis of Captain America.Talking about the demerit of the movie, the antagonist of the movie isn't as frightening as he should have. I was personally hoping Taskmaster to be more dangerous.This is a treat from MCU to its fans, and its sure MCU's fans aren't going to miss this tribute to Natasha Romanoff.4/5**","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was easy to follow.I loved that Black Widow had her own movie...especially without a love interest. It was great to see the main relationships were familial and accurate, funny dialogue reflected that.I thought this movie was easy to follow. It took us on a trip of one of the many lives Natasha lived and her noble desire to do good. Scarlett Johansson was an executive producer and I felt like her choices were wonderful. Her character wasn't sexualized and the women kicked butt in this movie.Maybe there's haters because apparently when it's a bunch of men fighting, it's kosher, but not when it's women?I hope women superhero movies become more the norm. This is and Captain Marvel (which I thought was not as great, but most origin stories aren't) show that us women will watch an action movie and feel empowered even if it doesn't fit the mold of a rom com.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

All in all the action scenes are great and the movie is well paced. The chemistry between black widow and her sister is fantastic and they bounce off each other well. I especially enjoyed her mocking the poses.It's also good to see more great actors in Rachel Weisz and Ray Winstone get a showing in the MCU.A great send off for the character in my opinion.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Did you succeed? It seems like yes, but if you consider it as a spy thriller, do not pay attention to some jambs in the plot. And so, it is possible to get pleasure, especially for lovers of action and adventure. Purely the film does not try to draw into what is happening, just turn off the brain and welcome to the world of industrial spy entourage, a kind of James Bond, only a female plan. The character Elena Belova, in fact, holds the film in her fist, she drags more.But honestly, the film caused me very controversial feelings, my expectations were higher. A very disposable movie that you are unlikely to want to watch again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The single exception to this rule, the rather obvious diversity hire playing Mason, O-T Fagbenle, is easily the worst performance in the film, and Ray Winstone (terrible accent), William Hurt and even the Taskmaster character are wasted and disastrously underused, offering no real threat and hardly being onscreen at all.Johansson and Florence Pugh are both solid, but they have very little of any substance to work with. There's no weight to any of the emotional scenes and just about all the jokes fall flat. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour as the parents are OK but their characters' changing behaviours (and ability to construct sentences in English) make no sense. The big change made to the Taskmaster was a disappointment as well and detracted from the character.In the final analysis, it's not the very worst superhero film ever - and certainly not as bad as Captain Marvel or WandaVision - but the last half hour falls apart VERY badly, and the rest of it is a long, dull and largely underwhelming slog, with nothing you haven't seen many times before in better movies, just done quite a bit worse, and in this it bodes badly for the future of Marvel.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

Because, of course, only their view of how MCU movies ""should be made"" ever really count for anything.{Back to normal programming}I won't go into further detail about the movie, as i'm sure there are people who are straddling the proverbial fence on whether or not they'll actually watch the movie.To the latter point (i.e. Contemplation on viewing), i highly recommend that you most certainly do. As to why? This is a tribute Black Widow deserved - and the character many MCU fans came to love (myself included) did meet with an untimely demise, so she most assuredly deserved a send off on this raucous, wild scale. To that end, the direction, screenplay, dialogue and story line (mostly) achieved that goal.Oh, one last point: it has to be reinforced that this movie is a snapshot into Black Widow's past lives; weaving it into a tapestry that gives viewers a better understanding of the person behind Black Widow - i'm quite sure the director didn't intend it to be a biographical (so, tough titties, OCD/PTSD types if it didn't meet your exacting standards on that front).And so here is the curtain call for that spectacular chanteuse. Fare thee well, Black Widow, i fear we shall not see the likes of such a bad-ass maiden ever again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Widows in the Marvel world face an unenviable fate: they are programmed to kill, made guinea pigs, self-destructing if they fail their missions, controlled by the megalomaniacal central antagonist Drake (Ray Winston). Natasha managed to escape, the others, including Elena, were not lucky at all. In the best traditions of the Jason Bourne trilogy, the action drags and unravels, pulsating and gaining momentum, which Marvel's solo films have previously had very little of.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unfortunately this feels more like a mediocre tv series with lots of unoriginal drama and soap.There is a heavy emphasis on family and the 'feminine'. The irony being that these actors couldn't lift half the stuff IRL - if the props were real. They rely on cool CGI and tough dialogue lines and all the other 'been there done that' bravado. Way too much.Not sure what's going on here. If it is crap directing, or poor material writing in general. Not even interesting cameos or other marvel characters make an entry. Super super lame the latter.Perhaps they were playing it safe and had braindead focus groups. Or perhaps the writers are out of touch or stuck in the past. The locations feel tacky and not very well integrated. It kind of jumps from this drama to the next drama event and becomes dull with the broken record tune of the awful past everyone was subjected to blabla bla. Gosh, talk about overstaying the welcome.It's a shame, the studio and producers probably knew the reception consensus and the opinion polls. Hence why we saw much marketing and tv spots and so forth.

The Question now becomes , is ""ok"" enough for a 200 million dollar disney production that plays out like it was made for a 4 part series on Disney+ not a movie.My Answer would be: ""not really"".The Movie started abit slow and the story was not all that interesting. The VfX as usual in the MCU movies was good, but you know it will be and expect that. In a time where you have shows / movies with similiar production value on netflix and disney+ with no extra cost ( This movie costs 30 USD in addition to the subscription on disney+) this just falls short for me.To the People that rated this movie 8 or higher i ask, would you have rated it as high if you strip out the marvel name and rename the characters - with no change to story or writing or anything but the names. I truly don't think so.If they had made this into a 4 - 8 Part show on Disney plus i wouldn probably say: ""Ok, its not worse than ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"", but also not better.""
But as a Movie it just falls short for me as it is.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

A solid return that would make every Marvel fan happy/excited. But, not satisfied.The film is really fun to watch especially that everyone is hungry for a Marvel Film. The film starts off in a great way that would confuse you a bit but in a good way because you would be curious to know why and how this is happening which would make you want to watch the film and continue it until the end. Something that surprised me is that although the film is 2h 15m, I didn't feel that.Black Widow is a character that we always wanted to know about her history. What happened to her? Who really is she? How did she become Black Widow? The film answered all of that. But, honestly, I expected more. I felt like her story was this typical story of a woman who becomes a spy/agent. Which in my opinion makes the impact on the character weak and little. The plot is just so predictable and there's nothing new about it at all. You would know where it's going and what'll happen. Also, the dialogues were cheesy and gringy at sometimesThe villain in the film was barely even there. For Taskmaster, all i'm saying is that they really ruined the character. One of the things that I was looking forward to was Taskmaster and I didn't even see him that much.The action scenes in the film were so enjoyable and fun, especially the opening. Watching those fight scenes brought up that excitement part in me that was always hungry for a Marvel (Action) Film.Scarlett Johnson's performance was obviously great as always. She always puts on a great performance, especially as Natasha Romanoff. Florence Pugh is one of the best things in the film. Not just that, also her character (Yelena Belova) is more than amazing. Pugh's acting was great especially in emotional/dramatic scenes. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz as well as their characters were also well done.The film's directing, CGI, cinematography, etc. Were all normal and nothing special about them which bothered me and wished if they were better so I could give the film a higher rating because those elements are important to any film and would make a difference.Black Widow felt like it is a film that is made only to satisfy the fans and not the story and where/how it fits into the MCU. It's is a solid return and a fun movie to watch especially on the big screen. But, I really expected more. Or in another way, I WANTED MORE.My rating is 7/10.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Too much family drama, not enough action, implausible plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7115660/?ref_=tt_urv","ginocox-206-336968","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57751100/?ref_=tt_urv","12 July 2021","Black Widow (2021), for much of its 113 minute running time, feels like what one might expect from a Lifetime direct-to-video movie: a dysfunctional family struggling to overcome personal and interpersonal issues to embrace traditional middle-class family values. Movie-goers who have eagerly awaited a Star Wars prequel featuring Ma and Pa Vader and baby Darth will probably enjoy Black Widow, while fans of the franchise will likely be disappointed. The characters talk about the Avengers, Tony Stark, and Captain America, but not even a brief cameo or an Avengers logo is shown.With many in Hollywood apparently still clinging to discredited allegations of Russian collusion, the villains are Russians . . . More or less. The main Russians are played by British performers Ray Winstone, Rachel Weisz, and Florence Pugh, and Americans David Harbour and Scarlett Johansson. To avoid any allegations of cultural appropriation, none of the performers, with the notable exception of Harbor, seems to act very Russian, even while drinking vodka and speaking Russian.Part of the reason the actors don't seem authentically Russian may be attributed to the self-conscious diversity among the throngs of evil minions. Russia is generally considered somewhat less racially tolerant and inclusive than the Antebellum South, but the throngs of elite female assassins in their leather bondage outfits are ethnically diverse, as they prepare to turn tables on men who treat women as subservient. Unlike most movies, they wear no hoods or masks, to fully display that they are female and diverse. But the notion of Russians tolerating racial diversity among an elite corps of commando assassins seems improbable, leaving the impression of pandering to progressives - which also seems incongruous in a film featuring extrajudicial executions, assassinations, unauthorized wiretaps, enhanced interrogations, et cetera.The movie seems to be about 40% family drama, 30% feminist female empowerment, 20% action, and 10% gratuitous CGI effects, with a generous measure of misandry throughout.The plot is an absurd contrivance based on radical feminist talking points exaggerated to comic proportions. The villain's actions make little sense, unless one ignores logic and assumes he is an insane misogynistic megalomaniac. It also makes little dramatic sense, as the action is reduced to manipulating images on a huge computer display. In a fashion worthy of Dr Evil, the villain made sure his years of preparation could be undone with a few keystrokes and built his secret fortress so the slightest damage would trigger a sequence of cataclysmic explosions.As is common among many recent Hollywood productions, there is no typical B-story romance, offering instead a tale of sisterly love between two girls who aren't really sisters and aren't particularly lovable.There are several well-choreographed action scenes, including several fights among female martial artists. Harbour's performance is noteworthy, until he is sucked into the maudlin family drama. The movie is a disappointment on several levels. The family drama is so bogged down in the mundane that the fantastic aspects of the superhero story seem less credible, particularly due to numerous gaps in the plot. Beyond that, the film seems a harbinger of future disappointing efforts by a film industry that increasingly seems more concerned with virtue signaling, posturing and proselytizing about political correctitude than entertaining audiences.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Taking place after Civil War, Natasha and her spy family try bring down the man responsible for creating the Widow program which controls orphaned girls into becoming killing machines. The film has a sick intro, a balanced start and a jam packed ending that feels rushed and somewhat anti climactic by the MCU standards making it all feel exactly like a second rate story about a second rate hero that came out 5 years too late.What often triggers me in Hollywood movies is when they poorly try to fit two languages into the plot which ends up being ridiculous. The mysterious language they were attempting to speak would be something close to how a 2 year old infant or a 95 year old toothless grandma would speak Russian because I couldn't understand a single word. If the film insists on creating this international spy vibe, the actors should at least put some effort into it. It kills the atmosphere and makes the movie look amateur when someone says a sentence in Russian and gets an English reply, or when the words on screens are bilingual.On top of this, we get huge inconsistencies in the narrative that jumps all over the place. The excessive action would suggest that we are watching a Captain America film because Natasha is clearly on some super serum based on how she falls from buildings and gets thrown all over the place. They could have gone for a slick spy-thriller style that would have used her agility, marksmanship and stealth but instead it was boom bang boom.I didn't hate the film but it all felt simply meh for a superhero flick. David Harbor was my favorite character as he was organic, honest and provided a few laughs. Florence Pugh did a fine job as well but Scarlett herself was flat and forgettable. The film had interesting villains but in the classical Marvel fashion, they got about 2 minutes of development. I also wished they would have shown Black Widow during her real spy days as the intro suggested but I guess that was too much to wish for.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

The plot is basically as interesting as any soap opera any dim-witted 1950's TV writer would have come up with.Sure... you got your gadgets, and your weapons, and your sexy female assassins devoid of reproductive organs, and your moronically impossible weapons (such as the retractable katana that the main foe manages to get out of her ass... sorry rucksack), and your amazingly impossible fight stunts... but in the end, the ""meat"" of the script is that stupid pathos that fails to be anything more than a carbon copy of 1950's all-american BS soap operas.Nothing new... nothing old as well (they managed to botch every single detail of that 1995 flashback... writers who weren't even born at that time think that back then it would be perfectly fine for a 12 year old girl in Ohio would have blue hair or run around in a mountain bike... I guess this is a new trend in film-making: rewriting the '80s and '90s as you would like them to have been).Bottom line: this is a fun action movie with all the fantasy you have come to expect from Marvel, plus some over-the-top ridiculousness that actually made me laugh to tears, because of how outrageously ridiculous these stunts were.Big thumbs up goes to Pugh: undoubtedly the best thing this movie has to offer. She outshines Johansen AND Rachel Weisz (who, IMHO is an absolute goddess of the silver screen). Watch out for her. Something tells me she's gonna be a huge star, if she keeps it up.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

The action was well choreographed and the jokes generally landed pretty well and we're quite funny. The soundtracks by Lorne Balfe was excellent and really helped to build tension. The cover of Smells like teen spirit during the opening credits is also amazing. The only complaint I have are with the villains. Taskmaster was a diabolically depicted and had more to do in the avengers video game. I felt like the reveal of their identity was lacklustre and I'm sure most people guessed who they were before it was revealed. Dreykov suffered from a lack of screen time but I felt like he was good in his scenes. The movie felt like it came too late and knowing how Natasha dies already takes away some of the tension as you know that she can't die. The new characters were great. The red guardian and Yelena. Overall, Black Widow is a great movie and I would highly recommend!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

(Iron Man, Avengers, Thor, Captain America etc)
Instead we got a movie that felt like it had zero connection to the Marvel universe at all, or like it was made by people who hadn't seen any of the previous Marvel movies, let alone worked in any of the productions?!The opening plot was exciting for the first 10 minutes but then it fell flat, and never recovered imho, and halfway through I was convinced Scarlet Johansson was only there to create enough buzz for the others to make a spinoff...I don't know anything about the director Cate Shortland, nor do I want to find out what other movies she's made in the past because this was so uninspiring. Really poor acting - or directing, whatever's at fault?Me and my kids have watched all of the Marvel movies up to the final Avengers time and time and time again - which is a true testament to great movies, but Black Widow is a movie I'll never watch again, which is a shame because I really love Scarlet Johansson when she's really into a role! This was a real ""meh"" moment...I'd hoped Rachel Weisz and Olga Kurylenko would have great parts and really lift the movie but one of them seemed sleeping and the other only showed her face twice - and only had one tiny line...
The only one at least trying to deliver was Florence Pugh - which is obviously set to return in a spinoff.I'm putting this Marvel film in the same bucket as most of the newer ones, you know the extra bucket for milking that cow dry to the bone, hoping the connection to the original Avenger movies will be enough to print more money, but I'm getting more and more fed up with how these new Marvel movies are made and gone are the good unique superhero movies, replaced with some cookie cutter - often feminist - replacements, and not good ones either.Your mileage might vary and I've seen reviews ranging from nil to max so please make up your own mind about Black Widow, but it's a Marvel movie I'd gladly had missed despite loving Scarlet Johansson as an actor because she can be really great with a good script and a good director!I know Jon Favreau is super busy and can't make everything himself, but if Marvel is going to continue making awesome movies we need him behind the reigns, or Taika Waititi for doing comedy variants, which I gather this one tried to be and failed so hard...P.s. The spoken Russian in the movie is abysmal, despite them supposedly being Russians... I mean couldn't they have spent a weekend with a speech coach teaching them their lines correctly?! My Russian is far from great but enough to make it feel like a comedy, not an action flick.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Great film that gives Black Widow the spotlight","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7650456/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","16 December 2021","So after a delay of over a year Black Widow is finally out and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Natasha Romanoff is on the run and forced to reunite with figures from her past to uncover a mystery.Main Character
Scarlett Johansson is back for potentially her final time as Black Widow and she is really good in the main role here. We have always seen her as a supporting player but she is thrust into the main character and thrives. Her really interesting backstory is further explored and it allows us as an audience to get more time with her and really see and learn more about her. She is also great in the action sequences and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast as well.Supporting Characters
Florence Pugh plays Yelena and for me she was the best part of the film. The chemistry between her and Johansson is fantastic and was the emotional crux of the film, she is great in the action scenes and nails the humorous and emotional scenes that are required. Dave Harbour and Rachel Weisz play there bizarre parents and they are both great, Harbour is sometimes seen as comic relief and does it well but also has some good emotional moments for him to deliver. Weisz is more stoic and intense but plays an important role and you see how these four are so dysfunctional but really need each other. As seen in the trailer Taskmaster is the villain here and I think diehard fans of the character will be disappointed but I thought it worked for this film. He reminded me of the T1000 from Terminator 2 and was just a warrior hunting Black Widow but there is very little character there to bet invested in. That links to the greater issue that is Ray Winstone as the villain and that whole part of the film, it is really generic and he isn't given anything interesting to work with and his motivations and whole arc is kind of in the background and it just didn't work for me.Story
The story is decent, this is basically a film about the concept of family and how it isn't always the people you choose and that part of the film was good for sure with all the actors really selling it and I grew to care about all of them and the relationships that get built up. But again my main criticism was the whole villain angle of the film, Taskmaster isn't as interesting as he could have been and the whole generic Russian bad guy is surely played out but used here and I also had an issue with the actual ending of the film. It is really abrupt and doesn't really make sense when linked up to its place in the timeline.Script
I thought the script was good, I have seen some criticism of the amount of humour involved but I actually though this film took itself quite seriously for the first act. The model for the MCU is to try and balance the humour and drama and I thought the film did it well, I felt the drama when it wanted and I laughed when it wanted so I give the film credit for that.Style
The film has some huge action set pieces but I thought they all worked really well, obviously there is a difficulty to raise tension and stakes with a prequel but the film did as good as possible with those limitations. The film is paced well, and felt an appropriate length, though maybe 5 more minutes at the end would have been appreciated.Overall
Overall, Black Widow is a great fun film that is worth the year long wait for big Marvel fans. If you are on board with The MCU then go and see Black Widow as you will enjoy it and there is a big post credit scene here too.Rating - 8/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now the pros the chemistry between the actors are great I would of loved to see them all in another film but we all know that won't happen. I feel that's mainly way the film is getting bad reviews Because they should of made this movie before avengers endgame because we all know the outcome. I think that was a bad move on marvel to wait so long.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Natasha a spy, a normal human falls off a three storey bulding and hits her head twice on some pipes and gets back up immediately without a scratch.The actors do their part but the script is haywire and there seems to be a lack of creativity from the people who helmed it , everything just comes across as mundane and flat.The villain, well....... Taskmaster shows up occasionally. The film tries to tie Natasha and the villain's stories together but it is done in such an odd
haphazard way that ultimately it leaves you feeling frustrated instead of emotionally capturing you.The movie is genuinely uninteresting and is an abysmal send off for one of the most beloved MCU characters and Actors. The editing is fine , the cinematography is bland, the music is forgettable.David Harbour and Florence Pugh may be the only positives in this film along with Scarlett's presence, all three of them have a genuinely good chemistry which does bring a few laughs and emotions from our side.The film has a weird and twisted morality and a clear and obvious undertone which it didn't need and quite frankly leaves a sick taste in your mouth.Don't waste Your time with this , go watch Winter Soldier instead.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Captain America, replaced by Black Widow. Bucky, replaced by Black Widow's sister Yelena. That's it. The End. The parallel's in the movie make you wanna' gag.On top of all that, there really isn't any good action until around 1 hour and 45 min into the movie. - and the movie is 2 hours and 15 min long.

As soon as I turned it on, I knew I was gonna be hooked because it's from Marvel. The only one that sucked I think was Harbour's satirical accent which he did not do that on 2019's Hellboy which was just a hell to have to listen to that. Pugh and Johansson was the real deal on this movie as they were the sidekicks who were kicking ass, Hurt was barely seen on this picture so can't really say nothing about him, Winstone was just a coward who had control but still got kicked though and beat, which was fun to see. We ended up seeing a lot of action but that's to be expected on Marvel movies. This one was a really good one so not sure where all the lowlife low reviews but this one was very well done and the least to say this was a 10 on my book.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Sthu. She was a nice surprise who did as good as others and she was able to because the writers gave her a character which they will milk for foreseeable future.Now on to the review.When I heard they're making black widow movie I thought it would be a proper send off to Natasha Romanov since they didn't do that in Endgame and gave 90% spotlight to the Diva that is Tony Stark. He wouldn't have those stones if not for her sacrifice. But then they made this movie which was lazy as hell but I was excited for Taskmaster. And then, after release people on the internet spoiled it for me. I knew the entire story before I watched this.Now despite everything I still liked this movie to give it an 8/10. First of all, one of the best looking marvel movie. Ragnork is on top of that list. Action is good, but bit too many cuts. Background score, specially Taskmaster's theme was pretty epic. CGI was rough towards the end but mostly it was great.Coming to the story, I liked the plot. They were doing so good setting up the challenges unfortunately the solutions which they apply they messed up. Bit of lazy writing there. Yes Taskmaster is different from comic but it was fine for me. They shouldn't have included that character in this kind of movie. But they did and utilized best they could.Anyway, I am not going to cry like a little boy because they didn't do justice to comics. As a movie this was great. It was less of a Black Widow send off and more of a Yelena setup. I had hoped Barton would be there in a Black Widow movie but they don't have to do what I expected. I am matured enough to watch a movie not based on what I wanted but whether what they have given is great and entertaining or not.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

They are a juvenile fantasy that has no basis in reality. Therefore, movies (like this one) that try to earnestly focus on the backstory and family dynamics of a superhero are doomed to fail. IMO, superhero movies work when they are fun, light-hearted, creative, and don't take themselves too seriously (e.g., Thor: Ragnarok). There are no action sequences or special effects in Black Widow that I haven't seen before. And I just wasn't that interested in the fact that a ""super assassin"" who was ""engineered"" by an evil Soviet regime had a dysfunctional family. I like Scarlet Johansson. But there just wasn't anything here for her to work with.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was also nice seeing Florence Pugh (Yelena), David Harbour (Alexei) and Rachel Weisz (Melina) play alongside one of our original six Avengers. Definitely worth the money for the premier access.

So what does that leave? Action sequences that are by-the-numbers, some token character backfilling, fairly mundane performances by all the cast, and some cringe inducing politics.Johansson, it has to be said, is ageing and tired looking. We know that she can give nuanced performances, and is particularly strong at reactions, but as the lead is given no opportunity to do so here. Still, she has presence, and carries the film, barely.Florence Pugh bring a personable performance and some surprisingly appealing chunkiness. She also gets to deliver the only real humour, although the single joke is overplayed. Will she be able to carry the inevitable sequel? I'm not convinced, but Disney will ensure that we get to find out.Rachel Weisz gives her usual solid, reliable performance, and it's nice to see Hollywood casting female leads in their 50s.Ray Winstone hams it up decently as Baddie Baddisov in the couple of scenes that he gets, but he's only there to embody toxic masculinity.The over-rated David Harbour plays his usual fat bumbling slob, and provides some fairly tedious comic relief in scenes ripped off from the Incredibles, before (of course) getting smacked around by a girl.For that matter, the final action sequence is swiped from the start of Saints Row 3, and there's not a lot of originality to be found elsewhere.It rips along at a decent pace, and it's perfectly competent - but only competent. The score and sound effects are overblown, as is annoyingly common now.There's nothing fresh or surprising or brave or clever here. And the politics are so predictably in your face. Woman good, men bad or incompetent, of course. But casting half the widows as African-Russians is bizarre, delusional and jarring even by Hollywood standards.It's watchable enough, but it feels very contractual, a filler piece to close out the MCU and introduce a next generation of younger, cheaper talent.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is a completely serviceable and rollicking Marvel movie, and fits in well with the rest of the MCU. The only real complaint I have personally, is that it should have been made years ago, so yes, I agree with some reviews that complain of the lateness of the project, but ScarJo really (always and consistently!) knows how to sell a scene -- and this film is no exception! And yes, I also agree that relative newcomer Florence Pugh is near impossible to look away from -- she has genuine big-screen gravitas, and is likely to go on to have a very rich and varied film career. I have read some incredibly vitreolic reviews and am floored by them -- just exactly what is it that has made them so angry? It is beyond my understanding. Filled with gorgeous men and women running around and having adventures all over the place, with little injections of humor and pathos here and there, not overdone, just right! Why would anyone complain? I had a ball, I laughed, I hid behind my hands, I bounced on the edge of my seat, and even shed a tear or two. A complete success of a movie, even if it was waayy too many years late in coming. Also, I love movies that rarely refer to gender, and don't try to push anything down your throat, and this was definitely one of those films. Gender-schmender! Who cares if the story is filled with mostly men or mostly women or anything in between? As long as the story gallops forward at a decent pace and inspires you to care about the characters. Yep, a total win! Don't listen to the nay-sayers, I am genuinely not sure what movie they watched.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

But ok, the Black Widow sounded a bit different, like she did not get some superpowers accidentally. She's supposed to be trained and dangerous...and Scarlett Johansson is an actress that I like, so I decided to watch. But what a waste of time.The script is weak and with many flaws. They don't know how to flesh out the characters or provide a thrilling story...that is, the little story that we get to see because for the most part the film is CGI action scenes and explosions. And the Black Widow doesn't feel as the protagonist of her own movie, just a passerby. There is not much insight or development about her character. She pouts and cries a lot, but where is the dangerous avenger? Another one who's pouting all the time is Rachel Weisz..she's a great actress, what did they do to her? They could also enter a competition for the most forgettable villain. It is also tiring the need for inserting the superhero team in every movie. Aren't there any other ideas? They had an interesting story, a charismatic hero and good actors, but nothing good came out of it...so much potential wasted.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

A VERY strong choice of female protagonists and a story that transcends the value of girl in our society. The story is worthy alone of how exciting the origins and depth of Black Widow. Male viewers may not like it as much as other Marvel movies, but this movie really struct a cord for the female demographic. I wish that Black Widow had a tv series to expand more of the character how how Scarlet is kinda of overlooked of the Avengers. This might be a action pack movie, but the story really puts perspective of some social issues that need to change. I hold this movie very dearly, more than any Marvel movie.

The woman part comes later, a good story comes first.You wanted to watch a commentary on the Cold War? Watch an actual documentary, or read a book, this is, was, and will be meant for entertainment. The viewer has to understand that Marvel Studios is now trying to please three generations of movie watchers - children, to reel in for selling merchandise; teens, for future films; and adults, who simply won't stop crying and complaining about everything.Iron Man, Captain America IS GONE! Come to terms with it!Speaking of the movie itself - phase IV is really off to a great start. Gone is the forceful, out-of-place humour MCU was criticised for. This film has some genuine moments filled with grief, and joy alike. Also, this film takes the final film of phase I, and flips it on its head, which is a very brave storytelling technique. Come on! Give it a shot, and don't go in with unrealistic expectations, and you'll come out with a few good laughs, genuine tears, and a well-spent time.

What it is is a vehicle (as many of them are) to setup the whatever comes next in the verse'.Performances were fine. The action was fine. The pacing was ok. Pretty vanilla overall.The only thing about the movie that really bothered me (and many others) was how they butchered Task Master. The character had been portrayed many different ways, from goofy henchmen to arch nemesis for some of the most popular characters in Marvel. Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that nothing about this incarnation made any sense or did any justice to that character.

As bland as any of the changes of hair/skin color or gender of other known characters in recent cinema an tv.Casting her also as Lucy and Ghost in the Shell (this time dyed black hair), monopolising any female action hero really became annoying.Concerning now the character of Black Widow, she is not very interesting. I don't understand what is her point in the Avengers team. Besides showing Scarlett's derriere, (which has been already seen during the fappening times, and is probably not better than any of my neighborhood's women) BW has no special skills to justify her participation.The movie started rather well, but despite some good ideas for the plot, and some Marvelised action scenes, the rest was rather boring to me who had to watch the movie in pieces to finish it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

If you want to see a pretty fast-paced movie with some funny side-characters, and watch Natascha and Yelena's complicated but ultimately sweet relationship develop, this movie is for you.My two main complaints about this otherwise great movie-experience are:
1. The action stunts towards the end of the movie seemed unfitting, a human body could absolutely not sustain the injuries. We suspend our disbelief when there are ""super soldiers"", demigods etc. But it was a shame to see that with one of the few human characters they still went for a ""brute force"" narrative in terms of action.2. We get a glimpse of what Natascha's old moral code used to be, and to not give away spoilers I simply would have loved to see more of that. She is a morally ambiguous character who changes during her time with the Avengers. Give me that deep character development! Let me root for my morally ambiguous character! Let her be gritty!All in all, I still had heaps of fun watching this movie and I personally dont think it deserves some of the heavy criticism its getting.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can almost garuntee if she wore less clothes and was most suggestive then there would be higher ratings from males.I think the film was amazing but can it be classed as a superhero film when the protagonist doesn't have any super powers? Black Widow is an amazing character and i think people are hating on the movie as they're forgetting that she's just a normal human. Scarlett and Florence were an amazing duo and really brought the film together. Probably my second favourite Marvel film to date.

I thought the intro was really cool and it didn't feel like anything else we have seen in the mcu. But after the intro we got a rushed movie, with a poor plot and characters you never really connected to. I also thought the mcu Taskmaster was bad and wasted. Taskmaster had some cool scenes but it didn't live up to the mcu villian standard. The second and third act felt rushed and forced. I was expecting more flashbacks like Budapest but they never lived up to my expectations. The third act was litteraly a joke it was just POOR and overexaggerated. I believe if this movie came out in the beginning of phase three after civil war it could have done better but coming out now when we have seen the new series like Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki it couldn't match the same standard. It wasn't even a good.tribute movie to Black Widow, I'm just disappointed... but I look forward to the new movies coming out in phase four because they can't be worse than this.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

It comprises of the Widow , but she surely deserved her separate movie . Just like the rest of the Avengers . So here's where we see how it turns out with her origin . The action, stunts, drama, emotions, casting, story . Everything from A to Z absolutely sizzles, dazzles and is remarkable . This has to be one of if not the absolute best movies of Scarlet Johansson. The only thing which I wasn't liking was the weird connection which they were making with the Avengers movies which awkwardly was screwing up the story. Cause the story of this film takes place in between Age of Ultron and Infinity War.

A deserved leading role for Johansson after being a secondary character since the early films, however the spotlight is definitely shared with the introduction of some brilliant new characters.Pugh and Harbour play their parts to perfection, adding to the action but continually providing bursts of fun and humour. The exciting thing is that although this film brings a close to an enduring character, these instant fan favourites are given an opportunity to star in the future.The choreography is excellent, although for some of the more outlandish action sequences the CGI seems a bit wayward or the screen blurs. The plot advances swiftly allowing no time for boredom, and who'd have thought that Ray Winston could be a Russian villain?Things lose their way a little towards the end, and the Taskmaster isn't the most inspired villain in the world. It's hard to tell whether the accents are any good being an outsider, but you can definitely notice at which odd points the dialogue switches from English to Russian, there's little consistency there. Odd bits thrown in, such as whistling at the end which is either a callback to something that didn't happen, or to something that wasn't memorable.For all its faults, Black Widow does justice for a character that has served for so long. It's fun, it's exciting, and it's a good send off.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Bringing the character plot back who we know has already departed(as per the storyline), these past sequels has started loosing the very baseline of a superhero storyline. As per my personal experience watching the movie was like watching the movie ""Red Sparrow"" yet again just with Scarlett Johannson. I hope that the upcoming prequels/sequels doesn't create up a mess for the MCU, a mess which would get really hard to clear up.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I do not think it dragged at all unlike some other reviews I read. If anything it felt short. In fact, I paused the movie to use the bathroom and was surprised that I was already about 70-75% through the movie. Could have sworn there was still half left. I also quite liked the family dynamic between Nat and her ""family"". Especially between her and Yelena. I really bought into that bond. And speaking of Yelena, Florence Pugh is phenomenal in this. She is just so funny, charming, empathetic and kick-ass. And she truly gets some of the best lines (both funny, and emotional). I also felt the film was easy to follow along for the most part. Only one scene towards the end that I think needed to be expanded upon more. But overall I really liked the story of this film. To me, I felt like the film was exploring themes of women's rights, the patriarchy and also a touch of domestic violence but in a comic book/action way. But I really liked what they had to say and it connected with me.My only big complaint I have is that the action felt too over the top at times. Reminded me of Mission Impossible 5 in that regards. If you loved that film, great. For me...it got kind of ridiculous. It makes sense with a character like Thor who is a demi God and super powerful but Nat (besides being well trained) is just a regular human. There was numerous points where I was like ""There is no way you would get up and walk after that"". But, movie got to movie I guess. Also the Taskmaster wasn't as notable as other villains have been. It does provide good character development for Nat though. So at least that's a plus even if the character in itself is kind of forgettable.If I had to rank it somewhere on the MCU movie list, I think it would fall somewhere around 9. Might have to do some re-watches again and maybe re-rank. I feel confident in my top 5, and I feel confident that I liked it more than the majority of the MCU films out there (is this 24th one now?), not that those are bad though. But there is some potential wriggle room. Also, this is based off my first viewing too.But if you're an MCU lover, I doubt I have to convince you to watch this film anyway.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Though it deserves substantial praise for what it is - a consistently engaging, tonally different, and largely grounded film that ensures you care for its titular character despite acknowledging she no longer exists in the MCU. It is well directed and acted, all-stars giving their best, and having a singular theme running for its entire runtime - the widespread abuse against women and the scarcity of people working against it. Sure, it doesn't go all in showing the iniquity that breeds amongst us, but it does far better than what we usually expect from a typical Marvel film.The beginning, particularly, and the ending, hits the rousing notes that you feel while reading the comics devoted to the character. It all culminates nicely, bridging the timeline of Natasha Romanoff well from Civil War to Infinity War while also giving us a few likeable characters to follow ahead in MCU's next phase.I'd honestly expect a disappointing film, assuming it would feel too belated. But I am surprised as well as I am impressed by how it ends up being an overall good movie, having great rewatch value and for being far, far better than at least six MCU movies (Captain Marvel, Ant-man and the Wasp, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Thor: The Dark World, and The Incredible Hulk).Watch if you can on an IMAX screen. It will add to your experience.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The storyline surrounds Black Widow during the Civil War where she takes a hiatus to regroup with her sister and support a mission that they are both pursuing. They decide to break their father out of jail who happens to know the location of the villain's lair. As they work together it quickly becomes apparent why there is so much resentment for each other within the family and why a happy ending isn't likely. This movie is directed by Cate Shortland (Lore) and stars Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Rachel Weisz (The Fountain), William Hurt (A History of Violence), Florence Pugh (Little Women) and David Harbour (The Stranger Things). The family dynamic in this made for an impressive storyline way better than I anticipated. There is a dark cloud over the family the entire movie and doubt if they will ever overcome it...and the conclusion to that element of the movie was very well put together. The action was top notch as always and the CGI and battle scenes were fantastic. The cast delivered their characters perfectly. They were very well selected and the chemistry and acting throughout was excellent, as was the writing and dialogue. This is a very well done movie that deserves a lot of credit. I would score this a 8-8.5/10.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

It's a really fun movie and an excellent entry in the series. Ignore the people who are slamming it because it's not being true enough to certain characters from the comics - I have no clue, I don't read the comics - or are the same misogynists who don't think female characters should be allowed to assert themselves in relation to the patriarchy. Tony Stark can make obnoxiously objectifying comments about Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2 and none of these same reviewers have a problem with it, but God forbid she finally have her say. The related jokes in the film are funny and pointed, and as a middle-aged man I was happy to see it.Marvel does an excellent job introducing the new Black Widow and finally gives Johansson the opportunity to really shine as a full-fledged character in ways she hasn't quite been able to before. The performances of all three leads are excellent, and David Harbor is a lot of fun in his role as well.Make sure you stick around for the post credit sequence, which is poignant - it brought unexpected tears to my eyes in the theater - but also a bit humorous, and directly connects this movie with the Disney+ Marvel content.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Not to mention, some of the plot twists were overly-simplistic.Regardless, the story progression, dialogue, action, special effects and so on are one of the best in recent times, even after I have watched recent blockbusters like F9, The Tomorrow War and The Hitman Wife's Bodyguard, which have plenty of great acting, special effects and overall content as well.I would say this film redeems Black Widow as an Avenger.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

They are all well made, with a lot of action, good actors, great special effects and mostly good stories.But the big differences between Marvel from DC is humor. Marvel movies are funny. And they are not just full of simple gags. They have good and very original comedy. Just think of Guardians of the Galaxy. Those two were funny from the beginning to the end, and all their characters were memorable, likable, well connected with one another. DC's only two attempts at making their movies funny were Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey. Both failed miserably. They were fully of gags that were not at all funny. Their were like an amateur comedian's act, you know, where the guy is standing on stage in front of the big audience, sweating profusely, telling jokes and laughing at them while everyone else yawns.There was a whole slew of things wrong with Black Widow.The story was weak, and I am being kind here. Well, maybe the original comic was good, but the execution of that comic was anything but good. The action in some places was simply ridiculous. I can see Captain America or Vision jump off the tall building and land safely, but when a non-enhanced person like Black Widow falls for a ten storey height and hits every metal object on her way down and then rises with a itty bitty scratch on her hand, that makes you share your head. There were moments when I thought Optimus Prime would form himself from the falling rubble and say something heroic in his poorly disguised Irish accent. Even 007 movies try to make their action somewhat realistic.David Harbour was the only bright spot in this movie. He was really good and its mostly because of him I rated this movie with 3 stars. A side note. It's nice to see him in comedic roles. He managed to make another bad movie - Hellboy - watchable. Unfortunately, David Harbour couldn't save Black Widow. It was just not enough.Until I saw this movie, I thought the weakest one in the whole Marvel movie universe was Captain Marvel. But now I believe Black Widow has taken its place.It's really sad, you know, this strange lack of good writing. Makes me wonder. If they could make Loki, a wonderful TV series, why couldn't they do a better job with Black Widow.Oh, one more thing. To quote one of Deadpool's jokes, couldn't the studio come up with at least one famous mutant? Not a single character from the Avengers universe (I mean main character, General Ross doesn't count) made a cameo in Black Widow.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

Action packed, humorous, and full of heart. Natasha has always been one of the strongest characters in the MCU and this movie adds more to the legend that is Black Widow. I will definitely miss seeing more of Scarlett Johansson in this role but if this is it what a fine send off it was. Feels a bit more mature and darker than the rest of the MCU and this was much needed, something to ally different and boy was it worth it. I hope Marvel continues to make different movies like it. More character, darker tone, new challenges, and a wonderful experience.

I thought for sure that marvel was trying to make a powerful move out of the gate after endgame. Spider-Man Far from home was as refreshing and fun as Homecoming. I started to see that marvel had hit a quality stride I could count on. In comparison, this Black Widow movie was hard to watch, and frankly, they shouldn't have even made it. I really liked Black Widow throughout the MCU, and Wintersoldier was probably the best film featuring her, but this feels like it's trying very hard to make a social point rather than tell a truly compelling story featuring larger than life super soldiers. My absolute favourite part was David Harbour. His role is relatively small but it was fascinating. I think it was a huge misopportunity to give him a bigger role, so he could really show off his strengths.One glaring problem of this movie was humour. Almost all of its humour was misplaced and eye rolling.I wonder if the story might actually be good, but needed to be told by a director who knew how it should be told.If you're an MCU fan, don't watch this movie. If you like good movies, don't watch this movie.","8 out of 30 found this helpful.

I've seen probably 5 of them. Only seen the first avengers, one of the Captain America films. Iron Man 1 & 2, Venom... I think that's it. So maybe, if I had seen more of them, I'd appreciate this more but honestly, they all feel exactly the same. Same formula, same action, same ""humour"". I don't get the appeal really and this was no different. Does anyone actually care about this story or these characters? I thought it might be a pretty good James bond type adventure or something but it's just the same old turd. Obviously I don't know the characters well because I don't read comics or obsessively watch all these films but I'm struggling to see why anyone would want to watch 50 films that are all the same. I've seen 5 of them and they're all the same so really, what's the appeal?

A fun ride that doesn't require you to use much brain power to enjoy. Just grab some snacks and sit back.The most disconcerting part of the film is that no matter what, we already know that ScarJo will be fine since this movie takes place right after Captain America Civil War but before Marvel Avengers: Infinity War & the conclusion of the Black Widow story. Simply put this movie does not work as well as it should have had it been made right after Civil War. This was more of an ""Oh crap! We forgot to give ScarJo her own movie. Let's write something up quickly.""Also to make things clear there is only one post-credits scene. For some odd reason there are many articles claiming that there are 2 when this is false. The scene many are referring too happens before the credits roll and is in fact just the last scene. The PCS is a setup for the next Disney+ Marvel show which if written well; may be a fun ride.The good thing about all these Marvel shows is that they do not need to be forced into yearly seasons; they can simply add in a season when it makes sense in the Marvel Universe timeline to add to the overall story with a focus on sub-characters.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

As an off-and-on fan of Marvel films, this one ranks near the top. I appreciated its scaled back nature and the focus on character development over insane action and cgi. And the characters in this are very likeable. The writing is also top notch and very believable for an otherwise unbelievable comic book film. If you like anything else Marvel does there's no reason you won't like this. The 81% rating on rotten tomatoes behooves me- like you know what to expect from a film like this and it delivers and then some, some critics are apparently expecting a masterpiece even given the comic book source material which is totally nuts to me how anyone can rate this poorly unless you've never seen a Marvel movie before and are expecting Titanic or something. There's not much else I really can say about it... I'm not a professional film critic and don't really want to deep-dive into the pros and cons, I just want to say that I think this is great and really stands up to the likes of the latest Thor and Guardians films. If you like those you'll like this it's one of Marvels better films in my opinion.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

From the first moments, the story gets going and it doesn't let go. Something about the cinematography and directing makes this one pop out, every scene looks very good, from the quiet moments to ever growing action set pieces.Scarlett is more Natasha (Or White Widow) than Black Widow in this, and she does well. But its the great supporting cast that elevates the movie higher than perhaps expected. David Harbour transforms into an iconic dadbod-hero, with tales of glory of his past and great one-liners. Rachel Weisz is beautiful, smart and funny. But its Florence Pugh who shoots the ball out of the park, and far. She is generally very, very funny and basically steals every scene. This felt like a buddycop-movie at times, and in a good way. Not often female heroes are presented and performed in such a way. Also Pugh plays effortlessly the quieter, sad parts too. Would love to see more of her character in the future.Music, special effects are top notch, as expected, but even the action rates high compared to other movies. Great choreography, bold stunts, well shot overall. I have to compliment the direction (Cate Shortland) in this, movie looks and feels original, and even mundane things are made look great with nice camera angles and special shots.Highly recommended!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

You do not have to have seen the other Marvel film to enjoy this Awesome origin story of Natasha Romanoff, a Russian spy turned Avenger.It is 1995, Russian spies Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff go in deep undercover in Ohio USA. Posed as a family with with two young daughters, Natasha and Yelena, (ages 11 & 6} they steal secret SHIELD intel and return to Russia. But the young girls are taken by General Dreykov and sent to the infamous Red Room and trained to be assassins.""My girls are toughest girls in the world"" - Alexei
Now twenty years later, the very intel they stole is being used to control ""Black Widow"" assassins all over the world...including Yelena. Now to stop Dreykov and destroy the Red Room the family must reunite and fight together. But were they ever a real family?""It was real for me"" - Yelena
""I'm sorry. We had our orders and we played our roles"" - Melina
Black Widow is my favorite of all the Superhero films.... and it is so much more. This is a great well written story about a unlikely family but with lots of action, mystery, spy and hero stuff, and family feuds and reunions.I saw Black Widow on the big screen when it came out and watching again, I really forgot how good is, Way beyond my expectations..... And a Awesome cast!

The story was a little too late for its own good to come to fruition, but it was awesome being able to see Black Widow earn her own solo film. Scarlett Johansson played her wonderfully and shown emotional leverage to the character.Florence Pugh was also just as good, if not better, in some parts of this film. She's a rising star, especially coming from Midsommar, directed by Ari Aster. I believe she has much more talent to show to the world overtime.The rest of the film itself is good, it's fun and it's well done as most Marvel movies are. The villain was awesome, and is unquestionably one of the most badass villains to come to the MCU.My only complaints are some of the decisions on timing of the story, and where it takes place- it's pretty incoherent and almost at some point seems to feel convoluted in terms of matching up with the MCU's timeline- but I think they made do with what they could and it doesn't affect it dramatically in the long run. The CGI is also a lot less stellar (which is insane comparing this to Endgame's use of CGI) in this movie which is strange due to the budgeting and income these Marvel films make. You will notice poor CGI in some scenes, but the choreography and set pieces are super epic.All in all, I'd recommend Black Widow for Marvel fans and those that wanted to see their heroine finally get her own screen time, it's a fun, solid watch. It just has some chips along the way.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The beginning and second half of the movie offered up a nice creative, refreshing introduction and building action climax that basically hit the right buttons. Some audience members may have appreciated a little better plot development in the beginning as scenes rapidly proceeded apace with the mental catch-up game for some people trying to figure out what was happening even as the opening sequences were nicely done as the action became quite compelling and original without super-hyper drive special effects. The movie then however became a little stilted with the hyper-action that seemed overdone and quite derivative using many action sequences done before in many movies. Yet the screenwriters, directors, and actors redeem themselves well with a powerful second half of the movie with nice double twists, humor, and emotionally touching interludes as a family or what might be called a family. With elements from Gemini Man (2019) and the Russian trained assassin moles genre going back to the original classic La Femme Nikita (1990) and Soldier (1998), Black Widow succeeds for the most part.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It was just CGI without any substantive plot. It was almost like watching a John Wick film, except this film was unironically being so shallow. The script itself was also hollow, dry and forgettable - conversations between characters felt forced and were either used to inform the audience of information in a very artificial tasting way, or to just be filler for this hollow corporate production to take up the film's timeslot, so that Disney could eventually cut to the chase of selling merchandise.But hey, we need to still respect this film because they sorta made it about women being strong and standing up against the only two/three forgettable main male characters in the ""story"", right? Well, no, this isn't a substitute for actually having a storyline. The real question we should take away from this film is whether it will take two months or two weeks for people to forget about it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Almost every character feels fake, especially the parents and the villain. For no reason the parents (as well as Yelena) start speaking with a heavy Russian accent even though you see at the start of the movie they are perfectly capable of speaking American English. This adds to the feeling that everything is fake and doesn't hold up.The movie sometimes tries to be emotional, but fails miserably every time.On the plus side, Yelena is a funny character.

I don't know what Marvel was thinking when they decided to make this movie. One star is for action and another for Red Guardian and the post credit scene.

Scarlett Johansson always does a great job playing her. I love espionage films, and the fact that this seemed to be sort of a homage to gritty spy thrillers like the Jason Bourne franchise also had me interested. The MCU hasn't really done a spy movie before, although the taut political-thriller tone of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has some similarities with this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the final project. The film is serviceable and certainly isn't bad, but it's far too bland and formulaic.The plot of the film centers around Natasha and her sister Yelena (a very strong Florence Pugh,) who were both brainwashed into an assassin program by Russian operatives when they were young--explained early on by an opening scene and a surprisingly quite grim (by MCU standards) opening credits montage. Natasha tries to track down their undercover ""parents"" that brought them into this world, and stop.its mastermind Dreykov and his masked henchman Taskmaster. Johansson and Pugh are always great to watch on screen, and are able to convey grit and realism as well as unique chemistry. David Harbour surprisingly steals the show during his scenes, but Rachel Weisz is sadly underutilized. The film doesn't really differentiate from the typical MCU formula--basically setting up a slightly-connected internal and external conflict culminating in a CGI-filled third-act action climax. What's unfortunate here is that the film misses a lot of opportunities to further develop Natasha as a character in contrast to what we know about her from previous MCU films. While Pugh is good, I'm not sure how much of an integral role she will end up having in the franchise going on.The film's pacing is fast and kinetic, but its story beats and plot tropes feel ""been there, done that"" enough by the standards of the superhero genre for the pacing to feel less significant to viewers than it normally would. Dreykov and Taskmaster are both very weak and underdeveloped villains. Some of the Jason Bourne-esque fight scenes are well choreographed, but the action doesn't really stand out compared to other Marvel films. While it can be mildly entertaining at times, viewers will ask what the broader point was here given the film's relatively light character development, formulaic tendencies, and stakes within the MCU. It's certainly not bad, but it definitely feels like a Phase 1 MCU movie deficient in the intertextuality and distinctness of some of the more recent Marvel adventures--and it doesn't end up doing much to further develop a post-Endgame MCU. Recommended only to die-hard Marvel fans, everyone else can wait to rent or stream it. 5/10.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Why would they ruin the best female comics (movie) character to date?! Johansson as Black Widow was amazing in her role. I waited for this movie to erase the bad taste of the Prey birds from my conscience, and extreme disappointment is the proper phrase to describe it. Black Widow has always been a sexy version of James Bond in fantasy setting. She was sexy and incredibly smart to get the info from her enemies, and held her own in ALL of the movies prior to this one. What we've got is lousy, ""woke"" character, who clearly forgot her origins and her means of dealing with obstacles. Bad everything! Is this the beginning of the end for Avengers franchise? Seems so.

People wondered why does such a ""strong female character"" get her movie a decade after the inception of the franchise and here's the reason - they never envisioned her as one. When she needed to shine her spandex bottom, to say a quippy line or pose for a group shot - she was appreciated and remembered... by youtube's ""best of black widow"" compilations. But when it comes to origin stories or what can a character do on their own... Well, only one thing was important: that she was russian. So the movie isn't about her as a character. No, it's about her sister and her family. And it's not about her motivations or personality, it's about an evil ruski being an evil ruski. And the problem is... that ruski is probably the best character in the whole movie. And what he does is basically what USA has done for the past 50 years. So all the ""bad man is mad"" had no effect on me. In fact, I merely appreciated the actor's performance. As well as Pugh's best rendition of JarJar Binks.The action is terrible. Editing is atrocious and unwatchable. Fighting is fake and animated. It's basically a Captain Marvel that tries and fails, because you don't win a game by scoring into your own gate. The narrative and the pacing are barebone too, because far too much time gets wasted on, to put it simply, idiotic comedy and what concerns character developed is mostly done by out of place action scenes. Or worse.But I did enjoy the Red Guardian's character. Even if he was written with the all the misandry you could think of. Not as bad as the latest Ghostbuters though. And I kind of appreciated the chemistry between characters. Again - the humor. It's not a tragedy or an action movie, more like a Futurama episode. And I think Black Widow deserved better. Yes, she is russian. Yes, he had an origin story in her comics. Should I divulge that the origin story of Black Panther characters would make modern lefties tear their hair out? Changes are often made to sell the propaganda, and it seems like the respect for the character did not outweigh the necessity of her classic origin.So, no, it's not as bad as Captain Marvel. It's not something to shoot for, like Red Sparrow. It's just a bad movie. One of the many. 200mil$ well-spent. Wonder Woman 1984 tips her hat.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Thanks Marvel, we've missed you.Although packed with CGI and unrealistic chasing/fighting scenes typical of Marvel movies, it's tone is more of a spy movie -like a 007 or Bourne- than a super hero movie and that was a good change of pace.I agree with some reviewers that, amid the whole MCU saga it may feel pointless since it almost doesn't connect to anything- the post credit scene being most important in that aspect than the whole movie- and the character is already dead ""presently"" so it may feel hard to really care about the story.

I'm very happy with the result. This movie is not only a great Marvel movie, but a good movie altogether. Because, unlike a lot of Marvel movies, it does feel like there are stakes, a key thing missing in a lot of the MCU. Part of that is because of the Spy/Thriller elements to this movie that keep the tone darker when necessary, and incorporate some good sets, but also because of the heart and emotion in this movie, that is conveyed through the trauma each of the main characters have to deal with (somewhat), and their connectivity as a ""family"". Each of the characters do have a lot of the witty humour, but it doesn't come across as being so formulaic here, instead it's actually funny and only used appropriately. Along with that the characters are individual and each have real stakes in the story, although most are lacking proper depth. This movie also has a lot of really engaging Spy/Thriller elements, more akin to the Mission: Impossible films, which gives it a more unique tone for an MCU movie and makes for some great action sequences. The main villain serves his purpose in the story, and provides a shadow of mystery and a looming sense of threat, before he is introduced to be ruthless and cold, making for a decent antagonist. However, what brings this movie down is that it presents so many potentially complex and dark themes, but as usual with the MCU, it doesn't fully engage with the concepts presented, and thus gives the characters less depth. Other than that, this is a solid action flick that goes beyond most Marvel films and is sure to entertain.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Scarlett Johansson was well overdue for her own movie being one of the original Avengers. It is just unfortunate that it comes after her death in ""Endgame"" but as I said, this movie knocks it out of the park with its action scenes, emotional drama and also sets up for future MCU implications. The core cast all did amazing work! Most notable is Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova. Her character has grown to be a hardened assassin from childhood who you think would be very dry but Pugh still manages to have amazing personality and surprisingly great comedic timing. Johansson serves as a great driver of the film and foil to Pugh's assist which makes for a very fun dynamic duo. The film is overrall great and exactly the epic adventure we all needed to drive everyone back to the theatre. This is an experience that should be seen on the big screen for sure even though it is offered through the Disney+ app as premiere access. If you want a spy movie that adds that patented MCU flair, I highly suggest going out to see ""Black Widow""","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

We already know what happens to Natasha and really the only reasons this movie exists is 1) fan service/a tribute to Natasha. And 2) to set up Yelena as the next Black Widow (if they even do that).The acting was fine, the characters were meh (Yelena stole the show in my opinion, best character). But I think this movie wasn't necessary and brought nothing to the table.I don't even think this is a good send off movie for Nat? It left me just feeling empty. And I don't remember 90 percent of what Nat does in the film, and it's supposed to be a movie about HER.I don't like what they did with Taskmasker or that they made Nat and Yelena adopted sisters/sister figures (in the comics, they aren't related at all and don't see each other that way).But hey, that's my opinion. Glad some people got enjoyment.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Natasha faces off against the demons of her past, when a new threat emerges.Black Widow is a fantastic movie. Director Cate Shortland has given us another unforgettable film, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are eye-popping. Natasha Romanoff finally gets a worthy solo movie, that the fans have been waiting for, for several years. Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as Natasha Romanoff. Florence Pugh is spectacular as Yelena Belova. Can't wait to see more of Florence Pugh's Yelena, in future Marvel Cinematic Universe projects. Rachel Weisz is brilliant as Melina. David Harbour is phenomenal as Alexei. Johansson, Pugh, Weisz & Harbour have this effortless camaraderie in all their scenes together. Ray Winstone is superb as Dreykov. O-T Fagbenle is great as Mason. William Hurt is effective as Secretary Ross. Ever Anderson & Violet McGraw are perfect as Young Natasha & Young Yelena, respectively. The supporting cast is excellent. Black Widow is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. Can't wait for the rest of Marvel's movies & Disney+ TV shows, that are due in the next couple of years. What a time to be alive!","7 out of 23 found this helpful.

That the actresses are 'lazy' and that the men were better actors (huh... I wonder what they're really trying to say).I've heard people say the plot wasn't good enough for a Black Widow send off; for some of those people they might genuinely believe that, but for others it's a thin veil to disguise their dislike of a female-driven movie. And, honestly, neither of them really understand this movie.This could not have been a better send off to Natasha. Admittedly, the action sequences were not as polished as Captain America: The Winter Soldier's, but that's an incredibly high bar. Black Widow's CGI was no worse that Infinity War or Endgame's! It was believable enough to be good and to have me thoroughly engrossed and impressed. It was a LOT of fun and each of the characters had moments to shine as absolute bad asses (Natasha in particular).The humour was entertaining and genuinely had me laughing (if you have siblings you'll totally understand) and the found family trope was actually very well done (definitely better than the limp attempts made by Whedon and the Russo brothers). In Whedon's Avengers they'd barely had time to feel like a family before he and the Russos started ripping them apart. With Black Widow, to avoid spoilers, all I'll say is that there was tension and the characters were complex and flawed but the film doesn't forget what its main themes are. I loved it.As for the plot? Again, to avoid spoilers I'll be vague: if you're a woman, I'm sure you'll agree with me that the villain is an absolutely vile creature. Both terrifying and, for many of us, so very real.If you know and understand Natasha Romanoff as a character at all, you'd understand that this movie, this mission, is the most important and most *personal* one she's ever been on (bar the one in Endgame, of course).And don't listen to the criticisms about Yelena. She's perfect. She does an excellent job of being the device that propels Natasha's plot and at the same time she's a fantastic character. They all are, to be honest.Of course there were some minor flaws, but show me a single action movie - or any movie for that matter - which doesn't have a few niggles here and there. Overall, this was a great way to say goodbye to my favourite Avenger and I for one, finished the movie feeling thoroughly entertained (and I haven't stopped thinking about it since).Don't listen to the haters. They don't *get* it.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

And it was on a new level for Marvel.This movie is like a typical superhero movie. Unrealistic scenes where the main characters fall from several floors and remain healthy and others. But I can't complain about it, because I think it's genre features. I want to note the attempts at jokes and humor, which were even successful. I also want to note the cool special effects and operators' job. As they say, fire was fire. And about the plot: I can say that the interactions of Natasha, Elena and their parents, I think, were quite complex and quite interesting. Elena is a very interesting character to get acquainted with her closer in the following projects. But the main antagonist has a bit vague motives.In conclusion: the first Marvel movie in a long time came out on the big screens with great dignity. I hope in the future we will see even more bright and impressive projects.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Now I'll be honest, I wasn't super excited about this film as Natasha was never my favourite (purely for lack of screen time), and she's dead so what does it matter? Turns out it matters a lot. Black Widow is a great return to marvel movies after a two year hiatus and is exciting and engaging throughout the whole two and a half hours. Scarlett Johansson is still incredible as Natasha, but the show gets stolen by Florence Pugh's Yelena. The relationship between the two sisters is one of the many joys of this movie and Yelena's witty sarcastic comments provide hilarious breaks between the action and more heavy themes of the movie. An hugely entertaining movie for the entire 2 and a half hours, it definitely stands out as one of the best solo films to date. Don't listen to the reviews calling it overly feminist- just because a movie has women in it doesn't mean that it's pandering to any agenda. Just because there are powerful women doesn't mean it's tokenistic or over the top. You would never second guess this movie if it was largely men, so why is it an issue when it's women?This movie is incredibly entertaining and a great edition to the MCU. Definitely a must watch for any marvel fan.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Once you believe in that reality (for the duration of the movie), people and events portrayed in the movie make sense. Not so with this movie. You will know early on, when a regular human being survives a fall from a 10-story building without a scratch, hitting at least three balconies with their back on the way down. Because I don't want to spoil anything (else), I'm limiting myself to this example, but the list of unbelievably unbelievable events is very long.Also, we're back at the tone of the original Cap film, in which a small team of Americans can successfully invade a ultra high security Nazi facility because apparently Nazis can't aim a gun. In Black Widow, Russians are given the American Superiority Complex treatment. They occasionally speak ""Russian"", but a Russian friend couldn't understand what they said when they did. Fortunately, they use ""Ienglisj wiz verri stronk"" aksent for the rest of the movie, unless an actor temporarily forgets and sounds American for half a sentence, which happens regularly. They're all megalomaniacs and pretty much all losers. I commented on a Facebook thread how Black Widow depicts Russians. That was flagged as Hate Speech. I find that absolutely hilarious.Bonus points for being able to look at Florence for a long time. And for staying away from requiring the female actors to appear in underwear at least once.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sure! But, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that when it's done with such elegance and supported by great storytelling & acting. Don't get me wrong; I can't argue that there aren't movies out there that seem to try and push social agendas while failing to apply the same care in the script itself, but that's certainly not the case with Black Widow.Opinions are like buttholes, and everyone's got one, but I'm hoping this short review might persuade you to give the film chance. Ignore the haters and unfair criticisms and go enjoy yourself at the cinema again for a positive change of space. Just be warned that this one's a little more on the dark and serious side, so don't expect it to be as kid-friendly as lighter MCU titles like Guardians of the Galaxy or Spider-Man: Homecoming.In summary, Black Widow has a stellar cast, top-notch fight scenes, beautiful special fx and plenty of action with just enough comedic relief to create the perfect recipe for fun. Sure, the movie would have offered a bigger punch if it was released before End Game, but this well-loved character unquestionably deserved her own movie, and Scarlet Johansson delivers the goods!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We've encountered some pretty bad Marvel movies, but I think Black Widow definitely ranks among the top three for Most Disfigured Donut.It's not like I can point a finger and say ""that's the problem, right there officer"" - there are a multitude of issues that plague this film and make it a difficult one to watch (and later to recommend). While the core narrative is decent and invents unique challenges for the cast, the editing and dialogue feels very shallow and low quality. A lot of the CGI for this film looks shockingly poor, and with action at the center of the Tootsie Pop, Black Widow can't move forward with plastic visuals. What only makes this worse is shoddy writing for the characters - a great cast (most notably Florence Pugh with her catchy demeanor and strong emotional presentation) is reduced to ash with a lack of depth and connectivity. I frequently found myself saying ""so what?"" to almost every narrative element and decision made by the cast simply because there was nothing for me to latch onto and empathize with what I was seeing. And of course, there's a feel good ending (curse the soul who thought making audiences happy at the end of a movie was a good idea).The primary handicap for Black Widow is its lack of depth. There are Marvel films that pull you in with their cast and relatability, but this film has none of it. Combine it with poor editing and visuals, and you're left with a film with a fizzling existence. The only thing I can say is Florence Pugh's back must hurt from carrying this film, and the post-credits scene does some absolutely fantastic foreshadowing.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

*** Hot Take ***
Pros : Was looking for a refreshing action movie. Thrilling Action. Fun acting from Rachel Wiesz.Cons : A bit rehashed. Should've come out after Civil War. Rachel's accent comes out when she hunches in the movie.Review:
After a year of half-cooked, mediocre releases. This movie was honestly refreshing.I have been an avid comic reader since the nineties. I have had my share of grievances with MCU but compared to DC much less. Such as there are no mutants, no WonderMan and quicksilver died too soon, No Reed Richards, no magneto. And MCU ruined A. I. M and Mandarin in a single movie.But I digress. Great movie all around. As a comic reader i always wanted and wondered what Heli jumps and Widows signature free running would look in live-action. Amazing. Not disappointed at all. But is it worth a re-watch? Maybe. Its not groundbreaking in any shape or form.Free of any brow-beating 'Hollywood Representation agenda'.After Thoughts :
Taskmaster is an AWOL shield agent in the comics. The entire shtick of Taskmaster is that he is a freelance trainer of goons for underground organizations. He learns from superheroes and teaches it to goons. For cold hard cash. Shield lets him do it so they can keep tabs on how much the underground knows.3 users voted down my post when I had only put the disclaimer ""review coming tomorrow"". Nice.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Somehow the ""test"" that got her accepted into Shield was unsuccessful but no one thought to check? And they never really explain how?It takes one of the only women in the avengers and makes her uniquely susceptible to the pheromones of an old man in his sixties. Which just feels creepy, and also rather demeaning to her character.It falls victim to one of the classic blunders: while it does not enter a land war in Asia, it does take a powerful character and make ""not being able to have children"" a major personality trait. This wouldn't be bad in and of itself, but because they have never made any of the men in the cinematic universe have this sort of an issue or personality trait, it does come off as uniquely insensitive and seems to be unintentionally (or intentionally, I don't know) suggesting that powerful women have a portion of their value tied up in whether they can produce children.On top of that, it gives her a backstory that is frankly not nearly as cool as that of practically any other avenger. I like the family dynamic, but you have to admit, having three years of fake family and then nothing else other than being ensorcelled by a villain and escaping to immediately join Shield seems more like the stories given to Marvel villains than to actual leading characters. She had no agency, no character building; all she was was a girl who did what she was told and then switched sides and did what she was told by the other people. No dramatic hero story, no ""with great power comes great responsibility.""Lastly, the movie contains a lot of filler, with action sequences that seem all about blowing random stuff up, starting avalanches, and stretching out the action instead of actually being unique or including enjoyable super hero fights. Which is fine in a Fast and Furious movie, but not exactly what one hopes for from a Marvel movie.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

It's one of the more fast paced and easy to follow MCU adventures and delivers a satisfying epilogue to Scarlett Johansson's, 11 year long role as Black Widow, after her death in Endgame. In this movie, we get a closer look into the black widow programme and what we learn is very interesting. Florence Pugh delivers a fantastic performance as Yellana, with Johannson delivering as well in the lead role. David Harbour is also a highlight playing Captain America, if he were a pathetic loser. In regards to action, this movie delivers with several exciting action sequences and fight scenes. However, this film really delivers with the story, providing an emotionally investing, character driven family drama, as well as a thrilling spy thriller. I definitely recommend watching this movie on the big screen, if you can. It's a non stop thrill ride from start to finish.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Far too much bad MCU banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream (Pugh in particular is terrible at those bits). Some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with Taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible. Winstone villain made me miss when people like Lonsdale and Lee made lousy Moore Bond plots half watchable. The major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were a pretend family and altough Johansson and Pugh have good chemistry and Weisz and Harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets, there just isn't enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land. I can get what Shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of a far more standalone movie than most of them. Also, strange how after a decade of postponing giving Johansson her movie, they did one in which she so often feels like a witness/connective MCU tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over ""killing"" Winstone's daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with. She is both the lead and the most extraneous part of her own movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yelena and Natasha are sent to the Red Room to be trained as Black Widow assassins. So begins the tale of how this family reunites with Scarlet Johansson as the adult Natasha and Florence Pugh as Yelena. They fight a Cyborg and the Black Widows (as well as each other at first), they even have to spring Alex from prison.

A moving tale, the ""sisters"" aren't just out for revenge, they want to free all of the Black Widows from mind control.

This movie has plenty of issues and plot holes but was still enjoyable and brought me plenty of laughs.Lastly I see plenty of reviews critiquing the fact Natasha took a back seat to Yelena and I totally agree with those views. I do think however that it was intentionally done by marvel to create an easy way to introduce Yelena and gain a larger following for the character which = more $$$$.

It's the very talented Scarlett Johansson (from much better movies like Under The Skin and Marriage Story) swansong from Marvel, which also ended sourly with Scarlett suing Disney.

The action is,,,,well,,its cut n paste from all the other cut n paste Marvel superhero films. But its the storyline, puns, one liners, obscure casting thats just so,,,dire! Ok the storyline starts off quite logically for a ""Marvel sidestep and pick up on another character development/ milk the franchise even more"" plot. There's the predictability of good against bad. But somewhere in this Covid dictated film, i'm reckoning, the original actors couldn't make it, nor the director, nor the screen writer, because you can actually see where the producer went ""oh hell,,,phone up whats his face, he'll do it"" as the film goes spiralling into someone else's dream reality! The one liners !!,,,oh my god if Tony Stark was a real person,,,and he wasn't dead (or is he?),,he'd be sueing the film makers for copy write on his character trait! Ray Winstons russian accent,,,well it just isn't ! The ""family reunion"" scene is by far, the biggest clue that, taking unprescribed drugs whilst making a film, is NOT a good idea! It's so far out their,,,it'll probably end up with its on reality tv show! I actually got extremely angry, the first attempt at a watching this ""film"", because it just confused the s*** gotta me,,,i had to walk away before i plucked my own eyes out! Second attempt (and some calm me down drugs), i made it to the action packed/completely implausible/yet predictable end. Watching this film is like, eating a well known burger,,,it looks sooo good in the adverts, even the wrapper is inviting,,,but when you start chomping into it,,,its just the same old minced up meat, with little or no valuable contents, but it'll do till you get a proper meal.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yes, but that isn't a high bar. The first Wonder Woman was the only OK one so far and even that had a terrible second half.Black Widow is a competent action film with a decent plot, some fun characters, OK jokes and very well done action sequences. It isn't on par with the best in the MCU. The main problem is that Black Widows back story is given too little focus and that makes the villain forgettable and makes the whole affair a bit shallow. I think the director wanted to avoid it being too dark knowing where it ends, but that was a mistake. As it stands the jokes come across as a bit odd because we understand the underlying darkness but we haven't explored it. If we were given the full story I believe the humor would have been the gallows humor that feels appropriate for people who have been so abused. That could have been one of the best MCU movies ever.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Did not expect much and I'm glad because this movie is not good. Sure it has some moments but overall it's kinda boring as the story is not really interesting.The visuals also look pretty bad for a mcu entry. Maybe if it was a tv show or made exclusively for Disney plus it could get away with the visuals, but this was in theaters. I would be pissed if I paid to see it.It's pretty forgettable as well. It can also be used for evidence in the argument that there is way too many super hero movies currently in Hollywood.Has mcu peaked and now flooding the market with over saturated recycled super hero garbage?

I don't know how anyone can say this film has no heart and is all action and explosions.One thing I've truly enjoyed as more women are getting a shot at directing is the emotional content and character development they typically bring to what could be over the top action films. There aren't a ton of those moments in a film like this, so the key is to make them count. The interplay between Yelena and Natasha is at times poignant and at others cutting. David Harbour also does a good job as the self absorbed father figure.I don't think we have to view this film as having wasted or ruined Taskmaster either. Let's think back to Origins: Wolverine and consider how we felt about Deadpool. Seems that worked out fine in the end, yes? I fully expect to see a more traditional rendition of Taskmaster in other MCU properties.The plot was predictable, but it was actually refreshing not to have the writers and director think they can pull one over on the audience for a change. It doesn't always have to be about the plot twist.The ending left the MCU open to taking Black Widow in a new direction, or at least adding another high caliber actor to the universe. Personally I'm a fan of Florence Pugh and look forward to what she can bring to the MCU.In the end this film met my expectations, which were high considering the cast and director. Its pretty rare when these films exceed my expectations, because I've actually read the source material. The writing in the better comics is really good, and often doesn't contain typical Hollywod endings, so its a rare film that can live up it, especially with a PG-13 rating.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

She's a great Russian spy. She's hardly trust people. She manipulated people easily and this sort of character is well portrayed in this movie. Her child background is fantastic. It describes why a person becomes very careful in trusting people. She barely knew her mum and she learns how to fake herself when she's still a child. I think it's very touching that she actually found someone to hold onto which is her fake sister, which also comes from the same background as her. That's how she develops this human traits that we all have which we called sympathy. The story kind of make me feel like it's very deep and emotional. It makes me feel like Natasha is the real heroes of all. I think the cinematography is well depicted for a person who's not an expert but somehow, it's really entertain my lockdown mood.

They, as a rule, convey their entertainment purpose to the viewer.And I wouldn't say a word about elementary logic and the laws of physics if we were talking about another superhero with superpowers, a la Cap, who is really able to fall from a great height and grab the railing without dislocating his limb. But when an ordinary person does it, which is a Black Widow, it doesn't seem funny to me, it disappoints me. An entertainment product is a necessary thing, but it should also have at least basic logic.After watching it, it seemed that Marvel owed someone and finally paid off the debt. Without involvement, without enthusiasm, reluctantly.

Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, teams up with her ""other"" family to stop a team of enemy assasins.But, it's not the plot that we care about in these types of movies, it's the characters and the action. And this film brings both in abundance.Let's start with the characters - the 4 main ""family"" members - Johansson (Black Widow), Florence Pugh (Yelena), David Harbour (Alexei) and Rachel Weisz (Melina) are wonderful to spend time with. These are characters that I want to see on the screen and their interactions - though sometimes confrontational - is filled with friendship, respect and love. This is something that other ""universes"" don't quite get as well as the MCU and it shows.Johannson, of course, is terrific as Black Widow. She has this character down and if this is her last go around as this character, she'll got out with her head held high. David Harbour (STRANGER THINGS) is the comic relief of this film as his (somewhat) overweight superhero RED GUARDIAN, tries to fit into his old costume (reminiscent of MR. INCREDIBLE) while Rachel Weisz (Oscar winner for THE CONSTANT GARDNER) is the grounding/realistic character.But all 3 of these take a back seat to the terrific Florence Pugh (Oscar nominated for LITTLE WOMEN a few year's back) as the ""little sister"" of Black Widow. She and Johannson have terrific chemistry together and the writers/directors give Pugh most of the good lines that will lead the audience to be won over by her character.The only blemish I have in the performances of this film is Ray Winstone's rather ""average"" performance as the main bad guy in this film. I don't fault Winstone's performance, I think that it is because the part is underwritten or, worst yet, an afterthought of the writers.Director Cate Shortland (LORE) does a good job keeping the film moving while interspersing the family drama with the action and the humor at a brisk enough clip to keep your interest for the full 134 minutes of this film. It's a good return to the MCU and one that will keep you coming back for more.Which is EXACTLY what the MCU wishes you to do.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

They remind me a bit of Winter Soldier - how efficient the villain was.However, none of the rest of the movie lives up to those brief glimpses of potential. The plot is far too complicated and uninteresting. Way too many characters are introduced without developing them. The later action scenes are bloated, generic, incoherent and dull with way too much obvious CGI.Also, fundamentally, for this to come out after Endgame and about 20 other MCU movies completely undermines it. There is little or no tension since it's a prequel. Nobody important can die, for example. There aren't any particular gaps which needed filling in in the first place. I did not yearn for this movie. It's nice that Black Widow finally got her own movie, but it came too late to mean anything in the wider MCU.The plot barely holds together or makes sense. It's a mildly interesting concept, but one which has been done to death. Black Widow offers no real original twists on the concept. It's too far-fetched to take seriously.The main adversary is cool at times, quite intimidating, fast, skilled and mysterious. But he/she (wearing a masked suit it's hard to tell) is not really developed. Another main villain is also 1- dimensional.I didn't understand what was happening with Widow's family. It wasn't clear who did what or why. Like so many movie characters, they barely communicate. It seems to be obligatory that they fight, lie and get angry in order to create drama. I prefer to understand characters and their motivations, not just get annoyed at how selfish or manipulative they are or how lazy the screenwriters are.Unfortunately, Black Widow feels like a completely unnecessary exercise. Some of the action is alright, some dramatic moments are decent, Scarlett is good and there's some attempt at developing her backstory, but it ultimately falls apart. It changes nothing, it relies on cliches, it's big and loud but not exciting and it's too dark and serious to excuse its plot flaws and tedious over-reliance on CGI.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Lackluster Opener to Phase Four","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7132938/?ref_=tt_urv","a2man","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104676930/?ref_=tt_urv","17 July 2021","After nearly two years since the last MCU movie, we are presented with ""Black Widow"", the first feature-length entry to kickstart Phase Four. I was pretty much looking forward to the movie, perhaps because I had incorrectly assumed it to be the origin story of Black Widow, and it seemed to be an interesting premise, since we only ever get hints of where she came from in the previous entries. The result is a bland movie, a disappointing movie with a plot that has zero stakes, random characters, and ultimately just feels like a set-up, instead of a full-fledged story.The first problem I have is the plot. It's set between ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"". We know what happens to Natasha Romanoff during these two movies, and I don't recall Romanoff mentioning the events that happened in this movie in ""Infinity War"". This essentially makes the plot of ""Black Widow"" feel like what you may call as a sidequest in a video game, it's highly filler and to be honest, it doesn't even feel like Romanoff is the main character here since I don't think she experiences particularly life-changing here. The main focus seems to revolve around Florence Pugh's character Yelena Belova, who plays Romanoff's sister, sort of. In the comics, Belova also assumes the mantle of Black Widow, so given that Romanoff's character died in ""Endgame"", you can guess what the purpose of the movie is.What else drives the plot? The villain. After a string of top-tier villains such as Thanos, Hela, Mysterio, ""Black Widow""'s main antagonist represents a terrible regression. It's an amalgamation of the MCU's worst villains, reminiscent of Malekith. Bland, boring, no charisma, no presence, generic, and pretty low IQ. There's the Taskmaster, essentially a person in a suit of armor that's not even that advanced, and another villain, who's supposed to be this elusive mastermind who hides behind the curtains, but turns out to be pretty lackluster. Considering that by this time frame, Romanoff's faced and lived through the likes of Loki, Ultron, witnessed aliens and the might of superheroes like Thor, Vision, it's hard to believe that the Taskmaster will pose a threat to Romanoff.There are some side characters here. I was interested in David Harbour's character, Red Guardian, who was supposedly the Soviet counterpart of Captain America. But he turned out to be insignificant in the movie, and did not particularly stand out, which is pretty disappointing since he's supposed to be a super-soldier, yet seems incompetent throughout the whole movie. Rachel Weisz's character is also pretty generic, rounding out a roster of characters that feel uninspired, save for some flashes of charm from Florence Pugh.The action sequences were also pretty subpar. The scenes in the first half of the movie were decent, as they didn't rely too much on explosive special effects that filled the whole screen, so I got the impression that it was pursuing the style of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". However, that gradually changed and the climax was a ridiculous action sequence, which while large-scale, did not really leave an impression on me.This is a pretty disappointing entry in the MCU, considering that the last string of movies they churned out, while they may be formulaic, were solid. ""Black Widow"" stumbles pretty heavily. I could respect it more if they stumbled while trying to deviate from the formula and create something quite different, but I felt this was a pretty lazily crafted movie, that only served as set-up for perhaps the growing MCU. It doesn't really provide anything new and by the end of it, you don't get the feeling that you're able to connect more dots across the different movies in the saga; it's essentially an unnecessary plot thread. Here's to hoping that Marvel can get back in the groove with its upcoming entries.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There has to be a reason why this movie exists, right? It doesn't really make any sense. We're getting a movie about a character that's... Well, yeah. It kind of reminds me of Rogue One, in a way. Both are movies that don't really need to be, we don't gain anything from their existence, they don't further the respective stories of their universes in any particularly meaningful way and neither of them has any stakes or anything to them. The difference being that I quite enjoyed Rogue One, while it didn't further the grand Star Wars epic, I felt like it added flavor to those lesser people in the galaxy struggling to make a difference. Black Widow doesn't do that in the slightest, the only thing it serves to do is hit us over the head with some really over the top lessons on sexism. Lessons which I will continue to say are needed but good lord if we could have any sort of subtlety or natural discourse rather than just ramming in these ridiculous forced narratives into things in ways that only ever feel awkward and contrived. The woman can be the hero fighting against oppression without making the man into Lucifer incarnate and/or a complete idiot.Anyhow, my rants on political agendas in film aside, I love that this movie introduces Florence Pugh to the MCU. She's amazing and I can't wait to see more from her, either in future Marvel properties or elsewhere... Although I am noticing this trend of not loving her movies but consistently loving her in them. Weird. Aside from her though, there's nothing to this. Its an inconsequential film that will likely be remembered more for the lawsuit around it than the film itself. I'd even go so far as to say, unless your a huge Marvel fan, you can skip this one altogether. It really brings nothing to the overall experience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Natasha seems like supporting character in the previous marvel movies. I was really amazed by seeing the Standalone movie using this character.

I feel like it would be better that way because even if this movie is more about her origin, it would be better to see it better if it is seen firsthand in a movie in phase 1. This movie really feels like it's not a first entry but more of a third with everyone in it. Taskmaster is definitely an underutilized character. I feel like the movie just barely scratched the surface of the character. I feel like Taskmaster is pretty underdeveloped in this movie. Don't know, Taskmaster could get pretty developed in the Thunderbolts. Timeline wise, this movie takes place in between Captain America Civil War and Avengers Infinity War. The post credits scene takes place after Endgame and before the Hawkeye series. That may be the only reason for why this movie to release when it did, but I still feel like this should've released between Civil War and Infinity War with 2 Black Widow movies releasing before it within the previous two phases. I feel like that is the main way to make this movie better. You don't have to change the script much of this one, just add two more movies of this lead character and you have it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The acting was pretty solid. In fact, Florence Pugh stole the show from the title character. But that is not to say Scarlet Johansson didn't do a good job, like always, she's always solid in that role. What I liked about this film was the story. It was less superhero focused, and more focused on Black Widow the individual. I think that was a good idea, instead watching another traditional MCU film, which is has been overused by now. I had a good time watching it, I just wish it came out sooner!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movies ending isn't as crazy as other MCU movie endings but it's still very over the top. The actual movie itself seems a bit late late to the party, we already know Black Widow is going to live so there was no sense of danger for her character and it didn't quite seem like a positive send off for her either... it felt very displaced. In saying all of that though, it's still an exciting film and it has some genuinely funny commentary throughout on the MCU and specifically Black Widows journey within it. The one thing I am dissapointed about is the portrayal of Taskmaster...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However within the first 40 minutes I found myself bored out of my mind, the story is extremely bland in my opinion with the exception of the taskmaster character being a throwback to older fans.The film repeats them being a broken family over and over with the viewers losing interest in the film. One positive thing I have to say is the start of the film had a lot of action which enticed me to watch more. I personally find the Black Widow character like a cardboard box, very bland along with the other characters. Not much personality is put into the characters which is a shame as there is a lot of potential. The fight scenes are solid except for parts in the 3rd acts where CGI is very noticeable which is a shame for Marvel.In comparison films like Shang Chi and Spider Man far from home blows Black Widow out of the water. So in conclusion a poor film on Marvels behalf and definitely a film fans won't remember for a while.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I expected it to be another thing, dunno why. Even when it's Marvel and it is always the same god-damned thing, with Natasha Romanoff I thought they could pull it off as a simple but effective action movie. Too bad nothing of that was given to me. What I got was a senseless plot, a pretentious dialogue wanting to belong to a family drama but failing and a CGI so bad it almost killed the movie by itself. For example, there's a scene a helicopter falls and crushes to the ground, as a pathetic attempt of making humor (hey, Marvel's trademark there). But how the hell do you pretend to be funny when the helicopter looks fake as hell and has CGI effects all over it? Come on, that was pitiful dude. When even the CGI is against you, you know you are in big trouble. Then, one of the main plot points of this movie are feromones. Yes, you heard right. And that plot point appears magically as a plot device in the moment to create some conflict, so it's completely stupid. The action sometimes is kinda interesting, I give the movie some credit for that, but the movie is way too long and way too talky, and in the end, for what? Just make a straightforward action movie Marvel, ok? Is that so hard? By the way, I don't wanna talk about the post credit scene, is one of the worst ass-pulls after credits I've ever seen. 4/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yeah it was different from the usual marvel movies but that's one of the many reasons I liked it. It was action packed and taskmaster fight scenes were really cool! It had some family reunion/sibling scenes that didn't drag. I personally liked their interactions even the awkward moments. We don't really see Natasha with fam besides the avengers so it was nice to see she had people she can trust and care about and also care for her too. For all that happened between them, I think it was sweet and touching that they were in it together. It also had some funny moments from Yelena and their dad Alexeia. I have to say Yelena was definitely the star of the movie and I loved every moment she had screen time. I guess people who gave it lower rating were those who expected more of a superhero avenger like film but that's not what this really was.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It tries to be a dark spy movie, but using the Marvel formula. At first, you think it's going to be a dark action movie, judging by the amazing opening credits, but it turned out to be a half dark, half colorful messThe plot is absolutely pointless, and the villains are completely forgettable. Taskmaster was a massive disapointment, and not to mention Dreykov and the widows. Halfway through the film, the dialogue was so boring that I was forcing myself not to fall asleep, and the third act is completely nonsense, with noticeable CGI.The comedy is OK. Red Guardian is the comic relief of the movie, sometimes he gets the jokes right, sometimes not. The action/fighting sequences are lame and the score is meh.The best scene of the movie was the post-credit scene, which didn't fail to get me excited for the future of the MCU. Also, there were some nice comebacks from previous movies, which I enjoyed very much.The star of the movie was definetly Yelena Belova. Even with the bad script, Florence Pugh still managed to portray her character amazingly, I'm excited to see where her character is going from now on.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I need more from Taskmaster. This movie is a good stand alone film, but fell victim to the MCU expectations. Some of the Disney plus shows had more impact on the upcoming saga and that is what I think disappoints many.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I knew this movie was going to be great before i even saw the trailer, I've been waiting for this moment for years I'm glad they finally gave her; her own film. This really hits different now you really need to see endgame before you catch this yet another cinematic masterpiece, truly breathtaking i can't imagine the movie going any better than it did, they did everything i hoped for and I'm glad a fellow avenger didn't pop up as it could of been a risk of stealing the show/light.Black widow has always been a personal favourite of mine, not just in the movies but in the comics too, there is so much more to this character that we have learnt so far, such an iconic peformance from Scarlett Johansson, it really feels like no time has passed since between Captain America: Civil War & Avengers Infinity War as thats when this takes place, it was great to delve deeper within Natasha Romanoffs story, i really like her sister Yelena, i think she's going to be amazing.A perfect farewell to an amazing hero, make sure you stick around for the end credit scene... it's very vital to the MCU! I can't believe the reviews, some of them are really bad and i have no idea why, i guess they were watching a completely different film!Highly recommended, this is an incredible movie to add to your lists A MUST WATCH!!","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Slick action, engaging dialogue and plenty of your typical Marvel hero mayhem and destruction.Scarlett Johansson again did a superb job as Black Widow. She really owned the character. But IMO, Florence Pugh did an even better job portraying her character - Yelena Belova. It's a character that I quickly connected with - even more than the Black Widow character. I loved the interaction between Yelena and Natasha. Particularly how Yelena keeps teasing Natasha about her super-hero landing/pose. :)While I would have liked a bit more origin story (ie. More storyline of Black Widow's past), the writers did a great job in taking us along this journey. Though some periods of sentimental dialogue I feel went for a lot longer than they should have, it halted the fast pace the story has built.SUMMARY: Marvel did another fantastic job in creating an entertaining super hero origin story. But Florence Pugh I feel, stole the show.VERDICT: A must see if you love, action movies or super hero movies. Regardless, you will be entertained.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Unsurprisingly, the prequel did not live up to the hype.The problem with 'Black Widow' is it comes off as a standard, formulaic Marvel film that came off the assembly line just to check a box. It's true that Scarlett Johansson long ago earned the right to have her own entry in the MCU, but the franchise could have gone on just fine had this film never been created.David Harbour feels out of place as a washed up Soviet superhuman (not so much a superhero) and Rachel Weisz clearly did not show up for this gig to earn a shot at an Academy Award. The one bright spot is Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova, who manages to consistently nail a tricky Russian accent while effortlessly toggling between comedic one-liners and tough as nails action sequences.Save for a few impressive scenes, 'Widow' is pretty dull and doesn't feature any real fan favorites, especially compared to some of the better received Marvel entries of late. It's also clear that Disney had to scrounge around in the couch cushions to find enough pennies to pull this together - it just as well could have been turned into a miniseries on Disney+ given its quality.Lacking originality and coming so long after so many other films, 'Black Widow' is surely one of the lower tier installments in the MCU library. Still, it's worth a watch if for no other reason than to check a box.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Really try to make this movie work. However, a weak story followed by even weaker, one-dimensional antagonists prove to be a great anchor in what otherwise could have been an excellent spy thriller.The acting is pretty great across the board (although Ray Winstone is the exception here), you can tell they are giving it their best. Florence Pugh steals the show as Yelena Bolova.The dialogue, while a bit campy at times, is good for the most part. There were only a couple times during the film that I cringed at an awkward interaction. ""The only resource this world has too much of...is girls"" bleghhhh.Here begins the fatal flaw of the film. While the pacing is somewhat in control, the story they are telling here is boring and by the numbers for a standard comic book. It has been quite some time since Marvel had a terrible villain but lo and behold Ray Winstone's performance as the villain (who I can't even remember the name of despite them saying it maybe a 10 times in the film) is up there with characters like Kaecilius or Whiplash. While he does challenge the morals of our protagonist, something most great Marvel villains do, it is given so little thought or time to explore that I found it rather insulting. He could've been do much more impactful on this story.There is also a complete tonal dissonance. I understand Marvel movies rely now more on their comedic aspects than their dramatic ones, but a healthy combination proves to be the most thought-provoking and memorable. Here, the film introduces humor at the worst of times, with many of the jokes seemingly throwaway that could have been replaced with more serious moments given the darker nature of this films plot.The story is nonsense, with really no resolution. I won't get into spoilers as I still think people should see it given they are a fan of Marvel's work but yeah, the story's end really felt like a cliffhanger with nowhere to go.Again if you are Marvel fan, go see this film, you might get a kick out of it. If you don't particularly care about Marvel films, you can skip this one.5/10.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Rumors say that feige was interested but Disney didn't give approval. Some say that it developed after wonder woman's success. We got it but unfortunately our lead is dead in the main timeline. Last year, it was one of my most anticipated films. But slowly, I started feeling that MCU won't be great like before after endgame and black widow proves it right.These are the drawbacks of black widow
1. Timeline: This film would have some impact if it was released after civil war and the post credit scene shown in it could have been added in endgame.2. Taskmaster: taskmaster is heard to be an iconic marvel villain who can easily copy anyone's fighting skills. Taskmaster's addition in black widow made us excited but it turns into a sore thumb like Mandarin in iron man 3 and nick fury's eye in captain marvel. A twist is revealed in order to evoke some sympathy like winter soldier but unlike bucky who we knew very well in first avenger, and due to that we sympathised with him. On the other hand, we don't know anything much about the taskmaster character in order to sympathise with her.3. Villain: Its obvious that mcu lacks strong villains and black widow continues that tradition.4. Main character: we have seen in some films were the supporting characters score over the main character and save the film. It happens either because of the actor's limitations or the character. Here natasha romanoff was overshadowed by her sister Yelena belova not just in acting but also in saving the day. Scarlett Johansson is a great actress but her character is boring. No wonder she wasn't given a solo film before.5. Action sequences: Why, i was previously anticipating for black widow was because i expected it to have brilliant hand to hand combat mcu film after winter soldier. But black widow doesn't have any great or memorable action sequences.6. No entertainment: Black widow doesn't have any entertainment because of its dark concept. Even winter soldier and civil war had dark themes but where thrilling and entertaining but black widow lacks any thrill or entertainment.On the whole, black widow is a disappointing standalone film.

I was entertained.Some scenes fell flat sure. And the pacing did have some missteps, but overall it's just a good film
Only thing I can think is people are judging it as a ""marvel"" movie instead of just a film. Meaning it didn't live up to their expectations on what they know about the character or it didn't play into the overall universe like they wanted it to. I think if you just watch it. Be present. And not think of its implications and comic source, you'll enjoy yourself.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

On the one hand, it delves deep into what makes Natasha who she is and explores her backstory, family dynamic and her relationships with people. On the other, it's a film that should have come out years earlier - since her death in Endgame means that she will no longer appear in the MCU.The plot takes a while to get going, but it does eventually find its feet - teasing with a tense opening shot and then exploring how Natasha became a super spy.Natasha is a person that is willing to go through pain and is not afraid of death - yet will not accept when her loved ones suffer. And this film gives us an idea of why she decided on her sacrifice in Endgame.She was done a raw deal in many of the Avengers films. She started out as a sexy secretary with a set of skills on the side to the token female in the group of male super heroes - to a fully nuanced hero ready to do whatever it takes to save the innocent.We will miss her.Oh and Florence Pugh is absolutely incredible this film. Hopefully we will see more of her character in the future.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

It was a worthwhile wait. I do not understand why so much hate about it.From the beginning of the movie, I personally got directly hooked, the plot began to unfold in such an elegantly clear way and it always returned the emotion of tension, joy, fun or even drama.The action sequences are spectacular, the melee fights were very cool and in general the action of the movie is maintained from the beginning to the end.The best thing in the whole movie was to see Scarlet Johansson in all her splendor in her character as always making it wonderful. But Florence Pugh also complements this sister-sister chemistry in such a beautiful way and manages to make this adventure entertaining to the end.Also David Harbor and Rachel Weisz make good roles as interesting, funny and serious secondary characters but without much relevance in certain parts of the plot.The script is not the best or original that Marvel has presented, but it is still good for a movie with a female protagonist, even though I have already known this character long before.The villains are also not perfect and have previously seen objectives but therefore they did not make me the worst villains in the Marvel universe.As for the production, the film is very well done, some special effects I have heard that do not look completely perfect compared to other films but it did not make me ugly in itself.In conclusion, Black Widow fulfilled my expectations of what I expected in a solo movie of this wonderful character of the wonderful Scarlett Johansson and although it is not perfect, it does not make me the best Marvel Studios movie.The film managed to awaken my emotion towards what comes from these superhero movies in the future and leaves me with a good feeling of happiness for a future sequel to this film and wanting to see it again.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The cast is charismatic and the movie has some genuine funny moments and great action beats. A must watch.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But like the famous quotes says : ""It isn't the destination that matters, but the journey"". Some people might not enjoy this movie in spite of that, but the truth is that it adds a lot of layers to this mysterious Black Widow Program + everything surrounding the 'Red Room' and all these dark secret projects, with everything that it impacts on a greater scale... And it obviously adds a huge deal to Natasha Romanoff's story, her life/journey, and the human being behind the Avenger... That's the purpose of a standalone MCU movie ? Yes, and it did the job well !Now, about the experience of the movie itself. The upset feelings between the main 'players' logically bring a lot of depth to the characters involved in this story, their complicated/messed-up relationships and how all these souls have been tormented since ages throughout all this dark journey they've had to endure... The movie solidifies Natasha's choices & trajectory since this dark past, while also healing many important wounds in the process (not just hers)... It adds tasty new characters and a whole new 'mythology' to the MCU, one that is grounded in a spy/secret world...The way the movie is directed and cut, cleverly resonates with the specific emotions the director wants you to feel... It is well paced and well crafted in that sense, because every scene or sequence feels and looks organic with what it's telling you, you then feel like being a part of it.The action set pieces -as always with the MCU- are high level. And as expected for a Black Widow movie, the fight scenes strike hard ! Visually, it's always very catchy, smooth and beautifully staged. You never get lost in the action because the cinematography of the whole movie is masterclass. A specific mention to the use of light and contrasts, because it just adds this delicious icing over the whole movie (certain scenes are true eye candies)... And the whole score/soundtrack must not be overlooked ; certain tracks are fantastic, powerful, epic...A very good addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has a lot of heart and tells a true 'self-sufficent' standalone story, while being useful to the bigger picture , it grabs you nicely from the first to the last minute and has some really strong moments. All hail to Scarlett Johansson, for everything she has brought to this character, with an obvious love, passion, and complete dedication to this role.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Usually these superhero movies are only suited for kids, but this movie can be enjoyed by adults as well, because of these great character performances.The good:
great characters, with true to life dialogues, who star in an original story that enticed me from beginning to end. It charmed me, it made me laugh, it excited me, but foremost it touched me because the characters arent made out of card board, but are real and human. This is quite UNIQUE (and praise worthy) for a super hero movie!Any bad? It is full on ridiculous CGI action, but however silly, it is done in a quite exciting way, because of the splendid editing and because of the terrific photography. The action ROCKS!The story of this superhero movie is (fortunately) not only about the superb action, but is mostly about the characters, who all fervently desire to belong to a loving family. Being cut out of ones family and finding your loved ones again is what this movie is all about.End note:
WATCH the end credits till the very end, because there is a very touching and funny end segment, which many wont see otherwise!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

They had 2 hours to convey heart and soul on the Marvel character that we should be best able to relate to because, well she was not a god for starters.So many things happened that you think ""why would they do that?"" and not in a comic book they are superheroes kind of way. Just what were they thinking?This is a bit of a spoiler but it applies to everything else wrong about this film and it gives away nothing of the plot. There is not A Black Widow. They really diluted the character. It doesn't matter that it follows the same path as dumping the old, in with the new.

The best parts of the movie are the quiet scenes of dialog - sometimes tense, sometimes funny, sometimes heavy. Don't worry: there are plenty of thrilling set-pieces too!Being a Disney movie, it doesn't get too deep into real-world politics but does take time to examine the tragedy of human trafficking of young girls. Shortland goes further than all other Marvel directors on having her film reflect the horrors of our real world.But perhaps the best part of the movie is the humor. It's hilarious!

Nothing at all.It is true that it has some negative aspects, like the movie came a little too late, it should have been released in the proper chronology, certain villain is now, in my opinion, unusable, at least in the current version, and that we will probably wont see any sequel from Sjo due to the known character ending, and lastly, we thought that the movie was going to be scaled relative to the ""superpowers"" of the hero in question (so, none), actually the movie is comparable to the first Iron Man in terms of scale.Sjo did a good job leading the movie, but to be honest, it gave a lot of screen time to Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as she will probably join the MCU soon. She was given a good background, and she has the most hilarious lines in the movie. David Harbour was also great in his role, but i doubt we see more of him, unless he appears in flashbacks.The marvel movies are supposed to be fun, have epic action, with some jokes here and there,. It is all there, it is well executed. Not real complains from my part, other than the villain, timing and that it does little to nothing to advance the story (probably a set up to another solo movie or tv show, but its a long shot).Yes, the movie is almost irrelevant to the MCU. Yes, we might forget it soon. Yes, probably Sjo wont return, but this is a proper farewell to the character that we just didnt had in Endgame. But yes, it IS a good movie, go watch it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This was not the case.Very one dimensional story.The action was great but anyone can do that.We expect more from the greatest female spy in the MCU.It didn't do her story justice.It just introduced her replacement and set up more drama for phase 4 in the post credits scene.And that's about it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Black Widow is only concerned with bringing answers to points that are irrelevant and does not add anything to the MCU universe","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8250620/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","18 June 2022","There are two ways to watch a Marvel movie. The first is for the film production itself, its script, direction and performances - for its value as a film itself. The other is to follow it as a new chapter of that universe, where each story adds something new to that series. And, in the case of Black Widow, he fulfills none of those roles. In addition to all the delay in the film's release caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it also dragged on for years until she got off the ground. The character was introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the second Iron Man movie in 2010, and since then, fans have been asking for an adventure that tells of her origins. And it was only after her death in Avengers: Endgame that Natasha Romanoff got her starring role. But at what price?Although the first solo films of each hero of the studio usually bring the origin of the protagonists, here the past events of Natasha Romanoff's life are only brushed in the opening sequence. In the first act of the film we have a brief history of the childhood of Romanoff and her younger sister, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh). The adrenaline starts from there and what follows are scenes of the girls being separated from their parents and heading to the dark Red Room, where General Dreycov (Ray Winstone) brainwashed girls, otherwise known as black widows. From this, we have many explanations of how Natasha and Yelena grew up to be black widows.After this window and the opening credits - which deal with the exploitation of young girls abandoned in the dreaded Red Room, where they will be trained to become Black Widows - we are transported to shortly after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"", and see Natasha on the run from authorities after helping Steve Rogers save his friend Bucky Barnes. Scarlett Johansson's sensational performance makes the following scenes heavy and ends up showing fatigue and regret on her face. Although she tries to convince herself that she is already used to taking on new identities, this time the protagonist is leaving behind something that, as we saw at the beginning, she never had: a family. Natasha is then reunited with her sister Yelena, who recruits her on a mission to save other women, victims of the Red Room program. Here, the film finds its first stumble: the difficulty of translating the theme of abuse in the context of the MCU. The task was not an easy one, and Black Widow tries to approach the matter with some sensitivity. Sometimes this works, especially in the third act, when our protagonist meets her main antagonist. But for most of the film, the created analogy sounds more like an obligation than an actual speech.The pace picks up again when Natasha suffers the first attack from the Trainer, a villain who appears as an unstoppable and mysterious force in search of content that the Black Widow was previously unaware of. It is curious to note at the beginning of the first act how much director Cate Shortland (""The Berlin Syndrome"") has a hand present in the idealization of the film's action, as this style is also repeated in the drama scenes. These are blurry footage and many close-up frames, interspersed with some views from very imaginative angles, as a way of bringing the audience closer to the events of the feature.Because it is a film set in the past, it would be very easy for Black Widow to become uninteresting for fans, after all, we already know what Natasha's fate is. However, while there is no real fear for what could happen to the character, there is a curiosity that the studio takes advantage of. How was Natasha's childhood? Who is her family? How did she become who she is today and what was her life like before the Avengers? All those questions that have been on fans' minds for years are answered here in a very organic way - nothing sounds very didactic, it's just there, making sense within the story.One of the great merits of the script is that it makes each addition to Romanoff's ""family"" a special moment. With different doses of action, comedy and drama, the encounters are captivating and help to show different sides of the heroine. Feelings like empathy, hurt, affection, regret and frustration blend together and add layers that complement the leadership figure she took on in films like Infinity War and Endgame. At the same time, characters are presented that do justice to the responsibility of playing opposite such a beloved figure, with emphasis on Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova. The dynamic between the two characters is one of the highlights of the entire film and even adds an unexpected tone of humor, as Belova is slightly ironic and moody. The intimacy between the two also makes us want to know more about this new character, which we have come to care about. Narratively, this was a big hit for Marvel: if on the one hand we already know Natasha's fate, now the attention turns to what might happen to Yelena. Even the annoyance caused by the exaggeration of David Harbor's Alexei seems purposeful, to make fans wonder about the constant worship of superheroes.If one of Black Widow's mainstays is the fun interaction between the family, the other is in the action. Present from very early on in the film, the sequels are exciting and tailor-made to showcase the skills of all members of the quartet. And at this point it is also necessary to highlight the Coach. A classic comic book villain known for mimicking other fighters' abilities, he appears here as a walking tribute by embodying the fighting style of heroes like Captain America, Black Panther, Spider-Man and more. However, director Cate Shortland goes further and creates an imposing and terrifying figure. Almost like a slasher movie killer, he emerges in blind spots and in slow motion before starting another action sequence.The Coach, by the way, is part of the film's big theme: abuse. Due to what had already been revealed about the character in other films, the dive into her past brings up this topic, whose approach marks one of the problems of the story. Established since the powerful ending of the prologue, the theme uses the underworld of espionage as a metaphor. However, the discussion proceeds superficially, resorting to uninspired resolutions to complex issues. The trailers already showed that the character would not have much development, but what is presented on the screen borders on the ridiculous. He's literally a puppet that's there just to render an action scene, since he doesn't even have dialogue.As it moves towards the final act, the traditional problems of the ""Marvel formula"" end up being incorporated into the plot. Despite adversities and solutions that are equally superficial and resolved with the famous conveniences of the script, it is in the explosions and unmeasured special effects that ""Black Widow"" ends up getting lost. If, on the one hand, the plot even inserts controlling pheromones brings to the film an aura of spy films from the 1970s and 80s, at least we are pleased to see the protagonist taking the reins of the situation and atoning part of the guilt she carried until then.It is also curious that Black Widow is the rare case of a hero movie that improves in its final stretch. The last action scene, which brings the characters together in a final free-fall fight, draws attention for the beautiful choice of references, most notably that of Mission: Impossible. The confrontation between Natasha and Taskmaster (a villain whose identity reveal is a nice easter egg for fans) is a highlight too, although the kitchen fight between Yelena and Natasha, early on, still wins as the best fight in the movie.The great thing about Black Widow is that it's a movie that goes from nowhere to nowhere. And it's not that he can't tell his story-he doesn't even have one. We don't see anything about Natasha's training in the Red Room, her past, or even how it all comes back to haunt her. None of it is there. At all times, Black Widow refers to previous events that were never shown and that have great consequences here, such as the attempted assassination of the Russian leader who commanded the Red Room. To that end, the movie relies entirely on a single line of dialogue from the first Avengers and starts off as if that Natasha and Hawkeye mission was common knowledge.So it's an exaggeration to say that Black Widow has a script. In fact, it has a plot - ""an unfinished mission from Natasha brings back ghosts from the past"" - and the action scenes unfold to stretch the film. This is so true that the first hour is entirely made up of shooting, blasting and chasing without any contextualization or development. It is only in the second half that there is even a slightest breath to justify what is happening. The whole thing is so poorly tied that they didn't even bother to adapt the historical period. By showing Natasha's childhood with her fake family of communist spies, the film sets the scene in 1995 - when the Soviet Union no longer existed.We are talking about the beginning of Phase 4 in theaters, but the film is only concerned with bringing answers to points that are irrelevant and does not add anything to this universe. It's a very weak movie and an empty chapter for the MCU. Like a bad comic book tie-in, one wonders why this story even exists. If this was the way to honor one of the most iconic characters in the Avengers, it was better to have left her forgotten on Vormir.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A good movie, but the time it was released really hurt it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7160673/?ref_=tt_urv","Crimsus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur134943639/?ref_=tt_urv","25 July 2021","Overall, this was a good movie. There was plenty of action, but there was also plenty of character development.The one mistake that Marvel made that really hurt this movie is the timing. This movie is NOT a prequel/origin story, it is a character supplement that should have been released in theaters before Infinity War was released--but don't worry, it doesn't spoil anything about Infinity War and beyond. If anything, it does explain some of Natasha's motivations throughout the rest of the timeline through End Game. People expected a prequel/origin story, but this movie wasn't really either of those. That isn't bad, but Hollywood keeps making the same mistake with prequel/origin story style movies over and over again. A good movie(s) is released, people love the characters, and the bits and pieces of each character develop a preconceived idea with the audience of what any prequel/origin story should be like. Once the studio releases the movie, people are often disappointed because it strays away from how a character is portrayed to the audience. Now in the case of Black Widow, this isn't really a major problem, but the studios probably could have advertised this movie a bit different to avoid the prequel/origin story syndrome that plagues most popular films.The movie is about 10% backstory of how Natasha was indoctrinated into the Red Room, and the rest of the movie is about Natasha looking to set things right from her past. You'll get some exposition here and there to help fill in some blanks, and that is all that is really needed for the storyline. To be frank, I honestly don't think the finer details of the Red Room and Natasha's actual training needed to be filmed or explained in great detail--and the studio made the right decision in that aspect. What happened to her during her training, as told in the other movies, is enough to paint the picture of just how brutal and inhumane her life was. There's no need to dig into that. If you can't appreciate a character story without seeing a bunch of gore and disgusting treatment, then this movie isn't for you.I would recommend this movie to those that haven't seen Infinity War and End Game yet. I would recommend watching this before those as it really does add to the continuity and Natasha's character overall.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There was a lot of action that I really enjoyed - it was impressive, especially seeing the almost-nonstop action in a woman-led superhero movie! The intro credits with the slowed version of Nirvana and photographs of girls makes me emotional every single time I watch this; since first seeing it upon release, I've wanted to look into the ""too many girls"" situation, the horrific observation by Drakov. It may be a rarely considered issue, but the movie makes its impact on the issue. Of course, Florence Pugh and David Harbour stole the show, but I'm eager to see them reunited in Thunderbolts! Thank you, Scarlett Johansson, for making sure this movie was empowering and inspirational, as cheesy as that may seem. The action and story can be enjoyed by all, but the power remains with young girls to old women.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So, when she finally got her own movie, all I could say was, ""FINALLY"". But to my surprise, Black Widow (Natasha) did not even seem like the star of the show - not that the other Black Widow (Yelena) was bad. Similar to other Marvel movies, the comedic relief was on par. The plot seems to stay consistent with the Marvel cinematic world. But, unlike all the other Marvel franchise, the villain in this movie was PLAIN AF - no likeability, no charisma, and has a pointless storyline. Of course, like any Marvel movie, even the disastrous Incredible Hulk (2008), most people would still be able to say that it was at least entertaining to some extent.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is a very nice Marvel story.The movie has a great acting crew. Scarlett Johansson, David Harbour, Rachel Welsz, and Florence Pugh are awesome in this movie. Even though I saw a very nice act from Scarlett Johansson, she can play much better if her role allows her. For example, you can watch her movie with Bill Murray 'Lost in Translation 2003'. You will see how much capable she is.The special effect is incredible in the movie, especially in the sky fight scene. The action scenes are wonderful. My favorite scene is the car chasing scene. You see a lot of incredible stunt moves. There are a wide variety of scenes in the movie. I recommend this movie to superhero and action movie fans.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It just didn't come together, and not due to the talent as I've seen most of these actors in other roles where they were very good, but this just didn't work.The acting felt forced as did some of the action & story. A waste of time and $$$.Some parts were downright boring, especially with the heavy accents and depressing ""Russian"" back story & dialogue where I almost fell asleep. Hannah, Red Sparrow, or Anna as female assassin film were better, and worked, this didn't.One more thing, what's with the costume changes, it's like either you wear regular clothes or you have a uniform, but to have different uniforms for every other or different scenes or parts of the movie?It was the same with the unlimited supply of vehicles, like are these stolen or do you just rent them or what, out of nowhere?The devil is in the details, however the movie seemed like a copy of bits and pieces of the previous movies without detail, or a bad Bond film without any charisma.Not worth a 2nd viewing unlike all previous Marvel movies, this was barely worth a single.Oh, and the teaser at the end was just sad!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that no moments like that existed and they just made a film about a Marvel Character and not a film about a woman Marvel Character.Scarlett Johansson yet again shows why she was made for this character and just outdoes herself, she literally makes me emotional! Florence Pugh is exceptional, again, as she is in everything she does. The pair of them together was just perfect chemistry. Then to top it off, it's literally a film about people who have no superpowers, they are just amazing fighters but their bravery matches any superhero!The two female movies we've had so far have been a woman who's a literal god and a woman who has powers that no one else can really compete with, now here we have a woman who has no powers but acts like she does, there was moments where I wanted to cry because I was finally witnessing the film I've always wanted to see.Absolutely smashed it out the park! The action is crazy good! There's a really good plot and you feel like you're finally getting to really understand Natasha as a person! As its not focused on the fact that it's a bunch of women fighting its enjoyable for everyone and even my highly critical partner liked it! I'm just glad that there's finally a Black Widow film as I'm going to miss that character so much, one of my ultimate faves!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The red guardian is a really interesting character that really needed more back story and more screen time as David Harbour did a great job in this role.

Negative reviews were often either action scenes seen before or a DVD issue. Yes, we've all seen car/cycle chases ad infinitum, and floating cities. But, when if what you represent so far outclasses the past, then that is noteworthy. Car/cycle chase scenes (crashes of course) were realistic & mind blowing. The CGI scenes involving the floating city - best ever. Yes, the usual action fight scenes were typical (not much you can do there) but didn't detract. Storyline of evil corporate mind controlling & mysterious drug to counter said nastiness also done before, but fit in well with the storyline. The search for one's family done before; also well done here. Some tongue-in-cheek humor to lighten the mood at times.Intelligent dialogue, ""This would be a cool way to die."" as they were about to be frozen in an avalanche (great CGI).

This whole film is easily the most disappointing of the whole MCU. I love a bit of escapism but there was nothing to really lift it. I suspect that has something to do with the fact that writing Romanoff's story was a delayed box ticking exercise to put out a female lead Marvel blockbuster rather taking the time to write a solid story worthy of such a strong and gutsy character. Barely adequate. At least Captain Marvel delivers on every level but this was a bit of a damp squib.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I just dont like this. There are pacing issues, the script is awful, especially the clunky exposition. The new characters are all 2 dimensional, especially Draykov (whos name I had to look up, such was his impact on the viewer). The action sequences start off ok, but got gradually more ridiculous. This idea that CGI stunts can ignore the laws of physics is infuriating. Good CGI bends the laws of physics to the level of 'far fetched', but not beyond. Atleast a dozen times the film makers flew too close to the sun and from the half way point on, it was akin to watching fast and furious 10 (or whichever number they're up to now). The only reason I haven't scored this lower is because of the occasionally humourous moments. IMO The worst of the MCU films, with Shang-chi, Iron man 3, and Thor 2 following just behind. A disappointing last outing for a fan favourite character.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It isn't daring and inventive like Guardians or Ragnarok but it isn't ""make me cry"" boring like Captain Marvel or Dark World, it's more on the scale of something like Iron Man 2, a great cast, a story with some interesting elements but not much more. The film does teach you a bit about what Black Widow was up to inbetween Civil War and Infinity War but when something like the Loki finale is releasing 5 days later it feels as if Black Widow isn't contributing much to the MCU canon. One big thing I noticed as well that kind of shocked me was some of the shoddy VFX work, there are some parts with explosions that look like they could have been ripped from an early 2000s X-Men film.If you're a MCU fan this film will satisfy you and I will admit that sitting in the cinema for the first time since lockdown started in the UK and watching the first marvel film to be released in around 2 years I did have a great time, excited for what's going on in the rest of phase 4 but it it's off to a slow start.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I guess after Disney acquired Marvel, we are going to see the same movie again and again.

Okay to watch if there's nothing else on that's cerebral. It's just a waste of money and time. Needessly over violent. When I was a kid and read comic books they were fun these are not fun.

From the perspectives of the child and the care giver. The love and attachment of a kid for an indifferent 'parent'. Is it still a family? This is supported by some good performances. I'll miss Scarlett's Black Widow. Her story ends at the beginning with her origin which is poetic in a way.

That being said, it still falls short in many areas and feels like a one and done film that I'll likely never watch again.If anything was done right in this film, I would say it had to be the casting. The actors and actresses were well chosen and I found several of them to be believable given the fictional world they were depicting.The social interaction and real life drama written into the script was well done, but overall it really lacked cohesion and it's easy to get lost, and this is coming from someone who's read most of the Marvel comics growing up. The script writers and director really seemed to lack direction and the pace of the film suffers as a result. Instead of being enticed to see the ending, you find yourself asking when will it end, and is thus too long given the story and the plot.I would give it a higher score, but only because I would be comparing it to the low bar Disney has set with other pieces they've put out. When comparing it to the entire body of films put out by Marvel, I'm unfortunately forced to stick with a hard 5. The whole lawsuit fiasco surrounding this film also didn't do Disney or Scarlett any favors, as it made the piece more about the money and not the storytelling/art form.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Both Florence Pugh and David Harbour were extremely memorable and were one of the biggest strengths of this movie. Johansson also did her thing.Overall I found the first half of the movie (the set up) stronger than the second one. The villain and the ending fell a little flat to me but I wouldn't say that it was too bad. It's just that it didn't fully utilize its potential.I actually really liked the idea of the plot and it felt like it was up my alley but some of the execution could have been better.Overall I think Black Widows is worth a watch for any Marvel fan but it's far from the best Marvel movie. The supporting cast did an amazing job though.7.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters were likable, Natashas sister was absolutely hilarious, the story was wholesome and the action was great, minus a few CGI effects that were not that good.After a movie I love to go into the reviews and see how others have experienced the movies. I am greeted with at maximum 5/10 reviews, most are a lot lower.Not one of those really explains what makes the film so bad. There is a 2-liner that just says it is b-o-r-i-n-g and it gets 157 out of 258 ""helpful"".Most of the ""reviews"" here are just rants and still marked as ""helpful"". How is a rant helpful? How did it help you in any way?Don't get me wrong though, if you think this movie is a 1 or 2/10, I honestly don't know what to say to you, because there are far, far, worse movies out there, but hey, to each their own. I personally think that at least Black Widows production values are great, which already makes it at least a 4/10 in my book, but perspectives might differ.But I always thought this was a cinematic page with people capable of expressing their opinions and people valueing in depth analysis.This happens in most action movies nowadays and I am losing faith in my fellow movie lovers.Anyway, if you like movies from the MCU, give this a chance.Is it without plotholes? No, there are some to b found.Is it perfect with the best action ever seen? No, but it has great production values.Is this the next ""Godfather"" and the acting will rain Oscars onto the cast? No.But the movie is entertaining and I absolutely don't understand where the hate is coming from. I would like to understand it, but there are no reviews that explain it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

(much much better than both Black Panther and Wonder Woman '84 ) Yes it could have been darker and more serious, ala ""Anna"" (2019), ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017) or obviously the awesome ""Red Sparrow"" (2018). Of course there were things here and there that annoyed me a little, but never something that bothered me throughout the movie. More like for a moment here and there...after all this is a Marvel superhero movie, so it wouldn't be fair to expect it to be things like scary, realistic or educational, for example ;)
I really loved the fighting sequences! Yes they were exaggerated a.f. But again...this is a superhero movie.It's 100% pure entertainment!However, what impressed me the most was Florence Pugh! While David Harbour and Scarlett Johansson were great in their roles, the only reason why the're not sharing the spotlight here is BECAUSE they are great actors (an extra ""great"" for David who's in my opinion a somewhat underestimated actor) and so, anything BUT great would have been a disappointment coming from those two. Sorry David and Scarlett, but with greatness comes responsibilities :)
No, the star that shone the brightest in this film was an unexpected one! It was the star of Florence Pugh and it shone throughout the whole film, and the fact that her voice ""matched the accent"" (i know this sounds weird) was just icing on the cake for me.I think i'm smitten :)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think his appreciation for the video comes mostly from how many shots are fired and how many explosions there are. I have more complex views to evaluate.I thought this was the worst Marvel video out of the dozen or so I've watched. I blame it all on the director.There were many scenes where the camera was in way too tight. It was difficult to follow the action to even get a sense of which of the two fighting was winning or not.This video would have been much better if I had seen the Marvel comic behind the story. The video did not do a good job of standing on its own. It was difficult to figure out the overall story.Even though my son enjoyed the movie even he spoke up a few times saying nobody could live through some action scenes. Do super heros feel pain? Do they heal a few instances after being badly beaten?There were a few good Marvel sized action scenes. Way too many frames devoted to non-action.To me the movie was a disappointment.The best thing about this move was my son and I spending time together.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

A great throwback to the espionage themes in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was a good choice given Natasha's spy-roots.We get the chance to see one of the biggest splotches of red in Natasha's ledger, and how she attempts to wipe it clean. The deep-dive into her past is also extremely well done, and twists and turns that occur are not at all forced. The action, especially the fight-choreography is some of the best to come out of a Marvel film. As expected, it's very ""show-y"" but very practical, brutal and extremely well acted. I could easily see some people seeing/enjoying this film strictly for the well crafted fighting.While it would be easy to make a film about an aloof spy very cold and void of emotion, ""Black Widow"" carries much heart with laments on family, and how overwhelming and shocking it can be to confront ones past. The acting is especially well at conveying this; I would argue all of the mains are worthy of awards.Overall ""Black Widow"" is a great espionage-acting film that has a lot of heart in the miss, and definitely worth the watch. My only major regret is that this wasn't released sooner.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Scarlett Johansson was born to play the role of Black Widow but it looks as if the role is taking its toll on her as she pretty much sleep walks through the film. The great Rachel Weisz is hugely underused and David Harbour starts off as a troubled father/undercover agent then turns into some sort of bumbling aged superhero with one liners that are just not funny. Florence Pugh is about the only saving grace in this film acting wise but even her russian accent is as bad as the rest of the casts.When watching this film you find yourself waiting for the next action sequence and the monologues in between just filler until the next cgi explosion. Marvel have done a pretty decent job in most of their previous films developing characters that u actually care about so that the 2-3 hour run time that all Marvel films seem to have now don't seem so long. Unfortunately with Black Widow they failed miserably and even the half decent action sequences can't save this film from itself.Marvel need to realise not all their films need to be sprawling epics, sometimes less is more and i feel if some of the unnecessary drawn out scenes would have been left on the cutting room floor we would have ended up with a 100-110 minute more polished action flick.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The family twists and turns were good and the action sequences were decent. I really expected Marvel to be headed downhill fast after the last Avengers movie, but with Far From Home and this movie they left me feeling like maybe they can keep it going for a while longer. I guess if you are looking for it to be a solid 9 or 10 you will be disappointed. But if you are looking to be entertained and enjoy amazing acting (by the rest of Black Widow's family) then you probably be glad you watched it. I don't understand the ""garbage"" reviews.

It's a pity the first and only Black Window film was so soulless
The movie is 5 years late easy. The ending especially is just loud action scenes and explosions no meaning whatsoever.She had a perfect character ending in Endgame, and then they make a prequel movie right after the events of Civil war which didn't contribute to the character or the overall story
The film was purely made to make money with a generic plot.Little they know COVID happened and they didn't even make that, such an irony.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The big surprise was the character development of the movie. So many of these assembly line Disney movies seem to skip a lot of that in many movies. This one took it's time developing some great characters and letting us decide who we would like and not, don't get me wrong, there is a top class villain to bring that whole protagonist dimension to a crescendo and give the viewer a nice ride through the movie. There was more unpredictability in this than in the 10 Rings for sure.Great watch that builds a connection between viewer and characters.Great 2 hour escape from the insanity of a pandemic world. Very needed. Nice to get back to the movies late 2021 and hope we can keep going in 2022.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Logic dictates that after missing the boat when Wonder Woman came out, Captain Marvel's decent output and traditionally super-powered male leads getting their own spin-offs, it's hard to picture where a ""basic"" character like Black Window will fit in. She doesn't have a shield, a suit, a hammer nor magic to keep us entertained with for at least 120 minutes. But we have been bombarded with all these enhanced beings left and right that maybe we needed someone to ground us back again. And Black Widow fits the bill.We get a super spy action movie at a time when James Bond or Ethan Hunt have been awol for a while now. In a review for Hobbs and Shaw I floated the idea of a dysfunctional family of spies and we get that here. We get Florence Pugh (we love her in Midsommar) who was a big help in carrying the movie, David Harbour (we love him in Stranger Things,) Rachel Weisz (we love her in the Mummy films) and Scarlett Johansson finally gets the spotlight she deserve (if only to pay her back for having to endure all the sexist questions she had to maneuver her way out of for suiting up as Black Widow for the past decade.)While obviously not the strongest MCU installment in the 24 movies released so far, the fact that Black Widow was even made (Johansson also serves as an executive producer,) released, in the middle of a pandemic at that, earn some money and bring up talks of a future installment (Pugh to take over unless they do a prequel) is too much of a win for a movie that so many people (me included) doubted in the first place. Black Widow can now rest in peace knowing she wiped clean all the red in her ledger, and then some.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not once is it forced down the viewers throat that this is a ""girl power"" movie. This only further stresses what a hot pile of garbage Capt Marvel was.One of the worst aspects of this movie was that as the story escalated, they were obligated to further and further up the ante of typical Marvel action sequences. The movie was strong and easily stood on its own without the 20 minutes of explosions and fighting that took place near the end.Overall, fantastic.

I have to say it is probably one of the top 3-4 DC movies. Of course since it is a Marvel movie, that is not a good thing. Neither is the movie and Thor:Dark World is no longer my least favorite Marvel movie. I have trusted Marvel and so far they always delivered until Black Widow. A lackluster movie was (in the words of Thanos) ""inevitable"".The story was weak. The actors did their best I felt but the story and many locations just did not support them. Taskmaster is one of my favorite villains but they really messed that up. Taskmaster was never in the ""comics"" costume with the cape and it is a shame because it is a cool costume. Also, no spoiler, this was not the comic Taskmaster in several ways.I envision a production meeting going something like ""Hey, let's make a new Batman movie. Yeah! Only instead of him being American, let's make him a Pacific Islander. Yeah! And instead of his parents being killed, he could be stranded from a boat wreck. Yeah! And instead of being rich, we make him an inner city drug dealer who then escapes prison. Yeah! That'll be an awesome Batman movie!"" Except of course it is absolutely NOT a Batman movie. I think the same thing happened here with Taskmaster and some other story elements. DC movies and Pre-Marvel Studios movies suffered from this and it is sad to see it finally hitting Marvel Studios.Red Guardian was awesome and funny and met expectations and the Yelena character was acceptable.What bothers me most of all is the people who will say ""people will not accept a female led superhero movie"" just as they did with WW84. It is not that at all (see how well Wonder Woman did). It is that people do not like a crummy movie whether it is male or female, white, black or asian led. Marvel, you can and should do better.Note that if you go see Black Widow, there is a scene at the absolute end of the credits (no other credit scenes) that sets up other things in the MCU.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has the same backstory as many ""sleeper agent"" movies (Red Sparrow and Salt come to mind) but Black Widow only glosses over this.Instead of a solo outing, Black Widow introduces five new MCU characters, and the script does not even come close to presenting them in any compelling manner. The audience understands why Thanos did what he did in Infinity War. It made him an ambivalent villain through good storytelling. In Black Widow, Dreykov (the villain) gave a short exposition two-thirds in, and that scene made him into a one-dimensional megalomaniac, like one out of an old James Bond movie.William Hurt showed up for perhaps 30 seconds in the beginning of the movie and another 10 seconds in the end. His character made absolutely no impact on the story (think about the last scene). Removing those scenes may have made the movie slightly less incoherent.Good: Good performance from the actors.Bad: Un-compelling villains, under-developed characters.Ugly: Jump-cuts - you really don't need to move the camera for every sentence uttered or when every time someone gets punched or kicked.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Why not create exciting action sequences that capitalize on her skills and problem solving rather than minimize her character's capabilities and reputation.One last thought, as many times as the word ""avengers"" is mentioned throughout the film, it almost felt like a psychological writing technique to ensure the audience is still programmed to be Marvel loyal. Either that or they felt it was a cheap way to remind viewers that this is a Marvel film.Overall enjoyable even if it became a loud heartless mess at the climax.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And after watching it, I understand why. It basically boils down to... how much do you understand about the comic book genre and black widows journey in these comic books (or acceptable journeys) ?!My review: Plain and simple. It's bloody good! It really fits into the MCU. And has a great story that will fit well into the future. More on this later...But overall: It's a great flick that has it all. Action. Drama. Story. Emotion. And really good acting and directing/ CGI! No noticeable flaws. It's a good flick! FULL STOP!So to dissect the movie further... This movie delves into Natasha Romanoff a little further. Shows us a glimpse of her background, family ties etc. And what drives her ... and then years later what brings her backgrounds together, if at all!There is a good story line about her sister here. And I'm glad they did... It's a great opportunity for future movies (I hope) about her story. She's a great strong character as well.But the best thing about this movie (besides aligning the facts with the avengers storyline) is the emotional aspect of Natasha, and what drives her to do what she does. Where she comes from?! And why she pursues to do what she does. This ties well with the endgame movie and her choices then! (Hint!) ""The burst of new found emotions"".This movie is a great watch, and it will make double more sense to those who have followed what has happened in Avengers End Game.In a nutshell. If you watched endgame. You have to watch this! Her decisions will make more sense!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But for the expectation it might disappoint you a little . Movie starts of well in the beginning and that action sequence involving Scarlett is complete mad fan stuff and . In the middle there is a little family drama with fun of marvel's mark but that drama will test your patience definitely for even a Marvel fan Coming to performances Scarlett Johansson had done a great job , but there is show stealer that is Florence Pugh who nailed the complete show , we cant take eyes of her remaining all other actors had done a decent job , Coming to technicalities Cate Shortland had done a good job in extracting performances and production values are rich as usual and music is about okay
Main Highlight : Post credit scene with Florence , Performances
Drawback : Climax fight CGI should be taken care a little.Especially film is between Civil War and Infinity war before going to film you should watch civil it might keep you hooked removing all other marvel movies from your mind.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought we were finally getting a movie about Natasha Romanoff. Maybe finally we get a proper send-off for her.We weren't and didn't, not in this film. I don't really know what the hell we got, aside from the introduction to Yelena Belova (who, is amazing and kick-ass and Florence Pugh is perfect as her, but my point still stands). The story is convoluted, to the extent there really is one, and I don't know, I guess if this had come out several years ago, maybe it would have been easier to forgive. But not at this point.Watching the Assembled episode for the film, it became even more apparent that there wasn't a coherent story in this film. It's fine to have a film be character-driven, but there still has to be a direction to go in. This was all over the place.Lastly, the CGI/VFX were so visible (and thus terrible) at one point I was shocked. This was not up to Marvel caliber.Black Widow deserved so much better. I was so sad that this movie turned out the way it did.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

To prove that; I actually liked Daredevil and Green Lantern - 2 movies panned by critics and fans alike. But I'd rank this movie way below those two; it just didn't do it for me.The focus was mostly on Natasha's family (not just the Avenger's family) and involved a lot of drama.Lastly, 2 more complaints: no matter how badly beaten up Ms. Romanoff was in a fight, fall or building collapse, she never exhibited more than a slightly bloody nose. And finally - I'm sorry, but you just can't bring in the Elaine Benes character (end of movie) and expect us to take that actress seriously!Final Verdict: Sappy with some James Bond like action scenes.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

With fan expectations at a high after the Infinity War saga completing, and the only phase 1 avenger to not have their own dedicated movie, all eyes are on the Black Widow Movie to close the Black Widow story from the avengers.Thoughts:
This film really drives this idea of family for Black Widow that is extremely out of character when compared to the previous phases. Another review compared Black Widow being a side kick in her own movie. Its hard not to agree with that. As someone who has never read the comics, this still feels bad. It feels like Marvel setting up her sister Yelena for Phase 4 rather than closing the Black Widow Saga.The film is brought up by the introduction of Alexei and Melina played by David Harbour & Rachel Weisz respectively. This Cold War era spy family provides comic relief through out the movie with their ""every day"" family issues.One word to describe movie:
Forced.Closing statement:
It would be easy to blame the poor script on Disney if it wasn't for Scarlett Johansson producing & hand picking the Director for Black Widow. If your on the fence about buying a ticket (or Disney primer access) I'd recommend holding off until its available on normal Disney+.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And it definitely met both those expectations with flying colors.What I wasn't expecting was the laugh out loud family comedy sprinkled throughout.Scarlett Johansson has always been adept at dry humor, but Florence Pugh is hysterical throughout. Rachel Weisz (where have you been??? Please don't leave us again!) And David Harbour (who deserved a much better Hellboy movie) were both fantastic as well.And Marvel's decision to have a relatively unknown female director pays dividends from the start. The movie has a tender undercurrent of family, trauma and coming to terms with the choices you make that might easily have been missed by a more conventional action style director.And yes there is an end credits scenes at the very tail end. I laughed my butt off, and it is definitely leading ti something big down the road...Is it consequential to the MCU... maybe not? But it is fantastic to get a long overdue deep dive into one of the core members of the Avengers. And any movie that gives me not 1, not 2, but 3 ass kicking women main characters and passes the Bechdel test in spades? Yeah, sign me up.8/10And sidenote to this. If you can and you are comfortable go see this on a big screen! We did IMAX and it was fantastic. Action, gorgeous vistas, more action. Worth it. But if you are still only up for At Home viewing then please pony up for the Disney+ premium access. We need Hollywood to know we want more female led films and they listen to dollar signs before anything else.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is basically a fan service, so what you get is a filler movie, simply giving us some answers about Natasha's past.The story as we know from the trailer is about Natasha going back to Russia and is reunited with her dysfunctional family. The treatment of the movie is classic marvel, i.e. A little bit of emotional drama with comedy sprinkled over it enough to not let it go to the dark ""DC"" side. It has all the predictable yet fun elements in it.Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Black Widow one last time and delivers another reliable kick-ass performance that we expect from her. We get all her signature moves- the kicks, the head locks and even the cool superhero landing. She is simply fantastic!Supporting her is her aforementioned dysfunctional family. The mom is smart, dangerous and cunning, played by the stunning Rachel Weisz. The dad is big and goofy but equally strong and menacing, played by the reliably charming David Harbour and finally the young kid sister is played by my Florence Pugh, who is equally bad-ass as her big sister Natasha and as annoying a young sibling should be. She is unarguably my favorite in the movie.This movie has everything you expect from a Marvel movie. The action set pieces are great and are choreographed to the highest entertainment level. The CGI is what we have come to expect from a Marvel movie. The cinematography and camerawork are also top notch.The two big negatives that I would say this movie has are -
a). It does not have a strong villain (it has two villains but neither of them are strong enough for our Avenger)
b). We know exactly when and how Natasha is going to die in the MCU timeline, so at no point do we really feel that she is in any real danger during any of the fight scenes, so that takes away from a bit of thrill that it could've benefited from.Overall I would say Black Widow had a lot of potential to be great, but ends up being just good. Still, it's worth your time and money to go check it out in a theater near you, especially in an IMAX or Dolby, i.e. If you are fully vaccinated of course.

However, unlike other superheroes, Black Widow as a character simply lacks the punch that other characters possess. Perhaps better equipped to be made as a more traditional spy movie, Black Widow is stuck between that and a Marvel flick. It lacks the touch of magic and the film feels flat. Also would have liked to see more of Natasha's past before she became Black Widow. The ending however is quite fulfilling, an honest and heartfelt farewell.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The ones with great reviews I usually end up hating. And the ones with awful reviews I end up loving. So I stopped reading them until after I watch a movie or show. I loved black widow. I know nothing about the avengers and all that stuff, so as an outsider with no expectations. I loved it and enjoyed watching it (my boyfriend made me watch if you're wondering why I watched in the first place). The story was empowering and reminded me of the very real human trafficking of women and girls happening in our world today. The co-star Pugh was definitely a scene stealer. I loved her character the most. Scarlett, Weisz, and Harbour were awesome. I gave 8 stars because I think it probably could of gave more, went a little more deeper but the movie is already 2 hours long so I understand why it couldn't have gone that way.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But, after saw the film it was changing me at all.. ""Is it the best marvel movie?"" Obviously not for me.. ""But is it different?"" Yes it is.. Well in the beginning they're add some opening credit that Marvel movies infrequently do that, but in this movies they add it out. And after that the performance are nailed it. From middle to ending i can saw potential from Florence Pugh that obviously she remarkable actress, and add David Harbour also make me laugh at many scenes though. Alright now move on to minus point from this movie, Well first it's obviously too late too realise the movie in 2021 (goddamn it pandemic) because this movie will get the hype in 2020 when natasha died on endgame that actually release in 2019.. (Spoiler even most of you already know it) so most of us have the sympathy of the character, second the movie obviously not focus on the main character (Natasha Romanoff) but I think they're focus on Yelena Belova which is Florence Pugh (Because the contract on Scarlett Johansson end in this film), and the last one I think there is too much CGI on this film that sometime makes me feel illogical to realize it out. Well I think it wasn't that bad to see the film its obviously great to a person who miss watching marvel movies Score:8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a little clumsy at times, but I genuinely think this outrage towards the movie is ridiculous. It's pretty campy at some moments and requires you to suspend your disbelief, but the characters were surprisingly compelling. I really do like the dynamic of Natasha's family. Marvel movies tend to follow a formula and I don't think this deviated too much. With that being said, I knew what to expect and was actually kinda surprised. Not every joke works and sometimes you'll be asking ""why does everybody have a one liner prepared "" but just remembered you're watching a Marvel movie. Despite that, I laughed more than I thought. This element honestly worked in Black Widow's favor as a character, humanizing her and adding depth. This is not a back story , but it tells you what you need to know about her.Her character before this movie was generally pretty lackluster, even with the small moments that really worked for her. I think we could mostly agree her character was mostly one dimensional and came off as more of an obligation to a trope, rather than an autonomous human with personal motives and morals and goals. This movie changes that, even if you think Natasha is not that unique of a character (which I'd probably disagree with).The cinematography was different from most Marvel movies but in an honestly pretty stunning way, at least when it came to the lighting and the more ethereal nature shots. CGI was not amazing but it was pretty good.I gotta commend this movie for actually fleshing out Black Widow's character. I actually feel something for her now. Her story is honestly pretty cool and I did not expect the movie to get so violent and visceral but it did and it usually served the narrative. Some moments are just cheesy explosions that really only make you ask ""how is anyone still alive in this movie"" but you really just gotta suspend your disbelief, it is a superhero movie.This movie is pretty good, better than I expected. The movie wasnt perfect and there's a few things I'd change but I'm generally quite pleased. Definitely check it out, and be prepared for a little extra blood and stupid action-movie stuff like sniping on the wing of an airplane. Refreshing, and satisfying.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In fact, for the first half of the movie, 'artificial' was a good descriptor for a lot of aspects, such as the arbitrary justifications for some of the fights, the occasionally distracting, underbaked CGI or the somewhat disconnected soundtrack.That being said, Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbor are all on point; their characters have a delightful, engaging chemistry and there's both a surprising humor and a deep sorrow to their dynamic as a quasi-real family. It is here that lies the pleasant surprise of the movie, its greatest strength: giving Black Widow some more character development, deepening her profile as a character and leaving a post-Ultimatum legacy for her and the characters connected to her.I began watching this movie with a frustrated, cynical outlook, expecting a by-the-numbers cardboard flick of the Great Marvel Machinery, yet I found a heart in this story. It takes a while to show, and it is occasionally obfuscated, but it's definitely there.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Where it fits in the timeline is confusing and lots of it doesn't make much sense.

Quite boring I might say; yes, she's a spying badass assassin, but although rightfully so, overshadowed by Thunder Gods, angry green dudes and what not. It never seemed like she had a platform as a character in this messy circus. Until this was announced.. and oh boy they did not deliver.First of all - character played by miss Pugh is far more interesting than all the baggage we got for Romanoff over the years, and this was the time to deliver on her part; unfortunately they did more of the same.Second - the story. What is this the 90's? Generic antagonist - I am this and that cause I am evil. Pointless, stupid, intern level writing.""I will take over the world with all these women soldiers!""
Why?Third. I know this is a marvel film, but there is no real quintessential character development at all./ ** Sorta spoiler here
Yes, there are sentimental moments of fake families reunite and children being abused for their exceptional predisposition to combat skills or whatever.**/

Perhaps it could have been a hit if it was released a decade ago, but these formulaic superhero flicks are definitely starting to grow outmoded. It's never terrible but just too naively written and visibly lazy in execution. Yet, I feel that it's the flaws that made the film so enjoyable to my taste.The usual Marvel template gets updated with a bunch of spy thriller stereotypes in the veins of ""Mission: Impossible"" and a beating heart for family affairs that made me inevitably think of ""The Incredibles"" or even ""Spy Kids"". The ensemble cast has good chemistry, and, despite the emotional moments falling terribly flat and the gags feeling like they were written in the 90s, watching the characters interact was more than pleasant. The Russian accents coming and going for no apparent reason bothered me at first, but after hearing Ray Winstone's, I just stopped caring about it altogether.Needless to say, the action scenes are always fun to watch. I just wish they would stop relying on confusing fast cuts and distracting CGI flourishes, though. I was actually surprised to read so many names in the special effects department as some of the chroma key shots were absolutely atrocious (the one with Yelena getting blasted away by an explosion deserves special mention). Still, the most distracting thing of the whole movie was Natasha's smart solution to resist the villain's pheromones, possibly the most WTF moment since the infamous ""rubber lips"" in ""Batman & Robin"".","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The music score was pretty good. There was a nice blend of some young/new and old actors.On balance they did pretty well for a Marvel/Disney production and it will probably keep the fans who are familiar with the rest of the franchise happy. Although if you take it as a stand-alone film and measure it against wider cinema then it's pretty weak and unmemorable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Boring and unsurprising. The villain was not even a villain! (that is a villain that has his agenda that the viewer can understand)Maybe the problem is that there is little more than Thanos for Marvel at that time.

She doesn't disappoint but also all the other cast members are outstanding. It has all the mandatory, implausible and impossible action, including some chase scenes and crashes that no one in reality could survive. But hey!! It's a fantasy movie and overall very enjoyable.It starts in Ohio in 1995, where we meet what appears to be a typical suburban family of four, with two young girls, until ""dad"" tells all ""It is time to go, do what we have talked about."" They make a thrilling escape to Cuba in a pre-hidden airplane, then on to Europe and Russia.The movie soon jumps forward 21 years and Natasha (Johansson) has become Black Widow working with the Avengers. And then it develops from there.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. We were entertained and that is all you ask for in this type of movie.JAN 2023 update: Just watched it again on BluRay after 9 months and I enjoyed it even more the second time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","GACK. Nowhere near as good as the character deserved.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7139980/?ref_=tt_urv","ScottBang","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4572033/?ref_=tt_urv","19 July 2021","Nowhere near as good as the character deserved. Yet, this film was not the train wreck that I was expecting. For every wrong turn or poorly crafted element there seemed to be two positives. In other words, two steps forward and one step back. While that formula isn't the most pleasant journey, it gets you where you need to go. That's the definition of this movie at this late time... a satisfactory film that delivered Natasha's back story in a proficient manner. It's not completely soulless but leaning heavily in that direction. The action isn't noteworthy but it's not pathetic either.The more you digest the film, the more middle of the road it gets as there are some things to like and some things to roll your eyes at and hate. The Taskmaster for instance is an absolutely pathetic villain. The main villain pulling the strings was a straight up ""mustache twirling"" evil guy for the sake of evil. He had all the depth of an Austin Powers villain or an over-the-top bad guy Liam Neeson would kill at the end of one of his movies. Another huge negative was that everything had to be spelled out as if the audience had the intellect of a small child. They left no dots to be connected at all, often telegraphing every turn. It was predictable to the point of nausea. Also, the ""mother"" character delivers another female antagonist in this phase of the MCU that commits horrible crimes and acts and never answers for them at all.I did like the supporting cast of Yelana and the Red Guardian. It seems to me that they passed the Black Widow baton properly from one sister to another. I did enjoy the call backs to past films.Overall, cutting it slack for what has come before might be its saving grace. Otherwise, it's completely middle of the road in every way. To say it delivers ""see spot run"" writing and below average direction is an understatement.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
