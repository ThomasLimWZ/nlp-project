"7","/10","Luc Besson's 'Lucy'.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5568189/?ref_=tt_urv","swordsnare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37874877/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2020","I enjoyed this for the most-part. The momentum in combination with the 90 minute runtime, kept myself entertained for the entirety. It's far from perfect, but it's entertaining. Then again I didn't labour over the science to over complicate the overall enjoyment. The climax is probably the most contentious and unfavourable issue, but I appreciate the intent of Luc Besson's vision.Note: It's probably best to ignore the super low-scoring trolls, who create accounts to downvote and spread negativity. If you don't have some constructive criticism, don't say anything at all. Any 'Not helpful' downvotes on this review are probably by the aforementioned.","143 out of 180 found this helpful.

The film in certain ways is a lot like Limitless, but at the same time it takes a very different overall approach and look on the subject of human evolution. I'm sure that many people will not care much for this film since it is filled with a lot of mystical/spiritual references and ideas and even some false science, however those with an open mind and an active imagination will likely be very glad they saw the film. This is clearly a work of fiction people, but there is no one saying you can't relate fiction to reality either, and actually learn something from it once in a while too. Our limitless imaginations are part of what makes human beings so extraordinary, we are best off using this gift and appreciating it. Fictional films can still be very thought provoking, and this one definitely fits that category. 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't scientifically accurate in many ways to our current knowledge, but it's still a monster landmark of a film nonetheless. Lucy is certainly not 2001, however they both ride that same imagination rules line that can spark the internal fires of unique creative thinking. In my view Lucy is a sci-fi trip worth taking. 7.5/10","45 out of 62 found this helpful.

Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is a smart , feisty college student who suddenly finds herself involved into a horrific drug and human trafficking situation . Later on , her brain is permanently altered when the fantastic drug CPH4 is released in her body . Lucy being re-animated due to the incredible synthetic drug , getting superpowers , breathtaking force , fast healing and undergoing unimaginable changes. When she gets a kick to her abdomen, the drug starts to leak into her body , and she begins using more than 10% of her brain and finds that she has less than 24-48 hours to live . With her new abilities , as soon as Lucy comes to learn that not everything he learns can be trusted , subsequently executing a merciless revenge . She's a slain woman and when his memories flood back and recalls the man that killed him , she gets away of the facility hellbent on vengeance , only to discover that there's more to the conspiracy than she originally thought . Along the way , Lucy finds the one neuro-scientist and professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who can help capture her super brain phenomenon for the world , before the nasty villain , Mr. Jang (Choi Min-sik) , kill her in the process. She has the Power ! . The average person uses 10% of their brain capacity. Imagine what she could do with 100%. Open your mind, expand your potential, evolve !.Nail-biting superheroine flick with thrills , chills , plot twists , struggles , high body-count , moving scenes , dazzling production design and latest generation special effects . Based on the character created by Luc Besson himself and heavily influenced by Superheroes Comic Books . This is a dynamic , fast- paced , entertaining and fun movie . It packs a brief message about the extreme dangers of the drugs and science, as our starring gets a tremendous strength thanks to a peculiar drug , she becomes a superhuman , a killing machine , resulting in fateful consequences . But it was really made to appeal to wide range of audiences , so the plot wasn't so complex , but Scarlett Johansson as the prominently featured super-power heroine was absolutely believable , and there was no other actress at the time who could have played the role asides from her . Nohing more fun to watch than to see her running here and there while seeks vengeance going after the man who previously killed her , or at least, who he believes killed . It also helps that it usually has a relatively good storyline to go along with it . This show has one really good thing going for it and that was a perfectly cast . Scarlett Johansson is nice , playing in her usual style as the two-fisted , serious girl brought back to life by an advanced technology that gives him the ability of super human strength , it would spin to transform into a relentless superheroine , armed with a invincible force that can stop any bullet , while regenerating his vital organs. Being well accompanied by other fine actors , such as : Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman , Choi Min-sik of Old Boy , Choi Min-sik , Amr Waked , Julian Rhind-Tutt , Pilou Asbæk , among others.It displays a stinging and rousing musical score by composer Eric Serra . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by cameraman Thierry Arbogast . The motion picture was professionally directed by Luc Besson , though it has some flaws , gaps and shortfalls . Lavishly produced by Eurocorps (Besson Production Company) and nicely made by Luc Besson with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics . Luc often casts Jean Reno (though here doesn't appear) and music always by Eric Serra . Besson is the greatest producer and director from France with hits as ¨Leon¨ , ¨Joan of Arc¨ , ¨The fifth element¨ , the ¨Taxi¨ series , ¨Big blue¨ , ¨Arthur and the Minimois¨ , ¨Nikita¨ and many others . Rating : Acceptable and passable, 6 . This is a highly amusing and frequently fun action-adventure romp with a witty script, sensational special effects and accceptable performances from main and support cast .","18 out of 25 found this helpful.

Starts off well, everything makes sense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. After a certain point in the movie everything becomes ridiculous, unrealistic and not enjoyable to watch. The idea behind the movie was good, execution was not. The characters were also a little bit boring in my opinion. The situation the main character found herself in had an array of extraordinary things to do and take advantage of but didn't. Not a lot out of the ordinary happened, main character worrying throughout and not taking advantage/playing around with the situation she was in.

This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. At the beginning, I thought that perhaps it wasn't going to be my cup of tea. However, as it progressed the storyline became more and more fascinating. In my opinion this film had the perfect balance of realism and sci-fi. Some of the effects were of course slightly questionable... but I cannot really complain because the overall brilliance of this film outshone any negatives I could detect.Scarlett Johansson was incredible as Lucy and it was astonishing to observe how her character changed so dramatically within just a few moments. Johansson definitely nailed the smart-girl/genius/superhero role, although I do think this role may have suited an actress like Rooney Mara absolutely perfectly. Johansson is just so womanly, attractive and feminine that I found it difficult to completely accept her as Lucy. Perhaps that's just me bring too picky - I just feel that Lucy could have been better portrayed by someone slightly more masculine and cold.This film is one that will genuinely inspire you to think deeply about evolution, human nature, and life. I left the cinema feeling like I had been given a new kick of energy and a punch of enthusiasm for personal growth and exploration. This film will also encourage you to consider the endless possibilities of technology and science. It will leave your heart pound if and your brain buzzing. Overall, this is a definite must-see for all action/sci-fi lovers as well as those who have an interest in humanity, history and the incredible gift that is life. You will not at all regret purchasing a ticket to see this, and as long as you keep an open mind, you will find this film to be extremely thought-provoking and clever.","243 out of 482 found this helpful.

I am a scientist and of course this movie gives me mixed feelings about its science. But I'm sure about one thing, that this is fiction. I am able to watch a fiction movie, am I not?Some people review this film negatively for its scientific value, ignoring the fact that this isn't a documentary. What are these guys comparing this film against? There is no comparison against real-world science here. If somebody makes a film about black holes, I expect it to be faithful to the latest research about black holes. If somebody makes a film about the Sun, I expect it to be faithful to what we know about the Sun. In contrast, a film about aliens can stretch our suspension of disbelief a lot more, because we know no real aliens to compare it about. And my my, how wide a range of alien species has been spawned by the film industry in all its years! The main concept in this film is equally flexible because it has been proved a myth years ago. Everybody knows that, director/writer Besson knows that. These negative reviewers miss the entertainment value of this film because of something they were expecting (harmony to actual science) that was never there since the film's inception.So yes, some other people review this film for its entertainment value, because we want to enjoy this ""What if this myth was true"" scenario. And we are truly entertained. I loved how Scarlett Johansson developed her character very well even when there was inherently not much to begin with: an innocent girl with not further background than dating some guy for a week and living in a shared apartment. Scarlett's charisma, weakness, strength, and acting spill all over the place, even during the most flat scenes of the film, even during the most VFX-packed scenes of the film. Morgan Freeman is... well, Morgan Freeman. Fantastic actor except for the fact that he's been typecast into the wise guy role for like, 20 years. I like the ethnic diversity in such a small cast. Not that they are trying to showcase it anyway, but it's a nice touch.The action pack is very good, the mafia pack is entertaining, and the renditions of Inception, Léon: The Professional, and 2001: A Space Odyssey are all cherished. Once again, the central myth is developed in a very fun way. I believe this film has risked a lot in its development, but for us who want to be entertained and have our imaginations opened, this film delivers very vividly.","581 out of 860 found this helpful.

With its combination of slick action sequences, existential philosophizing, and dazzling visuals, it challenges and entertains in equal measure, pushing the boundaries of conventional cinema.The plot follows Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), a woman accidentally caught in a dark deal who turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. Besson has crafted a fascinating narrative that juxtaposes the gritty realism of crime syndicates with the abstract realm of cerebral possibilities.Scarlett Johansson delivers a powerhouse performance, expertly navigating her character's transformation from a terrified victim to a superhuman entity. Her nuanced portrayal ensures Lucy remains empathetic even as she becomes increasingly detached from humanity.Morgan Freeman lends gravitas as Professor Norman, a neuroscientist who serves as the narrative's anchor, grounding the escalating spectacle in a semblance of reality. His measured performance provides a necessary counterpoint to Johansson's increasingly otherworldly character.Besson's direction is fluid and kinetic, imbuing the film with a frenetic energy that propels the narrative forward even as it dips into complex concepts. His choice to intercut documentary-style nature footage adds a unique flavor, creating intriguing parallels with the story unfolding on screen.The cinematography and visual effects are dazzling, creating a vivid sensory experience that takes viewers on a roller coaster ride through time, space, and the human body. The mind-bending visual journey, coupled with Eric Serra's pulsating score, creates an intoxicating atmosphere that leaves viewers both thrilled and thoughtful.However, ""Lucy"" isn't without its flaws. Its ambitious premise often teeters on the edge of becoming too esoteric, possibly alienating viewers expecting a more straightforward action thriller. Furthermore, its fast pace and lean runtime can leave certain aspects feeling underdeveloped, notably the film's antagonists.Yet, despite these shortcomings, ""Lucy"" stands out as an audacious cinematic experience that dares to merge high-octane action with cerebral science fiction. It inspires a sense of awe and curiosity about human potential, prompting introspection about our place in the universe. It is a visual feast that stirs the mind and quickens the pulse, a cinematic cocktail of action and philosophy that leaves a lingering impression.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

She's made into a drug mule, with the stuff in plastic bags within her, but it gets broken and what looks like a kilogram enters her body. The new designer drug turns out to have the effect of opening up the connections between cells, so that she gains greater use of her mind. As she heads to Europe, seeking the other mules for what they carry, while trying to fend off Choi and his gang, she seeks out exposition machine Morgan Freeman, and cop Amr Waked for physical connection.It's not the first time that science fiction has tackled new steps in evolution, from Olaf Stapledon's ODD JOHN, to A. E. Van Vogt's SLAN, to Theodore Sturgeon's MORE THAN HUMAN. Writer-director Luc Besson brings his METAL HURLANT sensibilities to the effort, and Miss Johannson gives a great performance as she goes from a hung-over airhead to an omniscient goddess in a a little black dress and Balenciagas.It's the visuals, more than the bafflegab explanations, that makes this movie so compelling, with its weird CGI, time-traveling backwards from modern New York to T. Rex time, and big, black, self-building computers against a white background while Freeman and associates stand around slack-jawed, and Freeman explains exactly what's going on. It's all nonsense, but seeing is believing, and we see everything, inside, outside, and from today back to the fiery beginnings of the Earth.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

In fact, I find promoting blatant falsehoods that promote anti-evolutionary thinking a bit irresponsible, even for the sake of art and entertainment!Science education set aside, how does LUCY work as a movie? Well, Scarlett Johansson is convincingly awkward and beautiful. Luc Besson's obsession with strong mysterious female leads clearly shines through and Johansson as an actor delivers. The movie is hyper-stylish, with gleaming colors and convincing CGI (lots of). The action is as entertaining as the visuals. And thankfully they decided to keep things short, focus on the core idea and stop right before it became trite.That said, I think LIMITLESS dealt with the 10% myth better as it stayed (somewhat) more within the realm of scientific credibility. And as far as movies go in which people develop godlike powers, LUCY doesn't beat the likes of THE MATRIX or SYMBOL (shimboru,2009).All in all an interesting but ultimately mediocre movie based on an utterly ridiculous (and intellectually dangerous) idea.","82 out of 156 found this helpful.

After this paragraph we'll probably be moving into (mild) spoiler territory, so if you've not watched it yet, or just don't give a flying uh.... seagull? (good job on your censorship IMDb, words are just words and they have their place); stop reading.The whole 10% premise is false, I'll give it that along with the 'fact' that you somehow develop supernatural powers at higher than 10%; it's almost like someone saw the matrix, a supernatural film, an action film and thought ""why not compress all of this into one film"" as I've said in the title, if you're prepared to suspend disbelief, it works. If you want pure scifi with no (major) suspension of disbelief; it's best to look elsewhere. Though as I've said, the movie has all the things I like. Unwitting protagonist, pressure of time put on said protagonist, some scifi in between and the mind control powers of Morgan Freeman's voice (seriously, they should get some real scientists on that; it would accelerate brainwashing research tenfold).From reading other reviews this film seems to be movie Marmite; you'll either love it or hate it.","90 out of 165 found this helpful.

Watching a family member rehabilitate from a head injury due to a hit and run car accident, I witnessed each level of healing process. At each phase there was a different action from extreme agitation and constant movement to periods of calm. The doctors explained it was the mind repairing itself.

Moreover the movie lacks on the details but just gives you a basic idea. Some scenes will really question your mind and provoke you to think over it. On the scale of acting both lead actors were good and had produced their best. And some actors are in futile role with no sense.Though the film has used some fake data and hypothesis to impress upon the audience, you will be entertained and learned.

They always divide film fans right from the off. It's a film that to all intents and purposes needs to be viewed just as a cinematic experience, as a piece of popcorn fodder that may try to be something more cerebral, but ultimately is a daft - but hugely fun - piece of film.Luc Besson writes and directs a film that sees Scarlett Johansson duped into being a drug mule, with the transportation of drugs sewn into her abdomen. It's a new drug, boy is it a new drug, and when things go belly up and the drugs are unleashed into Scarlett's system, she's a threat - or hope - to mankind.It can be, and has been, called pretentious et al, such is the science factor, which is perfectly understandable, so any hope of tight science fiction musings will only end up in a crushing disappointment. Undeniably Besson and his backers thought they had something to say, to open up the film watchers' minds to something deep and probable, to be relevant and viable. But unlike the makers we the viewers didn't have access to donepezil, so we sadly couldn't all turn into Bradley Cooper and be limitless in our viewing capabilities.Personally, it's a rollicking fun film for two thirds, when it's about Scarlett kicking butt, a revenge driven babe, it grips and shakes all the genre compliant cinematic senses. The ending, the grand finale, infuriated me, and by the looks of Morgan Freeman (coasting for easy money), he was also a little frustrated. But I had fun, yet on the flip side if anyone fronted me up and said they hated the film with a passion? Then I would understand and take them home to play with my chemistry set. 7/10","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

It stars Scarlett Johansen and that is of course all I needed to wanna watch this movie. Lucy is about this women who is kidnapped by this group of thugs and then gets a powerful drug put inside her that unlocks the full 100% of her brain and now she's super smart and seems to have the powers of Jedi. This movie is just really weird and not quite what I was expecting. This is of course an action film. It's got all clichés that were use to. Then becomes a super hero movie and then a beautiful visual ride. It's really confusing a bit at times and it gets worse in the end. The issue I have with Lucy is that she's the only super powered person in this film and there's no one in this that ever becomes powerful enough to give a really cool final final fight in the end, but a weird and visual like dream of a world kinda ending. It's not great and I highly doubt someone would become super hero or a jedi if we used 100% percent of our brain.

The story line is artificially cooked up to suit the action, effects are so-so (for this day and age) . Its more of a mindless action movie. The brawn and violence is made to shock, rather than entertain. But after a few scenes it gets quickly repetitive and boring. They tried to interject some scientific narrative in between with an academic backdrop as if that will lend it some credence, but it falls awfully short. Some of the effects are so wild and unexplained they might belong in a Hulk movie. Johannsen's performance is mediocre, she could easily have been replaced by any average actress. She has one part where she talks to her mom and some emoting is needed, but like the rest of the movie it just comes across as plainly artificial. I could hear some of the audience going 'oh please!'.","159 out of 353 found this helpful.

However, I got an extremely interesting, unusual and highly entertaining story, that I found quite fascinating. Of course, it's completely unrealistically, but the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies which manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring patterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does that. Its just, well, cool. I absolutely enjoyed the Science Fiction aspects and seeing Lucy developing her powers was just pure gold.

That we only use 10% of our brain capacity is a myth, the science world has corrected this, and the movie jumps around the facts and talking points, but still this movie is good for raising so many questions, and to help one think outside of the only physical world we see with our eyes --and keep us thinking ---so it's amazing to explore that at least, through this movie.

In addition, if you're not able to take a few action sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off. Lucy (2014) is written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla. Just like The Fifth Element this movie is very similar to that movie, just it has a different story and different cast of actors in it. At least unlike Taken 3 This film is well shot and bloody. I adore Scarlett and she is an absolute delight to see in this. I just finished watching Lucy today and I like it. It was really good descent sci-fi action flick. In the beginning when Lucy talks to his friend Richard I thought the movie would be boring but it wasn't it was a hell off a ride. It went pretty fast and end well. I watched Scarlet Johansson in Captain America The Winter Soldier which in my opinion is the best action super hero movie for me. And in Lucy Scarlett Johansson did not disappoint me. Also Morgan Freeman was also really good. I enjoyed it ,it was fun and It is pure fantasy. Scarlett Johansson & Morgan Freeman carry this film, no doubt about it. But there is a story here ,what if we used 100% of our brain?? What would that be like , what would we be like?? Well for one thing ,things wouldn't be important, wars wouldn't be fought, racism would not be anything or wouldn't have started in the first place . You could think what you want on all of this, at least the film makes you wonder and that I find is fun. Lucy was like Inception and limitless combined with its intriguing premise and a film where u have to think more than a lot of other mindless films. every movie needs some sex appeal to make it realistic, film is the art of re enacting life....to some degree....I thought she was kick ass until her body dissolved. fortunately that was at the end of the movie. the small amount of sex appeal that she is given with this role is forgivable because her mind is transforming and everything is new, but I felt betrayed when she lost her ability to be relatable. I watch this movie twice it was fast paced and Entertaining action sci-fi flick! I really like Scarlett Johansson I was disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron especially on Scarlett's acting skills and her behavior during that awful movie. I think in 2014 were still some good movies that I like: I love Captain America: The Winter Soldier which Scarlett Johansson surprised the hell out of me on her performance as Black Widow including Chris Even as Steve Rogers and everyone should know that I love this movie to death. I like Lucy and I think of Luc Besson there are three movies that I like: Léon: The Professional (1994), The Fifth Element (1997) which everyone know I am crazy about that Sci-Fi action movie and this one Lucy (2014). I know the director made a lot of movies including La Femme Nikita (1990) but for some reason I never liked that movie, I don't know why, I just didn't. Or the series which Peta Wilson started it and later in new the series Maggie Q as Nikita. I just don't like those types of bloody movie and series. Those three movies I just counted are really good movies and I love them so much.Lucy is one of those high-octane films from writer/director Luc Besson that gives the audience a fun entertaining action extravaganza set piece but with a plot that is so far out there that its not so fun and entertaining to relate to, unless of course you happen to be tripping' along with the films characters. Scarlet Johannson, no stranger to the action genre brings her A game and Morgan Freeman's authority shines through but Lucy is as wacky as they come. Human mules may be a dose in reality but one where the in-jested drug makes you become one with just about everything is a little bit bizarre. Either way this one will either thrill you or beg you for a much better 90 minute high. The only thing that confused me so much of this movie is the ending which I don't get what happened with Lucy on the end of the movie. The end ended with a cliffhanger by the end if you ask me. I like that Luc Beeson tried to do something different than a straight revenge action movie - It was interesting and it kept my attention - I really liked the scene in the hospital when she was talking to her mother:)!!!! It was fairly decent overall. Wish it were a bit longer though because it seemed quite short. I am giving this movie a 10 because of Luc Besson, Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman as a science professor he did an outstanding perfect acting performance, he is awesome as always!!!

Maybe the German dubbing was extraordinarily well done? Like, better than the original? I don't know. It's not even that I'm a Luc-Besson-Fanboy or something - I found ""The Fifth Element"" pretty annoying, although Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors. So why did I like ""Lucy"" so much? First off, the movie starts and is right away enthralling. Scarlett Johansson plays a rather shy girl on vacation or whatever in Taiwan, who is forced by her acquaintance-of-last-night to transfer a mysterious briefcase to a scary gangster boss, incarnated terrifyingly convincing by Min-sik Choi. It turns out the briefcase is full of drugs, a bag of these drugs is planted into her stomach, leaks, the overdose gives her full-access to her brain capacity, REVENGE! All in the first 30 minutes, as I remember. What sounds like an ""ordinary"" action movie story line is fed with (I admit, pseudo-)scientifical information by Morgan Freeman and behavior-study like scenes of animals interacting, and after a short while, it's anything but an ordinary action movie. The more Lucy can control her brain, the more transcendental her abilities become, the more she is in control of her environment, mentally and physically. In ""Lucy"", Director Besson deals with the most urgent questions of humanity, with the existence of something transcendental, 'where do we come from?', 'what defines our lifes?', 'where do we go'? After this altogether, I left the cinema stunned and contemplative. Yes, the movie might have some goofs and flaws, but in the end, the message is unbeatable.","26 out of 62 found this helpful.

When the reviews came in, I sort of lowered my expectations. Nothing could prepare me for how bad this truly was. From the beginning, it seems like the director is intent on overwhelming us with transitions and cuts from the present to all of these ""evolution"" shots that, instead of feeling creative or intellectual, just feel incredibly stupid. And I'm not one to throw the word ""stupid"" around, but... I don't know how else to describe how obnoxious and annoying I found the film from the get go. I don't care how scientifically accurate this is, no. I just care that the dialogue and directing really range from mediocre to atrocious. There are a few decent scenes, but few and far in between. The car chase is an example, like if it was a scene taken from another actually-decent action flick. I will say that the second half is at least a bit better than the first.Scarlett Johansson has been on a roll lately, and I'm a fan of her. But the reason it took me so long to warm up to her is because while I generally like her very much in her more subdued, quiet or more natural roles (Lost in Translation, Under the Skin) she has the tendency to just not be as convincing in more melodramatic, showier roles. Oh yes, she's pretty bad once her character here gets her powers, totally unconvincing at playing the emotionless aspect. She's supposed to play Lucy as if she has no emotions, but instead it comes across as her trying desperately to convince us that she has no emotions. But before Lucy gets her powers, she's also pretty bad, totally unconvincing and probably more laughably bad when she's trying to play a woman with fear for her life. What a misfire of a performance, although the girl tries hard enough and isn't nearly as obnoxious and as downright ugly as the film around her.","63 out of 131 found this helpful.

I reckon it's natural that this is by the creator of Leon - don't actually expect another Leon though, this is Luc Besson doing something different. Neither should you expect deep character development or carefully pondering concepts in this express train of a movie.In summary, the action is good and unrelenting, the sci is perhaps more fantasy than science, but still entertaining if you let it be, and the fi ranges from gritty to moments of almost Olaf Stapledon wondrous.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Who wouldn't want to watch this film? But as usual, nothing is what it seems, and the question is: is that a bad thing or a good thing? It depends, whether you expect just another sci-fi action packed movie or, knowing old Besson, something else. In the same fashion that ""The Fifth Element"" (1997), ""Lucy"" is not so genre-tight, but it tends to expand, an inside out explosion. Some might like it or not, but the truth is that Luc Besson is a great filmmaker, and it seems he can make a very good movie anytime he wants to. Lucy (Johansson) is a tourist that finds herself in the middle of a drug dealing business and ends up being a mule. To make things even worse, the package she carries bursts inside her, and the consequences are as unexpected as they are cool. In just one day her brain capacity will reach its full potential, unfolding every secret the brain still hides from mankind. Scarlett Johansson (oh Scarlett...) is Lucy, and she turns from bimbo to super-heroine in half an hour, something Scarlett does easily, as well as showing us how with higher brain capacity comes some ""changes"". It is in those moments that she makes her best, though I am not objective here. What she did in ""Her"" (Spike Jonze, 2013) was outstanding, and I am a crazy fan, I must confess. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman are just spectators, and we all just sit and enjoy the Scarlett show. ""Lucy"" is sci-fi, yet it states that we only have access to 10% of our brain capacity, which has been debunked by several scientific studies. That would be unacceptable in most cases, but in this case it is not a big deal, since this film is not hard sci-fi; it is not a superpowers film nor a brain research film, but rather a film about our very existence and evolution. Quoting Pearl Jam: ""I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher (...) It's evolution, baby"" (""Do the Evolution"" from the album ""Yield"", 1998, epic records).","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Fair enough, this film starts from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from magic. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

There are sparks of Luc Besson's talent, but unfortunately on the widescpe they are overshadowed by the lazy development of the story.The film anyways has lots going for it. It succeeds in delivering some of this potential, but fails in delivering the major part of it. Undoubtely the part where it succeeds the most is the first act. It never gave out too much information, but by giving away just the essential it managed to produce a very intense interest in how the story would go. It was also filled with very stylish and kind of strange sequences mixed to it, that I didn't quite understand, yet didn't really mind. Scarlett Johansson is another highlight, she really carried everything along and I didn't realize until later in the movie how much merit she deserved for not making this movie a bore. Her mix of charisma and good skills was key in bringing some spice to an otherwise flat and flawed story. Still on positives, there is a sequence near the end of the movie that was pure brilliance, the CGI involved was flawless and it took me on a short psychedelic journey that I absolutely enjoyed to the bone.Unfortunately that sequence alone is the only spark of visual brilliance that is present in the movie. For the rest there is nothing wrong with the cinematography, but it looks just so average, there isn't one single interesting shot, it all looks as if it was shot by a computer. again nothing wrong because it certainly didn't get me to annoyance, but I was constantly bothered by this flat look. Anyways the biggest flaw this movie has is in storytelling. Firstly, because as much as I found interesting the first act the second and the third just fell into generic action movie territory. Secondly because the logics of the movie are totally bonkers and make no sense what so ever. They manage to produce good filmaking occasions, but their roots are totally out of place.Lucy fails in being what it wants to be, but it succeeds in giving the viewer 90 minutes at the theater that won't bore him and will flow pretty smoothly.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Yes, there are logic gaps, a cliché use of Morgan Freeman and perhaps an over-simplification of the idea, but 'Lucy' drives home with visual invention, a notable, pumping score by Eric Serra and sharp, fast paced editing; the effect frequently being that we feel, like our typically tough female lead, as though we are on some mad drug ourselves. Drawing on some of his own best previous work, Besson puts together a film with a feeling, at times, not unlike a solid Manga adaption, ala 'The Edge Of Tomorrow'. Also, a fun little aside that is most welcome, now I think about it, is a not-so-subtle tip of the hat to Korean classic 'Oldboy', with Min-sik Choi himself playing the villain Mr Jang with relish! It is easy to ignore the obvious liberties taken with the science, because the film is quite clearly not trying to be seen as accurate; you can also overlook the lack of character development, or indeed any real narrative meat, because once again, Besson knows exactly what he is looking to make here. Much like its own thesis on how human beings interpret the universe, 'Lucy' is a big idea scaled down. It is not as original or fresh as one might have hoped, and it does have its stumbles, but once you're over the hurdles, it proves to be a more-exciting-than-expected, well-built, high-octane thrill ride, which is most worthy of ninety minutes of your time.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

However, when she accidentally absorbs a massive amount of the drug, she is given the ability to use more than 10% or her brain. A struggle for answers and her own humanity ensues as she begins to use more and more of her brain. It's a little like Trancendence and Limitless.-The film as a whole was very interesting. I did not find much I didn't like about it, but at the same time there was nothing I really loved in it.-The plot/story/concept was easily the most interesting part as she discovers more and more and makes the audience think more and more about life and everything. There are even some very thought provoking creation vs evolution sub-stories that left me very surprised, I think.-The cast did well. Nobody was really great but nobody was bad. Morgan Freeman has also totally mastered the 'shocked beyond belief' face.-The music was odd, but good.-The effects were very good.-The content was not too bad. The film is actually rated-R, but could have been PG-13. Some language and violence, but that's about it.-The thing that is really most intriguing for me is how the film progresses as the can use more and more of her brain. There are a few things they kept around for the sake of the film which felt add-on, like a cop helping her out. Even he admits he is useless, but she tells him that he is to remind her of what it is like to be human. As the film goes on it becomes very difficult to relate to Lucy as a character, which makes sense, but is also a drawback. However, it will make you think. A lot. Like way too much. Yeah it is ""mind-blowing"" to the almost literal sense. Like the universe and stuff. Okay I'm done thinking about it.-So if you are looking for an average action flick without any depth and too much thinking attached, you might find Lucky a bit disappointing. But if you are looking for a movie what contemplates life and the universe and God and brain power and a bunch of other things that will go totally over everyone's head because they are incomprehensible, it is pretty good. So I would give Lucy a high 7 and say that Lucy is probably worth seeing in theaters, if you want to think that much.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

To maintain real interest, we really need some conflict. I don't mean a bunch of Korean guys chasing after you. It has to be a problem the protagonist has to solve or at least deal with. Lucy unfortunately helps a friend and ends up in really deep stuff. She is used as a drug mule for a crazy drug that can up human intelligence. She was never intended to use but a guy assault her and breaks the bag inside her. She immediately begins to divide cells and transform into a new creature. The second criticism is a lack of explanation as to why she loses all compassion and empathy. She does have the revenge thing going but she is almost zombie like in her interactions with others. Is the point that we are just animals with reproductive and survival instincts? Other than teaching his classes and giving us a reference point, Morgan Freeman is of no use. He just stands around saying he doesn't know anything. Lucy eventually takes us on a ride through time but why. Is she just absorbing information. If so, what is she going to do with it. The long and short is that it is disjointed and relatively pointless.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

ScarJo's powers are also poorly defined, basically she becomes a god and can make up new powers as she goes along. This doesn't make a lick of sense even if I am willing to go along with the ridiculous 10% theory. There are still the laws of physics that humans must adhere to!The movie suffers also from unsatisfying action sequences and a large number of ""what did I just watch?"" moments.

LUCY, is excellent, credible beyond the usual mush and the action and actors are great. If you like a good story that will touch your heart, make you cheer and hope, take you to possible scenarios and just enough chaos to make it interesting, good actors and a great story, then you most like will like LUCY.

Still trying to process what's actually going on, she wakes to discover the smugglers have sewn a packet of a new drug into her stomach. Before she can deliver the drugs, however, the packet busts open, releasing the powerful drug into her system. The drug's effect is an ever increasing utilization of her brain. Soon, Lucy is capable of manipulating matter and energy with her mind. She contacts a renowned scientist for assistance. She realizes that the drug will kill her within 24 hours and she wants to pass on the knowledge she's gained. But the smugglers are intent on getting their drugs back. They follow Lucy half way round the world for a final showdown.Overall, Lucy is a fantastically entertaining film. The action is nice with plenty of fights, gun battles, and car chases. The direction from Luc Besson couldn't be much better. He keeps things moving at a very lively pace. The acting is also superb. Scarlett Johansson proves once again that a woman can be successful as the lead in an action oriented film. And Johansson does an excellent job portraying the changes to Lucy as the drug changes her brain. Nicely done. The supporting cast is also solid. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Amr Waked as the bewildered French policeman who helps Lucy in her journey. Another highlight for me has to be the special effects. Just amazing. Finally, even though things do get a bit messy and even rushed toward the end (this is my biggest complaint), I still had fun with it. The time travel bits were especially moving.I really like and appreciate the message I got out of Lucy. Being a father of two boys and getting older each day, I too sometimes feel that the only real commodity of any value that I have is time. Time to spend with my wife and kids, time to do things I enjoy, time to live my life - that's what's important. It's not material objects or anything else. It's the limited time we each have on this Earth.Finally, if you read comments on Lucy, you'll sooner rather than later run into criticism of the scientific errors made by the film. People love to point them out. I honestly didn't have any problem with the film's scientific realism. It's a movie - I wasn't expecting a science lesson. I accepted the scientific mumbo-jumbo just as I would in any sci-fi film. In the reality in which the films is set, it all makes sense. In our reality, it doesn't. I went with it and didn't let it affect my overall entertainment.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Said if you ignore all the Morgan Freeman parts you're left with a great movie.You are not. You're not even left with an okay movie.The dialogue was painful. The BS they had Mr. Freeman spouting was excruciating, but I came prepared for that. It was discovering that the rest of the dialogue wasn't much better.Some other reviews talked about it being worth it to watch Scarlett Johansson kick ass, but the actual physical kicking parts were very short lived. I can think of few things more dull than an all powerful protagonist.I understand why the director opted for a tactic of escalating blandness for the Lucy character. It makes sense for what they were going for, but that leaves us with a woefully uninteresting protagonist.There was a fair bit of splicing nature scenes with the main stary. The type of thing you'd see in a rom/com like Bridget Jones Diary, or some hip TV show about 30-somethings dating in the big city. I'm not sure what the film makers were going for.I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this movie.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

The movie feels like it's split in two with the first half starting out fairly plausible and by the end of the movie grows into heavy CGI and sci-fi.Luc Besson is famous for Taken, Leon, The Fifth Element and The Transporter. He is a very good writer. This film leans more towards The Fifth Element in its levels of sci-fi and plausibility but I personally believe Leon and Taken are his masterpieces.The acting in the movie is good for an action movie, never likely to receive Oscar nods. I thought Min-Sik Choi was very good as the dictator boss and Morgan Freeman was his usual composed and impressive self as The Professor. Scarlet Johansson had some memorable scenes in the movie and she pulled off the change in her character superbly.The way the film shows the origins of humanity and the development of time, particularly in the end sequence is very impressive and well done.I was a little disappointed with the Soundtrack. I thought this movie could have done with something similar to the Drive Soundtrack or Tron...or even Terminator. Such distinguishable OST's from the action/sci-fi genre. But other than a few main scenes in the movie it lacked memorable backing.This movie is very similar to The Terminator and has elements of The Matrix. In fact, during many scenes in the movie I thought that Scarlet Johansson reminded me of and would have made a great Sarah Connor when it was remade.Overall, I would recommend this movie. It's an entertaining watch from a very creative writer and the plot is very interesting. 7/10","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

They play the role of Lucy and the french professor Norman.It is about a 25 years old girl, called Lucy, who gets caught by the Korean mafia for smuggling experimental drugs into Europe. By accident, she'll take the drug. The plot is based on the effects of this drug on Lucy and, on the other hand, on the thesis of the professor Norman who says that the human only uses 10% of its mental capacities. They'll both make discoveries about humans because the experimental drug increases the mental capacities of Lucy and she'll be able to use 100% of her capacities.I didn't intend to see this film at all but as everyone spoke about it, I decided to watch it. And, actually I did well.I absolutely loved this film despite the fact that there are to many special effects at the end, in my opinion. Even if it's quite unrealistic, the story is shown in a such original and attractive way that we can't not be interested in it.The storyline is very gripping. The way the drug increases the capacities of Lucy is amazing. I especially enjoyed the comparison between the thesis of the professor and the reality of Lucy.As far I'm concerned, I'm totally keen on the main actors ; Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. I've never been disappointed by their acting and I found them once more amazing in this film. I would strongly recommend the film to anyone who loves action films and who wants to experience something new because the way the film-makers have done it is incredibly original.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Lucy, the protagonist, is very much a cross between Nikita and Leeloo the Fifth Element, with a touch of the anime 'Akira' and Chayefsky's 'Altered States' thrown into the mix. There were some great moments in this movie, but, on the whole, I have to say it wasn't as dark and intense as 'La Femme Nikita', or as entertaining as 'The Fifth Element'.Don't get me wrong: Johansson gives an excellent performance, as an initially carefree student who through a very nasty set of circumstances is trapped into serving a drug kingpin as a mule, carrying a surgically implanted packet of a new drug with some ... shall we say ... remarkable properties.When she resists a rape attempt by one of his goons, this suicidally stupid henchman kicks her in the stomach several times, rupturing the packet. Since unless they just hired him that day, you'd think this flunky should have some inkling of what his sadistic, cold-blooded killer of a boss would do to him if he found out -- and he pulled this stunt in front of another henchman -- all I can say is, the guy must have had a major death wish. Or very poor impulse control. Or the IQ of something from the back of the refrigerator. Or all of the above.Anyway, through the miracle of scientific-sounding mumbo-jumbo (as tediously expounded by Morgan Freeman -- what a terrible waste of a fine actor!) we find out that the drug which has leaked into Lucy's bloodstream is expanding her consciousness and giving her superhuman abilities. This leads to lots of special effects and general mayhem, as well as the obligatory car chase.I don't mean to sound dismissive of this movie: far from it. Generally, anything Besson directs is well worth a look. There are some marvelously trippy sequences showing the effects of the drug on her perceptions, and some humorous moments, like when her body tries to rebel while she's on an airliner. Johansson deftly manages her mental transformation into something both more and less than human, making her performance chilling and touching, sometimes both at once.A slight correction to the IMDb blurb: it's true that at first, the drug turns Lucy into a ruthless killer. But as her consciousness progresses to a higher level, she stops killing, even though it would have been easy for her to squash people like bugs.Not Besson's best, but still a nice alternative to your usual mindless summer blockbuster. Worth seeing.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Usually they are people joking about how bad a movie is. I am not joking. And I am also astonished that I am the only written review so far.This movies is one of the worst scripts i have ever had to endure. And believe me, ""endure"" is the correct word. It is a test for withstanding abuse. Scarlett's character makes no sense. OK, she unlocks hidden potential? I don't mind that. its very reminiscent (and eventually blatantly rips off) a favorite movie of mine called Akira. She gains power and becomes the ultimate. But no, alas, there is no development. She gets a dose of pre-natal blue rock candy and instantly changes in personality.This would have been wonderful: She suddenly has powers, but is unable or afraid to use them because she is still a meek person. As she becomes more powerful, she becomes less human. It's a no brainer of story, but nope! None of this ""development"" crap!Other than that, the script is 70% unintelligible techno-babble that doesn't even try to come across as intelligent. The remaining 30%? Over-done, seen it 100 times before attempts and bad-assery. The villains lack any motivation for their actions after the first 10 minutes.The acting is, after the first 15 minutes, equally appalling. I usually like Scarlett Johansen. She is a wooden board here. Not that she as anything to work with. I LOVE Morgan Freeman and he spends so much time phoning this in that I actually want to see his AT&T bill for the months he was on set. Must be astronomical.This is a movie that is about accessing other unknown portions of your brain, but this movie was actively trying to shut my brain down. Also, I now have eye strain because i could not stop rolling my eyes. I wanted to rush the ticket holder and demand my money back, but my mind had degraded so much i couldn't process speech to ask for my money back. This review may have some humor, yes, but still, my point remains: This is an absolutely terrible movie and the only good thing is that it came out in a very busy summer, because if this had a blockbuster amount of attention, I would be worried for Scarlett Johansens acting career. Please run screaming from this movie.","30 out of 73 found this helpful.

Today I'm tackling Luc Besson's 2014 opus LUCY, and I am going to kick off by saying that it is spectacular, do see it, you are in for a treat if you do, but as this one is a new movie, I am also really going to blast it plot-wise. Scarlett Johansson is to me what it is all about, so, as far as I'm concerned, the first half of the movie was the riveting part. You could have kept all the special effects for my sake. The poor little bunny in such terrible distress, Please Mr. Jang, if you can't get rid of the chain, you don't have to chop off my hand... To me, a normal ol' suspense drama would have been much preferred. This bit about unlocking brain potential with the help of a leaking bag of CPH4 sowed in your stomach is just too much, way too much, the much simpler crime thriller that was thrown away in favor of this banal monstrosity really is a sad loss. Anyway, keep Scarlett wrapped in cotton wool, she is a national treasure, still every bit as hot as in THE ISLAND, years and years later, Hollywood living must really agree with her! She has a most beautiful huggable-bunny face reflecting childlike innocence. Memo to self: Unlock 100% brain power. Open up world of endless possibilities. Enter movie, right there at that bit where she begs him to not chop off her little hand. Kick Mr. Jang's awful old ass... :) I'm not kidding.Special effects and lofty theme make this one for many a Ten, but do note that Scarlett is an Eleven.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie explores consciousness / the power when one uses the mind as a focused tool. It explores what people have inquired about for decades, and it does so in a fun way - with constantly growing special abilities now wielded by Scarlett's character, Lucy. Plenty of action, but also lots of stuff to ponder. I like a mix of both of these - perhaps that's why I'd give it a solid 7.5 out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even before I watched the movie, I knew it was going to be a horrible movie, but I decided I'd do it because some of you guys would probably be interested in a review, so here it is. The fundamental idea at its most basic level can bring forth a very interesting concept, such as what the movie Limitless did. What I saw in this movie was an infinitely worse version of Limitless. Luc Besson, the writer and director, took this very simple concept, and not only did he try, unsuccessfully to overcomplicate it to sound smart, but he tried to use a trick on the audience, by introducing a few sciency sounding terms and keeping the viewers interested by their, ironically, lack of knowledge. The path he chose the movie to take, from the fundamental concept, made the whole idea absolutely, and hilariously, absurd. Firstly, the ""fact"" that humans only use 10% of their brain's capacity is a myth. We use 100% of our brain's capacity, just at different times, for different actions. Secondly, the idea that humans, or anything, for that matter, are able to control things that are physically unreachable on a subatomic level, such as time, is just stupid. And for any questions regarding time travel: time travel doesn't work with simply ""moving"" time. You bend spacetime to reach a different destination. You're bending particles with energy; not magically leaping through time. This movie completely disregarded any and every basic law of physics. Moving on to the acting, it was the best acting I've ever seen in my life not really. The acting was actually very bad. I didn't expect much from Scarlett Johansson, and I got even less from her. Since she was basically the only important of the movie, I'd say the general acting was bad as well, seeing as no one else had any significant roles, except for Morgan Freeman, whom didn't have many lines either. The metaphors were completely unsubtle, and pretty much threw themselves at the audience's faces and screamed ""WE'RE METAPHORS."" Also, I'd like to point out that it's literally impossible to portray a character infinitely more knowledgeable in a movie, seeing as the ""research"" put into said movie would come from other sources. So, unless the writer would be the Nikola Tesla of our time, it'd just be a poor attempt, and excuse, for a movie introducing a ""new concept"" which is revolutionary. It's predictable down to the last detail. I'm not even kidding. It's an extremely predictable movie. The director/writer is, from what I gather, not a very intelligent man, and movies like these should be left to people who: a) are intelligent, and b) actually know what they're doing. This movie was just a mockery of human intelligence and understanding as a whole, not to mention and indirect mockery of anyone who thinks it's good.","20 out of 47 found this helpful.

Well, as it turns out, I was wrong. Apparently ""superpowers"" don't always equal superheroes in cinema. That's actually very good. I'm glad that this didn't turn out to be some mindless superhero action movie with ray guns and all that stuff, even if this isn't on the same level with the actually deep, astonishing science fiction movies.Cinematography was astonishing. The effects were good, and most of the scenes were very clear, and it was easy to keep track on what was going on and were.Lucy is slightly interesting as a character, but only because of this mystery around her. We don't know who she is, we know only small things that are kind of useless little facts. But all that interest I had in her vanished after she started to change into this typical godlike character who is in some way superior to others, and just knows everything, knows how to do everything, and then just sits there and explains things we don't know about our word so expressionlessly it's almost painful.But to be honest this movie was disturbingly, well, racist. Mostly because of in the beginning this was a lot of ""White woman killing scary Asian men"". Come one, she shot one just because he didn't speak English, that is disturbing considering were she was. If you don't think about the racist parts for a while - and I know a lot of people won't - this movie is pretty good. However, I think it might lose its magic after the first time, and you probably can't watch this every weekend. But still, it's visually stunning, interesting and worth seeing.","14 out of 20 found this helpful.

Although I expected the movie to be much better before watching it, as can be seen from its score here, it is just a movie that is just a little above average. After watching it, I can remain of the same opinion. Even though they chose the concept well, I think the mistakes the movie contains and its last half hour definitely drag it down a lot.In the movie Lucy, the idea of ""not using the full capacity of our brain"", which most of us have probably heard somewhere, is discussed. In this film, a scientist who develops a hypothesis on whether this full capacity is used or not, and a woman who has a high dose of synthetic drug mixed into her blood and therefore can use her entire brain, come together. However, the skills this person can achieve when his entire brain is used seem very interesting indeed. Of course, the fact that a person is very smart brings to our mind the firstly artificial intelligence. These machines, which can perform very large operations in seconds, can run through their algorithms in a very short time the things that people often work on for hours and produce results. Naturally, when we say ""very smart person"", the first thing that comes to our mind is artificial intelligence as an imitation. However, with the popular artificial intelligences we had the opportunity to talk with recently (GPT), we have seen that artificial intelligences cannot avoid very simple mistakes and cannot be fully human. So here we have a person who can hypothetically use his entire brain. Although we think of a person who can use his entire brain as a very high-level calculator in today's scientific paradigm, the screenwriter's perspective on this matter is different.In the paradigm of today's science, humans are represented as high-level complex machines. In psychology, elements such as memory and mind are modeled through computers. People do not build computers by looking at humans, but they take computers as an example and explain their own brains. The reason for this is that the West, which is the ruler of science, defines the person who meets its own living standards as ""normal"" while determining the ""normal"" of a person, and defines the other as ""abnormal and non-functional"". In other words, in the paradigm in which the West has a strong say, man is a machine from the perspective of science. We, in general, agree with these ideas because we were educated entirely within the Western paradigm, especially in science. While looking at the reviews about the movie, people complained about the movie not being scientifically real, but the movie doesn't make such a scientifical claim anyway. However, we can see in these people how today's scientific approach crushes even our dreams and theories under the name of ""science"". They are so attached to the paradigm that a new idea has no effect on them and they reject it outright. However, science itself is not done this way. Science can thrive almost entirely through dreams and ideas. It is clear that if such people had lived before, they would have been firmly committed to Newtonian physics and would never have agreed with Einstein. I was saddened to see these friends who were more interested in information technology than science.The themes of ""nirvana, ascension"", which are mostly from the east, are discussed in the movie. The power that comes from knowledge and the full use of the brain can give a person powers that we currently describe as ""superhuman"". These powers include not only being very intelligent, but also being able to control the physical world. From here, the unity of man with nature and different religious and spiritual views are included in the film, but since I do not have much knowledge, I cannot write about it in detail. In my opinion, there is no point where the film contradicts the general theme. If there is, it is because today's people cannot see the situation they are in and are unaware of this situation, limiting even their imagination in line with what this world has taught them.So, if you ask what the problem of the movie is, it is that the character, who uses his brain enough to integrate with this world, makes some strange mistakes in the movie. I think that a character created like this should definitely not have made these mistakes, which I think were made to lengthen the movie and make the ending exciting, but at one point they might have made them to emphasize that this character is aware of everything and that he created the difficulty herself, etc. It is really difficult to make a clear inference, but of course the police officers watching a lot of people with guns entering the university cannot be explained. Although the general theme of the movie is interesting, they failed to keep this theme warm and wrote it as if it went completely wrong after a while. Maybe there's something I missed.I liked the visual and sound techniques, but they are not great either. Those black parts at the end were very fake and very visible. In general, it would be fair to say that I did not see any additional shooting techniques, but since I still do not consider myself competent in this regard, I would like to quickly finish my cinematographic review and move on to the music. To be honest, there was nothing that interested me much in the music, except for one or two songs. There is one piece that is quite nice, but the rest seemed like filler pieces to me.It would be a lie if I said I remember anything extra good or bad about the acting. Personally, the acting of the Asian friends looked a little bad, but it wasn't that bad. I think they used Morgan Freeman purely for his voice, I don't understand why they chose the actors anymore. I think that our sister in the leading role was chosen to resemble the people in these first human events, but she is not such a divine human type. How's her acting? I don't know much, honestly it seems average. There is no scene that impressed me.In other words, it is a movie that starts well, goes well, but then becomes a bad movie with a lot of mistakes. I would say the concept is good, but I can't because they say it's too similar to the movie Limitless. Oh, it's definitely worth watching. An hour and a half won't steal anything from your life anyway. Maybe it will help you open your mind and get rid of this ""science"" paradigm that the West has established on you. As I always say: ""Boo different opinions boo"".","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It stars Scarlett Johansson as an American woman, living in Taiwan, who's forced into transferring a powerful drug, hidden in her abdomen. When the drug starts leaking it allows the woman to use her brain's full functioning capacity, which in turn gives her super powers. The film costars Morgan Freeman, Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked. The film deals with some interesting theories but it's much more fantastical than intelligent science fiction. Still it's action-packed and pretty entertaining.Johansson plays Lucy, a young American woman who's living in Taipei, Taiwan. She just began dating a drug mule there, named Richard (Pilou Asbaek). After Richard makes Lucy do his job for him, and he's killed, the Korean gangster he was working for, Mr. Jang (Min-sik), forces Lucy to take his place. A powerful synthetic drug, called CPH4, is sewn into her stomach and she, and three others, are forced into transferring the drugs into Europe. After being beaten, by one of Jang's men, the drug begins to leak inside her. This makes her increasingly smarter; which gives her special abilities. Freeman plays a Professor that Lucy goes to for help.The theory that we only use 10% of our brain's capacity is heavily explored in this film (although most scientists say it's just a myth). In this movie when Lucy begins using 20% of her brain, and increasingly higher amounts, she develops super human abilities; like telekinesis and mental time travel. She keeps getting more and more powerful, self aware and also increasingly emotionless. This makes her character seem extremely unrelatable; she's still an awesome action heroine though. Besson is well known for doing action flicks with really strong female characters (like 'LA FEMME NIKITA', 'THE FIFTH ELEMENT' and 'THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC'). Johansson's character here continues that tradition. As an action flick it works but it's definitely not full of intelligent big ideas. It does try to do something different but it's still highly reminiscent of other recent sci-fi flicks like 'TRANSCENDENCE' and even 'HER' (which also featured Johansson). It's definitely entertaining enough for 90 minutes though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/3AK4roDokJo","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

The movie has many different strengths, differs from similar films and feels fresh and entertaining despite a more philosophical and scientific approach.First of all, the movie has a running time of ninety minutes only. The viewer is immediately thrown into a story filled with pace and tension. This films simply doesn't include any unnecessary lengths.The acting performances in this film are completely incredibly. Scarlett Johansson starts as a naive and shy lady that slowly becomes a clever heroine in a credible manner. Her character doesn't include the usual weaknesses of so-called superheroes. She doesn't talk too much, she only uses her powers when she has to and is still quite impressive and there is no cheesy love story or a demon from her past to distract us from the main plot. Morgan Freeman only has a smaller role in this movie but he simply convinces for being there because he is credible in his role as a clever scientist and has a lot of charisma. The ruthless main villain is portrayed by the incredible Choi Min-Sik who is one of my favourite actors ever and it's great to finally see him in a Western movie where his incredible talents get some more attention. This may not be his greatest performance but this man has a talent and history for playing dark characters.The story of the movie is another strong point. It's not your usual tale of crime and vengeance. The film has a rather profound philosophical and scientific side and takes its time to explain what is actually going on without boring the audience. Many viewers felt let down by the ending of the movie but in relation to the entire film, it completely makes sense. The movie doesn't only convince with gifted actors and addicting action sequences but also offers some real food for thought.The visual effects of the movie exploit all contemporary technologies extremely well. I was stunned by many impressive images from animal and nature sequences over animated pictures of the human body up to modern images with different rays and colours. These effects make the movie even more enjoyable in a cinema.The rest of the movie is very well executed as well. There are no annoying shaky camera passages, the soundtrack is very fitting and the whole movie has an intriguing multicultural touch as it takes place in Taiwan and France and involves actors and characters from many different countries. The fact that the Korean actors only speak Korean might be annoying for some viewers but it makes the experience even more realistic. Just as Scarlett Johansson's character in the beginning, the viewer doesn't always understand what is going on when the Korean characters are talking and this adds even more tension to the plot and is a great element that is more and more employed in commercial movies as well.Lucy may not reinvent a whole genre but this science-fiction movie focuses on the best elements of science and a really gripping fiction. If you only like slow-paced dramas or comedy movies for the whole family, this movie isn't for you but anyone else should absolutely watch this film as soon as possible. There are still some interesting movies to come out this year but so far, this film is a more than solid candidate for the greatest movie of the year and you really don't want to miss it.","37 out of 63 found this helpful.

Metaphors are literally shown to the audience with footage of animals, like a mouse being enticed by bate in a mouse trap and it's either Luc Besson's idea of artistic flair or he thinks so little of his audience that he has to spell out even the dumbest scene. Morgan Freeman's speeches about using more than 10% percent of the human brain, even in fantasy movie land, are so simplistic and silly, an audience of children would be more fitting than college students and adults. For someone that has apparently unlocked all of her brain, Lucy doesn't use much of it and has gotten herself drawn into a really terrible action movie - when she could have used her smarts and about 5 minutes to synthesize the drug for herself, or simply duplicate it with her powers. But no, she has to travel the globe to get a few bags from some mules, because the worldwide theatrical box office would benefit from it, not that a modicum of logic should dictate the story. Idiot plotting; dialogue that's equal parts point at the screen hilarious and roll your eyes into the back of your head bad; villains who are typical stock characters that you'd find in your standard straight to video actioner; a climax that was either cut due to budget restraints or Besson just had no ideas outside of throwing his percentage of brain gimmick into the structure of a D grade action film - Lucy is truly out of this world dim-witted.","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

"","","Has the gloss and nice structure, but ultimately lacking in forward motion, sense, and thrills","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3209317/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","27 March 2015","It is to this film's benefit that it barely touches the 90 minute mark; not only was it this factor that made me watch it in the last 100 minutes of a long-haul flight, but it also means that it has a very short distance to go, and doesn't have to worry too much about not being able to keep up a fast pace all the way. This does cover up for a lot and to a certain point it did make the film work for me by virtue of it moving forward with slickness and material that offers some interest. It also benefits from a nice structure which has a lecture interspersed in the beginning, plus quickly edited clips and images, all of which add pace and variety.This approach is complimented by a slick presentation, a good sized budget, famous faces in the cast, good locations, and all the trimmings one expects with such films. Unfortunately, these aspects mostly serve to mask some of the inherent problems with it, rather than lift an already strong film to be stronger. The writing is probably the root of most things and in this case it is weak, trying to engage and expand but also trying to service an action thriller – it doesn't really do either well, even though in the broad sweep it is quite daring in where it goes. That said, by failing to really engage the brain, the daring place it ends up, actually comes over as pretty silly and ultimately makes for a weaker ending than it should have been.The action is a mixed bag since at times it is well executed whereas at others it is lacking in memorable set-pieces and tends towards genre cliché and standards. The slick style does cover this up, but generally the action doesn't thrill as much as it should, and combined with the so-so material, I did find myself just ""looking"" at the screen, rather than really being into the film. The cast try hard and are part of the slick presentation; Johansson is not really used well, however she does her best in the style, and has some elements of performance about her. Freeman plays himself – and is best when detached from the action, not so much in the second half. Likewise Min-sik Choi is stylistically very much a key part of the film, but at the same time could have benefited from doing that within a better film.Lucy does fill its time well, and does it with a style and pace that at least will distract, but not much more than that. The action needed to be sharper, the ideas needed to be smarter, and although the destination is a good idea, it is poorly executed and ends up more silly than inspired.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The way they put the movie could have been different. It was also a fast moving movie, so you have to pay attention. The end was weird and came abrupt end. Though it was different than many other movie it still wasn't good. Morgan was a highlight to this movie for the brief parts he was in.

The film's tired plot relates how some blood-thirsty Chinese drug traffickers attempt to corner the market with a new designer drug. After sewing packages of the substance into the stomachs of some reluctant mules, they blackmail them to fly to Europe with the contraband. Apparently these incompetent mobsters haven't properly tested their product, and are ignorant that an overdose can endow its consumer with extraordinary physical powers and intelligence. When one of the packages leaks, a ditsy blonde mule metamorphoses into Superwoman. The plot-holes are gigantic, so writer/director Luc Besson attempts to distract the audience with his standard menu of theatrical fights, car chases, shoot-outs and gratuitous violence. These stale leftovers are served up with some pretentious babbling about the drug's mutations projecting humanity up the evolutionary ladder. Unfortunately 'Lucy' only signifies another dead-end in film-making.","14 out of 34 found this helpful.

After this deal takes place she is transformed in a best warrior with some special powers or better senses. These powers cannot be understood by the people since they are very evolved and beyond the human logic.I liked this movie because of its interesting and new plot with a well-written script.

In one of the stranger wide releases in years, there is much reward given to those willing to give Lucy grace (ridiculous premise and over-the-top aspirations). It's flawed, but it's a brightly filmed and darkly themed scifi action thriller that delivers. Lucy posits the debatable notion that humans only use 10% brain capacity. Johansson plays the title character that goes from monotony to superhero when a new drug gives her the ability to use 100% of her brains power. Her capabilities aren't just big math problems and fast reading, but telekinesis, shape shifting and other comic-booky things. It's a fascinating if overly ambitious premise that Besson puts to great use, playing it out like a briskly paced, inventive TV pilot. The scifi is strong, with theories and declarations posited throughout and thematic exposition that works. The shining element here is Johansson, who continues her upward trajectory in a bombastic yet effective performance. Her progression from a nobody to the most powerful femme fatale in history is emotional, funny and relatively believable. It's great to see Besson bounce back after The Family to present what may be his magnum opus, touching on all of time and creation in under 90 minutes. Sure, some of the effects are cheap and goofy, but the editing is unique and tight, the violence and style are lively, and the storytelling is refreshing. Engaging and cool, Lucy is highly stylized scifi pulp of the highest order.","44 out of 78 found this helpful.

Anyway, my impression of this film is that it is another type of Fifth Element with a sexy chick presented as the greatest and best humanity can become. Like The Fifth Element, Luc Besson writes and directs this story about the aptly named Lucy who accidentally absorbs a superdrug that a Korean cartel is trying to manufacture and sell. She then uses more and more of her brain allowing her to have all these wonderful powers and knowledge.Unfortunately, this is about all that the movie is about and you get that from the trailer. In a way, the trailer is a damned lie, because after you see the premise of the film and some cool scenes, you are tempted to believe that is just a part and the rest of the film would be building on it. It is not. That's about all you get.In fact the Korean mafia and the police and humanity in general become pretty much inconsequential after a while. Morgan Freeman's character appears in about 5 minutes of scenes, the violent murders, fights and car chases are there just as a distraction and Lucy herself, the apex of humanity, does nothing more than use the entire existence as a she would a cell phone, spout some existential things that make little sense and look pretty.Bottom line: If Transcendence really posed some interesting questions about what people would do if granted limitless power, ending with a very philosophical free will choice kind of thing, Lucy is just eye-candy. The only interesting idea in it seems to be that the purpose of life is to share knowledge. Well, there is that, but also another: the elimination of knowledge we don't like. Yet that's another story altogether and probably more interesting than this film.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Luc's inter cuts of stock nature footage was not really something we are use to but it was worked in brilliantly and was very humorous. It felt like a major Hollywood studio was allowing this Frenchma n free creative control to make the most artistically obscure action movie the U.S has ever released in theaters, and he's proving to all studios that they should give that type of freedom to artist. Nicely done. I also loved how foreign the movie felt, not just with the film making but with the international cast. The movie takes place mostly in Taiwan with small parts in France. Though it stars two American actors the movie's man antagonist does not even speak English. Possible the weirdest action flick I've seen in a while, it's not for science geeks as it's thrown out the window for a more artistic focus that made for a very watchable thrill ride at the movies.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A whimsy built on a fallacy. Exciting, but conveniently wrapped up.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3076803/?ref_=tt_urv","TheSquiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34414709/?ref_=tt_urv","28 August 2014","It's been a while since Luc Besson really excited me. I'm going to say 1994, with the sublime Léon. His most recent outings as writer (3 Days to Kill) and director (The Family) have been dull thuds that threatened to overshadow the resounding successes of his hit-man triumph and the likes of Subway and The Big Blue. Twenty years is a long time to wait for something worth celebrating, but finally we have Lucy to admire.Let's not get too excited, though. Lucy is a curio, an enjoyable return to form from the French auteur (a contentious mantle and one worthy of debate another time), but is a long way from being a classic, despite a solid, central performance from Scarlett Johansson in the title role.When Lucy is forced to deliver a briefcase to the violent criminal kingpin Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), she winds up with a bag full of a new synthetic drug sewn into her belly. Before she can complete the delivery, the bag bursts and the drug infects her, unlocking the unused 90% of her brain and transforming her into an acutely aware, brilliant superhuman with warrior-like powers and a drastically reduced shelf life on this earth.At this juncture we should perhaps take a momentary step back into reality. Lucy is a whimsy built on a fallacy. We don't use a mere 10% of our brain. We use all of it (although a look at some people around here does bring that accepted 'fact' into question) but understand perhaps 10% of the brain's workings. And while we're at it, if you cut a worm in half, you don't get two worms, you end up with a dead worm in two parts. Deal with it! However, facts can get in the way of a good story and so Besson dispenses with them from the outset, not that I have any particular issues with that. For the most part, Lucy is exciting and a thoroughly enjoyable romp. There are plot holes aplenty but Besson bats them away with aplomb, and concentrates on the thrills and the race against time. This is Limitless meets Transcendence with a serious armoury thrown in for good measure. There is much to enjoy as we watch Lucy evolving physically, mentally and emotionally before us, becoming ever more resourceful and violent as she seeks out Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), the authority on the mind and brain function, for help and to impart her knowledge to him.Morgan Freeman, though a comforting presence, is unremarkable, playing essentially the same role as he did in Transcendence. His Professor Norman is virtually indistinguishable from his Joseph Tagger and the impression he gives is of a man coasting in his dotage. His performance doesn't in any way detract from Lucy, it just doesn't enhance it.The presence of the hominid Lucy is awful, however. Didn't Besson think about looking at the make up and CGI created for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or even the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Awful, just awful. And the confusion of travelling through space first and then time is clumsy and implies he is uncertain of his historical chronology and geography.The principal failing of Lucy is its culmination, which of is largely unsatisfying though hardly surprising. Lucy sets out with high ideals of uniqueness, boldness and enlightenment but is unable to be truly original and has to settle for a rearrangement of old ideas. That isn't entirely the fault of Luc Besson as we must shoulder some of the responsibility. We are creatures of limited comprehension, we cannot truly fathom the infinity of the universe (something has to contain it, surely) and this, Lucy, is no different. We have a need to box things up to understand them and by doing so Besson immediately limits it.'It', the expansiveness of intelligence and our potential, becomes something tangible for us to scrutinize. Professor Norman states early on that he doesn't know what would happen if we ever harnessed the entirety of our brain capacity. He can only hypothesize; the rest is a mystery. Besson, however, attempts to explain and portray it for us. The bolder move would have been stop short of an explanation, to perhaps watch Lucy's brainpower percentage rise and to fill the screen and auditorium with white noise until the credits cut in, leaving us puzzled, confused, befuddled, just as Professor Norman is, but I suspect Besson feared the cries of outrage from audiences and critics and instead he gives us a convenient, comprehensible resolution.Lucy needed a visionary at the helm. Whilst Besson is imaginative and delivers a rollicking good ride (on a good day), he lacks the courage to create something truly unique and astounding.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I must say, the story is ridiculous. The scenes keep coming without logic, and all we see are ideas without content that lack strong justifications.How boring that was.At least the actors do their work without ever excelling. The special effects are quite successful, except in a few places where we feel far from the Planet of the Apes ... It is quite a chance for us that the movie does not last longer than its short 1 hour and 25 minutes. This is a sometime satisfactory visual trip, with some interesting reflections about our human origins, but in general the film is just bad.Luc Besson has failed the last movies he did, and this one is one of his worst.

I started counting the the money I spent to buy this DVD in cents so that I too, can plug into another dimension and forget I ever bought it. The movie is based on the most wide-spread urban legend since the Loch-Ness monster. The fact that 100% of your brain is used (maybe not the director's) is the most classic example of debunking scientific misconception and I am surprised that there are still quite a few thousand people who still believe it. I pushed myself to watch it because I thought that it would be a ""Limitless"" copy but it turned out to be a lot less than that.Defying the basic rules of the universe is a job for a superhero, and I tried to see this like watching another superhero movie. But the problem is that even superheros have a special ability that arises from exploiting unknown scientific concepts. Whether it is a humanoid for another planet, or a chemical reaction to an uncharted material, or even a smart-eccentric millionaire geek. All of the above have an unreasonable, yet a quite far fetched ""believability"" because they are based on facts you DON'T KNOW. Not on the De'facto KNOW it's not true. Even so, to be able to show a character defy the very laws of nature, there must, in my opinion, be some sort of a far fetched explanation, exploiting the unknown variable. They might as well replace Scarlet with a talking CGI tree and remake the whole movie. It will make the same sense.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

"","","OTT SF film is also a bloody crime story.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3079184/?ref_=tt_urv","guchrisc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39929622/?ref_=tt_urv","1 September 2014","A Universal film. Exciting trailers suggested a film rather like 'Transcendence' from earlier this year starring Johnny Depp, and so it turned out to be. 'Her' (2013), which was screened earlier this year, starred Joaquin Phoenix as a man who fell in love with his computer. That film concentrated on the personal and was rather boring. By contrast, in 'Transcendence', Johnny Depp is plugged into a computer, an event which is exciting and has far-reaching consequences.In 2011, Bradley Cooper starred in 'Limitless' playing a man who takes a drug which expands his brain-power. 'Lucy' has a similar plot, so it is not an original idea. However it is an exciting film. If however you are interested in this brain-expanding idea, 'Limitless' is the better of the two films. Like in 'Her', 'Limitless' concentrated on the personal, and was rather believable. Writer and director Luc Besson seems to have taken that idea as a starting point, but then via a crime story, has moved into a 'Transcendence' mode of limitless possibilities.In 1994 Luc Besson astonished audiences with his 'Leon'. Now in 'Lucy' Mr Besson has given us a rather similar bloody and exciting crime story.'Lucy' opens with some nice graphics to go with the opening titles. However, just like in 'Leon', it is merely the calm before the storm. Some information given out about this film was that the star, Scarlett Johansson, played a character forced to carry drugs, which then got into her system. This seemed an unlikely scenario but Luc Besson makes it a believable situation.Miss Johansson plays a not too bright party girl in Taiwan who is caught up in the clutches of a gang of violent criminals. Just as 'Leon' opens with a young Natalie Portman scared of falling into the clutches of mad killer Gary Oldman, so in 'Lucy' we have a similar scenario. Miss Johansson stumbles into the clutches of a Mr Jang played by Min-sik Choi. This villainous character makes Mr Oldman look like a pussy-cat. Like Miss Portman before her, Miss Johansson attempts to escape her predicament. However she is unable to. The situation gets worse and worse, the scenes bloodier and bloodier, unremittingly so.Whilst the early scenes are filmed in Taiwan and are clearly based in Taiwan, the gangsters do not seem to be Triad members. The body-tattooing and Korean language suggest rather that these gangsters are in fact the Japanese Yakuza, who in reality have many ethnic Korean members. Poor little white girl Lucy, unable to speak the language, is terrified by the situation. This is captured well, and we, like Lucy, do not understand the situation. In these scenes Miss Johansson is very emotional and gives a superb performance. As the film develops, so does Lucy, and she becomes more like 'the woman who knows too much', acting accordingly, and again Miss Johansson excels in this character development.Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked give good support, but this film is all about Scarlett Johansson and Min-sik Choi, who are the chief protagonists, and who dominate the proceedings, in every scene they are in. Two tremendous performances.This film is part SF, and part crime story. It is very bloody. If you liked 'Leon' (1994), or 'Transcendence' (2014), then you should enjoy this film. Fans of SF and pseudo-science will enjoy this film, but it is not suitable for viewing by scientists.Bloody, but good. 9/10.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

First of all Darwin theory is nonsense, no matter how much Holly Wood tries to justify it, its completely, utterly nonsense. Further, Limitless was a movie about a guy who take some unknown pill and it enhances his mental capabilities, makes him a smart guy, makes him remember everything and give access to every thought, every memory and everything that he ever experience.

The interest in what ideas the writer's may come up with to take advantage of this catchy film idea, keeps the watcher attentive. Unfortunately, as most movies do that just try to push scientific evolutionary theory as the 'main-Sell' of the movie, it ends up lacking in the human-relationships side of the plot. Although there is some romantic interest in Lucy, there seemed a lack of believability in some of the other characters relational-side to humanity. Visually, it is a very Matrix-esc display (Even though it could have used some of that Matrix Sci-Fi-ness to enhance the plot). Great special effects, time stop-motion filming. Good camera effects with zooming, panning, and meshing with computer animations. The down-side was an extensive amount of B-role footage from yesteryear. A lot of time lapse photography/videography, and history lessons that look as though they came straight out of the Encyclopedia Britannica CD ROM collections of a decade ago. They would've been better-off to show more of their A-List actress, Scarlett Johansson. She played the role very well, not overly emotional (as the character dictated) and not so understated that you miss her. Co-staring actors left something to be desired. Johansson is a real up-and- coming film Icon. Her role in Captain America gave her widespread fame amongst a diverse audience. Her audience for Lucy will be considerably smaller. Although doing well at the box office, because of the content and MPAA Rating, Lucy has a lower ceiling for success. However, with Johansson's talent and current appeal to American (male :) action movie audiences, I see Lucy doing very well. I was pleased with the non-stop pace it started with and took right up to the end.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And guess what: you'd be totally right!The problem is, this movie essentially does to you the same as what i described before, but honestly and even naively expects you to take it for granted as some sublime wisdom and enlightening experience. To do that, it uses three components it considers omnipotent: Morgan Freeman as ""deep"", Scarlett Johansson as ""sexy"" and lots of random CGI as ""cool"". Well, and some shoot-outs and car chases as a cherry on top.The fact is, even though these components seem to mesmerize some of the people to make them believe there's some deep essence in this film, they are surely not omnipotent. Because they definitely fail to transform this utter piece of crap into anything decent.The only way to believe that Luc Besson's not completely insane is to assume that 'Lucy' is his way to say ""f@ck you"" to the viewers and to make them pay for it afterwards. And if it's true then one can only wonder how much of the brain capacity that grateful audience actually utilizes.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

But he is seriously tripping balls with this one. All because of a drug o.d., Scarlett Johansson begins to open her mind far beyond our known capacity; which means she's just full-on superhero. And the first half of this is a tightly-paced bundle of energy. IT is pure comic book and a lot of fun. I'm actually surprised it isn't Japanese (""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Akira"" jump to mind).The second half is where it loses step, explaining the nutballs plot and trying to make a statement on man's power list. Scarlett manipulates space and time like Neo and it loses its winning personality. For me, this movie boils right down to its lead. She is perfect; and I wonder how good this would've turned out with a lesser actor. Casting makes up for an awful lot in the writing department here.7/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Johansson is stellar.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3079200/?ref_=tt_urv","shawneofthedead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48490287/?ref_=tt_urv","1 September 2014","How do you like your action movies? Straight-up and balls-out, no brains required? Or something a wee bit more thoughtful, even if the philosophy being peddled is wacky science and hardly substantiated by scientific inquiry? Either way, oddly enough, you should be quite pleased with LUCY, which is a ridiculously fun - if occasionally outrageously silly - action movie, spiced up along the way with some unexpectedly deep ideas about the value of life and love.Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an exchange student in Taiwan, is a perfectly ordinary girl with perfectly ordinary concerns. (Leaving aside the fact that she looks like Scarlett Johansson, that is.) Sent into the maw of an international drug syndicate by her skeevy new boyfriend, Lucy is forced to become a drug mule. A brand new experimental drug is sewn into her stomach for transport back to America. But no one expects the bag to be roughly kicked apart, or for the hyper-dangerous drug to sink deep into Lucy's bloodstream. Within minutes, she finds that any previous limitations on her mind and body are rapidly being unlocked - which greatly facilitates her quest for vengeance and, perhaps, something more.Make no mistake, this is science-fiction of the first order; if you're looking for science-fact, you've definitely come to the wrong place. The notion that humans use only 10% of their brain power has been debunked by scientists but remains stubbornly entrenched as an urban myth. Writer-director Luc Besson relies heavily upon it - and the sonorous, credibility-lending tones of Morgan Freeman as a professor expounding on said theory - for the progression of his story, as Lucy acquires new, terrifying abilities each time she gains access to another portion of her brain. It makes for some quite thrilling, hyper-kinetic scenes, as Lucy moves from manipulating gravity to changing her appearance in a split second. Besson even manages to explore a few weightier ideas tied up with identity: as Lucy's consciousness expands, so too does her understanding of the inter-connectedness of the world around her, and she begins to slip away as an individual.But Besson does falter along the way - he takes his frankly silly concept so seriously at times that it's hard not to laugh at what he's tossing up on screen. Lucy meets the first primate - a female named Lucy. She gains a soul-changing comprehension of the universe and is nevertheless bent on avenging herself against Mr. Jang (Oldboy's Choi Min-Sik), the brutal head of the drug cartel. LUCY - and Lucy's - final scenes manage to be eerie and ridiculous at the same time. Fortunately for Besson, Johansson anchors the entire film - even at its flightiest - with a steely humanity that proves absolutely essential in her more dramatic moments. It's sometimes hard to follow the logic of the character (surely Lucy should become more pacifist and less wantonly violent as she gains knowledge?!), but Johansson will make you care anyway. She delivers most of her dialogue with a stony, impassive face, yet somehow allows the great pain and fear Lucy experiences, at least at the beginning, to spill through the cracks of her character. Her few moments of human connection with people who mattered greatly to her in the past - her mother, her room-mate - give this action film more emotional ballast than you'd expect.LUCY is not, ultimately, Besson's best film - he might well have made that twenty years ago, with The Professional. But it's certainly a nice change of pace and relative quality from the forgettable films he's been overseeing for years - everything from the Transporter and Taken franchises, through to the awkward We're A Nice Normal Family. Smarter than you'd expect, though quite silly as well, there's plenty to enjoy in this high-octane, heart-racing, brain-busting blend of action, emotion, and pop philosophy.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sub-par writing isn't always a death sentence. If there are good performances, solid direction, interesting effects and decent production values, audiences may be able to forgive story lines and characters that just don't quite work.And I think ""Lucy"" is a good example of that.It's storyline is a bit messy. It's based on a false myth that has been scientifically disproved. The characters are fairly stock and even boring. And outside of the titular ""Lucy"", you'd be hard-pressed to even remember anyone else's name.However, the direction is very strong. The effects are quite fascinating. There's some truly unique and creative uses of editing, music and cutaways that give the film identity. And the performances are incredibly strong. So honestly... I didn't mind the weak script, because despite it, the film was just too much fun for me to dislike.Scarlett Johansson stars as Lucy, a seemingly normal young woman who is inadvertently pulled into a desperate and bizarre situation after hesitantly agreeing to act as a one-time ""drug mule"" for money. Suddenly captured by the ruthless Mr. Jang (the incredible Choi Min-sik, best known for the Korean version of ""Oldboy""), she is forced to accept a new job smuggling an experimental synthetic drug surgically implanted in her body. However, the bag containing the drugs within her is accidentally ruptured, lacing her entire body with copious amounts of ""CPH4""- the synthetic drug which begins to rapidly advance her body physically and mentally, allowing her access to the previously unused parts of her brain. Suddenly granted increasingly super-human abilities, including telepathy, telekinesis and other powers, she decides to seek vengeance against Jang and seek the help of a scientist (Morgan Freeman) who may hold the key to helping her control her new powers before they tear her apart.The performances and production are what really saves the film here. Scarlett Johansson excels as Lucy, giving a performance that, while not perfect, really shows growth as her character ""evolves"" and transcends ""normal humanity."" She's perfect for the role and is able to garner a lot of sympathy, empathy and support from the audience. Choi Min-sik is perfect as the ruthless villain. He's a bit one-dimensional, but you can tell he's having a blast just being pure, unadulterated scum. From his casual ""been there, done that"" attitude towards violence, to some amusing moments where he loses patience with other characters during the bizarre scenarios presented, Min-sik is absolutely watchable and compelling. And supporting roles by the likes of Morgan Freeman are all admirably played. (But seriously... it's Morgan Freeman... when has he ever given a performance less than stunning?)Luc Besson's visual direction is grand. As per usual with his films. No matter what content, Besson always brings vast scope, character and energy to the visuals of his films. And this is no different. He excels and elevates the material. He also makes a fascinating choice of using consistent cut-away shots of footage (both stock and new footage made exclusively for the film), often in most scenes, to emphasize things like mood, character and emotion. (Ex. some scenes may feature cutaways to wildlife, animals hunting, volcanoes erupting, etc.) It does almost feel cheap at first (I thought it was just padding to extend the running length), but as time went on, I realized that it was a fairly carefully planned stylistic choice, and I actually really got into it.The visual effects are quite spell-binding. And they also help to elevate the material. While it is obvious what is CG and what is practical, the computer-generated imagery is quite unique in its design, and the way it emphasizes the changes happening to Lucy. While they may not be photo-realistic, they are just darned cool on their own.As I said above, the script is the only real problem. Because it doesn't quite work. But the wonderful performances, great direction, cool effects and other very competent facets of the production are able to make up for it. It's a very watchable, enjoyable film. And that definitely counts for something.I give ""Lucy"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth checking out for fans of action (and even of Sci-Fi) at least once.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

She plays Lucy, initially a down on her luck young lady who gets involved with the Chinese mafia and ends up ingesting a drug that morphs her into a superhuman in terms of ability to rule matter with her mind. The plot develops into her journey to the 100% marker of brain power while the Chinese contingent is trying to destroy her. Along the way, she involves a French detective, Amr Waked and a professor, Morgan Freeman. As she moves close to using 100% of her brain capacity, Lucy becomes more estranged from human feelings and gradually replaces them with pure logic and knowledge of the fundamentals of human existence and bridges the gap between physics, time and space. The evil doers chasing her are not used to losing but are thwarted at every turn and in the end they are obliterated. Lucy the movie is a fabulous ride to the unknown and gives us a glimpse of what can be in the far distant future. This is a different role for Scarlett which she plays wonderfully.

Fred DurstLucy is a summer surprise—a sci-fi with brains and humor directed by Luc Besson, whose talents I first spied in the strong woman flick, la Femme Nikita. The titular heroine, played by Scarlett Johansson (carrying on from her other intriguing sci-fi this year, Under the Skin), begins as a hapless woman caught in a drug deal, whose drug she is forced to carry as a mule. Spillage gives her brain powers undreamed of.This drug increases her brain function incrementally until she finally uses all of it. At stages higher than the usual human 10% or so usage, she has insights and telekinetic abilities that neutralize tough guys and engage intellectuals, mainly Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who has been theorizing about the brain's potential for years. The reality of the increased brain usage in Lucy is almost more than he or the world can bear. The super power action could remind audiences of The Matrix's arcane philosophy and action.Besson deftly plays between violence and humor, the opening sequence the most hilarious when the bad guys corral Lucy, who begins to feel her power and uses it on the Asian thugs, who scarcely can believe this white woman tornado. Intercutting between Lucy's slowly realizing her accelerating brain functions and Professor Norman's lectures on the brain's underused capacity, Besson keeps the film moving at thriller pace while educating the audience on the potential of underused intelligence.As usually happens in most thrillers, but not always sci-fi's, chases are too abundant, either in cars or on foot. The car chase where Lucy drives through Paris is unusually creative, more keystone Cops than James Bond, but ingenious enough for me to mention action I usually ignore in reviews.In the end, it's not the guns or the beautiful Johansson that interests me; it's the philosophical contrast between our need to love and our thirst for more knowledge and experience. After all, that knowledge compromised Adam and Eve, and by extension all of us, and Lucy's increasing wisdom would seem to put us in a similar danger. ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,"" as the saying goes, but what about too much?","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Subtext clearly a hindrance for cinema-goers, Besson leaves no stone unturned as he dazzles us with shots of animals hunting prey to tell us something bad is about to happen, title cards to inform us what percentage of Lucy's brain she's using, Lucy's voice-over, or indeed, Morgan Freeman's voice-over - which is cleverly disguised as his character's dialogue. Hopefully they'll someday release an interactive version, which will show the movie's viewers what percentage of THEIR brain they're using, and administer a dose of tranquilisers any time it ventures above zero.For a movie that wants to explore the impossible, all it really explores are a bunch of hackneyed action B-movie plot devices - which is fine if you're thirteen years old - otherwise, I'd steer clear.

I approach movies just seeking to be entertained for awhile, and this movie did that. In fact, I liked it and as my above summary says, I will most likely watch this movie again. As many reviewers have critically mentioned, the story line is improbable, but so are the Star Wars movies. This movie doesn't have the overuse of raw language or grab-you-in-the-ass action/gore/sex/fill in the blank which some people seem to expect from every movie. I don't watch every movie waiting for the special effects. For me, it was just a story that had enough going to keep me interested. I do enjoy movies with character development and this movie doesn't have much of that, but given what is happening with the main character, she's not left with much personality. I think that it would be easy to approach this movie with expectations that might not be met; if you take that approach,you may not find what you were looking for with this one. Besides, it has Morgan Freeman and sometimes that's just enough.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The director was able to mix the stories of Chinese drug gang and Lucy's slow transformation very well. Scarlett Johanson I guess has confirmed her place with this movie as a action character like Angelina Jolie. She was good in her role so was Morgan Freeman who with his experience can sleepwalk such scripts. The stunts were decent enough. The climax was justified.

Johansson plays a woman who gets forced to smuggle a kilo of CPH4 (a new drug) in her stomach, but it rips open and she gets a overdose which gives her the ability to gradually use more of her brain capacity. It all sounds plausible up to here but then it goes completely of the rails. I won't mention the things she can do with her mind in this film, but let's just say that they are not very realistic or scientifically sound. It's all just very silly and ridiculous and you have to just go with it. The film was very successful in the cinemas, my guess is because it's a very international film. There are Americans, Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, Koreans and China-men in it. Everybody likes to see themselves in a movie right? The film most resembles a scifi version of the Transporter films which Besson also produced. You could say Chris Nolan makes Scifi with a capital S and Besson scifi with a small s. It's not bad but don't don't think about it to much, it's just popcorn cinema.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

October 09, 2015 Expository Writing Mrs. Smith Lucy Synopsis: Scarlett Johansson, who plays the brave role of Lucy, is deceived by a guy who she thought was a ""friend"" into carrying a briefcase to a supposed business contact. The once care free student is captured by a gang of men with all of the wrong intentions. After being exposed to a new European synthetic drug, Lucy develops superhuman abilities; which, causes her to seek help from neurologist Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who she hopes can and will help her. Review: The movie Lucy is an exhilarating, action packed thriller that will have you on edge every step of the way. Very similar to the film Limitless, director Luc Besson with an excellent choice of casting and meticulously detailed imagery depicts the first person to access full cerebral capacity . With Scarlett Johansson cast as the main character Lucy is portrayed as a brave, fearless, and sharp minded individual. She was placed in a tough situation, and she follows her instincts in attempt to reach safety and potentially save her own life. As you get further in the movie more extreme things began to happen and more mishap's are stirred up. Ten minutes after the movie has started, action has already taken place. At a midnight club outside of New York City, Lucy meets Richard (Pilou Asbaek) who she dates only for about a week up until the day of his death. One evening Richard tries to lure Lucy into entering a hotel by herself and supposedly delivering a briefcase to a man she'd never met by the name of Mr. Jang. But Lucy's isn't going along with the plan, so Richard quickly handcuffs the case onto her wrist forcing Lucy to complete the mission. The way she handled herself allowed viewers to get an inside look at Lucy's demeanor before the whole disaster. Once Mr. Jang comes down to ""receive his package"" a spark was lit and more action took place. Mr. Jang's thugs abducted Lucy and shot Richard dead on the sidewalk in front of the hotel they were at. Although false, the combination of philosophy and scientific theory Besson delivers viewers to ponder is remarkable. These mind stimulating ideas brought additional excitement to the film! That wasn't it though, it seemed like the more Cph4 that dispensed into Lucy's internal organs the more levels of her brain she'd unlock. Besson manages to use a lot of vivid and colorful imagery of the synthetic drug that was inside of Lucy's body. When she'd reach new levels, you could see the colorful medicine rushing through her veins fast and with really cool illuminations. This keeps the audience's attention. The aggressiveness shown by Lucy was acted on not only for revenge, but also for the safety of the drugs being exposed to the world. In hopes of storing all of the information and knowledge the drugs allowed her to and passing it on from generation to generation, Lucy's entire mission to obtain the drugs, inject them, and use 100% of her cerebral capacity wasn't an easy one. With the help of Professor Norman and his colleagues, Lucy is monitored as she absorbs all of this information through matter.His choice to parallel Lucy's story with nature and evolutionary biology makes sense and was very unique. I would definitely recommend this movie to any one who enjoys action/sci-fi drama related genres.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Tries To Be Smart but Embarrassingly Fails","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3059140/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmMuscle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18123905/?ref_=tt_urv","30 July 2014","Scarlett Johansson has been on quite the roll as an action star as of late, bouncing back and forth between her more expensive (Marvel) projects and more peculiar and experimental ones. Though Lucy might appear to be the former—a clichéd, loud extravaganza of mindless, fun action—from the trailers and the like, the truth is that it (somewhat) belongs to the category of the latter. A Taiwanese mob implants a mysterious drug called CPH4 into her stomach, and very soon, she discovers that access to her cerebral capacity has surpassed that of the normal human being. Apparently, that means that she can now wield ridiculous superpowers that allow her to tap into people's memories and extract any bit of information from whatever object/individual that existed within. It also means that she can levitate anything and anyone, as well as teleport to any location she so wishes. Right from the get-go, you'll have to get used to the fact that the premise is incredibly unbelievable; the plot will get even more outlandish as it progresses, and don't worry: the movie will warn you with a continually increasing percentage (indicating just how much of the brain she can now utilize) every time events are about to become even more preposterously implausible. Once you get past the utter lack of realism and plethora of plot holes, what you experience is pretty badass. It's heavily stylized with its sci-fi components—it honestly reminded me of something like The Matrix, especially when considering the more twisted acts of violence. Complemented by beautiful cinematography (lavished with appealing colors and futuristic characteristics), this film is a blast—a lightning pace and intriguing set-up. Everything, aside from the ending, offers an abundance of thrilling amusement, and part of it obviously is due to Johansson's fierce presence. Even though Marvel Studios' rendition of Black Widow is softer and more forgiving, Lucy can be ruthless and calculating just like the original Marvel comics portrayed the Russian spy, Black Widow, as. However, eventually, the narrative takes a turn for the insane as convolution and far-fetched absurdity floods the plot and the sheer power Lucy truly holds furthers into the realm of sheer impossibility. The focus on high-octane, compulsive action is therefore abandoned and substituted with a confusing climax that only makes you wonder about what the hell this film which started out with a gripping basis has transformed into. So yes, the tale's unraveling heightens in ludicrousness, but at least, it's entertaining and cool. On the other hand, when it comes to the film's attempt to assess the themes and depth to which the idea of an increase in cerebral capacity goes, the arguable failure of this project certainly arises. First of all, this story is centered around a myth (humans only use 10% of their brains) that's already been debunked by guffawing scientists, creating irritation in the viewer as they continue to roll their eyes at the filmmakers' ignorance and clear unwillingness to properly research the subject. Secondly, as I've pointed out, this increase in intelligence—the ability to use more of your mind—does not mean that you'll suddenly turn into some terribly powerful superhero. If Besson didn't concentrate on producing a Limitless rip-off and simply decided to produce an absorbing sci-fi action film instead, Lucy wouldn't have been as annoying of a film, but if we're incorporating serious topics that beg the audience to recognize intellect in the project, don't expect to hold that compelled audience when you begin betraying realism and truth (of the topic). At the end of the day, Lucy is mostly fun, but it's ironically stupid fun as much as it tries to be smart fun.","7 out of 27 found this helpful.

Unfortunately I can't go into details without spoiling, but basically it's all wrong: incorrect, unfactual, mixed-with-pseudoscience, wrong.In some ways, it's a shame this tripe-fest got foisted on poor Scarlett - she is an underrated, actually very good actor, and this plot and its details were well beneath her abilities.But, as a ride, Lucy is quite enjoyable. It has no message, and no internal consistency, and it's based on a load of gobbledegook, but heck... at least it's not boring.The action is very actiony - the start, especially, is very gripping. (Though there are 'art' cut scenes in a very heavy-handed attempt at metaphor - oh my god, they just have to be ignored.) It promises you that it's going to be some kind of deep, techno-thriller... then it goes somewhere, er, 'else'.The CG is quite amazing, and for once it serves its purpose instead of boring you to into headache-dodging sleep like the (yawn) Matrix sequels.Grab the beer and the pizza and a bunch of friends, put it up on the big plasma, and turn your brain OFF - use 0% of it.Cheers! - -- ---","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Only hitch I found were the 'bad guys' that were annoying and I only partially understand why they were a continued threat; some other plot device could have been used to drive the story (CIA, FBI, NASA, NSA, CSIS - anything really) - something that would really give governments a cause for concern is someone with powers such as Scarlet Johansson obviously had so except for the stereotyped mafia types chasing throughout the movie everything else was strong.I really enjoyed the philosophical moments, a quiet moment early on when Lucy calls a loved one - the technologies that were displayed, the visuals, the music and score. I really think this was a strong effort and well, we'll have to see if this becomes a Trilogy.I gave this movie a 9/10, if more attention had been paid to the broader scope someone like Lucy would pose a threat to world governments and ALL forces would therefore make efforts against her I think that would have set the stage for some really fantastic stand-offs. What we got was OK, but not great as it was a bit too simplistic for what was happening in other parts of the movie near the end.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

There is a quite a lot of action in the film, but the majority of it was quite frankly pointless and you were constantly left asking yourself why did they do that, or who the hell would do that. You really have to ask why the so called A-list actors would read a script like this and say ""sign me up for that"", of course only one reason, money, and my god they must have being payed a lot to put there name to this film. The only decent thing about the film was the CGI, which was quite good, but again it was not really placed that well in the movie, in fact it made the movie even more confusing if anything.

However, he is a director who made some visually breath taking films such as The Fifth Element and Leon. If you think Lucy is an action film then beware its more of a sci-fi film with heavy scenes.Lucy starts off well. Its slow initially and as I watched the film, it got a creepy feeling in me. But when Lucy starts harnessing her brain as the trailer shows, Besson makes it a visual spectacle. His interpretation of the subject is brilliant and he uses less of CGI to show his mastery. I loved the scene where Lucy goes to meet Mr.Jang. Jang is listening to opera and Lucy is killing his men.Even the character of Lucy is interesting. Once she begins harnessing her brain, she becomes into a superhuman with some extraordinary powers but never a superhero. She is somebody seeking answers and not interested in providing solutions.And, that brings me to Scarlett Johansson. I think no actress would bring justice to Lucy's character what she does. She is brilliant in each scene; 1st as the victim and then as a person seeking answers. There are two scenes that stand out; one where is speaking to her mother and the other in the plane where she gets an attack.The rest of the cast does well. Freeman is sidelined in this film by Johansson while Choi is superb as the Korean drug lord.What doesn't work in Lucy is the last 15 mins. It left me confused and there was too much to think and absorb. Also, there is a some unnecessary blood shed.If you forget the last 15 mins and don't think much about the plot and scientific reasoning, then Lucy is must watch for sci-fi lovers.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

But suddenly, the end just falls flat. It doesn't totally, but the ending in no way measures up to how you got there.Scarlett/Lucy is a nobody in Taiwan with a loser boyfriend. She gets involved in this drug deal and next thing you know, the ride begins. This movie is ultra-fast paced, and seems to accelerate as Lucy's powers expand. There is a lot of blood and violence here, so be warned. The story is good, it keeps you guessing where this is going. The French policeman, Del Rio, is superb - he knows how to act, and how to let Lucy do her thing. Morgan Freeman plays the wise professor who is somewhat shocked to see his theories live before his eyes.There is a lot of killing and somewhat over the top bloodletting. Many chase scenes too, one of the best taking place in downtown Paris. Scarlett Johansson is terrific as Lucy. She has this look of, well, you don't know what I'm going to do next, but I know I'm capable of doing whatever I want. Kind of reminds me a bit of Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill series, without the swords.However, you are ramped up to reach the end, and then, splat. It falls flat. You could hear the audience sigh....that's it?? Yep, that's it. At 90 mins start to end, that's at least a tidy pace. But I think Besson could have taken the last 15 mins, shortened it to 5, and spent that extra time adding a bit more depth. Leaving a movie at the end with a --that's it?-- feeling is deflating.I still give it a 7/10 because for 95 percent of your time, you are glued to you seat. It's worth a look, but it really could have been better with a better, more well-thought-out ending.

It's science fiction in an ungrounded, wing-it kind of liberation. That's why some reviewers hated it (see the one in The Atlantic via Rotten Tomatoes). And I hated that aspect, myself.But this is a completely cheerful kind of mindless movie on some other level. It's actually funny (laugh out loud funny) in many parts, if you're paying attention (the most obvious is when the American Indians are shown). There are wry comments and a kind of chipper exaggeration throughout that make it all kind of bright, even when crazy and deadly things are happening.There is also the kind of action-adventure pace, with lots of moving camera (some of it really good) and lots of fast edits (without resorting to montage). There is also plenty of computer graphic excess, and sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just self- indulgent and almost boring. Scarlett Johansson holds it all together well, playing the emotionless type of character she just played in last year's ""Under the Skin."" I like her! Morgan Freeman plays a scientist, a dull version of his Lucius Fox (from ""Batman""). The rest of the cast is there to prop up these two (and mostly Johansson, who is the title character), but it's worth noticing, I suppose, that there is the common Hollywood pandering to the huge Asian (Chinese) audience it hopes to seduce. There are lots and lots of Korean bad guys (all are men but one, a tattoo artist). And there is lots of shooting, both in Taiwan and in Paris, where the second half of the movie is set. (The movie is officially a French production, but is mostly in English.)The movie has pretensions, which is its biggest downfall. Instead of just being silly and fun (like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") it has big (empty) ideas to foist on us. The opening scenes of the movie set this up, a kind of fast motion ""2001"" beginning. (Director/writer Luc Besson admits this, sort of.) And the very last moment of the movie makes clear the concepts here are ""big."" And so the trick is to keep it light and enjoy the humor and get wowed by the effects.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

At worst it is an over the top movie based on a single concept that runs out of ideas and falls down. The truth of this movie is somewhere in between. Lucy has a great opening, with a woman forced to transport a rare drug in her stomach by the menacing Min-sik Choi 'Oldboy'. What happens after that is quite amazing however the plot is too short for a feature length movie so the last half an hour seems to lose track of anything remotely feasible and this spoils the whole feel of the movie. Its a shame really because for the most part this film is a good thriller but even sci-fi films have to remain convincing to be effective, no-one expects a realistic movie with science fiction but it needs to be intelligent. 'Lucy' lost focus and descended into something quite absurd, despite this however it's a decent ride with the stellar cast in brilliant form.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I did not expect Lucy to be as magnificent as that of course, but I had hoped for some mildly entertaining sci-fi to pass a couple of hours at the cinema, alas however, this movie got under my skin alright, but for all the wrong reasons. Luc Beeson has been put firmly in his place by Mr Glazer. . We begin with some shots of a chimp (which looks absolutely terrible when compared with the Apes movie out at the moment), and Morgan Freeman spouting off pseudo-scientific garbage from a podium being well.......Morgan Freeman. Is it just me, or is anyone else sick and tired of seeing Freeman appear in movies as the ""knowledgeable old black man"" adding nothing to any film he's been in for years, and existing only as a piece of old mahogany furniture as if his mere presence gives a flick some validity? He's been typecast for at least a decade now and surely he must know how boring a character he's become? Honestly, you could take him out of any of the last 20 films he's made and place him in another and no one would notice the difference. What a yawn. I wish he would just call it a day and retire with his ample fortune. But anyway, back to Lucy. . Once Scarlets character has a package of drugs burst inside her she apparently gets the ability to use more of her brain (does anyone with even half a brain still believe this 10% nonsense? Obviously Beeson thinks someone does), and all of a sudden she acquires these superhuman abilities which even with some amazing drug effects are preposterous (yes we don't see all of the available light on the spectrum for example but that's a condition of our eyes' construction, not something a pill will fix). Then we have several intercut scenes of wildebeest roaming the plains (or was that Fawlty Towers?) and animals having sex, crashing oceans, and other ridiculous tosh that's supposed to underpin the daft plot. If I wasn't cringing at the dialogue that came out of Scarlets mouth I was laughing out loud at the scientific woo I was being force fed. I know it's a fact that America is low on scientific literacy but surely no one could swallow this nonsense? I mean really? It's been mentioned many times too that Lucy is a bit like Limitless, which I agree with slightly, but Limitless was fun and wasn't trying to take itself seriously, while the longer Lucy went on, the more ridiculously ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" it got. Exchanging one pseudo- scientific soundbite for another (sending me off down the proverbial rabbit hole). . By the end I felt mentally raped of my intelligence. Yes it's only a movie, but I know that somewhere out there people read into stuff like this creating ""alternative"" websites and Facebook memes that spread wacko rubbish all about (like we only use 10% of our brains). But maybe I'm wrong, because when I truthfully look back at my experience of watching Lucy, I get the sense that I was indeed only using 10% of my brain, or maybe that's all I was left with.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A thought-provoking, fun, entertaining sci-fi action film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3075128/?ref_=tt_urv","YJLcool","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34627686/?ref_=tt_urv","25 August 2014","First and foremost, Lucy isn't exactly the typical sci-fi action film that you would expect. The film shares many similarities with Limitless, Watchmen, The Matrix, The Tree of Life, Her and Transcendence. The film has a slightly misleading neuroscience premise that's based on the age-old, silly '10% of brain' myth that most humans use only 10% (or less) of their brain capacity. In actual fact, humans use nearly 100% of their brains in various ways...with many parts of our brain are not accessed consciously but rather subconsciously most of the time. However, humans never actually use 100% of their cerebral capacity consciously at the same time.The film is basically a story about a woman who is being forced to work as a drug mule manage to 'unlock' her entire brain capacity, consciously at the same time and gain exceedingly powerful physical and mental abilities after a packet of a newly-developed synthetic drug called ""CPH4"" breaks inside of her body. However, her body becomes highly unstable and starts to disintegrate due to the limitation of the human body and she needs more and more of the drug to sustain herself. The film asks thought-provoking 'what ifs' questions that are meaningful, provocative and worthy of our attention: What if the synaptic networks of our brain are so perfectly connected that we are capable of transmit more information at one time? What if we have access to all our motory functions, deepest memories and knowledge in fractions of a second? What if we are capable of using 100% of our cerebral capacity, consciously at the same time (all regions of the brain are pushed to the limits and we are able to control the subconscious regions of the brain)? Most importantly, what would happen if a person eventually gains complete control/mastery of elementary/subatomic particles that exist in the quantum realm?The film gives some rather clear answers that may seem absurd, nonsensical or silly to many, but some of them actually makes perfect sense if you think about it carefully. However, it is true to say that the film borrowed a few scientific principles (the basics of quantum mechanics and brain functions) and embellished them a bit for entertainment purposes. At first, the person acquires various enhanced physical and mental capabilities: perfect marksmanship, extreme agility, instantaneous reflexes, fast absorption of knowledge, immunity to pain and fear...and subsequently, telepathy, telekinesis, the ability to interpret/decipher/control various electromagnetic waves, atemporal and able to perceive time in a non-linear perspective, clairvoyance, quantum teleportation across space-time continuum and matter or energy manipulation.In short, the film is actually a mixture of facts and fiction. Some parts of the film do require a fair amount of suspension of disbelief from audiences as the writer/director has taken some creative liberties with its grand and rather ambitious sci-fi premise (Besson has admitted that this film is a lot more fiction than science). Although some of the main lead's abilities look downright silly and ludicrous, they're actually quite new and imaginative.While all facts are not necessarily 'true'; some fiction are not entirely lies either. Just that the 'world' around us behaves like so, we tend to perceive it like so. This doesn't mean that in other parts of the Universe, the same rules apply. While some people might find it hard to understand, all things, including living beings, consist of matter which has mass and each of them occupy a space-time dimension. We are bounded by the laws of motion and gravity. We are our own observer as time is relative while we're moving through space-time. Although the film's premise is not horrible or completely illogical, the execution is rather sloppy at places. The film shows the evolution of all living things on this planet by cutting in various shots of nature or Universe. Unfortunately, all these pieces just don't fit together nicely and seems rather out of place. There are numerous plot contrivances to allow characters to perform a certain action just to move the plot forward. There's no character development and backstory. The characters in the film don't have any significant emotional attachment to any other person on the screen.Despite its shortcomings in characterization and plot, Scarlett Johansson managed to pull out a great performance to carry the film. Her panic shaking as she cries and begs for her life when she meets Mr.Jang for the first time or even when she wakes up after heavy sedation feels real and truly gives the feeling that she's in peril. Later on, when she is able to access her deepest memories and cry profusely during the phone conversation with her mum, it clearly shows her character's vulnerability. But as Lucy rapidly evolves, her lack of expression shows that she is gradually losing her emotions and humanity. It shows that she has truly become transcendent and no longer has any petty human concerns. On the other hand, Choi Min-sik done a great job as the merciless, frightening Korean drug kingpin, Mr.Jang. His presence on screen shows that he's not the man you would want to mess with. Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman doesn't have much to do with his character other than delivering exposition for the audience to know more about the premise.In my opinion, this is by no means a terrible film, it's rather fast- paced, thought-provoking and entertaining. The purpose of science fiction is to seek answers for big important questions, to pique your interest or curiosity to further question, to find the truth and making sense of the world around us. This film succeeds in this aspect, despite its flaws. I believe that you'll appreciate this film more if you're willing to make an effort to take a step further to ponder and think, seek answers to extract the facts included in the film.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/08","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I try not to compare this movie to Luc Besson's earlier work, as it makes him seem to repetitive, and he is a good film maker, although it's hard to call his work purely original when the influences are so obvious. I would compare this film to Transcendence, and in comparison, this film has better ideas, however the execution of Wally Pfister was much better considering he worked with Christopher Nolan and Lucy feels like it was made by someone trying to be Christopher Nolan. There are things which Luc Besson does in this film, which are extremely French for a mainstream movie, and certain aspects don't feel right, mainly the percentages which display periodically throughout the film. If Wally Pfister and Luc Besson switched movies, Lucy would've looked the way Luc Besson wanted it to, and Transcendence would have been interesting, with cheesy dialogue which only a Frenchmen would write.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","The more ""Lucy"" stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3066912/?ref_=tt_urv","RyanCShowers","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19043679/?ref_=tt_urv","9 August 2014","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSEarlier this week I updated my daily attire with new glasses. ""Lucy"" is the first movie I saw since the transition between spectacles. Not only did I feel as if I was watching a movie with new eyes, but the film showed me something that I have never seen before. The undeniable fact of ""Lucy"" is its ingenuity, but be warned, it is a polarizing experience.Though I hardly find it as trend-setting as some suggest, feminism is embedded deeper within the film than the drugs are planted in Lucy's stomach. The explicit female empowerment almost becomes cheeky satire, such as when Lucy's love interest addresses his expendable nature in the plot, but her response insinuates the best use of his existence is to kiss her while she fights the bad guys. (Women Studies professors across the country will be giddy after seeing ""Lucy"".) It's incorrect to pretend as if females have not led science fiction/genre films before, especially films that acquired a lucrative gross at the box office. Though Johnasson's Lucy is only a descendant of people like Ellen Ripley, this film's success could turn the tide away from the frequency of male dominated action thrillers.The first twenty-five minutes of ""Lucy"" are unbearable. The film's opening moments begin with calm images over Johansson's voice, whispering ideas emblematic of evolution, but that lasts for only moments. The story plunges its viewer into an obnoxiously directed, jarringly edited, and bombastically scored chaos. It would be acceptable if someone were to walk out of ""Lucy"" during its introductory scenes, even if they would miss the fun surprises to be had later in the film. During the crucial, plot-setting scene, Director Luc Besson interweaves shots of a cheetah killing its prey into the sequence, a pompous move that sinks ""Lucy"" to its lowest point. It's almost as if Besson was testing his audience through endurance experiments during the first 25 minutes, before getting to a film that wasn't actually that bad.The quality transition from act one to act two and three is one of the most drastic in recent memory. ""Lucy"" began as a discomforting experience, but something happens after the dust settles from the storm of act one. The material is given the space it needs to breathe, Besson takes his dead weight foot off the gas pedal, and ""Lucy"" begins to fly. In the second two thirds of the film, the tone is infused with real emotion, campy fun, and soothing tranquility. Besson relinquishes his domineering approach seen in the earlier scenes and lets the erroneous ideas speak for themselves. The film concludes with a sensational montage that exposes the radical ambition behind ""Lucy"".For however disproportionate the film itself becomes, the one constant is Scarlett Johansson's drilling performance. Johansson can add ""Lucy"" to her string of hits recently because in this role she shows emotion in the most melodramatic ways I've ever seen from her as an actress. In addition, she builds a grounded, cold state of omnipotence in later scenes of the film, creating a nice emotional range within the movie and the character.""Lucy"" has ideal pacing and storytelling methods, clocking in its running time at 89 minutes. Sure, the introduction was a bit disorienting in its eagerness to jump immediately into the rising action, but that's a forgettable flaw once the running time minutes begin to rack up. It comes and goes swiftly and pragmatically, and maybe that's something future films should try to emulate, in addition to the female dominance. The more ""Lucy"" stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.* * * out of * * * *6.9/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Alas, the two have collaborated on a movie that's truly cool and exciting until it descends into stupidity. Besson's directing significantly out-paces his writing in this one.The premise is familiar axiomatic science. Humans only use about 10% of our brain capacity, leaving zillions of neural pathways, with all their unknown potential capabilities, in storage. What if we could use more, or even all of it? What information and collective memories might we access? What physical and mental powers might emerge - perhaps ranging somewhere between superhero and deity? Those prospects are particularly relevant, since Johansson has played the former, and co-star Morgan Freeman the latter in better movies.Johansson's character is a college student dating the wrong guy in Taipei. Gangsters force her into serving as a mule for a new designer drug they'll sell in Europe. When the package they plant in her belly bursts, it expands her mind to the max. Payback and other deployments of these enhancements before the drug overwhelms her drive the plot and its hectic pace. Several sequences show Besson at his best, including one in which Johansson drives through Paris like another Jason Statham.As to the rest, there are two possibilities. Either Besson didn't know how to get his cast out of the situation he created, settling for a jumble of splashy, acid-trip array of computer effects that fail to sync with his title character. Or the upper limit of my 10% is so far below his that I've missed the point and should have given this a higher rating. If you go, the call is yours.","5 out of 21 found this helpful.

She hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (Morgan Freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a Paris police captain (Amr Waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant Asian mob boss (Min-sik Choi).It should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (Don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. There were two of these in the mid-90s, ""Powder"" (1995) and ""Phenomenon"" (1996). They're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while ""Powder"" reached for greatness and got a finger in. Francis Ford Coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's ""Youth Without Youth,"" a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include an entertaining story.""Lucy"" is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. ""Lucy"" includes the mindfood of Coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. As such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). On top of this, ""Lucy"" is stylish and ""hip,"" whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizzazz.Some complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. Take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. Viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. Or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? They're, in essence, running away from reality.What's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. Lol, just kidding. (Or am I?)In regards to Lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other films noted above, I've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. For instance, about seven years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. The potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I awoke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow-motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.Less spectacular is something that I experience every day with my wife: One of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, ""I was thinking the exact same thing."" What's going on? We're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. What if we developed this further? Other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge."" Although they're exaggerated in the film, they're REAL.""Lucy"" is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to GROW UP. As Lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time ""partying"" and pursuing a ""cute guy with nice buns"" (or however she puts it). Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their PURPOSE for living. Whatever happened to ""All things in moderation""? The beginning of the movie shows that Lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she GREW UP.My praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I agree with every jot and tittle. It's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. Secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything? Is that even healthy?Needless to say, I love ""Lucy""!The film doesn't wear out its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in Taiwan, France and a German airport.GRADE: A","24 out of 43 found this helpful.

It's definitely a movie worth viewing but I don't think it really captures the imagination like the first ""The matrix"", for example, nor does it get as trippy as the end of ""2001"". The plot of the movie revolves around an American tourist - the titular character, played by Scarlett Johansson - who is duped into becoming a drug mule for a nasty Asian drug syndicate. Due to her being assaulted by one of the syndicate's goons, the drug is released into her body, giving her extraordinary powers. Lucy now has her chance to get revenge on the syndicate. On the level of a revenge movie, the movie also fails to deliver (as it did with its ""trippy"" aspect).The high concept of the movie is the premise of: what would happen if humans could use more than 10% of their brain? Lucy creeps closer to a figure of 100%, as the screen constantly reminds you. Now, I'm not sure where the figure of ""10%"" is pulled from, but I'll be so bold as to predict that someone attaining 100% brain capacity will...not in any way resemble Lucy's personification of this feat! In other words, her abilities are somewhat implausible and the movie comes across as more science fantasy than sci-fi. However, I do get the impression that the movie mixes actual science facts (or provisional facts, if you will), with just pure, escapist fantasy.Performance wise, I found Scarlett's representation early on (pre-drug effects) to be a bit ""Laverne & Shirley"" like...although I haven't actually seen that TV show...just brief clips. I.e. she seems sort of working class...Brooklyn (?). Like the movie, I didn't find that she created a sense of excitement for the concept. Morgan Freeman also plays a scientific expert. Again, his performance didn't really grab me. So, from my point of view, whilst Scarlett and Morgan being int he film helped to get it sold, I personally wouldn't have minded had the cast been complete unknowns. Morgan pretty much does what he's been doing for years in these kinds of roles...quietly oh so Morgan. I did enjoy the amusing performance of...- this site bills him as ""The limey""! - Julian Rhind-Tutt.The movie itself is jokey at times (as with ""The limey""), amusing, dark, violent and fantastic (as in hard to believe). At the start of my review, I mentioned ""Aesop's fables"". By that I mean that the frequent juxtaposition of shots of animals in the movie serve to provide a moral lesson for the bind that Lucy is about to find herself in. Some may be put off by this random juxtaposition of film.If I had any other issues with the logic of the movie, one might be the scene where Lucy meets her namesake. It made me think that perhaps the world that our Lucy lives in might have been changed by that meeting.Some interesting titbits from the end-credits:* Oddly, there is a ""Special thanks"" to Monsieur Hulot! Guessing that the director doesn't take these things all to seriously!* I enjoyed the music at the end of the movie...was unsure if it was one song or me. I particularly like the song that plays last in the end credits. I thought that that might have been by Blur's Damian Alburn (""Sister Rust""), but it turns out to have been by Roary, with a song called ""God's whisper"", which I'm not sure is even mentioned in the end credits. He's a new artist...not even on Wikipedia yet!As I say, it's an odd but interesting movie that is well worth seeing, but doesn't have a big pay off if you are after a 'straight' sci-fi movie, 'trip' movie or revenge movie. If you like screen violence/fighting/car chases etc., that's all there too. In fact, on reflection, the anti-climactic 'fight' scene with Lucy up against a bunch of syndicate goons is amusing for the way that it deflates boyish fantasies of revenge.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

I liked Nikita, though I had some issues with the plot holes that in my mind come to signify Besson's writing. It was even more of a problem with the 5th Element, where pseudo philosophic babbling was added to the mix not to mention tons of pretentiousness. The truck on which Besson's obsession carries him is moving forward always advancing, unfortunately it doesn't advance into good movie making, it's simply gets more pretentious and more dependent on his pseudo philosophic babble. Besson has all the making of a good director. He has a very good visual perception, which he always translate well to the screen. He has a good eye for actors and even more so for actresses Anne Parillaud, Milla Jovovich and Natalie Portman owe him a lot, the last two launched their cinema career on his films. And all his talent as director is getting him into poorer and poorer results, because he insists on writing his own scripts. Many directors do it with remarkable outcome Luc Besson doesn't. He must have someone else beside him to tell him that things don't make sense, someone with an influence. It seems to me that he simply doesn't care about plot logic he might even think his ""philosophic"" bits are deep and meaningful - sorry it's not the case. It rings hollow and pretentious (I know I used this word before - no other word describes it better).And so, amazing performances by Scarlett Johansson, and Min-sik Choi, and some solid acting by Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked, on top of some brilliant action scenes and some real beautiful cinematography, are all getting wasted because by the end of the film the utter stupidity of it all covers everything else. What's supposed to be deep and thought provoking is so empty and ridiculous I found myself laughing a desperate bitter laugh instead of being excited or thrilled.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, it is enjoyable if you have nothing else to do for 90 mins.The film gets off to bad start with its premise. It is a complete myth that we only use 10% our brain. So its attempt to ground a matrix-style movie in reality falls at the first hurdle. Also, the premise was used in Limitless so the repetition is a bit tedious.Morgan Freeman's job seems purely to establish the bad premise and doddering around, not contributing to the story.People will argue over Johansson's performance over the course of the film but she does a good job with weak material. Some of the effects and stunts are very enjoyable. Transcendence was better and most people didn't like that. This movie is worth a watch if you are in any way a sci-fi fan.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Besson's latest concept actioner goes the abstract, philosophical route","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3133456/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","30 November 2014","For the last decade, Luc Besson has been among the most reliable producers, writers and directors making thrilling, mindless entertainment, which makes ""Lucy,"" a film about a woman accessing 100 percent of her brain capacity, somewhat ironic. In all seriousness, however, ""Lucy"" is a departure from the filmmaker's gritty, revenge-driven track record of late, though not necessarily a noticeable improvement.Like most of Besson's films, ""Lucy"" is a straightforward, concept-driven action movie: Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American in Taiwan, gets kidnapped by a wealthy organized crime boss (Min-sik Choi, of ""Oldboy"" fame) who stuffs a package of a new synthetic drug in her body for smuggling purposes, but the plan takes a turn when the package ruptures and Lucy begins experiencing its mind-enhancing effects. Consuming knowledge and experience cell growth at an unprecedented rate, she seeks to turn the tables on her captors.But while ""Lucy"" is a pretty clear-cut concept, the plot is rather messy. As Lucy begins to unlock more and more of her brain and power, she understandably becomes more than just revenge- driven and becomes obsessed with sharing her knowledge with Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). The script ends up being 50 percent philosophical and theory-based, and it seems Besson is more fascinated with this idea of humans accessing their full brain capacity and what we would learn about our existence than he is with crafting a compelling story.What results is a film that talks an interesting and intelligent game but plays out in somewhat dumb fashion. In other words, ""Lucy"" is easily the most thought-provoking film Besson has made in the last 10 years at least, but it ranks behind many of those recent films in terms of being a compelling watch. Eventually, the concept of what's happening to Lucy's brain flies off the handle and we can no longer understand the science or theory behind it. The movie gets abstract and flat-out trippy in a way we haven't seen from Besson since ""The Fifth Element."" At times you have to wonder if he was watching too much Terrence Malick when he made this one.Johansson, of course, makes for an eternally watchable leading lady. Even when Besson injects a few emotion-driven moments that feel completely out of place, she makes the most out of them, as if somewhere inside the hollow vessel of her character is a multi-dimensional person. Even the casting of Freeman as the professor, who exists exclusively to explain what's happening to Lucy, adds a certain legitimacy to the film To Besson's credit, he manages to create enough thought-provoking moments to make ""Lucy"" feel like a smart and unique film. There are some big ideas within this concept and though he mostly scratches the surface, he manages to create enough of a hook to pull the audience into the movie. Although it plays out so differently compared to films like ""Taken"" and ""The Transporter"" series, Besson again proves to be innovative as far as surface-level entertainment goes.It's also tremendously helpful that ""Lucy,"" like most of Besson's films, is short. At less than 90 minutes, it doesn't toil about long enough to let its faults drag it down. For everything it's missing, it's still efficient. That's the kind of low-risk approach that most flawed movies could stand to benefit from and that Besson had proved time and time again to be pretty reliable in delivering.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I've been a fan of Besson for ages, and I find his movies to be different and intense at times.Leon the Profession was the start of being a massive fan of Luc Besson, and overall he is my definitive favorite director. Taxi and The Fifth Element just added to my fandom. His movies are so different, well-made, and always a highlight.Lucy is no exception, and if you're a sci-fi buff this certainly is sublime. It starts off like many Hollywood movies, but it just goes wild, forwards, and upwards from there.Besson often bring France into his movies, and it's nice to get a change of scenery compared to, more or less, everything Hollywood spits out.I really hope there'll be a follow-up to Lucy, but I'm afraid of how it would be. Maybe this one is more than enough?","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

I hear a lot of people complaining about the science, but that's where the fiction comes in! I think we all know by now we don't use 10% of our brain (Or cerebral capacity if you want to get anal) and I think the people that made the movie also knew this. It's just a matter flicking a switch in your mind that in this reality, in this fictional film, this is true. The plot was quite simple and compact. Nothing too complicated and it was quite easy to follow. Not a great masterpiece with convoluted intertwined story lines or deep characters. Which made the movie better in my opinion. This shouldn't be your nail biting shoe squeaking adventure. It's good action and just regular old science fiction with a hint of slight sarcasm towards the science field. Somewhere I got the feeling that the main point of this story was that we as a species have become so full of ourselves that we think we know everything as fact.Scientists usually say they love to be proved wrong but mostly they love it more when they are right. Maybe the point of the movie was to show that we could be wrong about everything.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I didn't even bother wasting my time watching the last 10 or 15 minutes. It was just so ridiculous and absurd. I had no real knowledge of the movie before seeing it, which is the way I usually like it so I have no preconceived ideas. But as I said before, the more I watched, the more ridiculous the movie became and the less I liked it. It's the whole thing, it's Stupid with a capital S. There will be people who will enjoy the movie. Those who can accept the absurdity presented then it will probably be great. But for me some of the concepts presented in the movie were just something I couldn't get my mind around and accept. It became so weird towards the end I couldn't even bare to watch another second. My thumb hurriedly stumbled across the remote searching for the stop key with all the finesse of an elephant on ice skates in an attempt to end the absurdity as fast as was humanly possible.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The movie lacked passion, creativity, and to be honest, i couldn't wait to get out of the theater.

It is, in fact, a movie that manages to be existential while not being preachy, and super-exciting at the same time.Lucy is the wrong person at the wrong time (we never find out her last name). Her shady boyfriend lands her in the hellride she's in for, and as an experimental drug explodes inside her, her brain capacity begins to increase. She uses her newfound abilities to get out of her predicament and escape her captors, but what she does from there may surprise you.Right from the start, ""Lucy"" asks questions. For a while, it even segues between Lucy's story and that of Professor Norman (played by Morgan Freeman), who's trying to theorize what could happen if humans could use more parts of their brain. Eventually, the two characters will meet.""Lucy"" is very exciting. Right from the go, we are with this innocent woman who wants to escape the drug cartel who capture her and intend to use her as a carrier. Scarlett Johansson is amazing, growing from the terrified young woman to the increasingly supernatural warrior with her own mission in mind. Min-sik Choi is terrifying as the revolting Mr Jang. At times you might feel that Lucy's a bit lenient on him and his men, but her ordeal changes her. I hesitate to give away more but the finale of this movie really makes you think. The movie's also very inventively told, with intercutting shots of things like animals used to thematic effect, especially as we realize in what danger Lucy is, and the interstitial indicators of the percentage level of her brain function.I'm not surprised that Lucy already has a below-7 score, because it's a science-fiction thriller that asks questions. It's an intelligent movie that takes you along on a thrilling ride, helmed by a wonderful actress and a visionary director.","42 out of 82 found this helpful.

The main problem is that the writing is terrible, the characters are not relatable at all and that I had fever dreams with a more cohesive plot than this abomination of a script.That's all the more disappointing as Lucy doesn't start out too bad. The first 20 minutes or so would have provided a good setup for a crime thriller or action flick, but after that it all goes down the drain. Scarlett Johansson's and Morgan Freeman's talents are totally wasted here. They hopefully had a word with their agents after this.

Probably it's a straight-ahead ""summer"" movie which could be (awkwardly) categorized as an action thriller ...or maybe it's an attempt to break new ground ...or maybe it's a massive tongue-in-cheek send-up of current multiplex fare. Although it has sci-fi elements, focusing too much on the sci-fi aspect will be disappointing. It's a bit more thoughtful than most ""action thrillers"", but just a bit; certainly it's not something to look forward to sinking your intellectual teeth into.It's reminiscent of many other films. Some that come to mind are ""Fantastic Voyage"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Tron"" (the original one), ""Chunking Express"" (the first half), ""Baraka"", ""The Matrix"", ""The Tree of Life"" (the abstract part), and ""Home"". Originality isn't the point - taking good ideas (sometimes even actual footage) from lots of places and pushing them even further is.Before going on, let me directly address the premise that ""we only use 10% of our brains"". In a completely objective world, this idea would be no sillier than the idea of telepathically controlling a suit of armor which projects force fields. But, probably because of the history of the 10% idea, right now many people recoil from it. Don't. Leave your scientific/analytic hat at home. If you insist on getting hung up on the ""un-reality"" of the 10% idea, you're certain to not enjoy this film. (The film even jokes a bit with this idea, labeling a U.S. college student studying abroad as using not ""10%"" of her brain power but only ""1%"":-) I understand why many professional reviews are tepid. The science is somewhere between implausible and laughable. The philosophy is sophomoric. And the ending can feel unsatisfying, even abrupt. That's partly because the logic motivating the sequence of events, even though actually quite simplistic, can be hard to follow on the first viewing. And it's partly because it's pretty hard to ratchet the ""climax"" even higher when the volume has already been up all the way to 10 for so long. In other words, judged only by small-screen criteria, the movie is indeed mediocre. It doesn't help either that the movie doesn't fit all that neatly into any existing ""genre"", so professional reviewers are uncertain what to do with it.The acting is first-rate. It's not just pretty faces; the characters are engrossing. The main character's development from quite emotional at the beginning to completely flat at the end comes through very well. It might sound like a downer that for the lead role Angelina Jolie was replaced by Scarlett Johansson. In fact it was most likely an improvement. One's reaction to Jolie kicking ass might have been ""again?"", but when Johansson kicks ass one really sits up and takes notice. The technical aspects of the shooting must have been outrageous: there are some outdoor scenes that appear to move far beyond any imaginable boundaries of a ""location"" or ""set""; some perspective shots that make you think you're either flying or high; there's excellent wire work where you'd never expect it; and it's quite difficult to separate what's a stunt, an in-camera trick., compositing, CGI-enhanced, or full CGI (for example the outrageous car crashes that you would think must be CGI are in fact stunts). But where the movie really shines is as a visual spectacle (or perhaps as a primo example of ""style""). Go with the same mindset you'd use to watch a movie with cartoon characters in a cartoon story. Hang loose. And just let the images wash over you.There's some of the best nature photography I've seen. There's plenty of blood and gun-fu and random deaths (but that's not the whole movie). The extended car chase scene is the wildest I've ever seen bar none. There's simulated micro-photography (things like cells dividing). And there's simulated macro-photography (things like interplanetary nebulae). There are shots inside airplanes that quickly switch from things you've always dreamed of to matter disintegration. There's improbable mixing of different contexts (for example a woman in a black dress sitting in an office chair, which in turn is hovering on the surface of a swamp). There's an epic battle inside the Sorbonne. There's wide scenic vistas. There are famous landmarks. Time sometimes speeds up, and sometimes slows down, and sometimes runs backward, showing us both fully realized cityscapes a hundred years ago and the birth of the earth and moon. And so much more. And the extremely rapid editing shoehorns all of it into less than two hours.I admit I had to see it twice to fully grasp it. The first time the story was a bit jumbled, and just letting all the fantastic images wash over me was everything. The second time though the story was fully coherent (if rather simplistic). My suggestions are to use all the movie and TV reading skills you've got, and to not look too deeply for a complex story or philosophy. And if you still don't ""get"" the story, don't worry about it, just sit back and enjoy the visuals.","45 out of 90 found this helpful.

This movie provides a glimpse into what would happen if a person could unlock his mind's full potential. The story starts in a middle of interaction between Lucy and a man she has been seeing, where he is trying to convince here to deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang. She ends up having no choice and what seems like a simply job gets Lucy involved in a horrible deal where she is turned into a drug mule for and extremely powerful drug. Things even take a turn for the worse when she is physically abused leading to the drug-bag in her stomach to rupture and a large dose is released into her bloodstream. Only not killing her, this dosage also causes her to be able to access bigger and bigger part of her brain – with drastic consequences. The featured cast is pretty interesting, as well as the storyline, however after a decent start the film completely loses its grip. Lucy doesn't have to go through any learning process to know how to control her new set of skills and powers – which was a bit of a let- down. Instead her journey thenceforth is a smooth sailing with minimum of emotions and excitement. There are a number of good looking scenes, but they do not come close to make up for the blandness, hence it is very hard to get invested in the story. Additionally the ending is partly given away early on which further reduces the excitement. This action film includes a strangely large amount of stock footage which really is totally unnecessary. Scarlett Johansson puts in a good performance; she has the extraordinary look a person for this role needs and is pretty believable as this supernatural human being. Morgan Freeman's role is a lot less interesting and is mainly used to explain what is happening to Lucy when she is not on-screen. Although Freeman has the look of a professor, he surely didn't feel like one to me on this occasion. The first part of the film is enjoyable but after that it just goes downhill, being extremely bland and stupid in so many ways (which is kind of funny given the brainpower of the main character). I cannot recommend Lucy – 5/10.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

At first it annoyed me because how hard can it be to do just a little more research before writing a ""scientific"" talk in the movie. He didn't even have the basics down in some parts. He clearly doesn't know how the human brain works and that's just embarrassing for the movie imo.I laughed when Morgan Freeman didn't know how to answer what would happen if someone was at ""100%, brain capacity"" but somehow had a very detailed answer for what would happen if it was at 40%... Sorry dude, but how would you know what happens at 40% either, information is being just pulled out of his ass.THAT BEING SAID, i was able to get past that because the movie itself was pretty fun and entertaining and frankly that is hard to find these days.If you can get past some of the ridiculousness, like some of her abilities that just don't make sense, you will enjoy it. It's best to stop asking question and trying to apply logic when watching this film. I learned pretty early in the movie not to take it seriously.If you just want a fun watch or something to even laugh at, i highly recommend it. If you are expecting a cerebral movie, move on and don't waste your time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Then I was surprised by her range and acting ability. My opinion of her has changed radically. Morgan Freeman is always good; and he is good in this film as well. The story of a street girl who becomes the smartest person on the planet is entertaining, and the production values, although a bit violent, are first-rate. Some of the characters (like the Asian drug dealers) are stereotypes and cartoonish, but we forgive that because the general story line is very intelligent.

It just felt strange - If we use 100% of our brains, we become like gods?What happens if a cat or a chicken uses 100% of it's brain? Boggles the mind.The movie ""Limitless"", which also speculated on using near 100% of the brain, felt more believable and interesting. As the main character increased in power, there were limitations and trade-offs. As such, there was a compelling challenge and catharsis involved.

I can suspend belief in just about any sci-fi movie but a movie so blatantly moronic I actually felt tortured watching it.During my undergrad I dabbled in neuroscience and even philosophy. The movie was just scene after scene of beautiful putrid garbage that spits in the face of biology and physics. The greatest issue was that the storyline was thinner than a surgeons scalpel. It was essentially Scarlett acting melodramatic and constantly changing her power levels (which didn't correlate to the 'percentage' whatsoever). The most adorable thing was the 'writers' attempt to bring up a fundamental existential question. Can someone give the idiot writers a joint so he can at least match the theories of 13yo stoners? I've never actually seen a movie with a weaker premise, I wish I was making that up. I really can't review this much further, my brain is still numb after being subdued to this (I had to stay till the end because of friends). Please do yourself a favor, if you have beyond high school knowledge in biology and physics stay far, far away. Don't fund this idiocy.

It's NOT ""Limitless"", and NOT ""Trancendence"".. but it takes a bit of premise from these two films and not only DOES IT RIGHT, but takes it to the MOON!!! ""Lucy"" is NOT a far-fetched fantasy with a lengthy, talkative, or wheel spinning plot.. but an ACTION-SciFi-Thriller, that has more than a tinge of realistic probability to it and Packs a Punch! Science, theoretical physics, string theory, etc etc etc. Scarlett delivers in a way that will leave your curious mind enthralled.. in a way that a movie like ""Star Trek"" cannot..why ? Because it takes you for a ride on a wave of realistic, human, possibilities.. It teases the curious mind with age old questions such as: ""What is time? What is life? and Who are we, or Where did we come from?"" and does it in a cool, quick, to the point way! Come on guys.. You couldn't get a more beautiful actress to play such kick-ass character. in a film with such a thought-provoking, interesting plot. Bottom line is this..

Morgan Freeman, who appears in every film released, plays a smart guy who knows exactly how the ability to Scarlett Johansson.The film starts in a very gritty scenario that resembles his first Hollywood style film, ""La Femme Nikita"". Scarlett Johansson, who you think could be Marilyn Monroe's kid, gets in trouble with dangerous drug dealers. There are shocking moments of terror and violence that Besson has a flair for, and doesn't disappoint here. Feeling a sense of educating the audience as if a National Geographic documentary was directed by Micheal Bay, the frenetic editing wants desperately to make us connect with something deeper. But ultimately the story seems just interested in giving us a series of flashy sequences that feature Scarlett Johansson. Anytime Scarlett Johansson leaves the screen, even Morgan Freeman can't save the vacant space where a more coherent story should be.It kind of reminded me of the last ""Jack Ryan"" film. The filmmakers have a checklist of requirements for a run-of-the-mill action thriller. Car Chase - check. Fight scene on the walls - check. Slowing down time - check. The audience reaction to the imagery-filled climax was that this supposed deeper imagery came out of nowhere, and didn't really fit what looks and feels like a Scarlett Johansson vehicle.But I really like Scarlett Johansson. I like watching her on the big screen. The material certainly has potential. But so did Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity and Johnny Mnemonic, etc. The material outside Scarlett Johansson is so weak in it's structure, the slightest puff of wind would cause it to collapse. Does the movie play self-aware and wink at the audience with a ""we know this is silly but just go along with it""? Not if it thinks it can take itself seriously with the animal documentary footage. So, no, not meant to be silly. Did I enjoy myself? Sure OK, this was a flashy but digestible action thriller. But if I had the choice, I would save the money and checkout Scarlett Johansson on DVD or streaming. But you may notice I have mentioned Scarlett Johansson twelve times now. So for some people that is enough to see this movie.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Luc Besson is well known for directing Leon, however I told myself I am not going to watch another Leon or The Fifth Element from the director who made amazing movies 20 years ago. Back to Lucy, alongside all Sci-Fi movies where all talk about one thing in total, Lucy opens a new horizon in telling who we are. Prometheus, for instance, nicely developed the idea of our origins. But Lucy is different. With taking some notes of religions and what it has been written on the Holy book or Quran, you can feel our origin, you can feel the source of creation. That's why I love this movie. It's nice, the plot is easy.

I've seen many movies with characters that are both heroic and monstrous.I think ""Lucy"" is the only movie I've seen in which we're asked to accept a monster as a hero even though she is consistently monstrous and never once heroic.The only theme I can find in this movie is that, in the fight to survive, might makes right and the lives of less gifted or less powerful people are disposable. The monster becomes immortal at the end of the story, which is ambiguous at best - on the one hand she is no longer rampaging through the city streets endangering public safety, but at the same time she has never shown any ethical concern whatsoever for anyone's well-being but her own.We are told to likewise pursue individual immortality, apparently with utter disregard for the needs and integrity of others. Immortality in this case is defined entirely in terms of biological and intellectual information - moral and emotional information is completely neglected. In this light, the ambiguity of the ending is terrifying. This could be a very successful monster movie if writer/director Luc Besson had given any indication at all that he was aware of the terrifying moral and ethical implications of his story. Unfortunately he seems to think Lucy is far from being a monster, but is in fact an ideal woman: smart, beautiful, powerful, and devoid of empathy or righteousness.6/10 for its depth and deftness of storytelling","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I'm not trashing this film simply because the assumption that humans only use 10% of their brain is erroneous; that wasn't an issue I had here. I just found it hard to engage with the character of Lucy, the philosophical themes explored here were silly, and the entire premise simply bored me. There were some similarities between this film and Johnny Depp's Transcendence where despite some solid visual styles the philosophical themes hurt the overall narrative. Scarlett Johansson delivers another solid performance, but her character really didn't work for me as well as former Besson leading ladies such as Milla Jovovich in The Fifth Element and Natalie Portman in Leon. Perhaps it was all the philosophical and scientific mumbling that ended up hurting the narrative story for me. However I do have to give Besson credit for trying something different and taking risks because the film goes to unexpected places at times. I do feel that comparisons with 2001 are unfair. Some of the CGI didn't really work for me either, especially the one with the Neanderthal during the opening scene. Besson also experimented with the use of imagery that seemed to be taken from a National Geographic channel which overlapped with the narrative serving as an analogy, but those scenes felt forced and they also took me out of the film. This sci-fi film might have taken several steps to stand out from other formulaic movies by not following the standard structure of a genre film, but the result didn't really pay off. I felt as if Lucy was trying to be this sort of profound philosophical film, but it turned out to be fairly silly and incomprehensible. Perhaps it may be that I use less than 10% of my brain and therefor just didn't get it, but for my limited brain capacity Lucy wasn't worth my time or money. Scarlett Johansson has taken several risks in the past year delivering some very solid roles in films like Her, Under the Skin, and now Lucy. The risks seem to have payed off considering she is catching the attention of talented directors and I'm glad she isn't going for the easy roles in rom-coms or standard action flicks. Despite enjoying her performance, this film lost me halfway through it. I enjoyed the supporting cast as well. It was great to see Choi Min-sik (better known for his role in Oldboy) play the villain here although I wish he would have been given more screen time. Perhaps my favorite performance was that of Amr Waked who played the officer helping Lucy (or should I say simply riding along with her?). Besson switched the genre roles here as usually it is the other way around, where the male character is the one doing all the work and the female only riding along. Morgan Freeman might just be the weakest link in this film as he is the one responsible for all the scientific and philosophical blabbing going on (my least favorite thing about Lucy). For a film that tries to take itself seriously with profound themes about wasted human potential, there are way too many flaws involved. I understand that most of these flaws were needed as an excuse to introduce some of the action scenes which this film would have suffered without. There are some fun scenes like a car chase across Paris, but there isn't much more to this wacky film. For all the scientific rambling there is very little substance to Lucy despite its ambitions.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

But the good ones don't try to scientifically explain/justify it, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. Believing in the force is admission to the star-wars universe. But they don't tell you some story about how consuming only orange food will do that to you...This movie however is scientifically inaccurate, and does try to justify it with bogus science. Which means that a good portion of the movie you're listening to completely rubbish false science and you'll be going.. ""whhaaat?! no... Thats not how that works...."" I don't want to spoil the movie so I won't go into detail, but I'll give one example: there used to be this myth in the world that humans are only using 10% of their brain. The myth has since been debunked because maybe at 1 time only 10% is in use, but all of it is used at some point. It is like activation 100% of all muscles all the time doesn't make you stronger, but spastic, and will stop your heart because in fact you need to activate and then deactivate the muscles is order to pump.. some muslces are actually creating forces in opposite forces. The same is somewhat true of the brain, activating it 100% won't make you smarter, it will just activate every part of your body and mind, and it will be bad.. The movie makes a lot of big big big jumps from there i wont spoil for you, but if you hate scientific inaccurate EXPLANATIONS, you'll hate this movie.I really hated someone telling me absolute bullshit for most of the movie. It is as if the whole movie someone is telling you all of what is happening is possible because 4+2=10 and 4-1=0... That makes the whole explanation a waste of time because no one will believe it anyway, and will make everyone roll their eyes instead.Other then that the effects aren't bad, the actors are fine.

The CGI is like the cherry on the pie, with astonishing shots attempting to recreate the sight of the creation of the universe. I am astonished by the fact that this is something that could actually happen; Of course we are very much aware of the 'We use only 10% of our brain' theory being a myth, but I assume that the intention was to put it as if our current brain only uses 10% of its knowledge capacity, see it as if without the drug Lucy couldn't learn more than that 10%. I think that Lucy is a brilliant film everyone above 15 should watch, as it does have some gory violence and the drugs may have a bad impact on younger viewers.

(If you disagree, you're in desperate need of a total reality transplant.)What's deceptive about ""Lucy"" is that it's packed with pseudoscientific claptrap that some gullible, impressionable boneheads might actually believe. The main one is that tired old saw that we only use 10% of our brains. As someone who knows better, I'm here to tell you that that is COMPLETE BALDERDASH (a euphemism in place of the word I really have in mind). Every animal with a brain, including humans, uses ALL OF ITS BRAIN, ALL OF THE TIME. Don't fall for that fictitious claim about using only 10% of our brains. Why would organisms waste the energy necessary to keep all of our brain running if we didn't need it? There's also a lot of biobabble about evolution in ""Lucy,"" and ALL of it is wrong. The film, with all the garbage spewed about ""evolution,"" ignores one of the fundamental principles of evolution: An organism's energy balance is tightly controlled. Everything that isn't needed is gotten rid of. That's why the great apes and we humans don't have tails. That's why when we evolved lungs, we got rid of gills. In fact, if you want to name organs that can be both partly or wholly utilized, it's the lungs and the muscles, NOT the brain. At rest, you use only part of your lung capacity. At rest, you use only part of your muscle capacity. But you ALWAYS use ALL of your brain capacity, because that's how the brain is designed. If we only needed 10% of our brains, our brains would be only 10% of their size.So if you want to enjoy ""Lucy"" as pure fantasy, go ahead. Just don't fall for the nonsensical pseudoscience. It's. ALL. Wrong.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Saying that, Luc Besson has succeeded in the past with similar gambles such as Nikita. In this case we have Sci-fi and Nikita mixed together as we count up to an unintentionally drugged up Scarlet Johansen increasing in sensory powers.Chased by some conglomerate hoods, we have explosions and chases which in the usual Besson way are spectacular and exciting. Our lead is perfect in the role and is smart, sexy and convincing.However the problem is the story. Okay it's Sci-fi but it just stretches things too far to get too interested. The dialogue helps to give an interesting explanation of the pseudo science behind the film, but you don't need a degree to see the holes which hurts any credibility. The ending in particular seems to have been conjured up in an afternoon after a struggle to figure how to end it.Overall fine but didn't fully hit its target. Still though you'll enjoy it if you give it half a chance.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Good...now I've got that out of the way and cleared my soul I'll talk a bit about the film.It's Brilliant. Watch it. Have fun watching it, eat popcorn and drink fizzy drinks with it.Now what do I actually believe? Well, I'm pretty sure we don't use our brain to it's fullest capacity. If we did would we be able to do all the things Lucy was doing? No idea. But I don't care because I loved this film. It's fast, has a real buzz on it, and quite frankly to quote Metallica, ""Nothing else matters"".Brilliant. Brilliant Brilliant.On a side note, the human race will evolve. We've been doing it for a few years now. If we carry on at this rate we will acquire greater knowledge and wisdom. We will be able to do many of the things that Lucy did. Yes, it will look like magic but only to us.Have you ever had a conversation with your pets? Some-times you think they understand you but really they haven't got a clue.That's what meeting some-one like Lucy ( or an alien with super advanced technology ) would be like if we met them now. We'd be the pets.Awesome film.Watch it

Lucy is directed by Luc Besson and is starring Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman. At first sight this film could appear to look like Limitless, which is quite similar. This time again Luc Besson works his magic on a beautiful woman with her gun (Nikita, The Fifth Element, etc.). Scarjo is pretty good at that in the movie, as she quickly turns into a bad ass killer in the first act. Morgan Freeman's character is not that interesting, he has pretty much the same part as in Transcendence except that the film itself is better than Transcendence. Mr Jang starring Min-sik Choi is nothing more than an evil guy, killing people in cold blood, we don't really know more about him. However the movie is looking good, it is very well edited. There's a cool car chasing action scene, several very natural and fluid action scenes as well. I have a divided opinion on this film as on the one hand Lucy has some conventional action movie themes and on the other hand some too unconventional parts; it's dealing with smart things in a dumb way. It's like Luc Besson wanted to make cool things happen in a movie and he did it, but I don't really care about the plot and characters and where the story is going. We can't really like Lucy or relate to her as she doesn't encounter threatening situations, as she can access 100% of her brain capacity she becomes nearly invincible and as a protagonist nothing properly challenges her. It's entertaining but there's no tension as in an actual action movie.Overall Lucy looks good, there are great action sequences despite the fact that tension really isn't there it's entertaining if you're just seeking that. Prepare yourself; it's different and a little bit more ambitious that you may have thought it to be just by watching the trailer.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The story had so much potential but it wasn't given justice in this movie. The ending really felt rushed. I won't spoil it but this story deserved much more than a 90 minute movie.Also an unpopular opinion but the villain wasn't good. He didn't even felt threatening; I attribute this to his dialogues being purely in. Korean.

A few hours off from life. A break in the continuous hammering from reality which most of us endure daily, hourly, minute by minute. Lucy is an excellent escape. The end, almost spiritual, along with some of the wonderful pearls of wisdom that drop from Lucy's lips throughout this truly entertaining film alone were worth the ticket price. And as far as the ""myth"" that we only use 10% of our brain being a fallacy, I personally have met many, many people around the globe who made me wonder if they were even using 3% of theirs. So, true or not, the ""myth"" does make for a rollicking good time, supported by a truly entertainment value provided by Johannson, Freeman and a cast of unknowns (well, at least to me before this!) who all did their best to make a marvelous bit of celluloid.Go see it.

Really it's only true of people in Hollywood. Because this is just an entertainment piece, it doesn't bother me much. If it was something more pretentious, like an Aronofsky film, I would have a bigger problem with it. The movie is certainly watchable from beginning to end. I'd even say it's fun most of the way. But it never makes the most of its premise and even seems to give up trying relatively quickly. You have a character who can do pretty much anything but the things they have her do are mundane and the only threat to her they can come up with are angry drug dealers with guns. The ending is the default transcendental trip that every movie about humans evolving since 2001: A Space Odyssey has used a variation of. The most amusing part is where Lucy (Scarlett) meets Lucy (ape woman). But 'space baby' it is not. The use of the animal footage is the kind of stuff film school students do. Maybe it does have its pretentious moments. Scarlett Johansson's entertaining. The guy from Oldboy is fun but the character was really an unimpressive threat. Morgan Freeman's got new choppers. Good for him. Overall, it's an enjoyable but goofy film that shouldn't be taken too seriously.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

There is nothing in common with the direction of these three movies that stands out to me, only that they stand out as some of my least favorite watches over the past 5 years. Regardless of my dislike for Benson's work, here we have a movie that jumps into action immediately, but quickly devolves into a science fiction mishmash that really makes no sense. You are asked to accept something that is patently ridiculous. If as a viewer you are unable to accept that then the movie will be like a joke to you. If, however, you are able to accept the absurd premise the movie will be interesting but still unfulfilling.The ending is atrocious. The one thing Lucy had going for it through the first hour is its fast pace and the ending brings the action to a stand still and makes the viewer focus on the ridiculousness of the plot. Lucy is a fantastic failure of a movie that tries so hard to be deep but only comes off as ludicrous.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Also there was enough for the more intellectually oriented to think about and contemplate some of the scientific fantasy sci-fi aspects as they as well enjoy the movie for what it is. Do not expect the movie to be based on solid proved current scientific understandings with its premises or how such events come to occur; that is why it is a sci-fi fantasy. Saw so many complaints in reviews here and other sites about it not being 100% scientifically correct etc. Tralala...Too often many adults seemingly lose imagination and become rigid as they get stuck on technicalities and are only able to relate to their understandings which often is what they find comfort in and/or seem to just seek to show they know better and basically fault find in a seeming sad attempt to prove their intellectual superiority instead just allowing the mind to stay flexible and enjoy such genres as is. There are many free documentaries and as well free college lectures widely available on the web if you are seeking such; this genre if for enjoyment by many demographics with varied interest and skill levels.Not being mentally locked in is why kids often make profound observations on things about a issue that have been right before us but we adults seemingly have missed or can not see. This is why kids often have uncharacteristic insights that we adults often miss because we have lost contact with our own imagination or ability to look at things from differing perspectives and points of view as we have failed in keeping and nourishing an open imagination into and throughout adulthood. Guess that is why many new ideas, technologies or re-purposed old technologies and as well many key scientific discoveries occur by young people, if child or adult. That is why we must keep open flexible minds, learn to listen and not just hear and be open to what youth notes and support their understanding without causing them to lose their imaginations and creativity. Easier said than done, I know.Just enjoy; it is a sci-fi movie which is for fun as well some thought provoking aspects if you so choose to allow such or wish such. This movie is not going to win a Oscar; but hey it was okay and not a total waste of time and many seemed to enjoy the movie in the audience I was in from what I observed.Thanks and lets be nice to each other; life is cruel enough without any help from us in making is more hurtful, of which we should know better anyway...","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This film is complete - beautiful cinematography, great story, a gripping score and tension that crawls into you and won't let go. Fans of the Fifth Element will recognize the increasingly frenetic pacing and staccato use of scene cuts, as well as the gorgeous, flowing camera work and the use of visual allegory from Besson's previous projects. Old film tricks used in new ways serve to build the tension from the first frame to ""Lucy""'s final, shuddering climax. Elements of Leon The Professional and La Femme Nikita are present but feel more refined here, more sophisticated and deliver even more ""oomph"" to action fans. However, beyond what we know of Besson's previous work lies the truth of why ""Lucy"" is such a fantastic film and a true, ""must-see"". If you love sci-fi - It's an excellent rendition of a classic theme. If you love Scar Jo, she's never been better and again demonstrates the range of a true talent. But, if you love films - be you a student, an enthusiast or ""in the biz"" - you must see ""Lucy"". It is on of those rarest of works that will remind you of why you started loving movies in the first place. Rarely, have I been moved along, so urgently, by a film. Ushered swiftly into experiences I thought I knew, only to have revealed to me some new thought, or philosophical idea that I was heretofore unaware of. ""Lucy"" does this honestly and smart. At times I found myself enthralled by the ""Koyaanisqatsi""-like images - here used as a device for squeezing more tension out of a scene - not just for their intrinsic, artistic value. ""Lucy"" is blessed with musical scoring so subtle and powerful that, at times, I was unaware that I was breathing with the tempo of the film.You will watch it. You will discuss it. You will re-watch it. You will remember why you love movies and lament the fact that so few of them deliver what ""Lucy"" does. Thanks Luc.","41 out of 87 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Pseudoscience has never been so much fun!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3171595/?ref_=tt_urv","KnightsofNi11","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10398346/?ref_=tt_urv","27 January 2015","Let me start out this review by saying that I freaking love The Fifth Element and The Professional. Luc Besson was killing it in the 90's, and while he may have lost some steam in the 21st century I still couldn't help but get excited over his newest explosive action exploit, Lucy. Scarlett Johansson stars as the titular character, a girl who inadvertently gets mixed up in a drug smuggling ring that isn't smuggling any old drugs. She is forced to smuggle a new drug that heightens a person's ""cerebral capacity"" and when she is exposed to the drug she starts gaining all sorts of crazy abilities that she rightfully uses to kick ass and take names. Honestly I don't really know what her actual goal was, but plenty of people get to die in cool fashions along the way, and that makes for an action packed 90 minutes of super powered ScarJo, so how can I complain? Now, this movie centers around the idea that humans only use about 10% of their brain and it speculates what a person would be capable of if they could unlock all 100%. There had always been controversy over this theory and shortly after the movie came out, hell it might have even been before its release, this whole theory was disproved and smashed into fictional conjecture oblivion. Thus, it's really hard, nigh impossible, to take Lucy seriously. It takes a lot of scientific liberties and its attempts to explain things for the sake of the plot are mostly laughable. There is some seriously nutty pseudoscience being bounced around here, and at times it seems like they're making it up as they go along. But once you separate yourself from the silliness of the plot and just accept the absurd foundation on which this film is built, you'll start to have a lot more fun. It only takes Lucy about seven minutes to kick off the action so if you like explosions, gunfire, or martial arts then Lucy will have your attention pretty quickly. Besson might be a bit older and a bit less on point, but I can't deny the sonofabitch still knows how to put together a badass action sequence. Lucy gives us the smart, tension filled action set-pieces reminiscent of The Professional. It reminds us that we go to the movies to enjoy ourselves and not everything has to be so serious all the time. And for that I have the utmost respect for Lucy. A film based around such flimsy science is bound to have a swathe of issues, and Lucy is no exception. But the issues here you can really just chalk up to the conceit of movies. Sure, the dialogue is cheesy, transparent, and comically expository at times. The performances are good, but you have to take them with a block of cheese. Johansson is fun as the super powered ass kicking femme fatale, and Morgan Freeman is pretty entertaining too, even if his character's only purpose in the film is to explain the plot and give us back story. But these issues are passable things that don't stop Lucy from being a riotously good time, and it's wacky story actually plays out in a really satisfying way. I was prepared for a really stupid ending, but what I got was actually pretty awesome and something connections that I didn't see coming were drawn out by the end.As far as action movies go Lucy is great. Its loaded with ass kicking and jam packed with wicked special effects. The film is a nonstop roller coaster and the ending certainly goes off the rails, but in an age where action movies draw out for far too long, what with our superhero and fighting robot movies clocking in at almost three hours half the time, Lucy with it's cool 90 minute run time is short sweet and to the point. It doesn't dwell and it doesn't over complicate things. If this movie's one goal is to entertain while not taking up too much of your time or too much of your cerebral capacity (hehe) then I would say it's a huge success.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And it does that at a carefully measured pace. I was surprised that many ""critics"" (i.e. parasites of opinion that compete for the meanest words to retain readers) point quickly to the inaccuracy of the science behind Lucy, but they do not care to point to the physical impossibility of let say Captain America. This is not your average Marvel movie... it is much better. There is the sexy girl, the exciting action scenes, and some profound questions without trying to give mystical answers. You can just sit down, relax, and enjoy an action sci-fi flick that is outside the predictable and formulaic Hollywood bunch (some of which I also enjoy greatly). This movie is a refreshing view on an old topic. There are many cultural references in this movie (to movies, arts, science, the crown of french archaeological findings, etc.) that you might miss if you do not pay enough attention; even if you do, you need to have vast knowledge to pick them all up. I am sure I missed many. For example, there is an elegant reference to Michelangelo's ""The Creation of Adam"", and another clever fundamental scene with Lucy drinking water happens in what looks like Gorges de l'Ardèche, where the Cahuvet Cave guards the oldest human paintings. Pay attention to the statue destroyed at the University. Perhaps many references are unintentional, and simply reflect the spirit of our time. In any case, Lucy takes you on a ride that will last long after the lights are back on. LUCY IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","28 out of 57 found this helpful.

I mean Scarjo and Morgan Freeman? how could this not be awesome? Well, somehow then managed to create characters that the audience does not care about at all.

You will leave wishing Lucy had died in the opening sequence. That would have saved you the 90 minutes of pure action with no storyline.Then there was the cinematography.... I was super confused with the opening sequence that was made up of flashes from Lucy to Freeman, then to national geographic footage??? With none of the clips containing enough info to get a handle on the story. Hence the lack of feelings for any of the characters...I love movies, and I really expected this to be a great summer blockbuster, but sadly even Scarjo and Freeman could not save this story-less plot, and awkward cinematography...I gave it a 2 to even out the overly high user reviews.

Lucy knows everything anyway and his explanation to the viewer will hurt your soul. It doesn't matter that the whole premise is impossible but STOP RUBBING IT IN MY FACE. The fact that hes presenting his ideas to a room full of students and professors only ads insult to injury. No one asks a simple why. Why does he think humans get psychic powers at 30%. Telekinesis?

The protagonist (Scarlett Johansson) is a superhero, but instead of having selective powers - like invisibility or the ability to fly, for example - she has all possible powers. Thanks to an accident involving a synthetic drug, Lucy starts to develop her brain, and soon she can control everything and everyone around her. (That is, drugs can have very positive effects, children, but don't try this at home). The prospect of a character capable of anything can be completely absurd in terms of script, but powerful in terms of image.Lucy does not live in a parallel world, of the future, she is not particularly intelligent or well intentioned. The young woman is accidentally chosen by a group of mobsters these days, and sets out to seek revenge for purely personal reasons: the character does not want to rid the world of drug trafficking, or evil men, just to do an extreme experiment itself, which leads it to seek and steal this synthetic drug from several people. Lucy is one of those strong, avenging women, a hero without character, as was Kill Bill's fascinating Widow, for example. She is one of the only female characters in the entire plot, surpassing all men in intelligence and competence.What follows is an absurd and inventive succession of moments of action. Everyone has seen shots and chases before, but this story makes an unprecedented representation of the action: instead of shooting the bad guys, Lucy disarms them with the power of thought; instead of overcoming them with punches, she sticks the bad guys on the ceiling (!) with a small gesture of the hands; instead of crashing into cars and generating explosions, it causes them to roll over on their own in the middle of the street. The script sends out naturalism and explores the potential of this great video game with sincere joy. The narrative is fast and lean, investing in the progression trajectory - the percentage of the protagonist's brain development appears on the screen, increasing. What will happen when Lucy reaches 100% of your brain?Luc Besson seems really invested in this project. He puts pop rock music in car chases, and soon afterwards uses excerpts of classical music (the same as the highly intellectual Nymphomaniac, by Lars Von Trier) to show the protagonist watching the sap of a tree running through each part of the trunk and roots. Lucy can be serious at times, hilarious at other times, and who would say, even poetic and moving in a few moments. Some images of the cosmos border on parody, others refer to Terrence Malick's transcendental aesthetic. The result, of course, is a surprising mess, aware of its excesses, without fear of displeasing. Lucy constitutes, from now on, a small trash classic, a script for a B film covered in Hollywood packaging.As for the metaphysical pretensions, the discussion about the capacity of the human being, the relationship between time and space, it is merely a background to attribute verisimilitude to history. No one in their right mind can believe the complexity of that scientific data. Everything is obviously false, but the film distorts rules of science to imagine a fiction - thus constituting a science fiction par excellence. The speeches of the great intellectual Norman (Morgan Freeman) are as simple as a pre-university entrance exam review, his data presented in Powerpoint does not convince anyone. But Besson includes comical comments, inserts about the animal kingdom, which reinforce the humorous character of this strange science: no, Lucy does not take herself one bit seriously. And for those who still have doubts, the human being does not use only 10% of his brain, as stated in the premise of the film.Who also deserves congratulations for this film is Scarlett Johansson. The actress could be content with the fame and salary obtained in great action films, in the style of The Avengers, but she continues to seek demanding, difficult roles, such as the operating system in Ela, the man-eating alien in cult-trash Under the Pele, and now of that kind of total woman, heir to the first woman in history, also called Lucy, and equivalent to a goddess among humans (""I am everywhere,"" she says). The actress does well in all these roles, deals with projects with great commitment, and builds in detail the progression between the initial Lucy and the others, with different percentages of the developed brain capacity. Johansson brings this small coherent, insane and fun project to life, marked by a healthy desire to bring something different to action and science fiction blockbusters.I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm seen on August 26, 2020.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

I do think with a little thought they could of made this a little bit more believable though if they had just focused on being able to use more of the brains potential rather than ""capacity"".Anyway apart from the basic concept that we still do not really understand our brains and what they are capable of everything else in the movie is based a lot in the realm of fantasy. There was a whole lot of things in the movie that could of been done better but even with all those flaws I still found it entertaining.The only thing that let the film down for me was the ending which even though visually was probably the best part of the film it still felt a little too generic and overdone.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Writer/Director Luc Besson has a track record of mixing stylistic visuals with more traditional action: La Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element. This time he tries to mix those components with fantasy, sci-fi and neuroscience. His hope was that Scarlett Johannson in a snug t-shirt and Morgan Freeman as an on screen narrator would sufficiently distract viewers from the intercontinental drug-muling mess.We have all fantasized about expanded brain power, and many films have touched on this: Transcendence (Johnny Depp), The Matrix franchise, and Limitless (Bradley Cooper) to name a few. Omnipotence may not be everyone's goal, but it sure doesn't seem to go well in movies. This time around, there is a Korean drug syndicate led by Choi Min-sik (Oldboy) who have synthesized a drug that takes the human brain to a new level.There are some nice moments in the film, but the pieces just don't fit smoothly together. Circumstances are such that Scarlett finds herself experiencing the effects of the drug - first by dancing on the ceiling ala Lionel Ritchie, and then with the most awkward phone call to mom in film history. Soon enough her telekinetic powers are so advanced, she mows down the heavily armed bad guys with a flick of the finger. If that makes no sense to you, you'll have to follow along with Professor Morgan Freeman's charts and graphs. His lecture spells out the steps that Scarlett will go through and the interconnected scene cuts makes sure all movie goers can keep up ... even those who don't use 10% of their brain.My biggest complaint is that if a movie about extraordinary intelligence is to be made, then the movie itself should at least be smart ... or witty. What the movie tells us is that expanded brain access allows us to medically diagnose our friends through a hug, instantly change hair color while strolling through the airport, and create invisible force fields to trap our enemies. We also learn that really smart people drive the wrong way on one-way streets. In Dallas, we typically refer to those people as idiots ... or at least horrible drivers. Evidently the joke is on us - those are the enlightened ones!This movie should have been a lot more fun than it was. A tip of the cap to Mr. Besson for casting Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen), and for the global trek from Taipei to Berlin to Paris to NYC ... and finally a dinosaur and memory stick. While Scarlett's character remembers the taste of her mother's milk, I expect the memory of this film will fade quickly.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

Besson skillfully combines mind-bending concepts, intense action sequences, and philosophical inquiries into the nature of existence, creating a cinematic experience that challenges the boundaries of the sci-fi genre.Scarlett Johansson delivers a powerhouse performance, effortlessly transitioning from a vulnerable and terrified individual to an all-powerful being transcending time and space. The film's visuals are striking, with Besson employing innovative cinematography and special effects to illustrate Lucy's expanding consciousness. Lucy stands as a thought-provoking and visually captivating journey that pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling, offering a unique blend of cerebral exploration and high-octane action.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I highly appreciate when someone tries to make something beyond their capabilities and understanding. The result is a fine product that incites imagination, which is more than can be asked of plenty releases. And average script aside, it is the development and execution that makes it. A simple scene of Lucy speaks to her Mother over the phone.. just to tell her how much she means to her. Scarlett does a great job.Sadly.. There's too much to cover and so little time, so while it doesn't suffer from pacing issues and keeps interesting, it leaves you wanting something more.. more concrete, more mind bending.

Not much more to say. It's a fun completely brain dead romp of CGI, explosions, and goddess of war woman kicking tail. It is unintentionally funny in many scenes mainly due to the complete lack of any sort of internal logic coupled with an almost Matrix Revolutions level of self pretension and the very wooden acting of the lead character that I can only assume is per direction. This is one of Luc Besson's better recent films but honestly that's not saying much.""1 + 1 does not equal 2"" <--- This is supposed to be a deep quote.LOL, OK, Luc. Lots and I mean LOTS of psychobabble wrapped in pseudo scientific language. The crafting of the movie is very good but the art behind it is pure dreck.And then there is... ""I'm not sure mankind is ready for it."", that ol' sci-fi movie trope.This is totally worthy of a parody audio dub if it hasn't been done already, but at the same time it is quite a bit of fun nonsense. If you can squint your brain vision hard enough through the silliness of the whole thing then what's left is worth a Saturday matinée. And of course the lead character is a draw simply because of her looks.Morgan Freeman should get an Oscar for this, managing to say the lines he does with a straight face and actually pulling off a seemingly real person. Pretty much all the other characters are basic archetypes.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In ""Lucy"" he creates the most powerful female character of all time. Scarlett Johanson plays the titular Lucy, who starts off as a student who is victimized by a bad boyfriend and some criminals. At one point you might consider her a superhero. And like many superheroes, her origin involves an accident. But this is a sci-fi film, so she is not just superhero; she becomes much more.Morgan Freeman plays a college professor who studies the human brain. Lucy reaches out to him because he might be the only person who can understand the problem she is looking to solve.This is not just a highbrow story about academia or brain power. Like many Besson films, it includes his style of gunplay. And an unusual chase scene. And bad guys. But he is much more ambitious here, taking the story into the cosmic realm, with side trips that might remind the viewer of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""The Time Machine.""The end result is an interesting film filled with special effects that bites off a little too much, resulting in a sometimes sloppy narrative.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Expectedly, trouble soon begins, as after a kick to the stomach, the bag containing the drug splits inside her, entering her blood stream and allowing her to use the other 90% of mankind's theoretically 'untapped' brainpower.The plot begins well, with Lucy discovering her new abilities, with some good old fashioned Neeson-esque gunfight sequences, but halfway through things start to get a little ridiculous. Whereas 'Taken' was somewhat possible, Besson has taken a more science fiction route this time, which unfortunately may lose some people along the way, but no spoilers here.As with the director's many previous movies, there is no shortfall of action. Gunfights galore, martial arts mayhem, and car chase chaos litter the Paris streets during the final act, with our female lead leaving a path of pile ups in her wake. Her new abilities also allow for some interesting sequences.Praise goes to Scarlett Johansson for her portrayal of Lucy. Her acting is one of the best female action leads there has been, and you do feel like you are taken along on the journey with her, providing you can follow the plot. Morgan Freeman, as always offering soothing baritones that help set up the film's premise, but more screen time for him would have been well appreciated.So, Lucy does leave you with the film's thought-provoking message of 'what really could happen if we were to use more than 10% of our brain?'. Unfortunately, for those who like a little more realism and substance in their films, that's not enough.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately there is very little real science in this movie. Writer & director Luc Besson stated that ""he admitted that he knew that some scientific assumptions were erroneous, e.g. that humans use only 10% of their brain. Nonetheless, he said that such assumption would be a great start for a sci-fi movie. Well, no that's not a good starting point if it's based on well known erroneous beliefs, in which case it classifies more as fantasy than sci-fi. I knew that going into the movie, so I was prepared to suspend disbelief on that, but the nonsense just kept getting piled on. Like when the drugs first start leaking into Lucy and she begins her ""transformation"", suddenly the laws of gravity are just thrown out the window and she's floating around the room? That's just dumb. I mean you can't even say that she was harnessing the power of her mind at that point, she doesn't even know whats going on. And it just goes on and on. Yet somehow its still worth a watch I think if you just accept that its fantasy based on very little actual science. Special effects and acting are top notch. Love Ms. Johansson, she could just stand in front of the camera and pick her nose for 90 minutes and I'd still watch.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The pros are the great cast of actors, Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman and Min-sik Choi. The cons are that writer/director Luc Besson tries to do too much on his own. I'd prefer a different director/producer/screen writer altogether. Most people complain that the end of the movie is a let down, a bit of an amateur ending in every way. One expects a similar ending to what it is, but it could definitely have been done a whole lot better from a sci-fi point-of-view as well as a production point-of-view. It's as if they ran out of money by 10 minutes before the end. Still worth a solid 7 out of 10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's important when embracing each individual movie's reality. Sometimes, however, a movie sets up a reality so far removed from the actual reality, that suspending disbelief to accept everything going on, is near impossible. Lucy's premise relies on a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. It was just too ludicrous, and presented in such a manner, that I had a hard time accepting it as truth - even knowing it was just a movie. The premise of the movie what it is, I found, that I couldn't care about any of the characters. They lacked depth. The movie starts with the fully formed character of Lucy. No background, no way for us to related to her at all. And we're treated to a series of somewhat inexplicably disconnected scenes, with very little actual development. Sequences that were pretty to look at, but had almost no impact on the story or the characters. I couldn't relate to anybody. Or anything going on. Luc Besson has made some movies that were unique in their own right, and movies I'll always appreciate. But this wasn't one of them. It felt empty, and when I left the theater, I felt like I had wasted my time. Like I hadn't been given what I came for: entertainment and something to think about.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

The truth is we don't know, empirically, how much of our brain we use and neither can we tell what it would be like if we reached 100% so the makers of this movie took a huge creative leap with rather mixed results.Don't get me wrong on the whole, it is a decent experience, well made, and at times rather intense. Nonetheless its story has holes on several levels.It doesn't get off on a promising start due to a prolonged incoherent dialogue between a guy and a girl where somehow the girl is forced to make a delivery unaware of the significance of the importance of the content she delivered. Now, you get a gang that invests a lot of money to develop a unique mind enhancing drug, so how come they decided to test it on a random girl rather than in a controlled environment?From the moment Lucy is caught up, the story flies off from there with several gaps which rather grow that get covered culminating in a very bizarre climax.Concluding, this is a theme with plenty of potential but goes nowhere near reaching it. The sci-fi aspect, largely conceals the action and thriller elements of this movie and in a detrimental fashion too.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

That is also the biggest issue that I have with this movie. I can accept a few scientific inaccuracies but this movie is a total fantasy land.The movie is based on the myth that ""we use 10% of our brain power"" and tries to explore what might have happened if we used more than that. The story has a lot of potential since it's really interesting but it becomes too much too fast. Everything paranormal is in this so called scifi movie and the irritating thing is that they try so hard to present it as if it's something that professors could be talking about.This movie is purely made in Hollywood terms oriented towards brain-dead consumers who don't like to use their brains. Some might say that the movie makes you think.. yes it does. However it makes you think based on totally paranormal ""facts"".If you like movies that are truly intriguing, then I recommend to skip this one.

Luc is not a great director but we can not deny him a sort of charm which all his films have - as to have a signature, you just know that the director is Besson. This is light mixture of Matrix and 2001 O.i.S., not bad but not good either. Scarlett in this film played solidly, but we must admit without those of her sexy lips half of the film would not be good. All in all, a fun movie that will entertain in less than an hour and a half, and those younger or less intelligent left in doubt what are they actually watching. Although the film itself has a lot of voids and familiar Besson's visual images, Freeman and Johansson make this movie interesting. As for the end of the film, the message is: live your life, it is worth and the only thing that actually makes it valuable, paradoxically, is time. So take the time and the knowledge that you have, grow and enjoy in life.

I hadn't really given Lucy much thought. I had seen the trailer a long time ago and completely forgot about it, to the point where when it came out in America and topping the box office I was left thinking ""What film is this? I've never even heard of 'Lucy'."" I had, I just hadn't remembered the name. The trailer instantly piqued my interest with it's whole 10%-100% of the brain dealio. I don't care if it's scientifically accurate or not, if I wanted that I'd watch a documentary. Anyway the point is it's a theory that's always fascinated me. If we did only use 10% of our brains, the possibilities we could unlock at 100% are simply unimaginable. Limitless attempted the same theory, but was decidedly bland and inconsequential. Within the first few minutes, Lucy had surpassed Limitless, and maintained it's quality throughout.Lucy, more than anything, is a philosophical sci-fi movie. It's not about the science, it's about the unimaginable. So yeah, it can get a bit unbelievable when she starts throwing people across the room with telekinesis, but it's the natural path to her destination, which is philosophical in nature and certain to spark debate. The movie, especially early on, is peppered with seemingly out-of-place shots of the order of nature. The scene of various animals getting jiggy with it even made the immature teenagers behind me annoyingly burst into fits of giggles. For me though? It added an extra dimension and weight to the overall themes of the movie. What is life? What's it's goal? Where are we, as a species, heading? The opening lines ""We've been evolving on this planet for a billion years, and what have we done with it?"" speaks volumes.Another key theme of Lucy is that of humanity and how it relates to the natural order of things. We are the only animals with self-awareness, and by extension a sense of morals. Most movies take the human side by appealing to our humanity and highlighting that it's what makes us unique. Lucy doesn't quash that approach. Instead it suggests an alternate viewpoint; that our humanity is what's holding us back and disrupting the natural order of things. The more knowledge and clarity Lucy gains, the more she becomes disconnected from her humanity; from her emotions. She doesn't feel sad or afraid, she doesn't even feel pain. They're all things that get in her way of reaching 100% brain capacity.However, this is still a Luc Besson movie, and Luc Besson likes his action scenes. Amidst all the philosophical ideas batting around, we get a lot of what feels like superfluous scenes that don't really add much. And it's true. They don't add much to the themes and ideas at all. They're pretty much put there to quicken up the pace a bit, provide some light entertainment, and to further the plot along, because the movie does still have a plot believe it or not, but I'll get to that in a minute. The more superficial scenes are very well done, as Besson is known for. Who knew a chase through Paris involving only one car could be so hugely entertaining (if a bit over-the-top; cars flipping and smashing into each other all over the place, in the middle of a busy city)? There's also quite a bit of tension early on. The introduction of Mr Jang near the beginning is surprisingly scary, as you can't help but imagine yourself in Lucy's shoes.The plot is reasonably simplistic. Lucy unwittingly becomes a smuggler of a new drug being put into the market, but a bit of mistreatment along the way results in her suffering a massive overdose of the drug giving her an explosion of cell development (thus the whole brain capacity theory). She escapes and goes on a rampage to recover the other packets of this new drug to keep her mental growth sustained. Feeling lost and confused, she also contacts a scientist who's been researching the theory for decades. Naturally everything comes colliding together in an epic climax worthy of comparison to 2001's Starchild.Scarlett Johansson isn't going to win any Oscars for her emotionless performance, but it deserves commendation nonetheless. Now, I've never been a particularly big Johansson fan. I've always found her to be just a pretty, slutty face adding little to no weight to her roles. Lucy is only the second time I've been genuinely impressed by her work (the first time being Black Widow's manipulation of Loki in Avengers). She starts the film as a bit of a bimbo. Not in a cartoony kind of way as is often portrayed, but she definitely makes a point to make this more human Lucy stand-out from her more cold and efficient Lucy later on. Also, while her performance is fittingly emotionless (as is the point), she does manage to bring a lot of weight to the character. The stand-out example here is with her phonecall to her mother, as she relives memories and experiences she shouldn't remember, like a cat she had when she was barely a year old, or suckling on her mother's teet (yeah, that got the teenagers behind me giggling as well). I wouldn't go so far as to call it a heart-wrenching scene, but it added to Lucy's character development almost purely thanks to the emotion Johansson managed to get across. Again, you couldn't help but empathise.Lucy has been getting a lot of hate, and honestly I can't understand why. It's got a good balance of action and plot, and themes and philosophy. It's 2014's intelligent blockbuster. It's got a little bit for everyone, from a car chase through the busy streets of Paris to the mind-boggling finale, from the tense introduction of the antagonist to the emotional phone-call. Maybe people are just taking the pseudoscience too literally? I didn't and instead I saw the deeper meaning quite unsubtly placed beneath the surface.","14 out of 26 found this helpful.

Lucy is one of those.There's no formal introduction of the character of Lucy except that she's living in Taipei. How she got there, who she is, what she does for a living are all left to the viewer's imagination. She somehow gets mixed up in affairs that led her to be a victim of CPH4 (blue crystals) ingestion in large quantities. (We're told by Morgan Freeman that CPH4 is produced by a pregnant woman's body in small quantities to help the foetus develop bones).The more CPH4 gets ingested, the higher percentage of brain she uses and unfortunately, the more ridiculous the movie gets. Lucy uses her enhanced brain usage to free herself from the captors and ""gather"" information about whereabouts of the other victims as her body is now craving more CPH4. She can now see the inner workings of trees and people and manages to diagnose her friend as well. She then ends up in France and makes allies with a cop to track down the other victims and contact Morgan Freeman, all while bad guys are trying to hunt her down.The visual effects and action sequences are good but they can't salvage a poorly scripted movie. One of the ridiculous moments is a call Lucy places to her mother. Any sane mother would have asked ""Are you high or on drugs?"". I don't know how other audience members kept a straight face through that. Plus there are numerous other hilarious metaphors.The final moments are over the top where Lucy becomes an all knowing all encompassing monster as she devours all the remaining CPH4, while the cop is trying to fend off bad guys and Morgan Freeman and other neuroscientists are watching in awe. And then as Morgan Freeman suggests, she manages to ""pass on"" her information.Scarlett's decent acting might be the saving grace for this movie. If you like movies like Crank, then this might be good entertainment. Regardless, remember to use only 10% of your brain while watching this.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

A similar idea of a youngster turned into a fighting machine was offered us in ""Hanna"".This time, we have the eponymous Lucy - a great role for the beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson - who is an American in Taiwan who suddenly finds herself ingesting a new super-drug than enables her to use progressively more and more of her mind with ultimately universal implications. If this sounds a bit like the plot premise of ""Limitless"" where NZT has been replaced by CPH4, then you can count on Besson for taking the notion further, much further, too far in fact. What starts as fun and merely fanciful finishes up as metaphysical nonsense. There are echoes here of all sorts of previous films such as ""2001"" (there are stargates aplenty) and ""The Tree Of Life"" (there is another dinosaur) and - inevitably - ""The Matrix"" (remember Trinity?).The work is visually stunning with an eclectic collection of images ranging from wildlife to cityscape to biology to cosmology and, since I saw it on an IMAX screen, at times I was close to hallucinating. The soundtrack adds to the atmospherics with use of Mozart's ""Requiem"" and contemporary songs (don't miss the one used for the long credits sequence). And the cast is very watchable with the Korean Choi Min-sik as lead bad guy and the ever-cool Morgan Freeman as lead scientist. Unusually for such an ambitious film, it clocks in a mere one and half hours and I would have been happier with a second hour in the vein of the first.

'Lucy' isn't preachy about the science and stays its course during its short 89 minute run delivering on all what you can expect of Luc Besson . Definitely a one-time watch.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

""Limitless was a great movie, but ""Lucy"" is an excellent movie - limitless in almost every way.Brilliant performances from all the actors, mind-blowing stunts and action sequences, and not to mention the outstanding and memorable car chase scene which is an absolute must-see for everyone! Nevertheless, the film may come across as somewhat higher grade. So if you are one who prefers ""My Wife and Kids"" over ""The Big Bang Theory"", ""Lucy"" is most probably NOT for you. Although the opening scene is very strong and gripping, the seemingly far-fetched, documentary-esque inserts of hunting cheetahs might puzzle some audience. How is it related to the film? It really isn't. Metaphorically, yes it is. But could they have done without it? Most definitely.The big question: will you be satisfied; is it worth your hard earned money? Certainly. However, the ending might leave you wanting more and feeling as though something is missing. The film is basically one long metaphor open to free interpretation. Everyone might have a different opinion of what its actually really about. None the less, best movie I've see all year!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Certainly Scarlett Johansson was the main attraction of the movie but she also could not do any better than this with such a poor plot. The making of the movie was great. Overall a good movie but could not meet up the expectation as it gave the notion of a great plot without a justified conclusion at the end. The acts of a person who managed to use her brain 100% should not have been like this. What she did could have been done by a strong woman of any kind. I am sure there will be many more movies in the future made on this plot but the initiator failed to meet the expectation.

It has a sequence of actions but no plot, and no dramatic tension. The characters are just sketches. The only people who will enjoy it are individuals who enjoy such: those of us who still like to visit the 12-year-old boy inside. My girlfriend sat with me for this DVD but mostly surfed the web.I went in with very low expectations after reading so many bad reviews, and thanks to that I was surprised to still be entertained. It has enormous flaws to be sure. Some of the acting by, and dialog for, the extras is terrible: I'm pretty sure I could do better as her mother's voice on the phone! The sci-fi is quite preposterous. The cut-scenes of animals felt very old and cliché. The ""wise words"" coming out of Freeman's mouth are careless insults to your intelligence.Lucy's character becomes robotic fairly early in the movie. This doesn't make sense (ever notice how humans are actually *more* expressive than the lower animals, not less?), and it is annoying because it makes for a necessarily boring performance by Johansson. And as Lucy acquires new abilities, I felt like asking ""Why wouldn't she just...?"" increasingly as the movie went on.So what's to like? Mostly it's just a fun concept to nerd-out on for 90 minutes, complete with lots of effective CGI. And some of the action is fun, though some is not worth noticing.The real puzzler for me is why Johansson and Freeman would have agreed to take part in this movie, since it did not require much of their acting ability.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Such a strong start to the movie, it just needs to cook a little more before it's ending is done.Luc Besson's original creation of Lucy tells of a woman thrust into the dark drug world of Taiwan, forced to be a drug mule. When the synthetic drugs sewn into her belly leak and are absorbed into her system, her mind's ability is expanded. Lucy turns her new-found potential and magnified powers back upon the mob boss responsible in the form of revenge.The story of Lucy is told seamlessly from three different perspectives simultaneously. The main perspective is through Lucy's experience, the secondary complementary perspective is through the lecture of a neurology professor and the third is spliced imagery similar to National Geographic footage interwoven relevantly to the scenes it mirrors. It is a unique, risky but ultimately effective directorial vision.Luc Besson takes the interesting belief that humans only access 10% of their brain function, aware it is an old wives tale and misinformed, and uses this as a jumping point for an enthralling movie. He assumes completely creative control and takes several liberties with his direction for purely artistic purposes. Lucy examines evolution and human brain function as well as the impact of the inherent human nature on the world environment in a purely hypothetical and exploratory manner. Besson also explores the concept of time in relation to human existence. All in all, the thought provoking views examined by Besson are decisive in opinion and well conceived.Eventually the film gets a bit monotonous, veers away from its initial design and becomes rife with action sequences. Certainly cool as a film, I wish Lucy had invested a more thought for a more complex conclusion.Lucy is a science fiction thriller and novel premise for a fictional action film. Note the word ""fictional"" for scientific proof and legitimacy won't be found here. Don't let that detract from the experience because Lucy is an entertaining and novel movie experience.Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

""Lucy"", both written and directed by Besson, is probably a 'Marmite' (love it or hate it) sort of film, as whilst it delivers a solid sci-fi story it is done in such a quirky style that some may find it distracting and irritating.Me? I love Lucy! Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) starts the film as a frightened gazelle-like student in Taipei (for reasons unclear in the film) where she is tricked into a dirty drug exchange with local Yakuza (or whatever the Taipei equivalent is) godfather Mr Jang (Min-sik Choi).Things turn ugly when Lucy is forced into becoming a drug mule and when things go unpleasantly wrong the drugs have a radical effect on her body, allowing her access to increasingly large percentages of her brain function. Unable to control the process she contacts brain specialist Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) to ask for his help (not that he seems to have much of a say in things as it turns out). As Lucy's powers escalate the need for more of the drug causes her to pursue the other drug mules around the world and a collision course with Jang and his henchmen becomes inevitable.Johansson has been described as a modern day Marilyn Monroe, and you can see where that comes from in her striking curves, bone structure and pouty looks. However (as brilliantly shown earlier in the year in the excellent ""Under the Skin"") she can turn her features to an other-worldly look that suit this film perfectly.Co-star Freeman has very little to do in this film though, which is a bit of a shame: his lines seem to be rather short and sanctimonious. The words ""spare part"" spring to mind. Amr Waked makes more of an impression as the local Paris police chief who has to protect Lucy.Also worthy of note is Eric Serra's electronic score, which suits the mood perfectly.But hats off to Besson, blending '2001' like monkey business with animal sex cut-ins with a journey to the start of creation as a roller-coaster ride of dizzying speed: at 89 minutes, this is another example of 'less is more' in film running times. A brilliant time travel scene set in Times Square is just marvellously done, posing fascinating questions about the origins of intelligent man.The only disappointment for me was the ending which (no spoilers) I found rather perfunctory. However, Lucy is a mainstream film that is both thrilling, gripping and thoughtful in equal measure. Recommended.(If you found this review useful please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!.

Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy, a young woman is pulled into being a drug mule. However, interesting things start happening to her when the drug leaks into her system. Among the complaints one could lodge against LUCY, the biggest one is how thinly written the whole thing is. We are given precious little information about Lucy, and most of the other characters don't do much but further the plot along or provide exposition. Morgan Freeman is probably the most interesting of these, a scientist/professor whose field of research happens to coincide with what Lucy is experiencing. Still, the film seems to be aware of this and wastes no time in getting to the point. It follows a very fast pace, and it becomes almost a game to guess what powers Lucy will access as her cerebral capacity gets closer to 100%. There's also some real-life footage of animals and cool visual effects sequences of cells dividing and cosmic-level events which one will either take as profound or pretentious. I took it as somewhere in between, but leaning more towards the latter. I didn't really get the feeling that the film was going for a particular message, but the idea that wonder is part of what makes us human is an interesting one, as Lucy becomes less human the more knowledge and brain power she acquires. There also seemed to be the idea that knowledge makes us god-like. Altogether, it waxed fairly philosophical for an action film with a threadbare plot. Time will only tell whether or not I really love it, but for now I'm content in saying I liked LUCY a lot. Luc Besson's films have never been known for being particularly deep, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun here creating something that does make you think a little, even if it's based on an incorrect idea. For all it lacks in plot or story, LUCY has plenty of gumption when it comes to philosophical and visual ideas.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There's nothing new here, but it revels in how over the top it is. There is some character development, questions asked about the nature of humanity and a healthy dose of humour.Unfortunately as the film progresses to its natural conclusion, far too much effort is expended on the special effects and little on plot development. Whilst the ending is in line with the progress of the film, that does not make for an interesting story. A twist would have maintained interest, or perhaps less time on how the last 30% of unlocking of potential develops and more time on post 100% potential.Beyond a certain point Lucy herself ceases to become interesting - she's essentially untouchable due to her enhanced abilities, and the tension derives from the normal humans protecting her development. The final fire fight is insufficiently ridiculous - it needed to reach the heights of Desperado rather than remaining loosely grounded in reality, or retaining some vulnerability of the main character as per the similarly over the top The Fifth Element.It's probably worth seeing once, but it's not a buy on Bluray. I'd rate the not entirely dissimilar Transcendence above this and friends have mentioned that Limitless is a better and more realistic implementation of the same idea.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He is among my favourite living actors and blows my mind every time I see him (I implore you all to see Oldboy). Furthermore Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman are actors for whom I hold a great deal of respect for, particularly if given a good script. I also enjoy Luc Besson's work, I consider Leon to be a masterpiece in particular.So when I heard about film that supposedly combined all these talents into a high concept sci-fi thriller, I was hyped. This enthusiasm barely flattered even after the sub-par reviews came in. I hoped that, despite some rough edges an overall interesting and enjoyable film was still possible. I was very much wrong.I will start with the film's pacing. It is fairly slow in its first few scenes (the best part of the film) and shows a little promise, however it cranks into overdrive at around the 1/4 mark and doesn't allow for anything resembling character or atmosphere. This seems indicative of a harsh editing process, just like the script. It feels like deep ideas and characters may have existed in some earlier draft of the script, but not here. Everything is so rushed that it comes of as feeling dumb, flaccid and lacking in any punch whatsoever.Next let's look at the acting. Min-Sik Choi shows promise early on, and does what he can with the material, however he is totally wasted and irrelevant to the films core plot. I almost started routing for him in the end as I was desperate to see him given the material he so clearly deserved. Scarlett Johanson is also clearly trying as hard as she can, in a role that doesn't allow her to show any emotion or personality whatsoever. Morgan Freeman probably escapes with more dignity than the rest of the main cast, as he is basically playing the typical Morgan Freeman stock character, the wizened mentor. The rest of the cast come off terribly, being either annoying, laughable or dull. Particularly Lucy's 'love interest'. His hilariously bad performance almost beggared belief at times.The films features atrocious CGI, it is particularly damming for a sci-fi film when the effects are weak. This factors into the film's pathetic action, which is largely caused by the film's untouchable protagonist and lack of threat in any of the action sequences. A car chase 2/3 into the film is particularly tedious and features some awful lines from our lead.Overall, despite a team seemingly capable of birthing this ambitious project, Lucy falls flat on it's face. I was beyond disappointed as I was genuinely hyped for this 89 minute long train-wreck.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Unless u r Stephen Hawking, how can u argue with that? It tells u to focus on your desires and learn about their real meanings and origins.

It doesn't matter if the movie is scientifically accurate; treat it more like a sci fi film than a realistic depiction of brain chemistry.But as a sci fi movie, or a movie in general, this is an absolutely horrendous movie. Firstly, the setup is too quick at the beginning and rushes to get Lucy to her superhero phase way too quickly. She has no character, so when she changes it doesn't have any impact. Every character in the film is one dimensional and most are plot devices.The editing with nature footage is downright awful. It occurs early on and continues through the film, consistently drawing attention away from the plot to give some broad visual themes that are way too heavy handed (the gazelle and cheetah chase eg.)Visually, the movie does very little of interest with the concept of (essentially) superpowers. We barely see any of Lucy's altered perceptions other than through some quick editing and overt dialogue.The writing is god awful. Exposition, exposition, exposition: mixed with scientific preaching.Avoid this movie like the plaque. It's not even a fun bad movie, go watch the room for that. Avoid avoid avoid Lucy at all costs.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

It starts good - pretty much like Limitless - a failed adult is exposed to a drug allowing her to use 100% of her brain and she becomes super smart and capable in a short time. But then the choices this genius makes and the stuff she does and doesn't do to get out of a dangerous situation, are just plain silly.

Because with Lucy he decided to just make ALL the comic book movies in one, with one character. This rating means not that it's really an entirely ""good"" serious action movie or a serious look at how human beings are part of this great long thing called consciousness and have evolved for years and years. I'ts more like a colossal, memorable guilty pleasure.Lucy is a fairly crazy look at super powers, and how a humans brain, once going last the ho-hum 10% functionality and by tens of percents, once tapped, we can, oh I don't know, have ""Force""-like powers to push people away with the swipe of a hand, see through walls and people, learn things with instantaneous ability, and control people's actions. Oh, and once nearing the 100% mark, a super computer with the ability to time travel and look back into the beginnings of the universe. Besson has some balls, but I think what keeps this from being totally pretentious garbage, for me, is that it's not taking itself entirely seriously....or, if it is, Besson doesn't pretend he's not making a genre movie, and complete with nasty Asian gangsters (led by Choi Min Sik of Old boy, a welcome presence and he plays every scene to the subtle-over-the-top hilt), and race-against-the-clock suspense. There isn't quite so much action as I expected, or at least from the maestro behind LA femme Nikita or Taken. Or perhaps I could just see that Besson was committing so much to the premise and exploring the bullshit science that I couldn't help but chuckle as Scar-Jo contorts on the ceiling as her body is racked by the mystery drug that, after seeping into her blood following being turned by the Asian gangsters as a drug mule, gives her the initial powers.We see what happens inside of her body as she is given this new drug, and then later when she needs more of the drug how, say, her face starts to melt and she falls apart like some wax figure. The special effects and science here is matched just right for pure wild fantasy. And most of all its good how much the Hero commits to her character, especially early on when she is just a frightened woman put into a terrible situation (when she sees someone shot, at first, it really shakes her up), and then at first when she is finding this power that turns her, in slightest terms, like the Terminator.If there is a problem its that she is so monotone through portions of it that, despite (or because) of the demands of the script, she has less to play with except for her dead-straight voice. Better is near the end where it just gets So wild that she is becoming the Matrix or something. So, in other words, Lucy is kinda stupid and doesn't make sense If you try to think about with full sincerity.But if you look at it as just pure unadulterated fantasy, And a quick one at that at 87 minutes, you'll get something... different from it, that's for Damn sure. It's like if five of Grant Morrison's most eccentric comics were put in a blender and splat onto celluloid (plus an expository Morgan Freeman).","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

The French action legend hasn't made a truly good film since La Femme Nikita back in 1990. That being said, he hasn't made any terrible movies since then either, and this somewhat dubious trend continues with Lucy. As is the case with most of Besson's work, anyone with half a brain will be able to follow the storylne with little trouble. Lucy unintentionally ingests an experimental drug. This raises her mental capacity to ridiculous heights, effects-driven hijinks ensue. Pretty standard stuff really, and the leaps in logic are so glaringly obvious that ignoring them quickly becomes a distraction (why push cars out of the way you could simply fly over them?). Granted, this fact does not seem to go unnoticed by the film itself, as several welcome moments of self-awareness manage to slip themselves organically into the storyline. But even knowing of its inherent flaws is not nearly enough to save Lucy from its cliched, high-concept plot and bring action.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is a negative point of the movie, and all the academic show offs presented, are basically incorrect. Being incorrect is different from being possible or not completely understood. This movie was too much fiction. I'm worried about the recent trend in Hollywood that science fiction movies tend to be like video games. Is this cinema art or cinema engineering? However, I really liked certain scenes relating to the past and nature. Good job. Besides, I didn't like Scarlett Johansson's acting, as my expectations are higher for such an famous actress.

They throw a lot of information at you in the beginning without giving you a way for it to sink in. Some of the action scenes seemed forced and there are significant plot holes. The culmination of the movie is disappointing and did not feel to me like it fit with the plot. Yet this movie is somewhat enjoyable with some scenes that are very well done. It is highly visual with a lot of effects, but I wouldn't go to see for the action scenes.

She can analyze problems faster, perform telekinesis, can telepathically see around the world, and control electrical objects. However, when she realizes that without the rest of the drugs her body will not be able sustain itself, she sets out to find the other bags of drugs until she finally reaches 100%.Roll credits. Seriously, the movie ends right when she reaches 100%. Though some may conclude this to be a film with an open ending, I believe ""Lucy"" to be an entirely incomplete movie throughout. Sub plots are started throughout the movie, but are never resolved or even touched base on after it is started. For example, a cop joins Lucy to find the drugs and he says after one action scene where Lucy easily killed everyone ""I don't think I'm much help to you."" To which she replies: ""But you are. As a reminder."" And then the subject is dropped for the rest of the movie. Never says for what the cop is a reminder for (of what it's like to be human) and the conversation is pointless because it is not referenced at all throughout the rest of the movie.I'm not even going into the concept itself which is taken to the point of being extremely unbelievable to a sci-fi geek like me, and that problem also lies within the script. I think science fiction is supposed to be believable, either based on actual theories we currently use and take it to the next level (Superhero movies, ""Ender's Game"", etc.) or completely ridiculous with its own scientific rules made clear to the audience (""Doctor Who"", ""Star Wars"", etc.). ""Lucy"" tries to do both, but fails. It takes its own concept beyond belief (travelling through time and space with your mind?).Though well acted and directed, Lucy falls flat with its incomplete story and, at times, rather corny dialogue.","7 out of 24 found this helpful.

After having some drugs surgically implanted in her abdomen that rupture, she evolves into the ultimate human, capable of bending reality and time to her will.To be honest, this film sounds a lot better than it is. I like the concept - the idea of becoming overdosed on what is essentially super strong performance enhancers to become ridiculously good at pretty much everything has huge potential. Imagine if the Matrix and Limitless had a baby and you wouldn't be far off. The problem is that the film bogs itself down with Morgan Freeman giving lectures about the untapped part of the human brain and evolution theory with regards to intelligence, slowing the film to a crawl at times. And when the film constantly darts between a lecture theater and Lucy breaking some faces, it just feels at odds with itself.

And director.In 'Lucy', although interconnected, Besson does a good job maintaining two unique stories. And by & large, it works fairly well.The only contrivance here, is the means (another goofy designer drug), by which Lucy's odyssey is unwittingly launched.Now, the intermittent classroom instruction by the tenured Philosophy professor, (Freeman), is pretty cool. There is some profundity in this, but it is his later interaction with Lucy where theory ventures in fact (within the framework of the film that is.). And this is not to denounce the film's statements around the human brain. Many of us believe, that higher brain power leads to a lot of what is played out in this movie. I've seen Criss Angel 2x live at the Luxor, (not, including his magic performed at the tranquility bar, going from Table to Table, no more than a foot away. I'm a retired engineer, and what I witnessed on multiple occasions; simply defies everything that is mass, gravity, & space.Well, all that to say, I probably found this movie more interesting and fun than most, and so, the higher score.Scarlett is always a knock out, and a pretty darn good actress.Choi Min-Sik was the ultimate evil, and done well.Amr Waked does a great job as the tough & honest cop, and most importantly, the vehicle by which Lucy can hold on to her dwindling humanity.Visuals: the visuals that accompanied Morgan Freeman's instruction, are right on target, and easily understood. But they were impressive just the same. It was directed well.The changes going on in Lucy's brain as she continues to accelerate her intelligence, is of courses beyond speculative. Maybe even a bit hokey at times. But what are you gonna do here? I liken it to Kubrick's 2001:A Space Odyssey, where Dave goes to ""Jupiter & Beyond"".Rating: Sci-Fi, like Horror, seems to have a lower ceiling going in. There are so many reviewers who are averse to these genre's. My wife is admittedly this way. An 8 is a 10, and they go down from there.Anyway, I highly recommend.Thx Bob R.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately though, the characters in this movie seemed far from original and failed to really excite my interest enough to make me think or be somewhat impressed. Scarlett Johanseen's blah and robotic like acting throughout this movie, in my opinion, shows her lack of depth as an actor (these days) and poor writing of her character. I was disappointed by this, even though I overall enjoyed this movie. I gave this movie a 7 instead of a 5 or 6 because of the well played Korean boss, cinematic display of Taiwan, and the somewhat interested displayed of drug transport in the body.

I thought Lucy was so good for the first hour and ten minutes. I was really shocked that the overall product could be this good. The topic is way over everyone's head but I thought Besson did a good job not to let it get too out of hand. I imagine there is a lot of stuff in this movie that is scientifically inaccurate but I tried to ignore that and I managed to enjoy it. This movie would have gotten a way better score from me if the ending wasn't so crazy, all over the place and hard to understand. I also like the casting of Scarlett Johansson.

Pretend it's a comedy or like some kind of intelligent parody. The science and logic are so unbelievably ridiculous, that there seemed to be no way that the film makers would take it seriously. Yet they do take it very seriously. And you can either balk at how inane the movie is, or you can pretend the film makers had a great sense of humor. I'm not saying it's so bad it's good. I'm saying the amount of ridiculous is so high in this movie, that it's hard to believe that it wasn't meant to be intentional. My friend and I were laughing so hard in the theater I'm afraid we might have confused the other viewers. But then they started laughing too. And I know none of those scenes were meant to be funny.All of that aside, I do think Scarlett Johansson was great in the role, and this really isn't the type of role I would expect to have a female lead, so at least the movie has that going for it.But I recommend this movie only if you're able to watch like it's a comedy.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Cinematography showcased visually stunning sequences, and Luc Besson's directing skillfully balanced action and philosophical themes.

Great action sequences and fast pace. Go see this movie if you want to have a fun ride.Now comes the part about why it's an insult to intelligence.We all use 100% percent of our brain. We just do. Think about it. Would you say you use only 10% of your hand or only 5% of your nose. Almost every part of a human being is under use all the time. It's being utilized fully for what its purpose is. The notion that our brain has unused capacity is simply wrong. Our brain is modular in nature and all its parts have a specific purpose. They are all under use, all the time. There is nothing in there that needs to be run at it's ""full"" capacity to unlock secrets of the universe. It's true that with proper training you can use your brain better to remember things or stay more focused. That's just rewiring inside your brain over a period of time which comes with training and good nutrition. I say this movie is an insult to intelligence, because they reduced our potential to unlock the secrets of the universe to pumping a drug in our body. Our generation is already becoming slaves to things like smart phones and the internet, here's a movie that explores the unlimited potential of human mind using a drug. That's plain lazy thinking. Is this what was going through Luc Besson's mind: ""okay so I want to show the human race what they could do if their brain were at full potential...hmm...lets see...EUREKA! a drug could possibly accelerate this process...not critical thinking...not meditation...not hard work...a drug...that makes sense...it's so simple!""I look forward to see Interstellar which does exactly the opposite. I believe Christopher Nolan wants us to believe in our own selves (at our current brain capacity) to unlock secrets of the universe.Also what's up with Scarlett Johansson's ET like mannerisms when her brain ""capacity"" increases. An enlightened person will not act like an alien, they will act like real human beings, they will show kindness and empathy.7/10 for its entertainment value only. If Luc Besson make any claim about this movie being something more than just an action movie then a f**k y** and 1/10 from me.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

As it continued it had a few questions of logic (like all films) but it didn't matter because it was entertaining and was looking like Besson's best since Leon.But then came the ending, it was unanswered, confusing and most of all pretentious, Besson apparently worked on 'Lucy' for about 12 years, which leads me to believe that the ending was over thought, it strikes that during the writing process Besson became more interested in making an ending for himself not rather than his audience.I don't support a lot of the hate 'Lucy' seems to have got, as despite my frustration towards the ending it was still an entertaining and a step in the right direction for Besson, a big improvement from 'The Lady'.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There were many rumours swirling that this was some sort of prequel to the Black Widow. Although I knew this wasn't the case, it still made me think someone was just trying to cash in on the Avengers action girl thing which put me off a little bit.After watching it, I can honestly say this wasn't the case. This movie stands completely on it's own for the most part. The only thing about the story I didn't like was the fact it had similarities to Limitless with Bradley Cooper. Although the premise is slightly different, it definitely felt like this was the same type of scenario -- up and coming famous actor is on the verge of super-stardom and is given a slick movie with an interesting drug based story as a jump off point.That said, I enjoyed the story and the acting was excellent. Scarlett seems to be a better fit for me in these action roles rather than the drama or romance movies she does from time to time. I think that time has passed for her and hopefully she embraces these roles, at least for the next few years.I enjoyed the special effects, but I did find it a little far fetched...and yes, I know it's a movie, but hear me out. It was supposed to be kind of based on fact, but they took some serious liberties with this as the movie went on to the point of ridiculousness. It was a little over the top for me in the end and I would have enjoyed if it stayed a little more grounded. There was a particular part with a computer towards the end that I thought was kind of ridiculous and didn't make much sense, but I get where you are coming from if you don't agree with.So in the end I felt like this movie was an enjoyable watch, and I'm glad it was successful, but for a reality based movie it became a little too ridiculous for me.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Then in 2021 another friend recommended the movie to me, so I figured there might be something to it, and I sat down to watch the movie.I didn't know that it was a movie written and directed by none other than Luc Besson. And that alone pretty much guarantees some sort of entertainment.And yeah, Luc Besson does deliver with the 2014 movie ""Lucy"". I will say that it was definitely a surprise of a movie, and I was thoroughly entertained by what the storyline turned out to be.Well, that goes for the majority of the movie. It was a great action ride that gives you something to actually think about. But then Lucy reached 70% brain capacity and the movie just crumbled underneath itself. At that point the movie went from being really interesting and captivating, to just becoming downright ludicrous and laughable. Everything that writer and director Luc Besson had established and built throughout the course of the movie crashed hard as Lucy progressed from 70% to 100%. Now, I will not give away what happened here, but it was definitely a slap to the face of the viewers with a cold, dead fish.Visually then ""Lucy"" was a pretty astounding movie. The visual effects department definitely knew what they were doing, and the effects were gradually layered onto the movie as Lucy's brain capacity increased. And it worked well in favor of the movie.""Lucy"" has a pretty good cast ensemble. Now, I am not overly keen on Scarlett Johansson's acting talent, but she actually was nicely cast for this movie and performed quite well. Needless to say that Morgan Freeman delivered his usual spot on performances here. I found it a very interesting, but really great, choice that they hired Choi Min-sik for the movie, because he is such a mammoth actor and really brings something unique with him, so he was a marvelous addition to the cast list.I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie right up to the 70% brain capacity marker, then it was just crumbling to pieces. Had writer and director Luc Besson opted for something else, the movie would have fared better. My rating of ""Lucy"" lands on a six out of ten stars, and it was that last 30% of the progress that dragged the movie down.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As human beings we only use 10% of our brains, what would happen if a person achieved 100% usage of her brain? Lucy (Scarjo or Scarlett Johansson) was exposed to a drug that allowed her to use 100% of her brain.Parts of this movie reminded me of Natural Born Killers in that there were several cutaways to file footage of other things that could be symbolic or relative to what was being said or perhaps felt. There were some exciting moments and some awesome moments, but then the movie got way too esoteric and almost metaphysical. A valid and plausible theory became mystical and almost comical. Essentially, what started off good sorta waned and ended with a whimper.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

From Leon to The Fifth Element, Besson has solidified himself as an action auteur. However, Lucy stands as a perfect example of seeing a legend overshadowed by a long and lengthy career. Lucy stars Scarelett Johansson as the titular character, a normal woman who is injected with a super drug. Before the film really gets going, we don't spend enough time with Lucy as what she would normally be. Before we know it, Lucy is soon injected with a mysterious serum that is some sort of super drug that is simply a more amped up version of the Limitless pill and then we slowly stop caring about her character because she is everything short of invincible at this point. Lucy's premise offers a lot of promise but its execution is something completely different. The action sequences are bland, played out and down right ridiculous. Usually that's a good thing for a film of this type, but what makes Lucy the exception is the terrible editing and poorly written plot. For the first 40 minutes of the film, you're engaged in the film. The story takes off immediately, starting with a voice-over from Johansson that proves to be pointless and useless by the end of its brisk 90 minute runtime. This is half a good film, half a really incoherent mess of a film. Johansson's attempt at being a brutal bad-ass collapses right around the time Lucy starts to access more than 50% of her brain. While her performance is commendable and she gets an A for effort, I simply don't buy it. Morgan Freeman plays virtually the same character here as he did in Transcendence and, much like that film, it gets tiresome after seeing it a couple times. The film descends into one pointless twist after another until you finally are asking yourself ""what the hell is going on?"" There are some great scenes of action that seem very carefully choreographed in the beginning along with a car chase sequence that was pretty awesome as well. Despite these two good qualities, it isn't anywhere near enough to save Lucy from poorly written dialog, terrible plot twists and an overall lack of coherence.","6 out of 22 found this helpful.

So said 'Graham Chapman' in Monty Python. And that's about the best summing up I can give 'Lucy.' It's completely daft and hardly intellectually stimulating, but – what the hell – sometimes you don't want films that make you think. You just want mindless entertaining fun. And Lucy does the job.Scarlett Johansson plays the titular 'Lucy' – an average sort of girl who ends up accidentally being given a powerful new drug which allows her to use powers no human has ever had before. And, like I say, it's a fun film to watch. It's not perfect though. It starts off a bit 'arty.' There are clips of various 'unrelated' events (like a cheetah catching its prey) interspersed with the main narrative. But these sort of get dropped about half way through the film, leaving you to wonder why they were included to begin with.While Lucy is busy killing those responsible for her new powers, we also have Morgan Freeman – the scientist who just so happens to be an expert on 'expanded brainpower.' His story sort of runs in parallel with hers, although he's basically there to explain what's going on (in the final scene he almost completely 'narrates' the action – it's quite funny!). He tells us that the average human uses about 10% of his/her brain. Lucy is on her way to use all 100%.Expect killing. Expect kind of cool action scenes with Lucy using her superpowers to destroy all those who wronged her. There's a bit of science thrown in there, courtesy of Morgan Freeman to add a few concepts that might make you think. But it's not a long film. It's pretty condensed and everything flows from A-B quite nicely.Basically, the film is about how humans only need about 10% of their brains to function. And you certainly won't need any more than that to understand and appreciate Lucy. Grab the munchies, allocate about 8% of your brain to the film and just enjoy.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Reason #1, the science is bogus. The whole 10% thing had been refuted a while ago. I remember when it was all the rage, I think it was the late 80s, or early 90s, at least where I am from. I was a kid, and we were talking about it during a break at school with my friends. Not really a topic for 10-year-olds, but I was weird like that. What I can't remember is when I knew it was stupid. We now do know, there is no part of the brain going unused, or not up to its potential. I'm not going to go into details here, let's just say that when I saw the trailer of this movie, I found it weird how they could use something so archaic.The reason why I did watch it was the reviews. They were pretty good, and promised excitement, good acting. I didn't really get either. The story is quite simplistic. Much of it is taken up by Morgan Freeman narrating. Now I like his voice as much as anyone, but the substance was sometimes face-palm worthy. Also, ooookay, I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and it just never did. Maybe if I had actually believed that whole premise of the movie, but since I know it's bogus, I was mostly rolling my eyes. It's not that I haven't seen fantasy or sci- fi that had unrealistic elements to it. However, this time, it felt more like listening to some Christian apologist speak in one of the debates I so love. Totally baseless, junk science. I just couldn't let myself get lost in a fantasy. Maybe if the story actually had a story. It was so cliché, simplistic and predictable, the credits rolled, and the first thing that came to my mind was: ""that was it?"" I want to go up to Luc Besson, shake him, and ask him how he could have made something so boring. It reminded my of those sci-fi shorts that were really just introducing a concept, or an idea. However, those are not fit to be made into movies. They're dry. MAybe he was trying to do that? This from the same guy who made one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time The Fifth Element. I must have seen that one a dozen times. I'll work very hard at forgetting that this mundane thing was also done by him.I saw praise for Scarlett Johansson. She plays the lead character, Lucy. I guess if you can get points for spending the majority of the film with a completely blank expression, then it's okay. Though for that they could have just used Kristen Stewart. She has that down to an artform. Yeah, I'm being sarcastic, just in case you haven't read any of my reviews for her movies. Morgan Freeman is also on the poster. He narrates. He asks questions. He stands around a lot. He sometimes sits. I don't think he was used to his full potential either. Not that people wouldn't enjoy him reading the telephone book, but really...So the story is simple, acting is not really required from the actors, so perhaps it has great fight scenes or special effects? No. Okay, there are brief moments when Lucy does something that looks cool. Like make guns fly into air. Would have been a wow moment in the 60s maybe. However, other than some people shooting up a bunch of places without much opposition is about as exciting or visual as this thing gets. I hope they didn't pay someone to come up with those fight scenes.Overall, I couldn't find any redeeming factor to this movie that would make me actually want to watch it again, or recommend it to anyone. I didn't hate it. Really. Twilight I hated for various reasons. This I was more like shrugging and marking it off the ""to be watched"" pile. Crap science, lacklustre action, no real characters, ... I just don't see a point to what I watched for 90 minutes. I can't give it more than one star. I tried to give two, but really, there is just nothing good about this, I didn't enjoy anything about it. One star it is.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

A truly pioneering concept, what would happen if the human brain could perform at 100% of its potential at the same time (although the 10% mentioned is more just a myth rather than reality). The title itself suggests the development of intelligence and evolution since a discovered skeleton of modern humans ancestor was named Lucy. So an ordinary girl gets involved in drug trafficking before she realizes it, only that the new drug is based on a substance that is produced during the embryonic stage of development. Eventually it ends up in an increased amount in her blood and begins to overstimulate the brain. That's where the imagination and the action begin. Obviously, there were plenty of exaggerations especially towards the end of the film, but this is a fantasy film and not a scientific research. Very good acting by both Johansson and Freeman, a lot of imagination especially before the end and a really unusual concept, which only reminds me of The Lawnmower Man (1992) with the increase of intelligence and the end. Unfortunately, despite the great idea and the very good performances, the film did not have a decent script, nor enough imagination or action as a whole, while it could well be developed for at least another half hour to show more imagination or action with nice effects focusing on the increased abilities. Great idea, but poor implementation. It is recommended, but it could be much better.6.5 / 10 from me","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Naturally, I didn't like the extremely non-scientific idea at first too. I remember when the movie came out and people were like ""well people do have limited access to their brain so you never know!"". Absolutely hated that. But should my opinion on the movie be influenced my such unscientific opinions? NO! It's a movie for crying out loud! And generally, your opinion should not be influence by who supports a certain idea. I'm no expert so I'll keep it simple. The movie starts brilliantly. Scarlett proves once again she is not just beautiful. Enjoyed the directing, cameras, etc (with my very limited knowledge).What I loved about the movie was that it took the sci-fi idea of the ""100% brain access"" (such as Limitless) and shredded it to pieces; there's nothing beyond this, and I doubt there will ever be. Some might (reasonably) argue that the end was too much. Ok, yes it was, but that was the point; no movie will ever be able to take this idea to a more extreme level ever again. Plus, it was the only ending that not everyone would expect; anything ""weaker"" and you'd be like ""pff the ending was casual"".On the downside, as we approached the end of the movie, it became a bit irrational, even in its own world. Sometimes even forced. Moreover, the constant attempt to make it sound scientifically possible throughout the movie made me cringe. But I guess I should have been more prepared for this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is a perfect example.Nothing could prepare me for how bad this truly was. Instead of feeling creative or intellectual, just feels incredibly stupid. I don't know how else to describe how obnoxious and annoying I found the film from the get go. I'm accustomed to suspending reality for the sake of fantastical storytelling, but this is just bad. The dialogue and directing really range from mediocre to atrocious. There are a few decent scenes, but few and far between.Scarlett Johansson is totally unconvincing at playing the emotionless aspect. She's supposed to play Lucy as if she has no emotions, but instead it comes across as her trying desperately to convince us that she has no emotions. But before Lucy gets her powers, she's also pretty bad, totally unconvincing and probably more laughably bad when she's trying to play a woman with fear for her life. What a misfire of a performance, although she tries hard enough and isn't nearly as obnoxious and as downright ugly as the film around her.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Lucy is filled with almost every sci-fi cliché under the sun and borrows so many aspects from dozens of other movies (including ones Johansson herself is in) that if you take it too seriously it'll be completely lost on you to the point of being terrible. It is derivative, vacuous, and slightly shallow.But, and you'll have seen from my score, it is far from a bad movie.Lucy sees Johansson's protagonist of the title caught up in a drug deal gone bad. Through no fault of her own she ends up ingesting the drug and finds her mind and body fundamentally altering and seemingly evolving to a higher plane.Already I can see people screaming 'Limitless', 'X men', and even '2001 Space Odyssey'. They're not completely wrong - this movie borrows so many aspects from these and more that it basically is a compilation of every sci-fi movie you've ever seen.But that said, while it tries to take ITSELF seriously with pretentious twaddle about evolution and psychology, it is delivered stylishly enough to be entertaining.Besson's direction is also good - there are plenty of stylish set-pieces and another of his notable works, Fifth Element, is here in spirit too. The guy does know how to produce a slick movie.The problem is the content, and the way it's delivered. The first half of the movie sees 'correlation' cut offs between what's happening to Lucy and Morgan Freeman's Dr Norman giving lectures to a crowd of academics which 'just so happen' to be explaining the nature of evolution and the primitive stage of human psychology. It's all very interesting but the idea all this is happening to her while he's delivering his very convenient sermons really pushes the envelope. Naturally she finds him and seeks his help 'because he's the only one who can help her'.Another notable flaw is the 'bad guy' is literally there for the sake of being a bad guy. He doesn't exude any fear, menace, or indeed interest, and seems wholly contrived for the sake of there being a nemesis.But, while Besson probably did intend this to be taken more seriously than it ends up being, it nevertheless entertains thanks to quick pace, an intriguing premise, and good cinematography. The visual effects are especially decent.However I have no idea why he thought it a good idea to stick Scarlett in a ridiculously sexy dress for two-thirds of the movie - don't get me wrong, I'm as hot-blooded as any other man and don't object to it, but it was unnecessary, distracting, and it served no purpose beyond eye candy. It certainly wasn't practical for the character's situation.Ultimately it was a fun, silly, well-executed if flawed movie which had designs grander than it was actually able to deliver.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"3","/10","A terrible movie with a few good ideas","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3310810/?ref_=tt_urv","joeravioli","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58886317/?ref_=tt_urv","4 September 2015","Lucy feels like a misplaced mash-up of silly sci-fi and a weird theoretical documentary, spiralling drearily from its boring beginning to its mind-blowingly pretentious ending. Sadly, it fails in both genres, sacrificing promising action for undue intelligence and coherence for unnecessary visual intricacy, eventually creating a film that is so wrapped up in its far-fetched ideas, it cannot fathom even itself. However, there are certain brief moments in the film that are strangely interesting, occasionally even stimulating the mind beyond what is expected of a common Hollywood action film. That being said, those moments are extremely rare, and barely make up for the overwhelming awfulness of this ridiculous mishmash.The film begins with our hero, Lucy (played by the wonderfully distant Scarlett Johansson), being blackmailed, witnessing the death of the guy who blackmailed her, and crying an awful lot. Even from the beginning, as the dazed lighting, lack of definite setting and deliberately pretentious cuts to random nature shots (which are even more poorly lit) suggest, this movie has a bloated idea of itself, not realizing that it has provided nothing in its initial few minutes to hold the viewer in any way. Even the subsequent scene in which Scarlett Johansson is interrogated drags on for an awful long time, eventually becoming boring and repetitive.The movie eventually finds a premise: Lucy is exposed to some fancy new drugs which gradually allow her to use an increased amount of her brain, turning her not only into a lethal killing machine, but also an omnipotent goon with a Messiah complex. With all this new brainpower (and also the knowledge that she is going to die within the next 24 hours), she decides to bequeath her newfound knowledge to humanity, choosing a theoretical neuroscientist (Morgan Freeman) to be her disciple. This choice is made without any explanation, but whatever.Although my interest in the film remained nonexistent up until this point, I began to feel a certain vile hope creep up upon me, that hope manifesting itself as the promise of crazy, telekinesis-fuelled action scenes. The film had finally slithered past its horrible beginning, its ridiculous premise, and now could proceed into passive, violent oblivion. But, unfortunately, the film saw it fit to avoid such action for completely unnecessary visual eye-grabbers, and mundane sci-fi chatting. The action is thin, kept to a minimum, and slightly disgusting. It feels like the product of the mind of a teenager: unevenly paced, poorly filmed, pretentious, and laughable. Even the characters are unwatchable, being either stunningly wooden, evil, or simply boring.But eventually the film reaches its ending, where Lucy travels back in time and learns everything there is to know. That one short scene should have been a movie within itself. The visuals are breathtaking, but divinely subtle as well, picking apart what we think we know and showing us what is beyond the limits of our knowledge with such ease and fluidity, that it is hard to dismiss it. Of course, it's all unfounded nonsense, but it's stunning unfounded nonsense. Then, as a final reminder of how terrible this movie is, it shows us that all that was just an excuse to make Lucy into God. Huzzah. The End.This film isn't really sure what cinematic path to follow, and its failure to span two at once makes it entirely unwatchable.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

There were many times where I was hoping the story's action would be a little more ""up close and personal"", instead, we are given ""Limitless"" meets ""The Matrix"". Which by themselves are perfectly good movies, but they could have maintained some element of Lucy's humanity as it was very hard to relate to what she was experiencing.

The infinitesimal? What was I? Still a human being? Or was I the man of the future? If there were other bursts of radiation, other clouds drifting across seas and continents, would other beings follow me into this vast new world? So close - the infinitesimal and the infinite. But suddenly, I knew they were really the two ends of the same concept. The unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet - like the closing of a gigantic circle. I looked up, as if somehow I would grasp the heavens. The universe, worlds beyond number, God's silver tapestry spread across the night.And in that moment, I knew the answer to the riddle of the infinite. I had thought in terms of man's own limited dimension. I had presumed upon nature. That existence begins and ends in man's conception, not nature's. And I felt my body dwindling, melting, becoming nothing. My fears melted away. And in their place came acceptance. All this vast majesty of creation, it had to mean something.

The theme is that human beings really only use about 10% of their brains' full potential. So what if someone were able to tap into the other 90%? What would that person be able to do? What would they be like?Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, an ordinary average gal roped into an untenable situation by a guy she barely knows: deliver a mysterious briefcase to a Korean mobster named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). The contents consist of a synthetic drug that supposedly allows users to tap into that aforementioned 90%. It's inserted into her system, and she becomes a rapidly evolving super-human who turns to an eminent professor (Morgan Freeman) and a badass cop (Amr Waked) for help.Ultimately, it's pure fantasy & fiction, and this viewer certainly wasn't expecting anything resembling a documentary. It's very fast paced (clocking in at a mere hour and a half), action-packed, over the top, and ridiculous as all-get-out. Nevertheless, it's fairly amusing on that level, with some violence & gore, and a plethora of digital effects work.Scarlett is easy to watch, as always, and her performance can be monotonous at times, but generally it's entertaining. Freeman again projects effortless quiet authority as the films' requisite brain science expert. Choi is a hoot as the unrelenting villain, and Waked is good as he injects a little dose of humanity into the proceedings.All in all, this is something of a hoot, one that doesn't require the prospective viewer to work their own brains that hard.Six out of 10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

As the film starts, we see professor Norman explain to a class that humans only use 10% of their cerebral capacity and he proposes a theory of what would happen if we could somehow use more. The idea is good and part of his theories are too. Then we see Lucy, who actually gets to use more than just 10% of her cerebral capacity and we see the changes she goes through as she reaches 100%. My main issue with this film is that I felt like somewhere along the way they reached a point where they ran out of ideas and decided to turn this supposedly sci-fi film into a fantasy film. Some of the action scenes felt a little bit forced and out of place. I did enjoy watching this film nevertheless, the pace is good, the acting is good and the visuals are great. The story is interesting, but the way it develops is a bit crazy. If you're willing to overlook a few details and just take it for what it is, Lucy is a rather entertaining film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A lot of action movies fall out short on brains, yet this is top of the line. Whether you like it or not, you have to be attentive and focused to understand. Oh, but don't worry, you won't need to, 'cause you will be pinned down to your seat the whole ride.The story actually starts simple, but gets complicated as it goes. A girl named Lucy gets kidnapped in drug deal and something goes on about some discussion about how people's brains work and that we only use 10% of it, and some drug that could make people use their brains to 100%, and... you'll know where it's going at. Simply put, this is one of the best action movies i've ever seen. It tries to merge science-fiction and action, and i think that it's very ambitious. But, sometimes it could come out as a misfire. This one in particular, is not the case. I found every aspect of this movie perfect. From its' opening shot to the final. Character developments aside, it runs briskly and fast-paced at a rate of 89 minutes. Thrills are on the way from one scene to another. Scarlett Johansson runs the show. She gives Lucy's character to life. I don't even notice that it's even her anymore as the movie plays. The other cast done well with their given characters and although they don't give the movie more seasoning, they don't go down to be obnoxious. I heard some people really love and trash the movie at the same time. I understand why. Some will dismiss it as downright silly for the everything-is-possible way the movie goes and all the philosophy is total bull***t. But, that's not the reason to go to movies for pure logic and plausibility, right?. You go to them for entertainment. I think this movie is pure entertainment.Luc Besson has brewed a magnificent, thought-provoking, fun, silly, and sometimes weird and creepy movie. i'm hoping for more like this to come","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

The myth of humans only using 10% of our available brain power was debunked a long time ago (although I can understand why it persisted given the terrible decisions most of us make on a regular basis).That said, the film does have some plus points - production values are high and the acting is generally good. The first half in particular contains some scenes which generate genuine tension - it's not hard to imagine oneself in a situation (like Lucy) where your fate is completely determined by others and your life is of little concern.Unfortunately the second half of the film is something of a mess, with action and special effects taking the limelight rather than the story or dialogue. It would have been nice to find out a little more about Lucy and how she came to be in this situation.Overall I'd say this film isn't terrible, but I think an opportunity was missed to create an interesting and compelling story.

She is forced to be a drug mule for a new designer drug that accidentally leaks inside her. The overdose results in her unlocking 100% of her brain's capacity, becoming an unstoppable warrior intent on getting revenge. The concept of a person reaching super human level capabilities through some drug and then going all badass is intriguing for sure. Also Johansson is no stranger to being a badass in movies, so she plays well as the lead. The problem remains that the movie concentrates so much on delivering on the style that you'll not care for the little substance there is.Full Review:So, Limitless + Black Widow + Neo from The Matrix? Hell yea count me in! That triple threat combo is exactly what I thought when I first saw the trailers for Lucy, so you could imagine I was quite pumped to watch this movie. Unfortunately I underestimated the epicness of that combo and Johansson ends up being so overpowered that the whole sense of danger is taken out of the movie.If you have seen the recent Marvel movies especially Captain America: Winter Soldier you know that Scarlett Johansson has proved to be a great action star. Lucy gave her the perfect opportunity to be the lead in her own action film, and she owns it for the most part. It was entertaining to see the sudden change from a vulnerable young woman to a methodical killer. The powers she has gradually increases over the duration of the movie, but about the half-way point it is abundantly clear that she has become a generic powerful killer. The power takes all the tension out of the action scenes because there is not going to be any real danger for you to care about. As for becoming an overly methodical killer, essentially all character is sucked out of Lucy and you are left with a emotionless robot that you can't relate to.Director Luc Beeson is a very visual director, and that is the strength of this movie. All the action scenes are very well filmed. There are no cheap tricks like shacky cam, the shootings are all very well edited and paced. There is one car chase that is definitely one of the best in recent memory. So I must give credit to the visual style. There is one thing that Beeson tries that I think will get some mixed reactions. In the beginning few times some national geographic type clips of animals are shown to mirror what's happening in the movie. I personally found it to be interesting but then it's not used at all. It's as if Beeson lost all confidence in this experiment. Why do it with half effort? Either follow through or don't do it all.Lucy is not a terrible movie, there are some things to enjoy. As a whole I wouldn't recommend paying full price to watch in cinema. Marvel, just give us a Black Widow movie!Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Although lacking logic, Lucy is still an ambitious action film held together by a remarkable female driven role.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3064732/?ref_=tt_urv","LloydBayer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20871749/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2014","Rife with analogies and open-ended questions, Lucy is a science fiction film that is every bit slick, stylized and surreal, and everything else you would expect from French action director Luc Besson. Like Besson's previous films, the extent of plausibility is directly proportional to the viewer's cerebral capacity, which, believe it or not, is what the narration is all about.Using one of the most debated questions of our time – the capacity of the human brain – Besson's script begins with the visible one-thirds of a hypothetical iceberg. Documentary-like intercuts stand in for creation and existence with an opening scene on cell multiplication. This is further explained by Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman, no less) who in a conference in Paris, goes on to illustrate the cosmic relationship between death and immortality and how this relates to using 100 percent of the human brain. Freeman's main purpose in this film is to sound calm and calculated like when he presents documentaries, and to make scientific mambos jumbo sound profound, like he does in other films; using that voice, his second purpose is to bust the myth that humans only use 10 percent of their brain. Thousands of miles away, Norman's illustration becomes a metaphysical reality when Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American student in Taiwan, is tricked into working for a Korean drug lord. While another cutaway shows a deer stalked by cheetahs, it suffices to say that Lucy is naïve but not dumb because her focus soon turns to Darwinian survival. This is where Besson amps up the action when Lucy is ingested with an experimental drug called CPH4, a synthetic version of a metabolic enzyme secreted during pregnancy. As a primary effect, Lucy experiences a surge in cerebral capacity. Now at 20 percent, she is literally bouncing off the walls.Before Lucy exacts her revenge, ala dual wielding guns blazing, her transformation is shown at 10 percent intervals. This is fascinating mainly due to Johansson's performance at each interval and her character's evolution into a different being. Without giving away the best parts, all I'll say is at 30 percent Johansson's Lucy is a notch above her Black Widow in the Marvel film franchise, and way ahead of Dr. Manhattan's DC comic book world by the time she hits 70 percent. Then it gets all weird to the point where you question Besson's cerebral capacity while writing the script. With an obvious inspiration from a ton of similarly themed films, it's safe to say that the main plot arcs are borrowed from The Matrix, Transcendence and especially Limitless. Although Besson won't find much praise for originality, you could say his creation of Lucy is as much a new cinematic super hero as his Frankenstein-ish approach in creating her piece by piece. Having said that, it is imperative that the audience appreciates her flaws more than her abilities because it's more about what she is becoming rather than what she can do. Through this creation, Besson's vision is clear but it is still not an excuse for his laughable hypothesis followed by a questionable ending.Besides the unnecessary cramming of anthropology, paleontology, neuroscience and the mind boggling space-time continuum, Besson's forte is in the action set pieces and it shows. From locales in Taiwan to white-knuckle car chases in Paris, to a hypothetical encounter with our ancestral primate, the action is heavy handed even with subtle injections of humour. This might all seem traditional for Luc Besson, given his pedigree for femme fatal films like Nikita and The Fifth Element, amongst other classics. With Lucy, Besson's nonsense and lapse in logic is bearable, and at times enjoyable, thanks to the film's only saving grace and that is Johansson. Fresh off the critical success of 2013's Her and Under the Skin, both science fiction dramas, Johansson could be the new name in female driven plots, even if that means running the gauntlet with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence. But as far as myth busting goes, there's more to Johansson than meets the eye. Blond or not.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

On the other hand, all this captivates and the viewer is not allowed to get bored. Of course, the main plot about the myth of human use of the brain looks 10% stupid. The plot is dynamic, but the motivation of the main character is banal and stupid. Lucy is a vivid example of an empty movie that only has a bright cover. Of course, you can watch it once, but no more if you endure the pathetic stupidity of the plot.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

An Insane Action film, that rides high on innovation & execution. 'Lucy' Synopsis: A woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic.'Lucy' is about a women who gains psychokinetic abilities when a nootropic drug is absorbed into her bloodstream & how her powers appear to be of a god. Its destruction, mayhem everywhere & yet its thoroughly engaging. The protagonist's unexplainable journey with herself, comes with a lot of action/gore, but its all such fun!Besson's Screenplay is top-notch, scoring high on rush & pace. His Direction, on the other-hand, is extremely stylish. Thierry Arbogast's Cinematography is engrossing. Julien Rey's Editing is razor-crisp, as the film culminates within 88-minutes! Éric Serra's Score is good. Graphics are outstanding. Action-Sequences are expertly choreographed.Performance-Wise: Scarlett Johansson nails the part. As Lucy, Johansson delivers a striking, affecting performance, that certainly ranks amongst her best works to date. Morgan Freeman is efficient, as always. Choi Min-sik is wicked to the core. Amr Waked is adequate.On the whole, 'Lucy' is one winner! Strongly Recommended!","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Probably hit or miss for most viewers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5710968/?ref_=tt_urv","puschit-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6119848/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2020","This movie has an interesting premise but doesn't do much with it. It has many, many flaws and you'll have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy it. A lot. Virtually every minute.See, the main problem isn't that much that the entire movie bases on the myth that we only use 10% of our brain. I am okay with that, you take this one thing, establish that this IS true in the world this movie takes place and then go with it. But everything else isn't any better. Our brain is doing ONE thing: Thinking! So this drug would make us super smart but that's it. But in the movie the drug allows her to do everything from telekinesis to shapeshifting and outright magic. There are lots of scenes with pseudo-science talk that tries to explain this but you don't need to be a scientist to know all of it is more than fiction, it's fantasy.On top of all that pseudo-science you'll also get an even bigger dose of pseudo-philosophy. I don't know if they just mixed every remotely related eseteric theory or if it's the fault of the mostly horrible dialogues, but seriously, most of the science and philosophy talk in this movie sounds like they took all the rejected ideas that Lindelof wrote for LOST but were considered too crazy or corny even for him!If it was just the bad science and corny philosphy, I wouldn't complain, though, as long as it's just a vehicle for a fun action movie. However, it also affects the script and movie.
First, there are many illogical scenes that wouldn't even work within the bad science we get presented. For example Lucy just watches someone speaking a few lines of mandarin and a moment later she is fluent in that language. No matter how smart, you can at best learn the words that have been spoken. Or, later she begins to disintegrate when she is running low on drugs. She literally lost many of her teeth, her skin was peeling off in clouds of dust >and eye was displaced<. Then she takes more drugs and the process isn't just stopped, it magically changed her to the state she was in minutes earlier.But more importantly, the authors somehow wrote themselves into a corner about one third into the movie because at that point she was already a being with superpowers that nobody could match and here adversaries are still simple humans. During her next encounter with the bad guys there is no fight anymore, she just makes them float around.
So, in order to still have some action scenes, what did they do? Lucy forgets about her superpowers, locks herself in with those scientist to have a slow verbal conversation about her current state even though she is about to build a supercomputer and store every information she has. This forces the poor police to fight the bad guys themselves even though Lucy could have dispatched them easily within a minute or so.And once you start looking for things like this, you'll notice them everywhere. The very first thing she does after the drugs start powering here is killing half a dozen henchmen with ease within a second. She kills guards without flinching, even that poor guy on the operation table. But she lets the crime boss that is responsible for all of this go without killing him? And again, later, in the police station, she does it again with the captain of the henchmen? Just so we can have another unecessary encounter with them later?
Lucy does, however, kill a lot of innocent byspenders during her car romp through Paris. I mean, yes, we don't see anybody get killed on screen but come on, that many crashes, flipped cars and so on can't be without casualties.And most of this would easily be avoidable. All they would have needed to do is one of two things:
A) Either tone it down and give her superpowers later in the movie, bit by bit
OR
B) simply let that henchman captain eat some of the remaining drugs at some point so he gets superpowers as well so we can have a proper fight!But as it is this movie doesn't work as SciFi thriller because the science is so bad, it doesn't work as a philosophic or fun movie because Lucy doesn't really do anything with it, but it also doesn't work as an action movie. I don't even know why many claim it to be one, there aren't many action scenes and the ones we have are either unnecessary, short, underwhelming or a combination of those.So, why do I still rate it 6 then? It still got that many stars for the eye candy and generally everything else that hasn't to do with the plot. Johanson played well in the first half (later on she is like an emotionless robot) and the special effects were quite good. I was also pleased to see authentic set pieces in Taiwan (I have family there, so I can tell it's genuine). The movie has a lot of potential but it just doesn't know where to go with this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Lucy is utter nonsense, utter chaos, love, and modern dialectic. As we are questioning the meaning of life, we rather tend to obey other circumstances which are of different matters. As such we do take notice how a wonderful main actress does a superb job in a fantasy driven action thriller. Not that it would matter, but she does entertain as action hero, in contrast to the nice and sassy blonde chick with the amazing sex appeal, we are used to. But it would be unfair to state this movie good qualities just because of her, there are too many good actors and great performances to mention them all. To be honest, the story itself is the weakest spot of Lucy. Darn it. They could have emphasised a little bit more on this topic, life and evolution, more than the average peeper deserves.

Scarlet was the reason I vouched for this movie, and she was appealing and pleasant to watch, but the other actors, except Freeman, didn't impressed me much. The movie started a bit in the rush and was promising a thrilling plot, but it was less than that. Instead we got an average Hollywood spoof with lot of scientific misconceptions, that promised to give us intelligent, philosophical thoughts and it was all except that. The Revolution and Evolution theory was interesting for the starter, but it's a thing that every nature science student is being taught, and the movie doesn't pass anything above that. Almost all other scientific stuff is fiction and that's not the way how science- fiction movies should work. Sci- fi is a genre that should contain fictional elements out of scientific background, not otherwise. But hey, it's Hollywood, and we are somehow used to it. Regarding the action part, Luc Besson likes to rush things and give us fast, wordless, action scenes, but here, he missed the plot completely and therefore I thing he should stuck with plain action movies instead with the wannabe intelligent sci-fi fantasy movies.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

That is true. But if you look at it from another point of view then this movie can still be enjoyable. It sure has got speed, action and suspense.The weakest point however is the impossible ludicrous story. What is the ludicrous story about? Scarlet Johansson becomes a forced drugmule at gunpoint. The drug she carries however accidentally gives her superhuman capibillities, that is the ludicrous part of this story. How ludicrous? Well, she can melt with machines, she can stop bullets, travel through time back to the dinossaurs. Ludicrous enough? Still there is something to be applauded for in this picture and that is it's guts. It dares to try mix a normal gangster movie with vague scifi nonsense. And surprisingly enough I watched it till the end, however bizarre and plain stupid the story was. Normally I really dislike implausible stories, let alone this kind of bizarre time travel story. But somehow director and writer Luc Besson pulled it off. It could have been better though with a more credible story, now it is merely a good action packed scifi B movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It wanted to create the mental image of the oldest human fossils which Lucy.The movie begins when splitting up cells are caught on camera. Shortly after that we see a chimp in prehistoric times drinking form a lake. Then Scarlett Johansson narrates by saying that is how life begins which was a good introduction.The movie takes place when Scarlett Johansson is studying in Taiwan and is dating Pilou Asbaek a drug dealer she met at a nightclub. Pilous has a delivery to Min-sik Choi When he tricked Scarlett and cuffs her to the briefcase forcing her to make the delivery her self. Regardless of her options she is forced to meet Min-sik Choi, who acts like a dangerous drug lord who kills ends up killing Pilous. Scarlett then discovers that the briefcase contains the synthetic drug as she is forced to work for Min-sik Choi as drug mule with three other men and transport the drug to Europe hidden in their abdomens. However one of her captors kicks her in the abdomen and releases the drug in her body. Soon Scarlett enhances her brain capacity and develops her physical and mental capabilities. She uses her abilities to kill the criminals and flees. However her power does not stop increasing and is destroying her unless she gets more of the drug to stabilize her body.She contacts Morgan Freeman, who takes the role of an authorized brain expert, and becomes her only hope to save her. But the drug lord wants to retrieve his drug and is hunting Scarlett down.Scarlett Johansson who plays the role of Lucy who tired her best to making it look like an outstanding movie. She tired to give her best performance in all aspects on the Lucy's role. Pilou Asbaek had to take the role of an emotional helpless deliveryman which he did a horrible job. I think he could have done a better job if he was given another scene in the movie. Min-sik Choi took the role of a drug lord which he did a good job. Morgan Freeman did a great job on taking his part of the scene regardless of the movie. Amr Waked took the his scene has an officer of the law who ended out on being on Scarlett Johansson side has done a good job regardless of acting as a confused officer. The things I liked form the movie was how it was collaborated and the performance of Scarlett Johansson, Min-sik Choi and Morgan freeman. They are the ones who tired to make the movie seem real. But there are also some drawbacks after the 30 minutes in to the movie is where there is too much fake science and unrealistic events happen. They made the movie seem childish and pointless. The lesson to be learnt here from this movie is trust people wisely. Not everyone act like what they look like. People have a different background regardless of their story. Always looks are deceiving no matter what their character is all about.If you like science fiction this is the movie for you. I would recommend it for kids from 8-10 years old. Form my point of view this is a horrible and pointless movie ever directed and made. This is the worst Sic-fi thriller movie.When rating this movie, it deserver's a 3 out of 10 because of its unrealistic features. If they had removed some of the unrealistic features it would have been a great movie given to its storyline.An undergraduate studying international business form China gave the following review.

I am really eager to see Lucy (2014), although I'm little sceptical about it. Let's see if he still got it!8 minutes - oh my god! the music, style, action, acting just wow... amazing from the very start. It kind of gives you an idea what can you expect to see later on.30 minutes - it's wild... really crazy wild. You have seen so much already and you still have no idea what to expect.37 minutes - OK... the story is a little ridiculous but the dialogues between people are even more off... Nobody would react the way they do... it just feels fake...50 minutes - definitely original but I was hoping for something more action oriented. You know guns, fighting etc. It's focused more on evolution and possibilities which is amazingly interesting as well.Damn... what a weird movie... Worth seeing but it's really weird... Totally different from what I have expected. Great original story, nice effects but after few first actions, it felt more like watching a ""what if..."" documentary on Discovery channel...

But if you go into this movie just looking for a stylish action flick, it's fun.The movie is based on that old myth that humans only use 10% of their brain, and tries to imagine what someone was like who could maximize their brain usage. When an ordinary woman named Lucy accidentally absorbs a huge amount of a new drug, her brain starts ramping up and she becomes, as the percentage increases, a super soldier, a superhero, and a god. The movie is slick and stylish. It's often gimmicky, as in a scene where Lucy's first meeting with some bad people is intercut with wilderness footage, but it all works quite well.This is the sort of movie you could really pick apart. The problem is not that the 10% brain thing is BS, which doesn't bother me at all, but that the movie is often sloppy in its internal logic. For example, Lucy types on a computer and she's so fast that hundreds of windows are opening and closing, but a laptop is not mechanically capable of that speed. And if you accept that Lucy is using her mind to control the PC, then WHY IS SHE TYPING? And no matter how souped-up Lucy's brain becomes, it wouldn't allow her childhood brain to have taken in the sort of data she recalls.The movie is silliest when it has Lucy describe what it's like to be a super mind. There's a lot of talk about memories and sensitivities and time that all sounds like what someone tells you when they're describing their acid trip. The truth is, if someone were that smart, they would probably have difficulty talking to us at all; we would be animals.Still, it's lots of fun, and I do recommend it for all its flaws.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's difficult for me to understand how a film like ""Transcendence"", not perfect by any means but enjoyable and intelligent nonetheless, can be damned to obscurity by critics yet ""Lucy"" is being hailed as inventive, exciting summer entertainment. The ""AI"" tone of this movie is by far one of the worst interpretations of that specific idea that I have ever seen in a sci-fi film. Please do not waste your time/money on this film.

Despite its ambition, for some odd reason, it settled on a mere 90-minute runtime. While I often tend to be a fan of short straight-to-the-point films, here, the short duration is only damaging. As such, the resulting film often feels unfocused and rushed.That isn't to say that there aren't good things in it as well. Indeed, there are quite a few of them. First of all, the concept in Lucy is great. I was all aboard with the idea of exploring how powerful the human brain might be, assuming we were able to access all of its capabilities. And while that concept and everything it brought with was one of the better parts of this film, the way it's was explored and brought to the silver screen, was one the worst. There are so many ideas and so many concepts that it tries to fit into one concise film, that no matter how long the run time would've been, I doubt it could've ever made much sense. And although I do admire the insanity that it tries to control and manage, I can't help but feel that there never was an intention to make a film that would've captured it all in a reasonable manner. However, despite an apparent struggle to contain and showcase all of these ideas, they do create a rather interesting overall product.Now, while there is a lot to like conceptually, there are also some fairly odd choices. They are thankfully apparent mostly in the beginning and slowly start to fade away as the film kicks into gear. One example, out of the many, could be the use of weird parallelisms and metaphors to help the viewer along. Early on, as Lucy, the main character, has to enter an ominous building, the film quickly transitions into a shot of a mouse entering a mousetrap. It goes without saying that Lucy is supposed to be the mouse and the building the mousetrap. Since that much is obvious without a metaphorical example from the animal kingdom, it begs the question, why was it there in the first place, and why were there others like it later? One theory, and this one of my own making, is that we humans are nothing more than animals. Not the most creative, I know, but bear with me for a second. A big part of the film and what it most adamantly tries to say is that we, humans, are trapped by our own constructs. That we would indeed be just like animals, had we not created the rules and laws that govern our lives. That idea, then, opens up the seemingly endless possibilities that could be unlocked with using our brains to their fullest capacity. Could we, potentially, control all matter and thought? Could we, even, travel through time, unbound by the laws of nature? The movie clearly thinks so. And in its attempt to make us think so as well, it paints a picture of the two different beings using those aforementioned metaphors. Animals and humans on the one hand and humans that are no longer trapped by the limits of their brains, on the other hand.As I said, it's a great concept. And although I wasn't a big fan of the heavily used parallelisms, they certainly got the point across. However, the biggest problem wasn't the concept or how it was delivered. What made Lucy difficult to watch, at times, was the clear lack of focus. That concept alone could've easily been made into a movie of its own, and it would've probably been longer than what we have here. But despite its constraining length, Lucy tries to do so much more. At the same time as it's exploring human nature and the deepest questions of our existence, it also tries to create a John Wick-esque action thriller. As a result, both parts suffer. Either this movie should've been twice as long, or it should've focused on being one thing. I think it could've been a great action thriller with the elements of revenge it had built into it. I also think it could've been a great sci-fi film had it only focused on exploring the concept it so heavily relies on. However, trying to combine the two, especially in the way it was done, created a lacklustre result that failed to make me care.But at the end of the day, despite its problems, which there are many of, there is a good amount to like here. As it explores the concept and all the possibilities that might come with unlocking our brains, it creates a visually stunning experience. And the action is also quite fun. And had it not been for the overabundance of ideas that were attempted to be included, Lucy could've been a great film. As it stands, though, it ultimately failed to make an impact on me, despite dealing with such an interesting idea.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

What this movie does well, it's starts a conversation about it for everyone who hasn't heard (enough) about it yet.
My first impression was that 'Lucy' is going to be a really bad movie, just existing so that Scarlett gets to be a Superhero as well, since in the Marvel movies she has no superpowers. But 'Lucy' is actually way more than that.
Especially the ending was interesting and even if the 10% statement is wrong, the movie could even work if they didn't involve the percentages. In it's state, it is a well portrayed adventure we get taken on and makes you question some aspects of life and your own potential and it's always great when a movie achieves something like this.
At the moment I feel torn about 'Lucy'. My thoughts went all across the board in the ratings, but in the end it is thought-provoking enough for a 7/10 and I would recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, Besson was less happy in thinking that a subject like this could result in anything more than a common science fiction-film. Not even a prominent lead like Scarlett Johansson is able to lift 'Lucy' from its corresponding flat story.Which inevitably brings us to the conclusion that Johansson wastes her great acting talent here. Or to be more precise: the more Johansson moves away from mankind's common 10 to 15% capacity, the more her acting vanishes into thin air. It is no surprise that Scarlett Johansson's characteristic down-to-earth performance comes out best in the beginning of this film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Maybe I am just too stupid to see the undertones and implications of the writer, but the last third of the movie left me unsatisfied and confused. I did find the CGI and special effects entertaining but much of them were unneeded and seemed more as filler. Towards the end there is a big CGI sequence that I feel the director was trying to use to explain an important concept, but did not seem very clear. Additionally, the characters were terrible. There was no development of any characters, other than Lucy's mathematical progression. As a lover of action and science fiction films, Lucy left me dissatisfied.

It did seem very short and the main character didn't really show off her amazing capabilities in the normal world but I did enjoy it's originality and some of the action scenes. The story of Lucy is quite simple but extremely technical. She was basically kidnapped by a group of thugs who implanted a special substance into her stomach for her to carry across the border. When the substance bursts, it gives her access to part of her brain which a normal person can't understand, except for a professor who is played by Morgan Freeman. I think, the thing that let a lot of people down is that the director over complicated the storyline with technical jargon which no one can understand. He could have easily made it into a more interesting movie by slowing down the process of the brains progression and to see her take her revenge with her new powers but the movie seemed rushed and a waste of a good concept. I was intrigued with her capabilities and we're they were going to end up but I honestly think that Luc Beeson missed the opportunity to make a classic. Watchable!Round-Up: Scarlett Johansson, really isn't showing any signs of slowing down and with profits like she made with this movie, I'm sure that she will be getting many calls from the big studios. With the new Avengers, Ghost in the Shell and another Captain America in the pipeline, she definitely has made the right choices in her career and at the young age of 30, I'm sure that were going to see her challenge her acting skills with some different type of roles soon. Its always a joy to see Morgan Freeman on the big screen but he hasn't done anything major since the poor Las Vegas, which should have been better with such a great cast. He seems to be doing these bit parts which have been pretty disappointing, like in Transcendence and Oblivion so I hope that he will reach his Seven type status soon. As for this movie, I thought that the concept was great but the director wasted to much time on fancy graphics and technical jargon. Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $459million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/action/mystery movies about a woman who gets implanted with a special substance which bursts and gives her special powers. 6/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

She thinks the bullets out of the bottom of a pistol...magazines don't work that way, she uses a CB radio to access a mobile phone conversation... again, ouch. The only reason I give this movie 7 stars instead of the 5 that it deserves is that someone in Hollywood was intelligent enough to borrow one of South Koreas greatest actors, Choi Min-Sik. Directors may not be geniuses, but they can at least try and look one up in a phonebook. Luc Besson... Leon The Professional is in my top 10 list. What happened?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

To ice the cake, the ending was a complete let-down that left you scratching your head and asking ""that was it?"". For a film that seems to be an intelligent concept about the intelligence of mankind and the possibility of utilizing 100% of the human brain, the overall feeling of this film is just plain ignorance, and it is yet another experience best saved for the cheapest options like DVD or the cable.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

It is only recently that I decided to watch this movie. Lucy follows Scarlett Johansson playing Lucy, a woman, who, after being implanted with performance-enhancing drugs, obtains marvellous abilities, gaining access to the unused 90% of her brain.Just a brief warning if you plan on watching this movie, this movie is not an action thriller. At least in my opinion. There are many scenes which would lead you to believe so, along with the film's trailer, but, especially in its final act, this movie is VERY much science fiction. Some may be put off by this but don't let this fool you!However, something I noticed whilst watching this film that may not bother you too much, is that, once Lucy achieves the effects of the drugs, she becomes practically invincible, causing the movie to not have much keeping you gripped on the action sequences.Another thing that I wasn't particularly fond of was the sudden cuts to nature to act as parallels to situations in the early first act.Nevertheless, the movie doesn't disappoint. Johansson is incredible, as per, likely due to the similarity from previous role, Black Widow; the action sequences are very well done, it isn't impossible to watch with quick cuts and shaky cam, to my, and many other viewers relief; and finally, the movie is a very fun watch.This movie is just a great time and I recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for anything fantastic or too well thought out in certain departments.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the Lucy tale, an innocent woman is captured by drug lords who stash a developmental hormone drug in her belly to smuggle it into Europe. Then they make the mistake of kicking her and releasing the drug into her. She turns into a superhuman who can use much more of her brainpower than you or I, and initially kills the drug lords like flies, but then realizes she has a bigger mission.Lucy has an interesting premise: what if the human mind is somehow capable of much more, including telekinesis, levitation, and all those things we occasionally dream we could do. The film posits that current science of the brain is not even scratching the surface, and consciousness can control matter. Fine.The problem is that it portrays current science incorrectly at a level that will make any educated high school student cringe. Nothing is wrong with the premise of the film, but if something transcends our current knowledge, at least present current knowledge as we know it correctly at the high school level. (1) Life arose well over a billion years ago. (2) The 10% brain thing is pop psychology of the 1950s. It's 2014, Luc! Etc. And if high school students will giggle (like the ones who sat next to me in the theatre), imagine someone who knows a bit about the current state-of-the-art in neuroscience!Moral: If you're going to use bad science, as opposed to extrapolate good science, at least don't flash a %-value on the screen every 10 minutes as a reminder !La Femme Nikita is just a much better film in the same genre: a woman turned into a deadly weapon that goes out of the control of her handlers. Lucy is a return to familiar fare for Besson, but he got it right the first time around, and ultimately fails here. If mathematics does not describe the secrets of the universe, how come you can summarize Lucy's important knowledge on a USB memory stick? That's a math-based device.The film features many interesting ideas and shots, like the cutting between Lucy/druglords and a gazelle/cheetah; or the scene about cell division, sex and birth, although the religious crowd will not like the interposition of animal and human behavior. And of course there is the Lucy that started it all in East Africa, whom modern Lucy gets to meet once she controls time. For these and other good ideas, the film still gets a 6. But for the lame science (spewed with laughable authority by Morgan Freeman), lame dinosaur action, stupid plot holes that don't belong in a film with high aspirations, and the ""Lucy is the Matrix"" ending, that's as high as it goes. I recommend seeing La Femme Nikita again instead.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Our protagonist, with the help of a new drug, manages to use a lot more than that. Scarlet Johanson did a pretty good job as the lead, going from a normal women to an extremely smart and powerful being. And you had to have a wise guy to give exposition about the concept of the movie and who better to have than Morgan Freeman. He was, as always, great. Now the movie had some really cool concepts and ideas, and some REALLY good scenes. But you have to be willing to apply a lot of suspension of disbelief because there is some really unbelievable stuff in this movie. If you go on wondering about the logic of it all, you'll ruin it. The not so good execution of certain elements stopped it from reaching greatness. First of all, the whole Mafia stuff was extremely pointless after Lucy got her powers. They should have focused on her powers and similar plot elements instead. What makes it more annoying is the fact that movie was really short, about 1 hour and 20 mins in duration only. A longer duration with more emphasis on her powers, development etc would have made it a lot better, instead they montaged her powers in the end. Then, like I mentioned earlier, the plot is really unbelievable. Even if you suspend lot of disbelief, you'll still be like WTF in many scenes. The CGI was okay-ish. Some scenes looked good while some clearly looked fake. Don't blaming it much though considering it only had 40 million $ budget. IN a way, this movie was somewhat like Transcendence, great albeit not a new concept and stuff but not so good execution. Good thing for this movie though was that it was still entertaining despite its many flaws. You'll definitely have a good time with it and might even wonder about philosophies and ideas depicted in the film. 7.3/10","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

In the middle of all of this, I had zero awareness of Lucy, which says to me that Hollywood did no marketing at all, which is, admit it, another outrage. As we currently sit and watch Hollywood devour itself, I can't help but rejoice, even though I generally disagree with ScarJo's politics...or whatever she has been assigned to say. Okay. Oh, yeah, the movie. Full of so many missed opportunities in the science that it seems reminiscent of ScarJo's actual career, and full of so many ludicrous fabrications of pseudo science that a person wonders if the writers were taking the blue powder (which is not a powder at all, but rather chunky particles), every part of the movie seems like it is a parody of the real world of ScarJo, including time running out. But I need to give a nod to the special effects which are very nice. In general, the movie told a story, and stuck to it rather well. The acting is solid.

Luc Besson fails miserably at both attempts; the action sequences are clichéd and tedious, while the faux-viscerality of the Cronenberg-esque sections are arbitrary and equally ham-fisted.

Lucy is inadvertently given a drug which allows her to access more than 10% of her brain, giving her superhuman powers. For the record, it is NOT TRUE that humans only use 10% of their brain. If you replace the phrase ""unlocked x% of her brain"" with ""unlocked x% of superhuman capability"" or something like that, it's much more bearable. Further, the movie presents itself as a thinker movie, when in reality it is more of an abstract expressionist movie. It doesn't give you literal or realistic explanations for things (anything, really), instead it gives you flashy visual effects designed to give you the sense of what is really going on (which are, admittedly, really cool and very well done). The acting is solid, though as an actor I'd be thinking ""this is bullshit, but I'll say it anyway"". Luc Besson's wacky and weird style with a laser focus on small details remains present, but he has done and could do better.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The main reason I picked this movie up was Lucy wasn't the best of films but it wasn't bad. It started off pretty good actually, with some nice action and suspense, it kept me kind of interested. It was when the movie got towards the end when everything for me got kind of far-fetched. From the beginning, this film could have easily started a creationism vs evolution debate. That's one of the things that made this film start off pretty good actually. Morgan Freeman's acting in this film was awesome as usual and Scarlett Johansson playing a kind of super hero in this film was great as well. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is caught up in a drug smuggling deal that accidentally turns her into a super human then goes after her captors and is aided by Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). Like I said earlier, it starts off pretty good but towards the end it gets kind of far-fetched. Now I'm not a neuropsychologist but I think there are some feats that are impossible even if you actually used 100% of your brain capacity. I know you might say well it's a science fiction movie, but even if I'm watching a science fiction film I would still like for the laws of physics to be respected.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's a footlooseness in Lucy that reminds you of his early stuff: But his early stuff is more enjoyable. It's hard to pin down exactly why. But I'll try.Lucy loses it because it's just plain weak. The premise and setup is morally hazy. It just doesn't compute, in the sense of metabolizing into compelling development. I think that, as time goes by, I have less and less patience for hyperbolic, action-flick, urban fairy tale-style ""evil""; and this flick's setup sequences establish exactly that. Sorry, but I guess I prefer human-dimensioned evil in my urban fairy tales, unless you're pointing the projectile over the wall of my credulity and firing all rockets, like, say, Robert Rodriguez, or a lot of fantasy/sci-fi (like Guardians of the Galaxy).To me the whole sideshow involving Freeman and his coterie was an attempt to gussy the proceedings up with a Greek chorus. It was supposed to add theoretical rigor/gravitas, but just winds up coming off like cheap VO exposition of dubious scientific provenance, writ large.There is a mythic element, and it's the ongoing play on the concept of a young woman moving toward an inadvertent, human-manufactured goddesshood, a la Dr. Manhattan. OK, that's sort of cool, and the film does deliver something compelling on that myth. It redeems the flick a little. But it still doesn't feel like enough. It's not an adequate basis for a 90-minute sitting.In general, I found the film weak, and weakness in a film irritates me.I can't recommend it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I would have guaranteed that I would have seen it in theatres. The trailer came out almost a year ago and it instantly became one of my most anticipated for the summer. It's Scarlett Johansson in a Science Fiction based action film, what can go wrong? Especially with the writer director from Leon: The Professional and Taken? It had so many good things going for it, but sadly it was poorly executed.Johansson still had a great 2014 with The Winter Solider and Under The Skin, and she sure earned a lot of money from Lucy. But I think she has to regret how Lucy turned out. It tells the story of a random girl who gets a drug injected into her stomach, in turn allowing her to access her entire brain. Now I have heard from multiple people that we as humans in fact use much more than 10 percent of our brain. Apparently it's actually close to 100 percent. Even putting this aside the movie is garbage. There is absolutely no depth to these characters. None of the supporting characters are given material for us to care about. Even in Lucy's case, the only glimpse of depth was a short phone call to her mother. I guess I'm just not the audience for Artificial Intelligence films. Transcendence, A.I., and now Lucy. Here's hoping that Chappie can right that ship.The film also uses several strange cuts to animals reproducing and other tasks. But it's not like it's in an intelligent and ambitious way, because the cuts stop 15 minutes into the film. We don't get any sense of why they chose to perform this procedure on Scarlett or any back-story with this drug or the people behind this deal. It's a really dull film that is saved by Scarlett Johansson's solid performance and some surreal special effects. It was enough to make the film watchable for 90 minutes but I cant see that being the case for any longer. It tries to be much more ambitious and smart than it actually is. I would much rather have seen a revenge type story with Scarlett going after the gangsters, much like a Taken style film. With a better back-story with Lucy and the supporting characters.+Scarlett +Special effects & concept -Strange cuts -No character depth-No back-story of the drug -No likable characters 4.5/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I really am not. The extent of my scientific career thus far involved my internship at the U of A's chemistry lab. But even I know that nothing in this movie makes sense. The main argument against this viewpoint is that the movie is ""supposed to be fun, not realistic"". To that I will first say, thank the lord, because even its central premise (the idea that humans use only 10% of their brains) is a complete myth. But its inaccuracy is not (only) what made it a bad movie. There is no plot. The entire plot can be summed up in- Hot girl gets a drug, hot girl gets smart (an inaccuracy in of itself), Chinese gangsters try to kill her. Not only his, but the entire film discusses how dumb and oblivious we are, and how the filmmakers are smarter than us, even though there's a scientific inaccuracy EVERY TWO MINUTES! None of the actors are all that great, Johansen is there to be a pretty face, Morgan Freeman is there for a paycheck, and everyone else is just not noteworthy. The best part of this movie was laughing at when a character said, ""The world's first woman was named Lucy"", even though there is no concrete definition of a woman, ""Lucy"" was not a human nor the first hominid, instead one of the earliest discovered ones, and she was not named Lucy until she was discovered, because of a song playing while she was discovered (Lucy in the sky with diamonds). The only way this movie could be good is if it is viewed as a ""so bad its good"" flick. Oh, and the cinematography is slick at times. neither of those factors were any where new enough to redeem this movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie can be compared to others but aren't most movies nowadays ramped up contrivances of past scripts and monologues????!!!! The idea of this movie reminds me of James Bond movies, Jackie Chan movies and the movie Altered States. It has a little bit of everything for everyone (except young kids). Though, if you don't like action, Scarlett Johansson, surreal ideas or Morgan Freeman, you might not like this movie.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Scenes are predictable; there is no convincing explanation for the main character turn out to be the way she is at the end - except for the fact that she is Scarlett Johansson - and the fact that Morgan Freeman was thrown in there looks a lot like a desperate decision in the hope that the whole plot would appear any smarter.From an action-movie perspective, nothing interesting goes on either, as the main character seems to be nearly always on top of situations, offering no thrill to the viewer.In fact this is an extremely visual movie showing and attractive star who pretends to be doing intelligent stuff, whereas neither the characters not the plot get to be intellectually satisfactory.In my view, the 40million spent on this movie could and would be better spent on a university funds. And that's about the only thing I can think right now as an alternative for the producers to possibly redeem themselves.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some may find the trailer slightly misleading. The trailer showed Lucy, who has been slipped a bag of drug under her stomach and the bag of drug leaked which led to her god-like powers. However, as soon as you start watching this movie in the theatre, you are going to realise it is a sci-fi movie infused with scientific and philosophic facts. More so to the philosophical size. Having said that, the movie probably require the audiences with certain level of scientific education or open mindedness in order to understand or appreciate what's going on. Like Prometheus, lots of people coming out of the theatre scratch their head or yelling BS or stupid.Good job once again to director and writer, Luc Besson.

""Limitless"" was a film that was also built around the idea of accessing and using more of our brain's capacity. In ""Limitless"", the result was genius, which is believable and watchable. But in ""Lucy"", the result was supernatural powers like psychokinesis and mind control.I would surmise that money to make this movie came from criminal syndicates in Taiwan and Korea. Perhaps this is why the movie ends up with Korean gangsters slaughtering Western low life junkies in Taiwan. A lot of the action depicted by these gangsters were simply cut and paste from the tiresome genre of Asian gangster movies. There was nothing original.Were it not for its big budget and special effects, I would have given this a 2 out of 10 rating.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Well according to the movie Lucy we would turn into some sort of Jedi Master who can read minds, control objects and human bodies with the mind, suffer bullet wounds with no pain or weakness and eventually turn ourselves into some sort of spiritual being. We would lose all emotion and empathy; we would walk around aimlessly in a robotic, mindless manner and only be able to communicate using awful punchlines and mundane one word answers.Lucy is a student living in Taiwan, she meets a man in a nightclub, dates for a week and is then tricked into delivering a mystery briefcase to a man named Mr Jang. Inside the briefcase is a new illegal drug that they want to get into the big European countries, the drug is designed to enhance the users brain capacity in order to develop mental and physical strength. Lucy and several others are then knocked out and operated on, a pouch of this new drug is then inserted into their lower stomach in order for them to transport it via aeroplane. Then came the point in which the story took a massive nose dive into a complete train wreck of a movie. When Lucy awakes she is informed of what is happening and is transported somewhere unnamed where she is beat up and repeatedly kicked in the stomach. This results in the pouch splitting and the drug being released into Lucy's bloodstream. What follows can only be described as one of the most ridiculous concepts and poorly executed stories I have seen. Lucy begins crawling on the walls and ceiling, has inhuman strengths and can read minds. As her brain capacity grows so do her powers.Lucy isn't a superhero movie and it isn't trying to be but it feels like one but without a hero, its scientific side which it drums down the viewer's throat seems laughable and embarrassingly corny. It is impossible to connect with any of the characters, Scarlett Johansson starts well but then once the drugs kick in she turns into a robotic, dull, mundane shell of a human that merely walks around giving one word answers and really cheesy poorly delivered one liners. Morgan Freeman has wasted his time and effort on this movie, he has a backseat role and does his usual Morgan role of talking slowly and intelligently, which suits me fine if the movie is even half decent. The whole movie just feels completely pointless, there is no character depth or development, you care for neither and have no back story to any of them. There are some huge plot holes which it seems the creators literally could not be bothered to fill and the meaning behind the story which they are trying to deliver is pointless and pretentious. The movie has no aim, the ending is awful and even as you are approaching the end of the movie nothing is building, there is no suspense or interest in what is going to happen.To summarise, Lucy starts quite well, it's mysterious and looks very good visually. But the more you watch the worse it gets, things keep happening and when they do you question it all. It all feels pointless and half finished. I don't think the idea is actually that bad and I think they really could have created something decent with it but it was far too poorly executed.First Half = OK. Second Half = Appalling.The only credible factor about the second half of this movie is the special effects. Some of the effects look fantastic, a lot of time and effort went into them and it shows. That is honestly the only positive I have for this movie, well that and the short run time of 80 minutes.3/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Lucy deserves an 8.X.A lot of people are giving the movie low scores because they feel it is unrealistic. This is a fiction movie! It isn't a college seminar. The movie was set up so well that i think a lot of people started to view it as ""educational"" and forgot it is fiction. The movie is beautiful and very well done. It was difficult for me to deal with the character personalities for the first 15 minutes but there turned out to be an excellent explanation for that.It was certainly the most entertaining movie I have seen all year.

One recent exception being urrgghhh Under the Skin. What a come back from that one. Given my love of science fiction films this one was, for me, a grand slam.Morgan Freeman was fine, as always, in his supporting role. Special effects also takes a big prize. Visuals galore and even better on our local XD 'IMAX wannabee' size screen.This is a super FUN, action packed gangster/Sci-Fi film that includes the expected (Paris car chase mostly against one way traffic) and also many unexpected moments. The early raw and violent scenes give way to Scarlett's on screen transformation step-by-fun-step.From Neanderthals and American Indians to intelligence as possibly interstellar pure energy the movie never stops to take a breath in its 89 minutes (it did not seem that short)journey.Scarlett owns almost every scene and she does a stellar job. The film tosses a half dozen genres into a blender. Scarlett guzzles it down and runs with it.The script came up with, for me at least, a perfect ending. In this film Scarlett, Morgan, the Paris 'cop' and ultra-evil villain deliver a truly entertaining film.","15 out of 35 found this helpful.

Just like the way I felt about Robocop, the Hobbit, Red 2, and all these crap with those shiny outfits. This disappointment was anticipated so I was not truly disappointed.At the beginning, when Morgan Freeman first appeared, lecturing, and with flashbacks (of documentary) accompanying this scene, I felt this is SOMETHING. The combination of flashbacks of reality and the film, it can be good. However, as it turns out, this short 90 min film has a 45 min of BBC documentary within the package.As the med began to affect Lucy's brain and body, the film started to move into a 100% action film zone. In addition, that is when Lucy the Kick-Ass turned into Lucy the Hit-Girl. In addition, she just started to Kill every Bill (AKA these AWESOME mobsters), and every pedestrian. For the record, I do not really think that with high intelligence means deprived of empathy. However, I heard that God, the saver, the sign of mercy, would eradicate the entire human race just to 'save' them. However, why would you need to kill with super brain? BTW, that Captain (?) with that lovely French accent, what is the purpose of that character's existence? Lucy said something like 'I need you as my reminder'. However, for god's sake, what was he doing there? (Something like nothing?)And then they just started to do Fast & Furious, something like a more violent one of car chasing scene in the Italian Job （and a more rough one.BTW, I think it's time for traffic police to say 'why always me?' like Droba in European Championship (?)）.In addition, when it comes to the 'philosophical theories', this film is just a pretentious using all these 'fake theories' casually and try to use these to impress people like Da Vinci Code did (you can't deny that Dan Brown did a great job). Anyway, there was a thing or two that I agree with: time is the only measure of everything; the only thing that humans do consistently is inheriting the knowledge. What I, as an audience, really want to see in a film about this kind of subject matter, is how this complete exploitation of brain capacity can really elevate the human mind and soul. But all this film has ever shown me is: in the aspect of additional 'super powers': there's a 'XXL hearing aid'; a X-ray scanner applied for body and mind; an invisible 50.1 version 'Google glass'; a 'Vampire Diaries compulsion package on sale'; a really cool control and credible anticipation over gravity, body, objects , mind; a super cool limitless ticket supply of time traveling; in the aspect of emotions: no sense of pain, fear, desire These are all superficiality. Nothing was truly not anticipated. I guess you can say it's something as horrible as the Fifth Element, and I can see why Gary Oldman did not want to work with Luc Besson.In conclusion, Lucy is composed of 25% BBC Documentary, 25% Gangster Squad, 25% Fast & Furious, 25% Limitless and 100% CRAP.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

My first persuasion that she was a good actress came in The Prestige (2006) and Woody Allen's 'Match Point (2005)' and 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)' and even the bizarre noire 'Under the Skin (2013)'.In terms of completely capturing my imagination, it'll be hard for her to top her role as Lucy, in Luc Besson's current science fiction masterpiece of the same name. The fact is there's not much about Scarlett's features or symmetry that I'd call beautiful - she has a funny nose, which goes off in a different direction to her mouth, and on the big screen all that is exaggerated just enough to keep you wondering if she's beautiful or interesting, but in the package with her acting, she's phenomenal. In terms of holding your attention, Scarlett doesn't miss a beat and, I'm sorry Angelina Jolie, but she leaves what you do on screen, for dead. She's a movie maker's dream. She's one of the few females who can not only carry a movie, but she makes interesting choices and takes risks with those choices. This is one woman who is not going to die wondering if she left any of her talent and ability off screen. No sir. It's all up there in minute, focused and interesting detail. And for mine, in short, what Luc Besson achieves with Lucy as a revenge movie, is what Tarantino couldn't achieve in two volumes of Kill Bill. I'm a big science fiction movie fan, but it's been a long time since I've had anything satisfy my movie-going instincts on nearly every level. Tim Burton's Mars Attacks was the last, and that was in 1996. This movie, Lucy, is in a class almost of it's own. Perhaps once or twice there were script elements which reminded me of Brad Cooper's 'Limitless', but they were few and fleeting, given the execution, believability and outstanding effects of Lucy. I'm not going to go into the story. If you've wondered whether or not you really like Scarlett Johansson, this should make your mind up. And if you like a thrilling ride/sci-fi/revenge flick this is up there with the best of them. Scarlett's performance is worth the entry price alone.","15 out of 35 found this helpful.

Instead, the script contains about 15-20 mins of pseudo science lecturing by Morgan Freeman, which should, in theory, bolster the premise, but falls miserably as the actual supporting content is pretty ridiculous if you have any basic scientific literacy.In terms of scenes, there are a couple of long sequences where nothing really happens. You'd be well advised to use these for your bathroom break. The same goes pretty much for the first 10- 15 mins where everyone but Lucy speaks Korean and there are no subtitles. Don't worry, nothing that critical happens.In terms of acting, I'm not a great expert, but that film doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would pose a particular challenge for actors like Freeman and Johansson. Morgan Freeman reprised his typical (and probably clichéd) role of an authority figure. If you've seen it before, you will see it again. Johansson, on the other hand, had the more challenging task of appearing confident and unemotional, but also likable. Overall, the plot was uninspiring and the actual writing does little to make it more bearable. There is some nice CGI and a bit of dispersed action and shooting of random people. I didn't like this film and would not recommend it, but YMMV - if you're not too bothered with the details and are looking for a relaxing action film, this may be your thing.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's rather exciting. But don't bother with the film. I won't spoil the movie (any more than Luc Besson already has)with any plot giveaways because there really wasn't one. A plot, that is. I kept waiting for the movie to start. Kept waiting, kept waiting, then I realized it was about to finish. There is certainly a good idea lurking in here somewhere, but I couldn't find it, and neither could Monsieur Besson. Honestly, I was bored. There seems to be a real division in the reviews between loved it and hated it. The lovers, in my opinion, are far too easily pleased by shoot-outs and the notion of supernatural powers. And it was just a notion; there was no depth to anything.Contrary to some other reviewers, I thought Scarlet Johansson was terrible. I assume the woeful overacting in the first few scenes was her paranoid attempt to make sure no one thought she couldn't act when she became the emotionless automaton for the rest of the movie. And Morgan Freeman ... WHAT were you thinking? It's a good job he had to look thoroughly bewildered most of the time. I think he was. It's a paycheck, I guess. The ending ... uh ... yeah.

Have you seen Limitless? They did the same plot better. Have you seen The Avengers? Better use of Scarlett Johansson. Even The Lawnmower Man has the advantage of not being so pretentious over this film.The script is probably my biggest complaint- nothing is natural. Every line is ""on-the-nose,"" and clearly just there to move the story forward, without giving us any reason to care about the characters or to believe what's happening is real. Who is Lucy? We never really know, she's been instructed to act like a robot the whole movie. There's one scene where she talks about her past, but it's so unnatural and sudden that I couldn't care about it. The supporting characters also have terrible lines...Why are they after Lucy? It doesn't even matter, they're only in the movie to give Lucy and excuse to fight them. The editing and ""symbolism"" of the movie is also amateurish. There is no subtlety in this film- everything hits you on top of the head with a lead mallet. For example, the film starts off by juxtaposing images of animals with people...which was a little cheesy but I was willing to forgive it if the film kept up the motif. Nope. Just some random images of animals in the first 10 minutes and then never again. Why even bother? It's like the film is trying to impress some ""film school"" teacher. Random shots and juxtapositions happen for no other reason than ""because it makes the film look smart."" It's not, though- it's just obvious and cheesy. There were also no clever ideas or insights to the human condition here...just clichéd messages about life that you can get from any 9th grade biology book. OK, so before you say I'm taking it too seriously, and this is just supposed to be a popcorn action flick, I will admit some of the action scenes are awesome. However, they're the same scenes we saw in the trailer, or we've simply seen them done before in other films, but better.I would not recommend this film, at least not in the theater. Rent it or stream it or whatever, but this isn't a film to pay good money for. There are much better films out there about the same idea.","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

Besson delivers at his best in this perfect mix of Sci-Fi plot and real world action. There are numerous ideas in the script which make this movie stand out, entertaining and in fact, intelligent - which is what the whole plot is about.A great cast performs incredibly well with a script that has so much punch you're hooked from the first minutes to the end. The character development of Scarlett Johansson is outstanding, and nearly completely different from her performance as ""Black Widow"" (which is also great). This is NOT a revenge movie, as it was advertised by some dumb folks.

The setup was interesting, with Scarlett Johansson's character going from being a sobbing, confused student to being very calm and in control as the movie progressed. I thought that it would lead to something big, like perhaps she would use her abilities to do great things. However, as the movie continued, it got more weird than epic. The plot started to jump all over the place, ultimately going nowhere. When it ended, I couldn't believe it was over, as if Luc Besson ran out of juice and stopped writing all of a sudden. In my opinion, nothing was resolved and nothing was accomplished.Overall, I am disappointed because I wanted to see a really creative sci-fi action film with a promising heroic female lead but what I saw was one woman's 90 minute psychedelic drug trip.","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

It's bizarre concept and fast paced story telling is not the average Saturday night film to be put blankly. Much like many other films it provides a great cast playing the roles in pristine character that really makes you empathize (more with Lucy though) with the characters. I'm not sure if you could call it a superhero film as Lucy is not as such a hero, she is not a villain either, she is super, but not taking any sides. Despite this you find her story very compelling and you want to see her be more of a bad-ass and show off what she can do. Much of this film is a thrilling sci-fi adventure that you could find a lot more believable than iron man or Thor (Don't get me wrong I am all for superhero films like them) and you get to see a bad-ass array of abilities from Lucy. However I do have a few complaints, this film goes very quickly, 1. Because it is good 2. Because it is very short and starts to rush. I think that given an extra half hour this movie could have benefited and made a lot more use of some problems encountered earlier on in the film. And also as much as i loved it I wanted to see MORE Lucy as in, more of her being a bad-ass. I felt also a bit let down by the ending, it is rushed and to be honest I wanted to see a showdown between Lucy and all these guys, It would have been epic. But rather we got a rushed ending that made sense but still was lacking in points, sort of like when you get bored of a book so you skim through the end. It doesn't let you take it all in. And I was also left very confused at the abrupt ending. I could go on but I must urge you to see it and find out for yourself what I mean. Like all movies it has its flaws but truly it is a classic sci-fi film.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

But as the movie goes on, it become quite apparently how bad this stinking pile of turd this movie is.Before this movie, I didn't know Luc Besson is a racist. In the movie he purposely cast ALL asians as either villains (the korean gangsters, or the triads) or they are the props to be killed for no other reason then for comic relieve. Two instances stands out - when Scarlett Johansson's character shot a taxi driver simply because he can't speak English; and another instance when in the hospital, Lucy simply shot an Asian patient on the operating table in the head simply because she needs the surgeon to stitch her up. Had this being a white patient the plot would had been how Lucy using her vast intellect to cure this patient thus showing how much superior she is - but instead, the plot portrays asians as not worth saving.And then there is the subtle racism that shows in the dialogue - such as ""Who Speaks Chinese, Anyway?"" and the rest of the drivel that came out of Analeigh Tipton's mouth. The tone of the movie also seems to convey the idea that white people were been victimized and oppressed by the Asian (gangsters). The other one is how Luc Besson subtly portray Taiwan as a lawless city - when you can fire pistols in public and not a single cop is in sight! Scarlett Johansson was simply walking around with pistols in hand and not a single person noticed or a cop in sight to stop her. Taiwan (like most Asian countries) forbid the ownership of firearms - thus a person with pistol will instantly stand out - let along a TALL BLONDE WHITE GIRL like Scarlett Johansson walking in pistols and submachine gun! The SWAT would be all over her in minutes - especially in Taipei as it is the capital with the most police force.The plot is fairly simplistic and predicable. The acting were pretty awful too as Scarlett Johansson's character turn into a robot while the rest of the cast were pretty forgettable.Overall, 1/10. Avoid this stinking pile of turd like the plague.","5 out of 26 found this helpful.

The acting was jam up, it was very enjoyable to see Scarlett play a lead role, dominating the scenes.Typical nuances such as multiple languages with no sub-titles, it does allow you to feel just as confused as Lucy did at certain moments which adds to the audience connection to her character. I believe the other languages were Mandarin and Korean.One of the amazing draws (for me) to this film was the lack of profanity. It brought a sense of appeal to my ears, I personally left the film wondering if even a single vulgarity was used. I know some people have lost their ear to catch the curses flying because it is the norm; to my knowledge there were only 3-4 used... wow. I'm proud to say we can still do that. Ironically, it was a foreign made film, not from Hollywood. That should say something about true filmography... you don't need nudity, profanity, or blood/guts galore to draw a crowd or earn your buck.I will note that there may be some things children and even the immature audience aren't ready to see, so I agree with the R rating.If you are ready to taste a true Sci-Fi action, mind-blowing experience, check it out!","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

There's only one thing that can make it worse, and that's when it is shoved down your throat in the most pompous and aggressive way. Sure, we can forgive Star Wars for midichlorians, but Lucy is beyond forgiving. It puts forth every debunked myth like it is the most intelligent thing ever said, such as dolphins being more intelligent than humans. And let us not forget Lucy's cringe-worthy speech about how 1 + 1 does not equal 2. And apparently having more brain activity means you lack the capacity to feel emotions, which makes no sense. And does anyone remember how she suddenly knew how the surgeons should be doing their job out of the blue? Even if she was at 100%, that knowledge came from nowhere. I don't think I need to poke out any more flawed logic throughout the film.Aside from Lucy being a generally unintelligent pile of filth, it is lacking in any artistic quality. The flashbacks to nature throughout the beginning of the movie were so out of place and absurd that it made me laugh out loud. No, it's not that I didn't understand why they were put in the movie. Yes, I get it, she's like a mouse in a trap, but it just didn't work. Scarlett Johansson's performance was hilariously bad as well. How did she go from ""Her"" to this filth? She spent the entire movie twitching and speaking monotone. The movie had basically no story. It simply existed because the director thought it would be cool to see a person progressively get more intelligent, and that's all that happens. The foundation of the movie is intelligence, yet Lucy never says one intelligent thing in the movie.This movie is only good if you want a good laugh. All the great scientists are rolling in their graves right now.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

But for ScarJo, I would have passed on this movie. She's on a career arc toward Streep territory in my world. But, I digress. The premise for the story is not new and the director hasn't really made any effort to put any imagination into it. He doesn't do much with the characters, instead pretty much leaving them to their own devices. Ordinarily not a bad idea when you are directing two major talents, but all he had to do was watch ScarJo in Under The Skin to see what could have worked better here. What we as viewers are left with is a vapid story which seemingly exists as a platform for car chases and gun fights with stereotypical cops and gangsters. While watching I imagined the director sitting on his couch at home playing violent video games and using those as his inspiration. Poor Morgan Freeman meanwhile plays pawn to special effects that add nothing, but clutter to the screen.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie takes beyond the advantages, it gives a theory that reaching to100% percent might also turn people into some sort of a superhero. Through it all, it's just too ridiculous to take seriously. Fortunately, that is not what the film wants, it just examines every single detail of this absurd idea without hindering anymore subplot. Lucy is just an intense rapid fire set of unrelenting imaginations, while it's pretty dumb, it's still a pretty amazing thing to experience.The plot is plain simple; it goes from a task gone wrong to a basic revenge thriller. The film has two palpable things to describe: one is the chase sequences that feels like playing Grand Theft Auto, knowing all the cheat codes, and then type them away to get an easy escape. The other is the exposition of the idea that appears to be a wannabe The Tree of Life. This combination of chaotic action and dumb science does come in handy, but it doesn't bother building anything larger to the themes of the story other than explaining the brain and human existence. Even though it's quite preposterous, the film does have a sense of fun. It takes no limits and let Lucy's abilities flow, even if it controls space and time. These sequences are just too priceless: the grandness, speed, and wondrous visuals that display on screen will keep giving you the endless frenzy you'll get in recent memory.Director Luc Besson is never afraid of showing off these things, no matter how stupid it all sounds and looks. No storyteller could express such ideas like Besson. The action scenes are pure mayhem, from bloody violence to cars crashing like it's not a big deal for the heroes. As the plot goes, it gets dumber and dumber, but that is, in the end, the point of the film. Any argument against it is invalid, stray whatever it has in mind until its package of imaginations explode. The acting doesn't need more than it already has: Scarlett Johannson just do what she has to do. There's human emotion then apathetic superhuman emotion, it's all wondrously effective.Lucy doesn't really need to prove anything smart, another comparison is this year's Transcendence although both may have different concepts, how they push their limits are somehow the same, except Lucy embraces its silliness, therefore that is its own charm, a sci-fi that recreates science only to let the spectacles get out of hand. Because we don't usually see this much insanity in our gritty blockbuster cinema. Sometimes we do need such enthusiastic guilty pleasure that could blow our minds in a different way.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Besson, known for strong female leads, continues to do his best in Lucy. After Mathilda in Leon we get another woman who doesn't let herself to be kicked around.Scarlett Johansson, always delivers an amazing performance. In Lucy she perfectly captures all the ranges of her character. From the scared, clueless woman to the fearless, no nonsense all knowing, all powers possessing ""god"". Morgan Freeman does his standard routine of an explaining professor but there is nothing wrong with that he fits into the story flawlessly. Amr Waked as the policeman Pierre Del Rio, who helps Lucy is a great addition to an already diverse cast. Besson always had knack for attention-grabbing villains and Mr. Jang played by Min-sik Choi is no exception.Despite the fact that the trailers made this film seem like an action ride this film is more than anything a celebration of humanity. The theory that people use only 10 percent of their brain is proved to be false but here it is used as a metaphor. By which Besson is trying to say that we are not using our fullest potential. Imagine, if we really tried hard enough to not be that lazy, to be more creative and to be adventurous. So the film's message is wrapped around a summer action fare but I think that most moviegoers should not just pass this along as a science nonsense and give it a second thought.I have also loved the use of inter cutting to documentary shots to emphasize the situation the character is currently in. For example the shot of the mouse approaching the mousetrap. By this Besson proves that there still are new and fun ideas how to present an idea. I also love how some films are just definitely written by Luc Besson and you can sense from a mile away. The premise, ideas and action scenes are just so Besson you know nobody else could have come up with them.In short, if you love Scarlet Johannson, Luc Besson's work, an amazing scifi film with some message to give you something to think about, then Lucy will certainly will be an enjoyable time at the cinema.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

I do feel that they missed an opportunity to make a great movie though.

If we only used 10% of our brains, that means we wouldn't even have our basic five senses as the control of these senses are scattered all over the brain. From a scientific standpoint, it is just not logical. And even if we pretend for a second that this is possible, unlocking the full potential of our brains wouldn't allow us to control matter or other people, or feel the world and its existence. This is why I found this terrible.The reason I say it has a great concept is based on the drugs entering the system and giving her abilities. I feel that without all that content on the brain they could have done so much more if they had just added more to her background. The trailer itself looks really promising, but in reality the trailer is better than the film. The story had a lot of scientific information added in, but it had a lot of philosophical material in it too which I did not get the relevance. Plus it contrasted scenes of the wild when she was being captured. Personally, I do not like juxtaposition of scenes that are not actually from the film to be in a film. It just emphasizes the fact that what I'm watching is not real.Even though I did not like this movie, the visual effects were still incredible. The colours were visually stimulating and complimented the movie well. Though the acting was not terrible, I felt it to be a bit dry.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

As the drug courses through her body, the young woman becomes more and more powerful, absorbing vast amounts of knowledge and cerebrally controlling her surroundings, before eventually becoming an omnipresent super-being. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), an expert in the human mind, can only look on in wonder.While the film pretends to say something profound about the existence of man, what it is really about is packing in as many flashy special effects as possible, crashing a load of cars, emptying loads of guns, and briefly showing Johansson in her bra (which is almost worth the price of entry on its own). It's all very flashy, and, despite its pseudo-loftiness, very trashy—a film to watch when you want to give your brain the night off.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, it fails in too many ways. Lots of foreign language with no way to know what's being said leaves the audience in the dark. Symbolism used but never explained, I didn't get a lot of it until I read the information on wiki explaining it. All this leaves a lot to be desired; the director and screenwriter have failed on a grand scale to tell their story. Any movie that you have to see multiple times to understand it, or need to read the director's explanation after watching it, is poorly written. As this is one of those, it doesn't qualify as decent entertainment as a movie. Perhaps it does as a puzzle. But most people don't want to go view puzzles without the information of how to put them together; in this way, this movie is like a jigsaw puzzle of a monotone piece of cardboard, cut up into a thousand pieces, so you have no way to figure out which piece goes where. Still, the light show was enjoyable to watch, much as a fireworks display is. But it's basically meaningless without knowing what it's supposed to represent.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

She notices how her mind and skills are expanding.Parallel to this we meet some scientist named Norman who is giving a speech in Paris about what it would be life for humans to use a greater percentage of their neurons. Lucy calls him showing him her skills. She's living proof of what he's been theorizing about. She tells him she'll see him in Paris. As she travels to Paris she develops the skill to control other people, but mid-flight her body almost vaporizes so she has to inhale the rest of the drug she's carrying with her. She also alerts the authorities about the other 3 mules.In Paris she meets a cop she's been communicating with. They catch the mules and take them all to Paris. She meets the scientists and has no choice but go all the way and take all the drugs and to see what will happen. But, the Asian mobster is also in Paris determined to get his drugs back.Lucy isn't so much about the action. It's...who would have thought...about the ideas. And who would have thought that it would be Besson to come up with a rich philosophical movie, a movie not even about French existentialism but about German metaphysics. The issues covered include--being vs. having, reproduction vs. immortality, matter and energy, and being and time. The science is a bit hokie, but the philosophical ideas are solid. That said, of the philosophical action movies (The Matrix, Inception), this one is the weakest when it comes to the action, the philosophical ideas also, aren't worked out, just hinted.Still, I enjoyed Lucy a great deal. Johansson does a good job. I wasn't crazy about the robot-like acting near the end though. If you catch the ideas and references, the movie gives you a lot to think about. While the movie doesn't quite develop the questions it wants to ask, it comes up with the answer and the answer is indeed philosophically significant.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Best sci-fi films put a simple condition - what if time-travel was possible? what if mankind would be able to reach another inhabited planet?... and the rest is organically built-up over and doesn't make one question the truthfulness of the happening. Lucy would be a good thriller. The opening starts tense and holds for 10-15 minutes and then everything collapses. There's an interesting message film wants to convey - ""the only unit in life is time, the rest is conventionality developed by men"", but this message is covered with a big pile of nonsense which I didn't have interest in digging. All the science baloney Morgan Freeman is spilling out does neither make sense, nor brings a smile. But some moments I was thinking that Freemen himself is going to give under his silly text and laugh out.From filmography's perspective Lucy isn't in a better shape. Movie starts and ends with something clearly inspired, but much more plain than 2001: A Space Odyssey, couple of poorly produced fistfight and shootout scenes, two minutes of Taxi-style chase and uninteresting sequence of disjointed plot chunks.P.S. Can't recommend Lucy even to Scarlett Johansson fans. I wen't to the movie without any high expectations, only because of my pal being into Johansson, but excessive nonsense covers up everything else.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

In addition to this, the way Lucy is portrayed in the movie is probably not very accurate.1) Because Lucy is using a large portion of her brain a lot, she needs lots of energy. I have not seen any commercials with her eating a Big Mac in order to keep her brain running at peak performance.2) Her brain would more than likely overheat from functioning at such a high level. I haven't seen any ice packs on her forehead in the trailers.3) She would probably need an IV (for fluids and nutrients) and a catheter to maintain her on-the-go, demi-god lifestyle (in addition to a feeding tube). I'm sure there are lots of other issues with this movie.

Or just a really bad version of a 007 wanna-be- bad ass replica. Even Johannson's acting starts off as a bit of a joke; literally, she seems to be laughing more than crying herself through the first ten minutes of the film. However, Lucy transcends with every passing minute – as if the quality of the film and it's acting were corresponding to the percentage of brain capacity that the protagonist female- gone-super-human android is using. It is one of those films, whose idea clearly surpasses cinematographic capabilities - time, space, gravity, and the origin of cells that build life and our reality - it is one of those films, that you watch skeptically, but are patient and open to giving it a chance. You watch, learn and enjoy, but after that start are all the while still deciding whether this is total guff, whether you have been ripped off at the theater counter, and served quantum-physics starters-pack drivel with some Scarlett glitter on top to cover it up? About midway through, I decided to give it a chance. A real chance. A chance at blowing me away and taking my mind to places unexplored, allowing my brain synapses to dance and go wild, tying together all my theories about life with what I was learning whilst fixing my eyes upon the screen. It worked. The key is, to see film as art. To take what you can get from it. Not to criticize (and believe me there was a lot of moaning and dis-missing going on in the seats around me) but to make the most of it. Yes you CAN. Once this happens (and there have been a lot of films where it just doesn't happen) you are free to go and experience that wonderful world of time, intelligence and purpose of life that is Lucy. Maybe I am an optimist who was fed cyborg-bull crap and went off on it – maybe I fell in love with the idea of being- and playing Scarlett's part, but in any case, I am glad to have seen this film, as it let me exit that cinema with sharpened senses and let me glide into the night feeling alive, thirsting for knowledge, finding life intelligent and beautiful. Each step was beautiful.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film is directed by Luc Besson of Fifth Element fame and stars Scarlett Johansson as the titular Lucy and Morgan Freeman as a university professor studying the abilities of the mind. To start off with, I found the directing to be rather good in terms of economic story telling and the classic show don't tell rule. There is actually far less exposition in this film than in others with similar aspirations of philosophical grandeur. There are some scenes where characters who shouldn't really know what Lucy is doing at a given moment yet they conveniently explain it for the audience but these are plot contrivances and I think over all the screen play is well paced and efficient.The acting is definitely not Oscar bait nor is it done with any subtly but I felt it was more than serviceable. Scarlett Johansson sells the awkward demeanor of her character pre-powers very well. The problem I had with her performance was her monotone personality after getting her cerebral abilities though I am fully aware this is likely due to the way her character is written. Though one thing I did like a lot was the confidence Johansson was portraying after receiving her powers despite her line readings being a tad flat. She definitely sells she knows she's a bad ass and she pulls off struggling with her detachment from humanity well. Morgan Freeman is pretty much good in everything he does and he certainly sounds like a learned scholar in this film. I had definite flash backs to Through The Wormhole with his performance here even if his science is a tad off. Luc Besson was certainly adequate form in this film. I found his camera work was lacking in the artistic department but he made up for it in by building suspenseful moments and exciting car chases and action scenes. It wasn't Die Hard by any means, but it was a fun ride watching Lucy execute her powers. A real problem with his directing is the intercut animal kingdom sequences which forces the metaphor on you. There is no subtly here the film tells or shows you everything you need to know and there's not a whole lot of room for interpretation. There's no real ambiguity.I did enjoy the special effects. I think it struck the perfect balance in terms of CGI scenes showing the human anatomy in real time(think Fight Club but a bit more grandiose in its approach and having real sets and characters. I don't think the effects are grounding breaking or anything but they definitely serve the film well.Okay, now onto the screenplay. I think this is probably the biggest flaw in the movie outside of plot contrivances because it simply tries to explore concepts I don't think the film is capable of doing. They spend time talking about human evolution by Johansson narrating, the creation of the universe, what in this meaning of life and how far Homo Sapien has come. These are all concepts I enjoy exploring in a film that has more nuance. In this movie it's all shoved into your face a bit too heavy handed though I will say they did show us the connection between this philosophical concepts instead of just telling us how they do. I think that's good story telling but the problem is the film doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it an action flick? A chick flick? A female James bond movie? The story moves at an abundantly fast pace but what is and doesn't take enough time to really explore these concepts. Any scene that has these concepts are given just enough time to let us know there is a theme there but it never explores it adequately. It's like the film is shouting ""hey look this is a metaphor for this"" and ripe with obvious parallels. These are great concepts to explore but they need to be more subtle. It's as if the film thinks it's smarter than it actually is.I didn't even notice the score too much to be honest though I did like the sequence with Mozart's requiem. I wish the film could have had more of that gravitas instead of the subdued score pieces. I have heard once before that you don't remember good music because it integrates so well into the film you don't even hear it. It just puts you in a subconscious mood. If you subscribe to that line of thought then you might like this soundtrack. I perform more bombastic background music to put me into the scene more.To surmise my thoughts so far; I think it's a film with great ambition that it doesn't have the motivation to achieve. I was expecting to see a fast paced, run n gun supernatural powers type of film so I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or Full Jacket. The film tries too hard to explore huge concepts and it is simply not deep enough to convey those philosophical ideas though it does get the benefit of the doubt for at least trying.... The acting is serviceable, the action is fresh and there are some really heartfelt moments within the film that may touch or dismiss you. The film feels like it's the ADD, Youtubed instant gratification version of 2001: A Space Oydessy in terms of what it is trying to accomplish. Its theme and metaphor can never match the flawless implementation of the subtext in Kubrick's classic though it desperately wants to be the action version of those philosophical questions. The film doesn't know what film it wants to be and I think that's the crux of why I believe this film is only serviceable.My final review: 7/10","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Actually, it's the most important, for any film. And, this one has a generous script and a top notch professional director. I've always liked Luc Besson, starting with ""Le Dernier Combat (The Last Battle),"" which fascinated me when I first saw it a long time ago (seeing it recently, I did not like it anymore) . Moving through ""Subway"", ""The Big Blue"", ""La Femme Nikita"", ""Léon: The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"", Besson has become better and better, more spectacular, more refined. Climbing with this ""Lucy"". The first movie in which I like Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman (I'm not the fan of anyone). But here I liked them both, very much (secret: good story, good director) And all the other actors are good. Spectacular filming, stunts like I've never seen, fights as I've never seen before, all new and innovative. And, an editing like I've never seen before. A spectacular, dynamic film, from the first frame to the last, not one second of boredom. Very good, congratulations to everyone, I will always see it again with great pleasure.

In the past I have enjoyed some of his film like Léon: The Professional and The Fifth Element, however recently he hasn't been directing much, only writing for franchises like Transporter and Taken. While his films are usually action packed, this film is a prime example of squeezing all of the action into the trailer. This is my review of Lucy.Luc Besson not only directs this film, but he also wrote it as well. As I just mentioned above Besson has been writing a lot of big action movies lately like Taken one and two, and also 3 Days To Kill. I enjoy all three of those films, some more so than others, but they are generally fun. This film lacked that fun especially in the script. The characters are not developed well at all, and frankly caring for Lucy never really happens. We just want to see action, and instead we are forced an insane plot(nothing wrong with that in a film like this) and far too much useless banter. With a short runtime, this film suffers even more. With lack of character development and such a short runtime, its a wonder we understood anything Besson wanted from this film. So in the writing department Besson gets a below average rating.Now onto the directing, also done by Luc Besson. While Besson has taken some time off from directing action films, he generally knows how to do it. The same can easily be said here. While his script fails to bring in much action at all, when the action does hit(mainly towards the end of the film) it is filmed amazingly. The acting that Besson helps guide on the screen is not bad, but not great. Scarlett Johansson as Lucy and Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman lead this cast with some fine secondary actors like Amr Waked and Min-sik Choi(who plays a fantastic bad guy). Sadly as I mentioned in my comments about the script, the characters are so poorly progressed that caring about them never really happens. Jonansson delivers a nice performance and I will give her credit for that, and credit as well to Besson for leading her in the right direction with this film. So, overall Besson does a passable job directing as he leads a nice action scene towards the end of the film that looks amazing, but sadly the action is almost not there minus a couple very short scenes.Eric Serra composed the score for this film, he has previously scored such films as Arthur and the War of the Two Worlds and The Lady, both directed by Luc Besson. This score is generally forgettable. When the action heats up(it happens so seldomly that don't expect much) his score gets much better, and is passable. As a whole the score is nothing to brag about though.Overall if you were expecting a bigger action film, then you will be disappointed. If you were looking for a film with at least a somewhat good story, then you will also be disappointed. The film however is really short(just over eighty minutes without credits) and moves by pretty quickly without much drag, so if you feel the need to waste some time, then this film may be worth it.5/10","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

A dame to kill for"" was not available. Oh my Lord, I should have just got back into the car and gone home. I decided to write this review to balance out the fact that people seem to be giving this a 9 or even 10 stars, with some going to the extremes to say its the best film they have seen (Really????)First i'd like to say I've given this film 3 Stars for three reasons, 1. Morgan Freeman. Again the man delivers a great performance, dazzling us with his voice, epic timing and delivery.2. Special Effects. Which are fair throughout3. Scarlett Johansson. Pleasing to the eye, does a good job at the beginning but then boring throughout.The movie begins with the question ""What have Humans done with life on earth"", and you would assume that this is this question that the plot is structured around but in attempting to answer this question the film veers drastically off course. We are lead to believe that Humans only use %10 of our brains and that all we should be striving for is more brain capacity but as Lucy receives more and more brain capacity all she really does with it is destroy every object that gets in her way (including civilians) in a linear mission to some how pass on the information she receives from her heightened brain functions.The Character development is non existent, as a viewer you feel nothing for the main character. The best that Luc Besson could come up with was a 30 second phone call Lucy has a with her mum about how much she loves her Mum and Dad (This is just lazy film making). This phone call takes place just seconds after Lucy kills an innocent member of the public having surgery on the operating table, then we are led to believe that the doctors agree with the half assed reason for the killing and then help her with her own surgery. The Film then clumsily takes us on a cheap roller coaster ride where Lucy receives more brain capacity which has unexplained consequences, such as telekinesis and interacting with phone receptions (What???). We meet more boring and unnecessary characters that provide no real interest to the plot and are just more meat for the grinder, before the film finally ends by Lucy hitting %100 capacity and it is reviled what Humans are capable of when they hit this magical feet of evolution???...... What is it I hear you Say? Well i won't spoil the end but believe me that you are just left with an unbelievable feeling that you are expected to believe this ""God awful tripe"" is what Humans should be striving for. The film ends with some really good special effects but fails miserably to convey its message to the audience.

I needed to have some more backstory for Lucy, which was never given, thus resulting in my utter lack of emotional interest in her well-being.Morgan Freeman did the Morgan Freeman, and just basically played Morgan Freeman in a lab coat.Other actors were forgettable and uninteresting.I also instantly had a problem with the ""man only uses 10% of his brain"" setup, as this has been debunked on multiple occasions. Knowing this kinda threw the whole premise of the movie out the ""believable"" window.So in conclusion, I don't mind having watched this movie, however I could've lived a perfectly good life without ever actually seeing it.I wouldn't recommend it for the simple fact, that better movies exist out there that are worth actually recommending.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I got that. What I also got was a surprisingly intelligent Sci-Fi premise with interesting and creative visuals. Even though Scarlett Johansson is famous for being a pretty face I think her performance in this film prove she is more than that. I suppose I shouldn't have been so surprised considering the Writer/Director is Luc Besson, a French filmmaker that is responsible for such films as: The Fifth Element, Leon: The Professional, The Taken movies, The Transporter movies, and La Femme Nikita (a.k.a. Point of No Return).I've read around the internet that 'Lucy' is a dumb movie because the ""humans only use 10% of their brain"" premise is a myth. I find it funny considering all the other ridiculous premises that exist in Science Fiction. That leads me to the conclusion that these people don't know what Science Fiction is. It's not a 100% accurate representation of proved science; that would be call Science Fact. Science Fiction takes pieces of real science or things that exist only in theory and explores what that would mean for humanity and our society. Don't think about the premise of 'Lucy' as ""What if we could use 100% of our brain because we only use 10% of it"". Think about the premise as ""What if we had limitless access to all knowledge in the universe? What would we do with it?"" It's an extremely relevant premise, considering we are currently living in the information age and the ease at which we are able to access information is growing exponentially.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Yes, the premise is a bit silly, and you do have to suspend disbelief. What this movie is, more than anything realistic, is very imaginative. In the Era of uber 'realism' and nolan esque 'everything has to make sense' and alternately the stupidity of Michael Bay, this move had a nice balance, and just had fun with it's insane premise. Scartlett Johannsen did a fantastic job with this movie. She really has a knack for Sci Fi, and she is a top notch talent. This movie was about the right length. If you go into this looking for an art house film, don't bother, it's not for your pretentious tastes. Get over yourself. There is probably about as much real science as there is pseudo science. That is to say it's partially grounded in reality. It's not like the movie makes any illusion about the fact that some of the stuff in it is simply made up. I will say that Luc Besson could be served by hiring a writing consultant. There are some scenes that were kinda lazily set up. It doesn't ruin the film, but it might take a step in the right direction in having his films taken a little more seriously. Also, there is the signature rocket launcher scene (every one of Besson's films has one). This was fun. Go see it!","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

""Taken"" and ""District B13"" aside, and to some extend ""The Family"" (and two of those were only scripted by him), none of his projects in the past 10 years or so even past muster, and ""Lucy"" is yet another massive blotch on his repertoire.The film is beyond inane - it's flaws, plot-holes, and downright absurdity are so vivid, and so many, that it would be a herculean task even to list them. Part farcical-scientific treatise, part messed-up action movie - a film that oscillates between rambunctious disorientation and complete boredom in a heartbeat. And, for a movie that worries about most of humanity wasting its potential, it's ironical that ""Lucy"" is riddled with so many nonsensical scenes. Even though the titular character may find her brainpower exponentially increasing as the film's run-time moves forward, chances are you'll feel your IQ levels diminishing and your intellect being assaulted just as rapidly.""Lucy"" is more or less the same kind of illogical gibberish we've come to except from post-2005 era Besson. Is this really the same talent that gave us classics like ""Léon: The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"", and ""La Femme Nikita"". Right now it's sad to see that he isn't even a reflection of the man who penned crackerjack scripts such as ""Taken"" and ""District B13"".

Only this time, he has the way to open people's minds in ""Lucy"". He's got the perfect stars in this film. Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, and Morgan Freeman is a professor who theories ended up being proved by her. College student Lucy(Johansson) is in Taiwan studying, is later duped by her boyfriend who is delivering a package to a dealer. When he gets killed, Lucy ended up being an unwilling mule. She and other mules have drugs seen into their abdominal cavities. Unlike the rest, she gets kicked and the drugs are released into her body, unleashing a phenomenal potential. She developed powers of the mind which she never used: telekinesis, magnetism, mind reading, etc. Whenever the percentage of her brain is used, the more her humanity seems to be leaving her. When she contacted the professor(Freeman), she demonstrates the potential ability of the drugs that enhances her mind. Making her a genius beyond her wildest dreams. The action is fantastic and phenomenal, I can understand the mind of what it can do. I tend to stay away from people who have limited imagination. Just think. Albert Einstein got nothing on ""Lucy"".

I'd watch him mow grass, so do I love Monsieur Besson. And Lucy is very likely my favorite Besson film since The Fifth Element (1997), though other strong contenders include Angel A (2005) and Les aventures extraordinaires d'Adèle Blanc-Sec (2010). In fact, in some ways, Lucy is a reworking of the central theme of The Fifth Element: The appearance of a woman who is a ""supreme being."" Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the title role, and I also enjoyed the performances of Min-sik Choi and Amr Waked. Johansson brings to her role an unexpectedly – for me at least – poignant portrayal of a woman whose humanity is being eroded as she becomes something entirely, unimaginably alien. She actually had me near tears twice. The effects are gorgeous, and we are propelled through time, from 2014 to that ""time"" prior to the Big Bang. The editing, as with The Fifth Element, is superb. And, as usual, Besson works with his tried-and-true collaborators, such as Eric Serra (soundtrack) and Thierry Arbogast (cinematography).That said, the science is, well, not really science at all. The entire film is predicated on the ""Ten percent of brain myth."" This is, of course, complete twaddle. Also, Morgan Freeman's lectures are replete with errors that would have been eliminated by throwing a few bucks at a poor biology grad student. Or checking Wikipedia. For example, we're told at least a couple times that life appeared one billion years ago, when, in fact, the earliest evidence we currently have of life on Earth is 3.7 billion years old. That's a pretty damn big error. And there was a bunch of foolishness about dolphins. However! Truth is, these problems actually didn't detract from the film at all, in my opinion. I think you have to look at what's happening in Lucy as metaphor, and where it takes us in the end is very near to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I give Lucy high marks. It is by turns horrific, transcendent, sad, and beautiful.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I've got a rare day off work, a free movie pass and figure a matinee would be a great way to pass a couple hours. So I look at what's playing and see ""Lucy"". It's a movie by Luc Besson which is good. I liked several of his movie. It's a movie starring Scarlett Johansson that I really liked. And the trailers for it looked interesting so I figured this was my movie.And like the title says I enjoyed it. There were aspects of philosophy, science, some kick ass fight scenes and then came the ending. There are very few movies in which the ending made me angry and this was one of them. They could have handled it in such a way that would have been better but they chose to end it the way they did. I felt cheated by it because it was such a let down.The story itself deals with the titular Lucy. She's a young woman who in order to make some money agrees to deliver a briefcase. But that's only part of the deal and she wasn't informed of the rest. Instead she's drugged and forcibly turned into a drug mule where this new synthetic drug is literally stitched into her and will be cut out when she reaches her destination. However one of the bags bursts and she ODs on it. Things get really strange and she starts to develop terrifying mind powers as she races to find a way to punish the people that did this to her and if there's a way to save her life.We're taken on a ride in which elements of science, philosophy and what it means to be human are explored. A lot of people criticize Scarlett's wooden acting but this is explained as being her having gone ""beyond"" emotion due to the drugs in her system. And then at some point near the end it just takes a hard left turn into something I just didn't care for. I can think of a half-dozen different ways they could have handled it and gotten the same kind of ending but as I said in the end it just fell apart and I felt cheated. Even though the movie itself didn't cost me anything, I still felt cheated.Personally see it for what it is and understand that the ending is really weak.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It truly makes you think about our potential to think deeply about evolution, human nature, and life. I cannot remember a film that has made me think so much about potential. I'm an engineer and have always accepted things as they are. However the film triggers your thinking in that it clearly states that ""it is our ignorance that brings us the state of chaos'.

She is drugged and soon begins to develop powers well beyond our understanding and it just continually grows from there. Every person and obstacle put in her path is dealt with easily and she has absolutely no problem that she can't solve because she can suddenly do everything. The other problem with trying to develop an all powerful being is you are still limiting said character to a human way of thinking. We do not know what would happen if we ""unlocked"" our minds because most of what you see in this movie has already been done in comics decades before, so it's nothing new.From the viewer's perspective, seeing someone being all powerful and having no faults, no weaknesses and can literally move Heaven and Earth is just boring. Kid with a magnifying glass and an ant hill comes to mind. Yeah, it's fun to see our favorite heroes beat the crap out of the bad guy, but the plot usually has them fighting some weakness or overcoming some life issue and learning a lesson from that. The entire story arc for Ironman is a good example of a flawed character continually growing from their faults to be a better, stronger person. It's what made the end of 'Endgame' so heart-wrenching for most people.Making mistakes, having faults, even being ""taken down a peg"" helps us connect with a character. You feel what they feel, you understand their hardships and you want to help them. Lucy doesn't do that. There is literally no reason to have anyone helping her, characters or viewers because she can do anything. They don't even make an attempt to have her try to hang on to who she used to be or keep some part of her intact, she just instantly decides to throw everything about herself away, so why should we care? Lucy deserves no sympathy because there's no reason to sympathize. You don't feel sorry for her because she becomes a souless husk as she grows stronger with no emotion. When you have more feelings for Baymax, literally a robot with no emotions or sympathy (he's only programmed to care) instead of Lucy, that should be a red flag right there.I was really hoping Lucy would get to a point where she would realize what she was becoming wasn't who she was and decided to reject what she was turning into. She makes this point in the movie, but it's just glossed over in favor of more gun fights. I know someone is going to say ""it's a movie about becoming more than who we are, to think about things in a different way"", but it really isn't. There are far better movies that get this message across much more effectively.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But where Limitless at least managed to get a thrill going and didn't dwell too long on the flawed premise of the movie, Lucy gets stuck on it and revels in it.It's never a pain to watch Scarlett Johansson, but this isn't a performance she will be remembered for and the script doesn't give her much to work with either.Some entertaining visuals and certainly decent sound, but even there Besson is like a raving movie fan on your couch, remembering cool stuff from other movies and putting it in, when all you really want to do is turn in and get some sleep. Trying to guess the 'references' could be fun, perhaps.(and no, we really *don't* use only 10% of our brain capacity, this goes in the same bin as ghosts, flying saucers and Bigfoot - that doesn't affect the rating of the movie though)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I found the script well written & well paced at no point did I feel the director was adding filler to make the film longer.

Should have shown some advantages for the human kind.I think few scenes are narrated in a very spoon feeding manner which is not needed. ex: When villain is about to meet Lucy, Lion hunting deer scenes are shown up.

It's only fair to say though, that in my opinion, an archetypal cult classic is one of the most difficult types of films there is to make, and they don't happen often. So I it is with the highest praise that i consider this to be an archetypal cult classic. The way that writer/director Luc Besson chose to present this incredibly thought provoking idea, was brilliant. This was some heavy duty philosophy, and rather than try to deliver something that could have easily turned into an over produced philosophical info dump, he borrowed, authentically I might ad, from the world of super heroes, took us on a brilliantly paced, exciting, and original journey that allowed us to follow his thought process and see the potential implications of his vision, through the use of analogy. Of course Morgan Freeman was stellar. The casting was wonderful, and the roles well acted. Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job. Remember, there are not many female roles like this to draw from, since it's only recently that roles like this exist for women. She is a pioneer and I believe she nailed it.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

Before you know it, tension and drama build and you're sucked into a story that you cannot pull your eyes away from the screen. Luc Besson takes a very interesting and alternative imaginary view into the idea of the human brain becoming fully unlocked. While similar to Limitless, this take on the potential of the human brain goes further into science fiction/action based drama. Can't forget about the quick witty comedic lines that are known best from the mind of Luc Besson. Scarlett Johannson and Morgan Freeman make a great team together as soon as they join together on screen.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

All I knew about it was that a woman Lucy breaks the barriers of human brain capacity reaching its maximum. Now the idea that having such a brain capacity will give you the ability perform telekinetic, mind control,control of electromagnetic waves and what not seems a bit too far fetched but it was fun and engaging to watch up to a level. I think that's how you might like the film, ignoring the science aspect of it.The movie begins with man tricking his girlfriend named 'Lucy' (Scarlett Johansson) into delivering a package to some drug-lord in Taiwan. Then it turns out it contains 4 packets a powerful drug called CPH4,one of which which then Lucy is forced to deliver by placing the packet in her belly along with 3 other people bearing the remaining 3 packets. The packet leaks when the buyer hits Lucy hard into her belly and the drug mixed into her blood gives her the ability and power the whole movie circles around. Well now intentions are to go after the drug lord and find the other 3 packets before they are misused. Once the search for the drug lord and drug sets in the action pumps up. We already have seen Scarlett in action as Black Widow of Avengers but here she shows the emotional depth of her character quite well too.Attaining such brain capacity and knowledge Lucy seems to be losing her humanistic ideals (which is again questionable) and she is having hard time digesting such power. Scarlett does it all with ease. Morgan Freeman is also there playing a professor expert in neurological science. He also adds some scientific and philosophical ideals into the film in the first half which was good to watch. Also some thought provoking questions about our existence of life, death,time,emotions and about being humans are raised which really boosted it in sci-fi department. But all this falls apart with an over the top climax going far beyond its reach. Also many of the action sequences become illogical due to Lucy's powers itself. She can hack into any system in the world yet the bad guys reach the destination earlier than her, you know just ensure there is final face-off.Actually Lucy gets a chance to kill the drug-lord for good early in the film but he is just kept injured so that he meets our heroine again at the end. Also it goes into full on '2001:Space Odyssey' mode at the ending which is supposed to wow us but up to the point things had become quite silly to accept any seriousness in the story despite the good visual effects and CGI.There some points in the film where it is better to keep doors of your brain shut and not think too much about what is going, it will help to enjoy this one more. Lucy is weak on story and script, also tries to reach the stars beyond its capacity yet despite its absurdness Lucy is somewhat an enjoyable ride and watchable action flick. Main credit goes to Scarlett who carries the weight of the film with a fine performance.RATING:[2.5/5]","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

(Incidentally, we already use 100%, so the entire premise of this film is absurd.)It's quite clear that whoever wrote this film has no understanding of intelligence or the human brain. We aren't superheroes waiting to happen. An IQ of 200 doesn't give us the ability to (literally) telepathically control other people (figuratively, perhaps, but many folks with IQs near 200 tend bar for a living) *or electrons*. An IQ of 400 won't make us telekinetic. An IQ of 1000 wouldn't suddenly permit us to dissolve into a sludge of matter that can somehow mesh with computing hardware (or time travel, incidentally--time travel isn't a real concept, nor is time, despite this film's simplistic notion that it's everything). (Forgive me if I have my ""percentage brain used"" vs. abilities mixed up--I simply couldn't care less, and it matters not.)In sum, there is only this: what in the world were they ""thinking?"" The next time you write a script, *have an intelligent person read it before you market it to studios who only want to exploit people of average capability and below*. Please and thanks.Smart people: avoid this film like the plague--if you must see a film regarding an ordinary man who uses a drug to become much smarter, see ""Limitless.""

Scarlett Johansson plays a young female named Lucy whose one-week-old boyfriend accidentally gets her involved in a drug smuggling ring that knocks her unconscious and surgically implants a bag of drugs in her. The drugs turn out to be a synthetic version of a pregnancy hormone and after one of her captors kick her in the stomach, the implanted bag of drugs bursts and leaks into her system. The drug increases her brain capacity slowly and what is unlocked as her brain capacity begins to increase is the bulk of the film. With her new found abilities, Lucy begins hunting down those responsible for the drug smuggling ring as well as trying to overcome any obstacles in her way. I say ""obstacles"" but the truth is that Lucy becomes so powerful so quickly that the actions scenes don't really involve all that much tension at all. Instead of fighting she can just freeze people, make them fall asleep, or manipulate their weapons. This isn't a knock on Scarlett who really tries hard here, but spends much of the film acting like a semi-Terminator - robotic and ticky as if she is computing everything all at once. A good example of this is the finale which is trying to be part action film and part 2001: A SPACE ODDYSEY but it doesn't really do either fairly well and it essentially renders Scarlett as someone who just sits in a chair transcending everyone else. It's just not all that well integrated or interesting, despite the imagination clearly on display here. An interesting idea, lots of stupid Hollywood quackery science, but all would be forgiven if it was better than mediocre execution.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The drug lord decides to use her as a drug mule, and has a plastic packet full of CPH4 embedded under her stomach. Through recklessness by her drug handlers, the packet rips, leaking the CPH4 into her. The CPH4 gradually opens her brain, and she gains knowledge far beyond any human. She is able to see and do fascinating things, but she also gradually loses what makes her human. She has no interest in striking back at the drug gang, as her intelligence has progressed beyond this world. Lucy calls her mother, but her basic message was: ""I love you mom, but I'm going someplace that you couldn't possibly understand, and I can't come back. Goodbye."" Lucy consults Brain Theory expert Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) on what she should do with all of her knowledge. He suggested that she pass on her knowledge to others, although he was also wondering if mankind could handle such knowledge. The drug lord, of course, is determined to kill her. By the time Lucy reaches 100% of brain capacity, she ceases to exist as a physical being. Lucy starts off as a pretty good story, but there are a couple of flaws later on. The big car chase scene, involving multiple car crashes, was pointless. Lucy could have just used her brain to make the other cars stop, and mentally just pushed them aside. Same thing for the big shootout scene at the end. Lucy could have just made all the bad guys collapse. Those scenes were just put in as action filler, but they kind of subtracted from the story.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It talks about using the intellectual capacity and shows far more than we can imagine (One thing I liked was, being able to control human and things around the person. How come we never thought about that? We can only think of having control over self). But then, I don't think 100% use of cerebral capacity will provide the access to the past unless the person studies about it or has experienced i.e. if it was already in the brain. However, if 100% capacity in the movie was used for exploring unknown rather than recollecting the known, it would have been the best Sci-fi. But here, it's a more like fantasy/superhero movie. The main concept is good. So is the performance and visual effects. But I find the story someway out of track. However, one can take it as out-of-the-box thinking. Sci-fi fans ought to watch this movie, it should be entertaining. I recommend it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The beginning was quite promising although the clips with animals seemed somewhat clumsy or inelegant way to get ideas across. I still expected a decent, adult movie. S. Johansson's acting seemed bad and I wondered if she was chosen because of her looks or because of her fame, but as the story progressed it all started to make sense. It's a teen movie, a typical Hollywood superhero flick for paying masses who JUST want to eat candy and popcorn and drink carbonated sugar water while being lightly entertained. Although IMHO the movie is not very entertaining... A sci-fi movie doesn't mean that viewer has to automatically suspend all disbelief and there's nothing more to expect than special effects and two-dimensional superheroes. Just take ""Perfect sense"" as an example - there can be layers, thought and so on. In contrast this one just had some stuff sprinkled on it that made it look like it might have some thought and ideas behind it, but at closer look there's nothing really there. It's like the snacks and drinks sold in the cinemas that taste and smell like something edible but are mostly artificial and not really good for you. Despite being fake they sell and bring in the profit, and my guess is so did this movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But why so linear? Why so predictable? There's no intrigue, no conflict, no development. And why equate higher intelligence with emotional impotence? It is a contradiction in itself.

To that end, a packet of a new drug called CPH4 is surgically inserted into her abdomen and she is told that she must take it from Taipei it to a city in Europe. However, prior to leaving she is treated rather harshly by one of her captors which results in the bag breaking open and releasing a large quantity of the new drug into her system. This causes her to have increased mental powers which continue to rise to an alarming degree. And using the new powers that she comes upon she also gains revenge on those who put her in this predicament. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this started off rather well but began to get out-of-control towards the end. It was all a touch too much. Perhaps if the director (Luc Besson) had kept things moving at a slower pace then it's possible this film could have really been something special. Unfortunately, he kept upping the ante to the point that it bordered on the ridiculous. Again, while this wasn't a bad film necessarily it could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly.

She fights back against her captors and ends up getting kicked repeatedly in her stomach which ends up splitting the bag inside her stomach mixing the drug into her system. Almost immediately her body and cells react violently to the drug as she begins to adapt to it on a cellular level ultimately speeding up the evolutionary process which gives her brain access to the untapped potential of the human brain which makes her smarter, faster and stronger.This isn't the first science fiction movie to explore the idea of accelerated evolution using chemistry and it won't be the last. The storyline isn't that different from the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy the only difference being that instead of humans it's Apes and instead of an illegal drug it's a new advancement in chemical science. Although Planet of the Apes is just a bit more realistic than Lucy in terms of how evolution actually works but neither movie are close to being realistic.I did find Lucy to be very entertaining it's a fun action movie with enjoyable characters and gorgeous visuals. The action is like a cross between The Matrix and John Wick combining things like characters being suspended in mid air and fast gunplay.My only real gripe with this movie is Lucy's character basically evolves into what can only be described as a powerful mutant from the X-Men universe but even the X-Men comics and movies idea of evolution is more realistic than Lucy's and that's saying something.I recommend watching this movie if you enjoy science fiction action movies as that's pretty much all it is an entertaining hour and a half movie that you say ""meh it was okay"" to after watching.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you enjoy a god scifi flick with supernatural hints thrown in there then watch. I wont give anything away, but Scars performance was perfect. She puts the exact kind of emotion into a person going through something like this. Which is...there is no emotion. As her brain moves up in the numbers she becomes more and more calculated like a computer. She could not have done better. I hope they make a second film.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

When Lucy gets abducted & the abductors mess up her body, by adding a synthetic drug through her stomach. Now, the effects of the drug is that she can use more than 10% of a human's average cerebral capacity. She seeks the help of Professor Norman(Morgan Freeman) who has done tons of research on the particular subject. Now, Lucy will have to control her cerebral capacity, no matter what. Lucy is a brilliant film. I love realistic action/sci-fi movies. The fact that this particular drug is used on pregnant women in small doses really fascinates me! However, Lucy suffers the same brunt of most sci- fi movies. It lacks an emotionally engaging story. Lucy is way better than Godzilla(2014) & Pacific Rim(2013), but lacks the dramatic elements of Inception(2010) & Transcendence(2014). The action sequences of the movie are brilliant. Be it car chases, surreal mind brawls or fist fights, they never fail to amaze. The special effects are outstanding too. I'm really glad that the movie isn't in 3D, which seems to be the norm for action/sci-fi movies, nowadays. Kudos, Luc Besson. Scarlett Johansson kicks ass as the protagonist. Lucy's lack of emotions has been portrayed beautifully by Johansson. Morgan Freeman is outstanding as Professor Norman. The supporting characters are effective. Lucy is a must watch, just for its concept. The fact that this drug actually exists in real life, gives me chills. God knows what a human being can do with a 100% of brain capacity!","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

This movie stars Scarlet Johanson as Lucy who, early on in the movie is kidnapped and used as a drug mule for this drug that enhances people to use 100% of her brains capacity and, after it gets into her bloodstream, it allows her to do all kinds of supernatural things. Plenty of people have a problem with this premise and I don't really. The film Limitless deals with a similar subject and (although Limitless handled it better and more realistically) I could suspend my disbelief for this premise. And after this moment the movie begins to fall apart. First off I was baffled by some of the director's choices in this movie. A situation would occur and it would suddenly cut to a 'symbolic' show of a similar situation happening in nature like a mouse walking towards a trap or cheetahs stalking prey. And it just seemed so... Pretentious. I get what's he's saying but there was not a hint of subtly in this symbolism. And the whole script just seems so convinced it's being new and groundbreaking it forgets to be any of those things. Stuff just happens, it'll display some impressive visual effect with no explanation of what, how or why and you can tell we're supposed to be amazed saying ""what does it all mean?"". I'll tell you what it means: nothing! There are plenty of other annoyances in the movie, Morgan Freeman's inclusion is pointless, the ending just seems preachy and uneventful. It seems like we're watching everything unfold with no stakes or consequence, and that brings me to my main complaint. Lucy is boring and empty because there are no stakes in anything going on. As soon as she gets these powers there is no conflict or competition. People chase her with guns and try to fight but none of it matters, she can just knock out a whole room without any resistance. We are never told her limitations because she has no limitations, she has no threat. Resulting in her character being boring, undeveloped and leaves all the side characters on the side line because there's nothing they can do in this situation. She's so powerful she needs no help and has no competition resulting in the side characters useless and all of the action scenes are boring and unsuspensful. Lets also not forget how Lucy is a terrible person once she takes the drugs, before she was quirky, Scarlet Johanson played her well but as soon as she becomes a god she is just dangerous. She shoots an innocent cab driver in the leg because he doesn't speak English, drives recklessly and even kills a man while he's being operated on because he apparently 'couldn't be saved anyway'. Nice protagonist writing there. And the ending... Oh my god. The ending. I won't spoil anything, mainly because there's nothing to spoil. After all of the efforts and 'conflict' in this movie amounts to nothing and the movie ends as if it's taught us something so deep but all I learned I wasted two hours of my life watching NOTHING If I were you, I'd skip this one but if the premise interested you I recommend Limitless starring Bradley Cooper. It's much better than whatever this tried to be","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He did his work well, he picked up a paycheck, but it really felt like Luc wanted another Name on the marquee. Here's my epitaph on the movie. The next day I couldn't even remember the ending...I had to think about it a bit to recall how it ended. Luc said, ""Well, we used up the budget folks. Lets just wrap it up and ship it.""

It had a few big stars, the story may have been interesting, and at the least it could have had some stylized action and good music. Unfortunately it failed on all fronts. Perhaps when the plot was adapted to film, a lot was lost. There were so many scenes that were put in just for a corny cheesy joke. I could have lived with plot holes that were left up to the imagination, but they went into too much and the very weak plot required far too much of a leap. This was worse than junk science, it depended on the viewer to actually be stupid. The action scenes were very anti-climactic. If you don't believe me, just watch the scene where she hits the ceiling in a rotating room. There is no good explanation for this and it's embarrassing to watch. The music was not synced well to action scenes, the actors played mediocre roles, ugh. There is nothing redeeming about this film at all. NONE of it was believable. I'm not just talking about the brain stuff. The belief that a Korean cartel would deploy that much firepower in a foreign city over such a small amount of substance... c'mon. Totally ridiculous film.

What does that mean for a person who no longer take micro seconds to perceive be coping with on a emotional and physical level. bridging off of these idea of higher being the film dives into a more fantastical realm and completely becomes fictional. It does not stick to the pure facts of what we know Yet they are using actual theories and philosophical debates. I find the fantasy used to exaggerate these notion to be done well and in thought provoking ways. how does one come to terms with understanding more then ones self, not only that but in seeing past the conjecture of basically everything.

Therefore, when you fill your mind with a lot of ideas about what's true or what's false that than obviates the searching for deep direct experiences. You're not willing to let go because you're stuck in a paradigm lock. People like to think that they can represent reality with ideas without recognising their ideas are apart of reality. There are limits on what you can represent with ideas. Representation is not the real thing and as simple as it sounds a lot of highly intelligent people forget this. That's where a lot of stuff goes wrong because if reality was simple and not complex, and reality was intuitive and not counterintuitive than this strategy might work. Except, what humanity has discovered time and time and time and time and time again is that reality does not work in the way we assume. Reality is filled with very weird paradoxes and facts that are completely contrary to anything we assume and that many of our speculations that this is contrary to direct experience. Your speculation about reality are always suspect and could always be overruled by direct experience.

With this type of movie (becoming omnipotent), it's hard to have a profound conclusion/3rd act, and this movie is sadly no different. Everything in the first half of the movie is certainly entertaining and thought provoking, but in the end, the writers write themselves into a corner.It's intriguing to see what type of powers she possesses early in the transformation, slowly gaining new abilities and fighting off her foes. But the movie makes the cardinal sin of making her too power, too soon. Way before the movie reaches its climax, she has to powers to basically stop any type of threat opposed to her, which, of course, ruins the ride too soon. Once Lucy gets to around 60% power level she is undefeatable and all the excitement goes out the window and we just have to sit back and see where the writers want to go with this.Omnipotence is probably something writers and filmmakers should avoid for the time being, it's a tricky subject that almost never pays off.

I'm not really sure - my best bet is 'Limitless' crossed with 'The Matrix', but without the best bits from either! Basically, Lucy (Johansson) gets involved in a drug ring in Taipei and it just so happens the drugs 'unlock' the full potential of her brain. The biggest flaw of the film is right there - it's based on the urban myth that humans only use 10% of their brain power. We may not always use 100%, but we certainly use more than 10% for the majority of the time!The best bits are the amazing car scene in Paris, the intercut footage (cheetahs, dinosaurs and other bits of nature) and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, that's more than counterbalanced by the fact that the film struggles to make 90min, has a lack of actual action/excitement has a huge cop-out ending and Johansson acts like a robot, which is apparently what a hyper-evolved human would be like?!?Considering Besson made 'The Fifth Element' - one of the more fun, inventive Sci-Fi films of the last 20 years - it's a shame this film is neither fun, nor original. I definitely think the filmmakers thought they were being far more philosophical than they actually ended up being.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Someone being all powerful is boring. When all someone has to do is use their mind to drop all the bullets out of a gun or throw someone aside there is absolutely no interest to be had in any action sequence the film throws our way. The movie tries to be a lot more than what it really is. It tries to be thought-provoking and intelligent but just comes across as a mess of ideas, with the audience insultingly trying to be convinced this is all possible. I'm not sure exactly how we are supposed to feel about the character of 'Lucy'. To me she's nothing short of pure evil. She will kill a completely innocent person without giving it a second thought and then in the next scene spare the life of a vicious drug-dealing mob leader who will consequently go on to take dozens more lives. She's portrayed as being the heroine we should root for but when you actually give it some thought she's no better than any of the villains. I had this same complaint about writer/director Luc Besson's other film 'Taken 3' as well. It seems to be a real flaw in his writing of late that he needs to fix. Overall it's a messy film that even Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson's star power isn't enough to save. There's an idea here that could have worked but it needed to be done in very different fashion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The plot is great, and Im always intrigued by the idea of ""what if"". Still i find the developing of Scarlet's character lacking. I wish we could be get a more insight of what she really is thinking, the moment the drug kicks in its like we are represented to a whole new person, and we don't know nothing about whats going thru her mind. Surely, we are told how she feels, or that she does not feel, but i wish there were more details around that ""what if"" scenario. To be honest, i find it hard to put the finger on this film, but what I do know is that, there should have been a lot more focus on the ""what if"" scenario. The photography is great, i loved it.

I really wanted to like this film. I really did. I am one the first people willing to suspend all belief while watching a movie, in the name of ""Entertainment"". But this movie slapped me around & called me a moron from the start.I'm a huge fan of Choi Min-Sik & sadly, he was this films only saving grace. I'm not going to go into the science of the film, which was extremely flawed but I will go into the common sense of the film briefly. This is a movie about a woman who can use %100 of her brain's capacity (Assuming, we ourselves, can only use %10). Unfortunately, the woman that is blessed with this ""insane"" percentage of brain usage... is a complete moron. One reason I say this is, without any spoilers, is she doesn't kill the main antagonist right away. She gets the drop on him. She's crazy smart. He is unaware of her prolonged existence. But she doesn't realize that he is going to be a major threat to her. Really?! I, supposedly, only use %10 of my brain. & my foresight was strong enough to see his actions coming. However she could not foresee this turn of events.I could go even longer into this but I'm trying to keep this review ""Spoiler Free"". If you're planing on viewing this film by spending your hard earned cash...DON'T. It's worth a viewing for free (Netflix being the most you're willing to spend), but not with money that you work very hard to receive.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is just not so and this has been proved by numerous studies and scans of the brain however I don't think any really holds on to this myth nowadays (or at least those who do should perhaps read more).Anyway, without giving anything away, there are numerous plot points that end up either going nowhere or are at least completely unexplained. In short there is no real depth of story to this movie. I knew before even going that it certainly wasn't original and was more of a mashup of ideas from numerous sci-fi books and movies that have very similar ideas but a mashup was all it that is very loosely tied together with string.I'm actually surprised that the book from which the movie is based hasn't been exposed as a work of blatant plagiarism of those other works.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Amr Waked, from the film Syriana also shows up to deliver a good supporting role as Pierre the French cop.It has a silly story that tries too hard to transcend the 'big dumb action-sci-fi' title, but more on that later. Lucy gets forced into a shady deal with some Koreans while living in Taiwan, and ultimately becomes a pawn in their drug trafficking scheme when her and a few other diverse foreign nationals have what looks like blue crystal meth surgically implanted in them for smuggling purposes. Instead of it being Heisenberg's famous recipe, the drug is actually some synthetic chemical similar to what fetuses get in their sixth month of pregnancy that is apparently extremely potentor something. It's not really important what it chemically is supposed to be. What IS important is that she gets kicked in the stomach and her little blue baby starts to leak and is absorbed into her body. The blue magic ultimately starts to change her physiology and starts to supercharge her neurons giving her an unprecedented mental faculty. So she periodically begins to unlock new superhuman abilities as her brain fully turns itself on. The premise, as explained in complementary scenes by Professor Norman (Freeman) is that humans by nature only use a very limited fraction of their brain power – something like 10%. His theories are that if a human were to ever unlock more of this processing power, they would be subject to unthinkable (pun definitely intended) abilities that are beyond our human scope of understanding. He is posed the question by one of his students what it would mean to use 100% of your neurons and responds 'I simply don't know'. Well that's the gimmick for the film. Lucy steadily increases her brain power until it inevitably reaches 100%. Additionally, the blue stuff has a pretty short half-life so if she doesn't keep ingesting it, her cells start to disintegrate. Ultimately she has to team up with Pierre (Waked) to find the other blue stuff before the Koreans get to it, and at the same time she has to unravel what it is she's becoming through the help of Professor Norman. Now I can't fault the movie for its story as it is vaguely original, albeit silly. I found it pretty interesting to think what would happen if mankind started to transcend space and time and suddenly have a completely alien understanding of the universe from what we currently know. It reminded me a lot of reading Dr. Manhattan's personal dialogue in the graphic novel version of The Watchmen. Where I see this movie primarily failing is that it was trying too much to be a clever film. It's trying too hard to project a meaningful message in a big dumb action movie. Yes, despite the silliness of premise, I will admit I was entertained by the action and visuals (namely Ms. Johansson) , but there was this subtext the movie kept trying to convey about mankind living in ignorance and self- absorption. It was distracting to have stock footage spliced in every few seconds of animals, natural disasters, and mankind's achievements that were obviously supposed to parallel and add some deeper meaning to Lucy's transformation. I'm sure you could find something more profound in the Big Bang Theory intro than in Lucy, as in this film it just comes across as a jumbled mess. When your premise is that a beautiful blonde suddenly develops the ability to interact with all of time and space, you don't cheapen it by trying to some implant some pretentious rigmarole like in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Bottom Line: This movie makes a decent attempt and ultimately touches on a lot of interesting and thought provoking topics in science fiction. The visuals are occasionally creative and well delivered – sometimes hokey, but they don't have that cheap feel to them. Unfortunately for Lucy, movies aren't just the net score of their individual components. It looked dumb going in, and it felt dumb after leaving but that's what an action film is. It isn't meant to pontificate the nature of humanity or indulge in some nihilistic view of the universe. Action movies are gun-battles and car chases and beautiful women with mind-powers. If it had just stuck to that definition it might have worked, but unfortunately it tried too hard to be something more.

But could we please let this ridiculous 10 percent thing go already? It's simply not true, and it hasn't been believed to be true for decades now. We humans use most of our brains for simple everyday functions. Perhaps only 30-40 percent at a time, but it's still significantly more than the alleged 10 percent.But, it's a single trope in a movie. A central one, certainly, but if the rest of the film was better, I wouldn't really mind all that much. But unfortunately it's not. The story itself is not a bad one. Luc Besson has managed to create this sweeping storyline about the birth of divinity within an ordinary woman - a theme I've often encountered in anime, in fact. Scarlett Johansson's Lucy has to deal with the evermounting loss of humanity as she becomes more than any human has ever been. Yet most of her actions are altruistic in nature, which I find refreshing.The biggest problem this movie has is that it doesn't go full throttle with its scope. There are certain artsy elements and imagery to its delivery that try, but that's only window dressing. The theme of transcendence doesn't open up to as, we don't learn anything about it. The most we get is that Lucy can think faster, and thus type faster on a computer and spout of scientific theory to university professors. The bare bones of an idea are there, but the meat is lacking.Plus the villains are superficial and unnecessary beyond their role in setting the film in motion, yet they're constantly brought back in to create action scenes. And the mood suffers accordingly.Lucy has a lot of good elements in it, from Johansson's performance, to special effects, to rather excellent cinematography to the aforementioned action scenes, which feel unnecessary, but are pretty to look at. It's only the mix of them that feels wrong, and thus brings the film down. Lucy is worth checking out if you're into science fiction or Scarlett Johansson. The rest of you should move on.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The second part of the movie changes things up, showing visually impressive action scenes that are surreal and unrealistic. The police car chase scene is really exciting. The movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is just the right length for a tight and engaging story.Overall: ""Lucy"" is a unique sci-fi movie that combines surreal elements, exciting action, and a thought-provoking story. The film is unique and memorable because of its storytelling and visuals. It stands out from other films in its category.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I usually read others', but this time I did really feel I had to tell mine.So, like many other movies, the idea, the concept is fine, even great, considering I'm a science fanatic, despite all the bullshit about using the x% of our brain and such. Few points that sum my opinion.1. Random wilderness footage at the beginning is really random and weird, especially considering they have no direct linking to the happenings and, after two-three scenes, the idea is totally discarded.2. Something that should start from epic karate skills suddenly turn out to let Lucy levitate, like if she's somehow possessed by a demon. What's the point?3. What's the real point of the whole movie, besides explaining what happens when brain reaches 100%?4. Why should she keep all the drugs for herself? So that they won't fall in the wrong hands? What could be ""wrong"" hands if she, herself, kills directly and indirectly hundreds of people to accomplish this?5. Luc is a really bad director, we all know that, but even kindergarten children would be disappointed to find out when she's at 20, 30, 50% blatantly flashing in your face instead of slowly discovering themselves how escalading is the brain of Lucy. Very, very, very wrong move, mr. Besson...6. When Lucy start disintegrating herself, no explanation is given: what and why is that happening? She basically can manipulate the matter but she still can't keep herself altogether.7. The final scene clearly explains she created a pendrive containing all the human knowledge she, as a 'goddess', could gather throughout her space-time traveling skills. Why rushing like this, if she clearly states 'she's anywhere' and therefore can do this later or in any other, simpler, fancier way possible?Definitely a great idea condensed in a poor, sad, low-cost, b-movie film. It was just like giving all the knowlegde to cure cancer to a fish entrapped in a glass bowl. Hope to see a remake by someone else, like Mr. Nolan.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In actuality, it's really silly movie, completely fabricated and hardly original. It's a mix between movies like ""Lawnmower Man"", ""The Terminator"" and ""The Matrix"" and you'll have to put your brains in complete neutral and fully trust your suspension of disbelief.This movie could have been a lot more enjoyable if it DIDN'T try to present itself and something smart and based on facts. It would have worked a lot better as a fabricated Sci-Fi that doesn't take itself seriously.I was surprised to (re-)discover that it's made by Luc Besson, since I expected a lot more originality and sophistication from him - and there's hardly any of either in this movie.Part of its ""sophistication"" is using Asian location and cast. Wait, they are in Taiwan but they all speak Korean?! Min-sik Choi (""Oldboy"") is good as usual, but he's capable of much more.Question: 1. Any reason to use an Egyptian actor as a French cop? 2. Any reason movies still show mobiles that are non-smartphones? I haven't seen people using these phones in the last 5 years but movies keep showing them for some reason.Did I mention the SHAMELESS product placement for Samsung? It's EVERYWHERE: Mobiles, TVs, cameras, printers.

In the spirit of simplicity, it was a poorly conceived script married to less-than-moving conveyance. To analogize, Lucy maintains that consistent, yet vapid projection by which the silver screen carries forth its collection of fallacious bumper-stickers. You know, the kind likely to adorn a Prius. So if you are seeking sheer in-your-face entertainment, your time may be better spent giving yourself a nose bleed. Though knowledge is perceived through clever diction, it is countered by the notion that ignorance is nothing more than knowledge aligned with an ideal. That said, leave the philosophy at home, Mr. Besson, and instead try to deliver upon the promises so badly abused by the art of movie trailer editing. In today's world, that would be unique. Your move, Luc.With such disappointment, why a score of 2? Well, a dinosaur shared my opinion and such mutual recognition deserves at least a point.

It's Action-filled, Cerebral, Intellectual, Metaphysical, Medical, and Gadget driven.In short, it touches all genres of SciFi.When a synthetic drug pushes Lucy (Scarlett Johannsen) to reach her full potential--even against her initial will--she sets off a chain reaction that comes to an unexpected end for those who created the drug... the Drug Lords who've masterminded it... the police who try to stop it with Lucy's help... the unwilling victims who've been coerced into carrying it across international borders.... and us, the viewers. This theme calls into question our biological behaviors, sociological behaviors, and intellectual presumptions. Based on the fact that we use such a small percentage of our human capacity, it asks us to ponder what would happen if we did develop our ""full potential"".

This movie may be a case in point, the story of a girl who accidentally ingests a dose of drugs which cause her to bring into use the full power of her brain beyond the 'ten percent' of it which we normally call on.It's worth remembering that this movie is a work of fiction, based very loosely if at all on any real science, rather than a documentary, something which director Luc Besson has himself pointed out in at least one interview. But while it's not something you'd quote in a science paper, this movie is a great piece of entertainment whose pace and increasing scale make for a great adventure. Scarlett Johansson is found again in the kind of role which she plays so well, that of the bemused 'outsider' who doesn't initially understand what's going on around – or in this case, inside - her. Her journey from this state to one of awareness and growing command of her increasing power gives the film a very strong narrative drive.During one sequence, the title of one of the old pulp sci-fi magazines, 'Amazing Stories', came to mind. 'Lucy' is truly an 'amazing story' for our day, based very loosely (if at all) on actual science, but if taken in that spirit – as a 'scientific thriller', perhaps - it makes for great entertainment, and is well worth seeing.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Advancements in technology depend on creative, intelligent minds thinking of ways to manipulate our world, and fictional stories like this one do half the work by artistically conveying possible worldly manipulations. Though this movie is based on a myth, it provides an important, vivid and emotional storyline, for it explores one of the biggest questions: How should we use our existence?Ultimately all of us are lost on this puny planet floating amidst countless other planets and stars and asteroids and comets. We pass on our genetics and have been doing that for years upon years upon years, but what have we really become? This movies encourages you to evaluate our species' progress, something that's needed as we speed through the twenty-first century.Infinite possibilities dwell in this universe and Lucy stunningly illustrates numerous unexplored ones. On a technical standpoint, the cinematography is beautiful, especially toward the end. Instead of trying to derive scientific fact from this movie, see it as material with which to derive a fresh lens for perceiving the world. Fantasy stories contain mythological creatures like dragons, elves, and mermaids, yet they can still prove captivating—so don't discredit this simply because of the 10% myth.If you're open-minded while viewing this film, then it will easily entertain you. The beginning events spur numerous questions and keep you at the edge of your seat, and the curiosity it evokes lasts until the very end. The strength and originality of Lucy's character, enhanced by Scarlett Johansson's wonderful execution, renders her exciting to watch on screen. Watching this movie is definitely worthwhile; at the very least you'll have a few more things to think about.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

I was interested mainly because I like Luc Besson as a director, and I was curious to see how Scarlett Johansson performed in this film. First off, let's get to what works for this film: the action scenes are well done, for one. Luc Besson knows how to put together action scenes. Morgan Freeman is great as the professor who examines the premise this film is based upon. But, then again, Morgan Freeman is great in anything he does! Scarlett Johansson does a good job of capturing the character of Lucy, going from being a Waif, to being a Warrior. Now for the bad: the length of the film is only 88 minutes long. In the conventional sense, 88 minutes is right at the end of Act Two in a screenplay. Before I wrote this review, I read that this film was a decade in the making. A decade in the making, and the best Mr. Besson could do is a film that is only 88 minutes long? That's sad. This film needed so much more character development. I would have gladly appreciated this film if it was right at two hours or over. Lastly, there's the bad guy who doesn't really do anything more than shout, make faces, and shoot at people.

Leave it to Luc Besson to once again take our imaginations soaring over a world that closely resembles ours. Everything here is a possibility in our world. My wife and I will go see this again. can't wait for the blue ray to come out. it is an instant add to anyone's collection.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

If only it had lower production values, it could have been bad enough to be comical (like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""), but it didn't even succeed at that. Just plain bad.The whole movie was premised on a piece of ""pop science"" that even a nine year old would know is ridiculous nonsense. Sure, science fiction is free to take liberties, but it's supposed to be creative with alternative worlds or play with future possibilities rather than just spewing silly drivel. This just came across like it was written by people with no imagination and no basic education. Luc Besson has made some great films, but this one seemed very lazy. The movie has no redeeming feature other than Scarlett Johansson's visual appeal.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie could easily have been made without that awful blunder, and to compound matters, the directors decided to make that flawed premise the very centre of their film's plot.In order to illustrate my point without giving away the movie's plot, consider this analogous film story: The sun is dying, which is creating havoc on earth, threatening our existence and so on. Could make for an interesting film. Unfortunately the producers decide the sun is dying because it is made up of coal, which is now running out. You would (hopefully) cringe every time that fact is mentioned in the film.. and that is what will happen to you when you watch Lucy. Enjoy Cringe Enjoy Enjoy Cringe Cringe Cringe.As for the film itself, consider the John Travolta film, the Phenomenon. Lucy could easily have borrowed the concept of brain hyperactivity without going off the rails as it did.As a saving grace, Scarlet Johanssen looks as good as she ever has, and she single handedly carries the whole movie.In short, watch the movie ONLY if you are a fan of Scarlet Johanssen, the woman I would gladly have given up my life to be a slave of, were it not for the fact that she found it acceptable to undertake a movie with such a rubbish script.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

To existentialists, it would seem like another useless waste of time seeing kid's fantasy movie, but to the people who understand mysticism, transcendentalism, and Sufism, it will be a good eye opener.The cinema is very short, but the impact of the theory is too heavy. Mysticism and transcendentalism, these two are explored. I know Islamic mysticism does not really bother anyone but if you really are into mysterious things and meeting with The Maker one day, I would say you should read into it. Books of Islamic Mysticists like Gazzali R. on mysticism will give you a proper knowledge of what Sufism or mysticism is. Anyway, the movie shows you that you can transcend and go beyond the limit of human knowledge if you can unlock the full power of you brain which was given to you at the beginning of your being. Being able to harness the power of your own brain will give you access to the domain of a Superior Existence that we often times talk of. I am not saying that humans can really perform all these but if that Superior Being gives you that power then you can do a lot of things. If you are a Jew then the story of Moses A., if you are a Christian then the Stories of Jesus A., and if you are a Muslim then there is no further explanation necessary to you as you already know through religious scriptures the existence of such domain and possibilities. What happened in the end is that when Lucy was eventually given the power to unlock the full potential of her brain, she seemed have met her beginning. The story is short, it has nice East and West combination; and the actors performed very well. Some of the visual elements of the movie were bit redundant and seemed old fashioned. But it is a good movie to watch.This movie is not like the other blockbusters and it should not really be rated on the same scale as the subject matter is totally different. Those who understand mysticism and Sufism would really enjoy the movie.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

I just know that I didn't like it. The story sure is something different than you would expect from an action movie. But a different or a daring story doesn't automatically equal a good story. And in my opinion the story in Lucy is completely ridiculous. Weird story, with below average action and terrible characters equals a bad movie.I say the characters are terrible, cause in all honesty they are. Besides Lucy, everyone else in the movie is just insignificant. Nameless henchmen, vapid villain, useless cop sidekick for the all powerful Lucy. Lucy herself said that: The more knowledge she acquires, the more she loses her human emotions. Or something along those lines. That really summarizes my opinion about her character. As the movie went on, the less I found myself caring. After she became a superhuman, her whole character just got more and more boring.Only time I was even remotely entertained during the movie, was when at the very start Morgan Freeman was giving his presentation about our cells and whatnot. Of course the whole thing was absolute bullcrap, but just Morgan Freeman alone made it worth listening.

Lucy it is then for you. Fits All, even though has some violence. Lucy is the new Terminator and boy it is damn cool. 10 out of 10!CineScope: Based on a theory that for ages human beings have been using only 10% of their brain capacity, what if it can be a little more than that, or what if it can operate at the full 100% levels. Sounds simple, but not it is. Lucy briefly refers to the first hominid /ape / human registered in the history, but then the story revolves around another Lucy of the current era - played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. While studying / working as an ex-pat in Taipei and living normal life of a young woman, how she gets trapped, becomes a drug mule and what makes her develop and use 100% of her brain capacity is all about Lucy! BFB (Bang For the Buck): I was captivated right from the moment I watched the promos in the theater. For the very theme and for Scarlet Johansson, not just for her :-) but for her being in a completely different role from her on-screen image. True-blue Sci-Fi, but from 80s /90s,somewhat like 'The Terminator', and probably NOT from the Matrix era. In short the special effects are minimal and it also tries and covers the emotions while dealing with literally and 'explodingly!' increasing capacity of the brain. No futuristic gadgets, gizmos, or aliens, spaceships etc. but the sci-fi that gets straight to your heart / or probably into the brain :-)My High! 1. I could relate to the theme (100% usage of brain) as I experienced (need not to be believed though:-)) something similar. Me and a couple of friends visited Swami Kriyananda's (foremost disciple of Yogananda Parmahansa) Anand-Ashram near Pune on 1 January 2011. He was recognized as the eminent spiritual Guru in the world. Everyone in the hall attended the session that day, could get a chance to seek his blessings. While he was doing that and I looked at him for a moment, I felt as if he has scanned me completely and knows everything about me and also about every single person in the hall. The gaze was so powerful and was just out of the world, as if he is God / Superhuman / someone using his powers / brains to infinite levels. And the Award goes to./ ScreenEsha Speaks Probably around 4 Academy Award nominations, may not be a winner:1.

As the titles rolled I realised that I'd seen a trailer for the movie a few weeks ago. The movie tells the story of what happens if we use more of our brain. Apparently we only use 10% of the brain at the moment. Presumably this is based on fact, but the movie explores what might happen if we use more of our brain power. Without giving too much away lets just say that the difference is quite dramatic.Scarlett Johansson plays the lead role which is also a clunky reference to the fossil Lucy. As ever Scarlett Johansson is pretty watchable with Morgan Freeman providing the descriptions of the science behind what is happening.You'll probably not remember anything about the movie in a couple of months, but it was fairly entertaining.

Technology obliges.Audiences will rejoice to see Min-sik Choi from acclaimed Oldboy (2003) on screen again as the leader of a Korean drug mafia this time. Johansson plays her usual role (girl next door,a bit simple and lost in space). – Watch out for the broken nail polish throughout the film – One would think that highly intelligent beings would have adjusted that (although it could be something that was overlooked by Luc Besson).In parallel to this, we have Morgan Freeman (science professor at the university of Paris) explaining how the brain uses a maximum of 20% of its capacity and preparing the audience for what's to come next. His theories reveal that if the brain uses 100% of its capacity one would die but at the same time would be able to read a book in a second and control the elements such as electricity, metal, air, therefore becoming a highly intelligent/supernatural being.However, the problem of course is that with great power comes great responsibility. The film asks the fundamental questions such as: ""Will technology destroy us""? ""Will our world become emotionless and lonely, therefore non-human""? The more Johansson's character gains artificial intelligence due to science, the more she's incapable of feeling pain, sadness, happiness, or any other emotions, but at the same time seeking it and wanting to keep her humanity.The film is very entertaining to watch and could be interesting intellectually speaking as the concepts are original and open for discussion, but gets ruined by a few things such as endless car chases, fights, Matrix vs. X-men visual effects, and peculiar ending. However, the idea is there and worth a watch.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

If...then...really? Why would the character do that? Does increased brain power allow someone to do that? The movie is built around the false premise that humans only utilize 10% of their brains.So, don't try to pick the movie apart. Just sit back and enjoy it. Lucy is quickly paced; you won't be bored. Scarlett Johansson is vulnerable at the beginning and engages the viewer as being almost pitiful. She turns into a complete bad-ass as the movie progressives. You end up not pitying her character, just glad that your not standing between her and her goal. Johansson reaches the status of Terminator in this movie.Morgan Freeman's voice and subject matter has you convinced that you're watching ""Through the Wormhole."" Min-Sik Choi makes a good villain, though uncharacteristically inept at times. Amr Waked plays an Interpol(?) cop who is the closest thing to a love interest this movie has for Lucy.There is a good mix of black comedy in with the action and violence. A couple of times, the director made heavy-handed assurances through awkward dialog that Lucy's violence didn't cross a line, pointing out that someone had been shot in the leg and that people were asleep instead of dead. There are more elegant, less obvious ways of pointing out things. If the director wants a violent movie (and Lucy can't be non-violent), then own it.Turn your brain knob to seven and enjoy this summer action flick.

I went to see it primarily for Ms. Johansson. I love her. I think she is one of the most gifted artists currently ""on the scene"". She can sing, she can dance, she can do it all. Damn, didn't she win a Tony too? I've found every single one of her screen performances to be flawless. She makes me believe every character she plays whether that be a Long Island Princess or trained assassin who hangs with a Norse God. ""Lucy"" is no exception. She brings to this performance a depth that it probably doesn't need or deserve; but because she does, the movie is all the more gripping. That being said... This movie requires the suspension of the suspension of disbelief. It is quite frankly ludicrous in its ideas and asinine in its assumptions. It is some kind of ultra-camp. But the execution is sublime. Besson just pulls out the stops with his storyline and somehow miraculously manages to successfully graft a drug heist caper movie onto a sci-fi thriller. Once I just gave in to the movie's preposterousness I was riveted from start to finish. The film excited me in a way that is rare. You know, when you feel you're seeing something fresh when you've seen everything a million times already? I found Lucy to be this kind of experience. Camp, intentional or not, often takes the viewer full circle. From the ridiculous to the sublime and back again. I was also entranced by some of the imagery. One critic said this movie is sort of like ""The Tree of Life"" if it had been directed by Michael Bay (and I'll add Tarantino as producer) and this is an apt description. But in this case, that's a great thing. ""Lucy"" I think is the kind of thing you're either gonna love or hate. I loved it. If you're willing not to take Lucy too seriously...or seriously at all...the strange thing is you might actually find it thought provoking.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Exhibiting great range in her skills as an actress. Going from a scared student to what she becomes as the movie progresses. The choice of Scarlett goes beyond her beauty, but also helps bring to light the capabilities of the human mind while you watch her transition.Morgan Freeman's part is no less critical in the progression of the character Lucy. Showing extreme maturity in acting Mr. Freeman's simple facial expressions add to the profound nature of the topic of the story.Other reviewers have given Lucy a very low rating, everyone is not capable of appreciating a movie of higher awareness. Lucy is a movie for those that have the capability of thinking!!Destine to be a classic such as 2001:A Space Odyssey. Lucy is far more that a Sci-fi filled with endless computer graphics, there are no aliens or robots. What the movie does have is deep introspective look in to the human mind.This is one of the best movies of the year for me.

"4","/10","this is your brain on drugs","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4675646/?ref_=tt_urv","ivko","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2510120/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2019","Far from being just a ridiculous, terrible movie, this movie is an exciting view into the vast world of stupid that humanity can dream of. Putting aside that 10% of your brain myth underpinning the entire plot that has long since been debunked, there's just so many logical inconsistencies in this film that it's a little baffling that someone didn't catch at least some of them during the process of making a major blockbuster like this. But the real tragedy here is that I think there was a better film hiding underneath it all that could have been in more capable hands.Consider the start of the film, for example, wherein Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy unwittingly becomes entangled with a criminal syndicate. This is my favorite part of the movie because Ms. Johansson plays the role with with such visceral emotion. Her terror at finding herself suddenly and unexpectedly in the midst of a life or death situation is compelling. But already here there are some problems, like the absurdly public and unnecessary violence of the criminals. Of course, criminals can be violent, but even the most violent crime lords do their dirty work in the shadows or in guerrilla-style hit and run attacks, not brazenly on their front doorstep. Working that way would inevitably bring conflict with authorities (at least in first-world, developed nations) and spur public outrage, forcing even a corrupt government to confront the issue. But more than that, it isn't needed. Lucy is already oozing palpable tension and fear; the violence, if anything, relieves the tension by giving a face to her fear instead of letting the nameless dread wash over the viewer.The movie goes downhill really quickly after that. Basically, Lucy gains godlike abilities before we're 30 minutes into the film. This completely blows any tension or concern for her out of the water. She's become unstoppable, so why should we be concerned? Instead of gradually building her self-confidence and powers with us along for the ride, we watch her seize to be human in the first act. How can we relate anymore? The director seems to think that watching her plow through endless armies of bad guys will be entertainment enough, and maybe for some people it was. But I suspect most people would have liked to go on that journey of self-discovery with her, even if we had to worry about her well being a little along the way.Another major problem with the movie is that in a very real way, after Lucy is exposed to the magic smart drug--well, actually it isn't described as a smart drug at all but rather as a concentrated energy drug produced in limited quantities by pregnant mothers to give babies energy to grow; no explanation is given for why a super-powered Monster energy drink would make you smarter, but whatever. Anyway, after she is exposed to the drug, in a very real way we watch Lucy die and something else that only looks like her inhabit her body. Her personality is completely different. Before her exposure she's shown to be expressive and empathetic. After her exposure she is emotionless and cold, coolly executing many, many people including an innocent bystander who, she explains while dumping his body on the floor, had a terminal condition anyway.The audience is encouraged to believe Lucy is still the movies heroine, since most of her victims were bad guys. And I'm not saying that a hero can only have a batman-esque philosophy of no killing ever, but such a bloodless attitude towards what our society would describe as murder is far more indicative of an antagonist than a hero. Frankly, the movie would have been far more interesting if the focus had switched to destroying this man-made monster with unfathomable motives instead of worshiping a super powered sociopath. But it was the simple acceptance by the other characters of her actions that gave me the willies. Particularly since it is implied that Lucy is us evolved into some future, ideal state. What kind of messed up future do these writers dream of for humanity?Another problem I have with the film is this idea that the laws of physics and space and time really only exist, in some sense, because we believe they do. There is no level of intelligence that disables gravity or lets us push our fingers into someones skull and extract their memories. Yes, it's their universe and all that, but it just feels like such a lazy tool. They're not trying to create a world with magic, they just needed a way to show how her increased mental capacity allowed her to overcome all of these obstacles. And since they couldn't think of a series of actions that would accomplish that, they invented some magic mind powers to create a shortcut to their goal. It's lazy and stupid.Speaking of, I also have to take exception with their depiction of academia and science. In between Lucy's adventures, the movie also cuts to Morgan Freeman's character giving a presentation at some academic conference about the brain. He starts with that 10% myth, moves on to a complete non sequitur about cells and their environments that seems to be there only so the movie can make a callback to it later in reference to Lucy, and finally starts talking about what happens to humans accessing 20% and 40% of their brain (while also accidentally debunking his own speculation about what happens by referencing how dolphins already access 20% of their brains; where exactly are their crazy powers?).Now, I've been to a few academic conferences in my time and they can indeed be a forum for the free exchange of ideas and even some educated speculation about future possibilities. But here, when he just pulls these very specific notions out of his backside about what happens at each level of attainment (that sound more like a description of what happens when you level up in a video game than scientific research), the crowd just gazes at him adoringly and accepts his confession that he just made it all up without any follow-up comments. I guarantee you that would not be the response. Academics are a competitive, hard nosed bunch who almost relish the opportunity to pick the unprepared apart. Make a claim like that and then admit you just made it up and you would be in for a deeply unpleasant inquiry from your audience.Ok, I need to bring this crazy person rant to a close. Believe it or not, this is actually the much shortened list of my complaints, but I need to save something for my friends and family to really make them regret answering the phone, so I'll stop it here. Obviously, I didn't care much for the film, but I'll say this much: if you like Scarlett Johansson and enjoy special effects laden action films and don't care too much that it all make sense, then I suppose you could enjoy this film. Ms. Johansson does as much with the script as she can, I think, and the cinematography is quite good, as are the special effects and fight scenes. Also, I think I could see how some people would enjoy it as a kind of revenge film, particularly since one thing they do depict pretty well is the misogyny of the villains. But if it's the idea of a smart drug that interests you, I'd recommend Limitless with Bradley Cooper as a much better alternative.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Even the slow parts had something to keep you in suspense. Luc Besson is best known for Leon the Professional, Inception, 2001: A Space Odyssey, but he is also known for the movie Intouchables (2011) which by the way has an 8.6 IMDb rating. One of my favorite movies.Luc Besson did a great job, again as always, and took a simple idea and turned it into a human lesson. That people should use their brains more often and control their desires. I loved the general idea and all the smaller ideas that popped out all over the movie, but only if you had your mind on listening to the dialogues would you know what I am talking about.I hope it doesn't take Luc Besson another 9 years to manifest another idea as good as this one!Thanks Luc.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Yes, I saw the action packed, sci-fi flick that that asks the simple question... ""What if they made a sequel to Limitless?"" For all intents and purposes, that's what it is, plain and simple- er... wait, let me revise that because this movie is anything but plain and simple. This movie does for Limitless what Crank 2 did for Crank or what Transformers 4 did for 1987's Batteries Not Included. In essence it cranks it up to 11 and breaks the knob off! It's basically the same setup as Limitless with Scarlett Johansson playing the helpless shlub, albeit a smoking hot one, who accidentally ingests an highly dangerous drug that increases her mental acuity 1000 fold. The movie is both visually astounding and pretty well acted but unfortunately, the story lacks any real sense of suspense or a menacing threat to the main character and things get rather unbelievable pretty damn quick for even the most willing audience. All in all its an OK movie to watch but to be honest, I was getting really bored with it after the first half hour which for what this movie started out as, is a major disappointment. I don't think I'd recommend seeing this one in a theater because frankly, there are much better choices this summer even in the eye candy section. Lucy earns itself a 2.5...out of 5.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is a film that pushes our imagination, offers fascinating insights about the possibilities of brain function, and takes a different stance on fantasy thrillers.Opening in Ethiopia we meet Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) and Richard (Pilou Asbæk) – Richard is asking Lucy to deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). But immediately Lucy is caught up in a nightmarish situation where she is captured and turned into a drug mule for a new and powerful synthetic drug. When the bag she is carrying inside of her stomach leaks, Lucy's body undergoes unimaginable changes that unlock her mind's full potential 100%. With her newfound powers, Lucy turns into a merciless warrior intent on getting back at her captors. She receives invaluable help from Professor Norman Morgan Freeman), the leading authority on the human mind, and French police captain Pierre Del Rio (Amr Waked). Watching Lucy's expanding brain power provide extensive insights and control is astonishing and the entire film is enhanced by not only the intelligent words from Professor Norman but also the flashbacks to the beginning of life on the planet, dizzyingly fast forwarded to now and the world Lucy must face. Try to pay less attention to the plethora of Chinese gangsters and focus on the intelligent possibilities and the film will remain in the back of your mind long after the credits run.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I will not judge those who found some way to enjoy this film (which I find highly suspicious, cough..cough...paid studio reviewers). You do not have to be a film critic to realize how bad this film is. I do not care about the science, when I watch a movie I accept the bending of the rules. This being said, this film is horrible, just god awful. The story goes nowhere and has not true identity. It feels like you are meant to watch a fun science fiction film, but are than meant to think about the film in an intellectual way, which is just nonsense. The film in no way provides any great ideas. If my review is confusing, it is only because that is how bad this film is. It's very hard to pin-point once wrong thing, that if changed would have changed the film, but unfortunately I do not believe this film could be saved. I think the idea sounded like a good movie, but there was never really a good plan yet the made it anyways.It's not like the acting was bad, it was just a poor delivery of a story. I wanted to donkey punch my brother for suggesting this movie. I like the only actors I recognized, Scarlett & Morgan, so thee is nothing personal here. I watched a movie to watch a movie.

I just thought about what we would become if we really use all the potential of ourselves. Somehow I begin to believe that we are created by some species more advanced and developed in the universe, considering that till now we haven't find the evidence of the key step of ape's evolving to modern human beings.

"9","/10","""Lucy"" Maximizes the Sci-Fi Genre to Near 100%","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3062863/?ref_=tt_urv","texshelters","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17472655/?ref_=tt_urv","1 August 2014","""Lucy"" Maximizes the Sci-Fi Genre to Near 100% Most of the best sci-fi movies are about ideas. The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Fahrenheit 451, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Inception are examples of this. Then there are those sci-fi movies that have relied more on technology and special effects than ideas. (See Transformers.) However, when science fiction combines both ideas and technology, the genre can be one of the most entertaining in cinema. Lucy does just that. The ideas in Lucy are no less universal than the purpose of life on this planet and what it means to be human. And like 2001, A Space Odyssey, the film offers no pat answers to these questions. Lucy gets abducted by Japanese thugs in a fancy Taiwanese hotel and taken to a room where she meets their boss. The gangsters want to know what is in the case her now ex-boyfriend has cuffed to her left arm. Lucy doesn't know, but she learns later what she has. Some critics question the fact that Japanese business men, mobsters really, don't speak English. The fact is, we don't know if they speak English. What we do know is that they refuse to speak English, and that makes Lucy even more frightened and the scene more foreboding as she is questioned by the criminals. Moreover, the lack of subtitles for the Japanese spoken in the scene helps us empathize with Lucy's situation; we don't know what is happening any more than she does. Lucy isn't drawn out or overly mellow-dramatic. Scarlett Johansson does a good job as Lucy, a strange and multi-dimensional character even though we have little to no back-story for the character. That doesn't matter, for Lucy's motivation comes from the changes she goes through in the film. Lucy is what good science fiction can be. It has action, philosophy, and big ideas. What surprises me are all the critiques of the science in Lucy, some from people who loved Inception, Transformers or The Edge of Tomorrow, films with even less plausible scientific under-pinnings. It's as if critics forgot what the phrase ""science fiction"" means. Movies are about suspending disbelief and being carried away. Lucy let's us do just that. Lucy is not omnipotent like Neo of the Matrix films. She clearly does not have all the answers, and she doesn't have to. Her answers to her existence are more like Buddhist koans, not pronouncements of her divinity. A friend told me that Johansson is charismatic, that the camera likes her. Wrong, I said, the camera loves her. And I am not just talking about her sultriness. In Lucy, she makes it easy to care about the enigmatic title character. Morgan Freeman's Professor Norman is not as well developed. As we meet him, he is presenting a talk on neuroscience and his theories about the brain to a group in Paris. The talk is the weak spot in the movie, although the character of Norman improves as he interacts with Lucy. One of the most contentious ideas in the film is that ""we only use 10% of our brain."" First, there is no evidence for this, and secondly, there is evidence that over a life-time, 100% of our brains get used, just not all at once. Perhaps the idea is that only 10% of our neurons can fire at one time. The film is not clear on that. I refer you to my earlier statement; it is science fiction. If you can accept the idea that some people can better access their brain's capacity, i.e. Einstein, Kepler, Tesla, Hawking, and so forth, then it is not hard to accept the idea that perhaps there is more potential in the brain than we realize. Thus, we have Lucy. Bonus: The editing is excellent; it makes want me to become an editor of cinema. I will go out on a limb and say that Lucy will win the Oscar for best editing. The music is interesting but stays out of the way of the movie. Lucy reminds me in many ways of 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially toward the end of the film. After nearly 50 years, Kubrick's classic is still influencing cinema. Weaknesses: Some of the dialogue is banal. Mostly, it doesn't get in the way of the ideas and action in the movie. Another irksome problem with the film is the lack of explanation of some plot elements, such as why Lucy was studying in Taiwan and how did she get into a jail cell after her kidnapping. A couple of well-placed lines of dialogue could have solved that issue. Rating: Pay full price; see it twice. Lucy is not a perfect film, and I could nitpick and rate it down a bit. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the action and ideas and was not in any way put off by the imperfect science. It didn't drag on, it entertained me, and it left me thinking. That's what good science fiction is about. Peace, Tex Shelters","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's an empty shell, filled not only with hot air, but also CGI (and clips from the great 2011 film documentary Samsara) which is not bad, if what you want is what looks like a TV ""tech-demo"" showcase.

No. Really.P.S.: I know some of you IMDb-goers seemed to like the movie, and that's fine, but for the sake of cinema don't accept a movie that lacks so much passion so easily. This movie to me personally was like a fast-food meal, something that's made in a rush, and gets out of my system equally as fast. We got to be critics, the cinema needs critic minds, the viewers must distinguish by themselves what's entertaining and culture enriching and what's not, or else a Lucy 2, Expendables 3 or a Prometheus sequel (shrug!) pops up, and the cycle goes on.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

The storyline is fast paced and gripping, not too fast that you lose your way but enough to keep people engaged.This film was excellent. There were a few scenes where they seemed a little silly and unrealistic but the majority was a great performance by Scarlet Johansson. There have been a fair few negative reviews and a surprisingly low rating on IMDb. Many because people were led to believe it was a sci-fi film. It did have some Sc-fi elements including levitation people and various time warps; however, what really gripped me with the film was the fact that it introduced true and very relevant facts of the world. The concept and story of Lucy is very philosophical to say the least, or at least that is what I found. Leaving the cinema it left me wondering about human existence and the capabilities and limits of the brain. It truly was a thought provoking movie!","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Some feel that they are so mentally superior that they need to point out how scientifically impossible the events of a movie are. Well, all you Smarty McSmartersons, guess what. This is not a documentary. It is a movie based on fantasy or science fiction concepts. Whether or not the whole ten percent thing has been proved in real life has nothing to do with this movie, because it is a movie. And in this particular movie universe, people only use ten percent of their brains. So let loose your omnipotent grasp on all knowledge that is correct and relax for a couple hours.I personally enjoyed the movie and recommend it. I love movies that focus on one person gaining a usually very specific super power. It falls into the same unnamed category as Limitless, Push, Jumper and Unbreakable. It's a what if story about people becoming more than they are in the real world. I just wish it lasted a little longer.Unfortunately for this genre, everything else besides the super power is usually quite mundane. The world looks normal, so people expect the rules of real world science to apply. If you are one to loosen your grasp on reality when being entertained, then you will enjoy this movie. If you are someone who needs to try and make sense of everything or needs to let the world know how smart you are, then you really don't need to see this movie. Just watch the trailer and pick it apart. Your argument will be that same.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

But the drugs she is carrying are no ordinary narcotics, they are CPH4, a synthetic based on a substance given to fetuses to help their prenatal development, and unfortunately, the bag tears and all that drug makes its way into her blood stream.To explain what all this means, the film takes us to Professor Samuel Norman, played by Morgan Freeman. But he's taking us down the rabbit hole here rather than Through the Wormhole (a fascinating series hosted by Freeman), and explaining that the average human only uses between 10 and 15% of their brain, but they could get all types of wacky superpowers if they are able to use more, which Lucy presumably can or else would they cross to this guy?Johansson slowly turns into a cross between Keanu Reeves from the Matrix, including his abilities to bend matter, shoot with pin point accuracy, see coding everywhere, and not display a discernible emotion; and Yoda from Revenge of the Sith, complete with wise sayings and the ability to knock a room full of bad guys unconscious with one flick of the hand. Johansson is looking for revenge on Mr Jang, (Chio Min Sik) the man who forced her to carry the drugs, with Drug Enforcement Officer Pierre del Rio (Amr Waked) by her side.Besson has done a good job with the direction, with the film frequently showing cut scenes to appropriate situations with animals in the wild, cave men and transitional apes, which actually do go somewhere in the film's final act. The special effects are adequate and the action sequences, including gun fights, car chases and hand to hand combat, are well put together.Johansson is solid in the lead role and puts across a believable detachment, Freeman is good as usual, while Amr Waked, probably the most important character in the film as he acts as a conduit for the audience, gives a well judged performance, though is let down a little bit by his character being under developed in the script.If you're the type of person who likes plausible science in movies, give this one a miss. However, if you can look past implausible science providing a film makes sense in its own reality, there is a lot to like here. I thoroughly enjoyed this and it is refreshing to see an action film featuring a female lead where her gender is not the focus. A pleasing return to form for Besson.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Revenge movie meets Discovery Channel nature documentary meets superhero movie meets The Matrix meets Inception meets 2001. I do realise all sci-fi and fantasy requires a suspension of disbelief but not all are as challenging as this. In order to have plot holes, some sort of vaguely feasible plot is required. No such effort was made here.What on earth was all that wildlife documentary footage about? OK, yes, the prof's lecture was boring and verging on insane but did the editors really think that sticking in film of big cats mating would hold our attention better?Special effects developed for Inception at least made sense in Inception (not that that movie made much sense) but were distractingly and bizarrely out of place here.Similarly, the power of the mind to pin people to the ceiling and stop bullets made internal sense in the logic of The Matrix, but stealing the effects and imagery and bunging them in where they make no sense at all.. why?I am sure the references to The Matrix and 2001 were conscious homages rather than just theft and I confess I did enjoy the whole 2001 redux bit in the last reel.What mildly bothered me but seriously upset my female companions was our ""superhero's"" total disregard for human life and suffering. I understand that made sense in the context of what little plot there was but it does make it hard to enjoy a movie when there is no-one you can sympathise with and the main character is a callous bitch.

I guess they did not check up what the movie was really about before watching it. The movie is not perfect, it has its flaws, but a 1 or 2 star bullshit rating is hugely unfair. Personally, I really liked this movie. It is science fiction, pure and simple. If you expect science without the fiction, well then you should go and see some other movie. With Luc Besson both writing and directing and statements like ""merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic"" in the blurb  well I got pretty much what I expected.The movie starts off making you think it is a ""simple"" revenge story with science fiction elements in the form of the superhuman Lucy. However it gradually evolves into something else. Lucy knows that she cannot survive in her new state and it becomes a quest to preserve the knowledge that she has acquired while she still has the time and at the same time dodging the drug dealers that are the cause of her situation in the first place.Lucy is great. Her powers and how they develop are awesome. I really like surprise effects in movie and books of the kind that you get when someone like Lucy reveals her powers to the ""mundane"". Especially when the revealing means swatting a few bad guys. This movie is full of moments like that. It is quite a roller coaster ride of action with Lucy exhibiting her growing powers. Not too surprisingly the movie is also full of scientific bullshit and plot holes. I do not really care. I'm in for the ride and it is a fun ride.Scarlett Johansson is very good in her role as Lucy. Most of the other actors are OK although the Asian drug boss could have been better. He came out more like a brainless thug than anything else. Certainly not as the mastermind of a criminal organization.The ending was a bit unsatisfactory compared to the rest of the movie though. I was a bit disappointed that the big fight at the end more or less was done without Lucy. The long cinematic sequences where Lucy wondered about in time and space felt a bit like yawn-filler-material. The actual ending, well that ""I am everywhere"" bit was really been there, seen that, done that. Also, if she was indeed everywhere, why the hurry to create that fancy memory stick? Anyway, apart from that I really enjoyed this movie.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

That is a very interesting question, but the question is never answered in a fully satisfying way. Scarlet Johansson does a decent job as Lucy, but the wasted opportunity of the movie was Min-Sik Choi. A fabulous Korean actor, who was given a role which had no depth or purpose. He was a villain, but was never a match for Lucy and her new found powers, which took away all tension and threat that the film had going for it, brilliantly, in the first few minutes (before their meeting).I cant help but feel extremely disappointed! Visually its a stunning film, but you would come to expect more purpose from a director who has achieved so much better in the past.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

It was weird, even stupid at points, but I stuck with it til the end. Certainly entertaining from start to finish, No time was wasted on any part of the movie. explaining how the human mind would work if 20% 30% 50% 90% would work in a movie would be impossible and beyond what us humans perceive to make sense. Which is why the movie could seem confusing and strange. It is suppose to be confusing as we do no yet know what our minds are capable of. I had to watch it a second time to make sure it was what I thought it was. To explain what our mind would be like at higher capacities is not possible. However the writer and director of this film did a brilliant job explaining it. Sure it seems weird, and dream like, but how else to you explain a theory. Especially a theory that is beyond our thinking.Keep an open mind and know that you are not suppose to be able to make sense of it all. Know it is beyond our thinking and appreciate this movie for what it really is. An entertaining fast paced brilliant piece of art that is a part of propelling us into the future. I have to give it a 10 even though it is not my favorite movie and even though it seemed full of holes, was cheesy and sort of B rated at times. Looking beyond the flaws it was actually well thought out and deserving of 10 stars. its sad to see so many bad reviews but I understand","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Luc Besson is the pioneer of mixing multiple genres Kitsch , Art House,Action, Drama, Comedy always with a view to commercialism.All his trademarks are there, the car chase through an European City in an ordinary car, The Slap, Suave Calm but violent Sidekick, the Mexican Standoff with Classical Music, the claustrophobic action set, Love taking a backseat but always around.....etc etcBut If there's anything Luc Besson can do, its combine the feminine and the violent.He can make the same woman in the same clothes look ugly once, beautiful immediately after, sometimes he does it at the same time, he has shown Scarlet Johansson in lingerie and still not stirred you sexually.Its the same with violence, he glamorises it, but it repulses you at the same time, at other times the most grotesque act seems so cool.He has his fare share of critics if but none will disagree when I say that Luc Besson understands human emotions, violence and women. Respect.Despite the ridiculous plot(please don't go if you're going looking for plot holes and scientific logic), the actors have remained true to their work, ranging from honest to flashes of brilliance.Scarlet Johansson though I've maintained just doesn't have the versatility to play such roles, but she adds that glamour than unknown actresses just cant.Technically Luc Besson has been and will always remain brilliant, and analysis of this aspect of his movies can fill pages.In the end though I would like to describe my experience from this movie with the shortest of short illustrations.You go into a Chefs Signature Restaurant, you're super excited, your friends who don't know of him less so, but some of your enthusiasm has rubbed of on them and besides everyone in the restaurant does their job well and your waitress is smoking hot.He serves up signature dishes in the earlier course, stirring up all the areas of your tongue and taste buds, indeed even stirring up a whole range of emotions in everyone's body.Everyone is anxiously waiting for a fitting finale , everything is ripe for it, the musicians in the restaurant are building up a crescendo , your expecting, Foie de Gras , Cocaine and Caviar, Dal cooked for days bye a blind , deaf cripple.......The music is building....wait for it...The credit card and rolled paper comes in.....wait for it...The feel somewhere a salmon is being pulled from a fish tank...wait for it.....In the background you can see the dying old lady, stirring Dal ...wait for it....And then you get served Soggy Fries....The vagaries of human thought doesn't allow us to enjoy such an experience no matter how good the earlier courses were, if you've built yourself up for something and that doesn't happen, than almost nothing that happened along the way will matter.This my friend sums up my experience in the movie.-s Finalle will soon be included in the definition of #epicfail and damp squib.+/-s scarlet Johansson , ridiculous plot (sometimes too much even for me despite expecting it).+s Technically Luc Besson, signatures et all, Cast remains true.4/10...this discounts my epic disappointment as a fan, if your not a movie buff or a fan than you could probably add another star.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

In these roles she plays a variety of quite bizarre characters, and plays them well. She has matured in her acting ability, and it is great to see a female actor picking both interesting roles and playing in them something other than a mindless heroine, or sex object/romantic partner. The character she plays is interesting as a mix of sensibilities. This movie is part thriller, part action, part sci-fi, and part philosophical. It has a reasonably artistic style, its philosophy is a little waffley, but still profound, the science is not always accurate, and some of the concepts require _an imagination_ or at least the belief that we do not no everything there is to know with certainty.But ignoring all that, to sum - it is a fun ride, affecting moments, has stylistic charm, some interesting acting, some fun action, and raises some interesting concepts. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and recommend it - but only if you can a) think and b) come into it without hyper criticism/cynicism - in other words, be open to the experience. Its a European produced film for American audiences, and this makes it less full of culturally centric ideas, and social stereotypes than it would have been if it was American only which serves as another little bonus.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

But she fights back, and with the help of hotshot cop Del Toro (Amr Waked) seeks to track down the benevolent Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who's spearheading some pioneering research in to the field of mind drugs.In a sea of mindless, wham-bam thank ya mam action flicks, French auteur Luc Besson has, with Lucy, tried to craft that rarest of breeds, a thinking man's action film that gets you to summon a bit of the grey matter in the midst of all the noise and explosions, even if he's admitted taking some creative license with a bit of the scientific truth behind it. The idea of experimental new drugs being used to enhance the mind's ability is a ripe idea for such a film. But, crucially before this, you need to care about the characters involved, and you need to make the film a bit of fun, two things Lucy completely fails to do.We find ourselves just thrust in to the action, without any sort of introduction or character development, and so it's impossible to care about this character or any of the problems that face her, as she single-handedly wipes out gangs of villainous mobsters with an unexplained sense of efficiency. The film is so swept up in the grandeur of it's clever idea that it just becomes overwhelmingly cerebral and far fetched, without a hint of humour or more easy going stuff.Yes, it gives you something to think about, but without solid writing or a lead character to root for, you just can't think about it as much as you could. At least it's blissfully short. **","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I particularly enjoyed the early half of the film when Lucy was in action mode...very 008 with style! Johansson rocks the part so well I can't imagine anyone else in the role, maybe Sigourney Weaver if it were made 20 yrs ago, but it's not, it's new and futuristic, a great story never before seen in cinema and makes good use of CGI, As I said, maybe a bit much but each individual decides that when viewing.In my opinion, it's one of the best films in this category that I've seen in a very long time.

This movie got the smokin hot Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman in it. What else do you want in a movie? Seriously those two is more than enough reasons to watch this movie. I randomly picked this movie and that is my initial thought when I see this 2 people in the movie. Well you guess what? I'm not disappointed. Truth be told my expectation for this movie is kinda low because I do not have any idea what this movie is all about since the title of this movie is very short, consist of only 4 letters; L-U-C-Y. And I never see a commercial or the trailer of this movie anywhere. Its like this movie is magically downloaded into my little brother's external HD or something.But this movie is more to it than meets the eye as I progressed through the story. Of course the starting of the story is kinda dumb, a guy asked a girl he just meet to deliver a briefcase and she agreed to it as stated in the synopsis. But what happens later is what makes this movie great, thrilling and fun to watch. Lucy in this movie is ain't no bimbo with just pretty face and nice racks, she is a deadly beauty with a brain(tons of it) and has achieved the unthinkable.Another thing that make this movie interesting to watch is the bad guy of the movie, Mr. Jang. He is not your typical African-American gangsta or Chinese thugs you seen in most movies, he is a Korean gangster with a swagg. Its a rare element in western movies I've seen. This movie touched about many strong issues like narcotics, human trafficking, human evolution, Darwinism and society corruption. So this may definitely not suitable for kids.In conclusion, this movie is fun, thrilling, mind blowing and enjoyable to watch. An action-thriller sci-fi movie that I would definitely suggest to my friends to watch.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Directors often spend big budgets on special effects without a story or vision worthy of the effort. Intellectually satisfying, this movie communicated vision, and this director did it right. The acting was brilliant, and the direction was spot on. I will watch this movie again, and hopefully while it is still at the cinema. I will refer to this movie in the future when I cite important concepts to think about. As to the special effects, I believe this movie has advanced the field. This movie was satisfying on so many levels. Thank you for putting together such a great experience, and please, give me MORE!","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Morgan Freeman as the supporting lead was very-very suitable. All in all, I think this film is set with a decent pace, with a nice story to tell and to close. I finished the film feeling satisfied and happy with a nice thrill. I totally recommend this title if you're looking at a nice action flick that has a little bit of depth, a bit unconventional and dark, yet no- nonsense action. The film do have some grotesque parts, especially with the blood and cutting up of tummy lines to hide drugs and all..","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

My mind was so intent on making that one power real I would sit for hours staring at a picture on my mum's mantle willing it to move but alas it never actually happened. Imagine though if it did. Imagine that you had the ability to not only make objects move but the ability to control people, make them do what you want, bend not only time but space with the blink of your mind's eye, whatever you wanted was there with a single thought. Luc Besson would be one of the much underrated directors in my opinion and another one of my favorites with such titles as: The Fifth Element, La Femme Nikita, Starship Troopers and B13 he has an ability to turn the simple into the extraordinary and usually he knows how to make his female leads totally kick ass. Lucy is his latest piece of artwork once again not only director but also writer, it is a very simple storyline; what would happen if you could use 100% of your mind? Lucy is what will happen. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) gets wrapped up in a dangerous drug smuggling ring where she is used against her will to import the latest drug to hit Europe. One thing leads to another and Lucy ends up ingesting the entire package she is smuggling into her blood stream. Slowly Lucy begins to gain the ability to use more than the proposed 10% of her brain function, as she gains more use the world she and we all know starts to disappear and Lucy begins seeing it for what it really is. Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption, The Dark Knight Rises) plays Professor Norman who is actually studying the brain and its limitless abilities who Lucy reaches out to for help. He doesn't have the greatest role but it is Morgan Freeman after all. Min-Sik Choi (Old boy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) plays the bad guy Mr. Jang who has organised the trafficking. As I said it is a very simple storyline and plot, though in the usual Luc Besson action and sci-fi style. An action packed brain melting film would be my best explanation, so much is wrong with the film but then so much is right as well. If you can leave behind the nonsense of it all and let that inner child break free this film is really enjoyable for what it is. Leave you marbles at the door and enjoy what Lucy is all about, an unknown universe and all it may have to offer.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

IMAGINE WHAT SHE COULD DO WITH 100%. I thought that this would be more enjoyable then it was, but unfortunately I was wrong. This film stars Scarlett Johansson and its basically limitless trying to be more of an action film with a female lead. The film revolves around a woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. The movie did not achieve its goal, it tries to be fun action film with a unique premise. But the premise is not unique and the film is barely any fun, it has its moments no mind you but I just didn't have much fun with it. The story is not that interesting, it's basically limitless meets old-boy. We see Lucy trying to kill the people who gave her this drug for being so cruel, and she takes more doses to access 100% of the brains capacity to save the information for a scientist played by Morgan Freeman. The performances from most of the cast members is just awful, they were all just really boring to listen too. The only worthwhile people in this film are Johansson and Freeman. You know this movie starts off like Old-boy and one of the actors from this film was in the original old-boy. The direction from Luc Besson is pretty good but as for the writing, now that's a whole different story. The film is poor due to its writing, it's not his best written work but most certainly his worst, or at least I doubt it is. All the elements of a good film are not present in this picture. Lucy drives to entertain, but left me with boredom but with a little bit of good acting and good directing this film wasn't a complete waste of time.

An independent film 'under the skin' showed Scarlett's Alien side, 'Lucy' shows her logical and philosophical side and 'ghost in the shell' shows her almost human side.
It's interesting to see how Luc Besson brought this film on to the screen after nearly 10 years of planning. Scarlett was the right choice for this project. It's good how she makes Lucy's humanity more Godly yet unforgiving.
One can not help noticing how she talks in a mono tonal voice through out as she appears not to struggle with her emotions, or lack of it.
Is this robotic phase a case where she has achieved immortality and emotions are irrelevant.
Over all I gave this movie a 10 because it is a difficult story to project to the audience on many levels and Besson did a good job.
Or we will end up thinking what is going on but like Kubricks 2001.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

For me I found this movie blur / unclear. what I found is some scene in the movie that are funny, - The hospital scene, where Lucy walking easily carrying a gun, without any of the staff members, patient, people, or security realizing it?? - When Lucy reads Jang's mind, but she can read the nation name not from Jang's POV, but from his men POV. - When Lucy changed her hair colors in public, and everyone seems not noticing it, even the girl that near behind her. - When Jang's men put out a lot of weapons in front of the university and all the police that arrived closely not noticing it. - All the police that came to secure the university aren't there in front of the front security area, but suddenly appeared near the room where Lucy and the professors were talking.I can't yet give vote to this movie. perhaps I should watch it over and really pay attention to the movie.This is just my personal opinion.

A lot of people have stated this film is a ""smart"" film and that regular summer audiences didn't like it because they didn't understand it. Just because a film deals with science doesn't automatically make it a ""smart"" film. To make a movie a ""smart"" film it actually has to have some intelligence put into it. The title character never seemed to evolve. Sure in the beginning she was a party girl and she progressed into the unstoppable machine but ultimately we only see two sides of Lucy the party girl and the ass kicking girl. There is never a happy medium. That leads to another point. As the film progresses Lucy begins to get stronger and stronger ultimately to the point where she's unstoppable and that's where the movie begins to get boring. Sure there are car chase scenes and shoot outs but if the main character isn't in danger then what's the point? Sure you have supporting characters but we never see them get fleshed out so we are left with no one to really care about. Th film also doesn't benefit from a 90 minute running time. I honestly think the film could have been slightly better with about 20 or so minutes added on of character development. The most redeeming quality of this film though is Scarlett Johansson. Mrs Johansson has a very bright future ahead to become a huge female action hero and a very great actress in general. From the very beginning you believed this was Lucy never for a minute did you feel it was Scarlett Johansson playing Lucy. She turned from normal party girl to badass in a snap of the fingers with the utmost poise. ""Lucy"" failed at being a smart, thought provoking film that would change the way we look at not ourselves but at our brains but did make Scarlett Johansson into an actress I can not wait to see more of.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Even if a movie is ""science fiction"", it needs to have some rules, otherwise the writers can just have anything happen at any time - so there are no stakes, and it feels cheap and uninteresting.That's how I'd define this movie as it progresses - it gets cheap and uninteresting. It sucks saying that because it starts so strong and has some great potential. Great actors involved. Cool cinematography...Worth watching, but a waste. The writing felt clever sometimes and extremely lazy at other times. By the end it's a mess.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

It involves a woman with extraordinary abilities overcoming adversaries (often armed men) in extraordinary circumstances. This has been his favorite plot device in ""The Fifth Element"", ""Nikita"" & ""Point of No Return"", ""Anna"", ""Valerian"", etc. Switch genders in ""The Transporter"" franchise and you have the same basic movie.Not sure if this is due to some deep-seated fascination that Besson has with his female characters, but the formula wears thin very quickly. It also becomes predictable and somewhat boring - not things you want in an action movie. Would love to see Besson permanently abandon this fascination and become a more well-rounded film-maker.So ""Lucy"" gets 5 out of 10 for being derivative and repetitive.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It may have been suitable for a TV show or a short film, but the whole movie feels like it's just stretching one concept out over the course of 90 minutes, but at no stage really developing.I'm no means a scientist and yet even I know how flawed some of the stats and figures are that are quoted in the movie and subsequently, the logical side of me couldn't enjoy this wild, sci-fi fantasy. It needed more science to support their fiction rather than this horrible concoction, that the whole time gave me the feeling like this was written by a child who read one neurology article and then let their imagination run wild.The acting wasn't exceptional either, but it wasn't written in such a way that really allowed any actors to really shine anyway. This is unlike Morgan Freeman, who for a while was a strong indicator of a solid movie, to me. Sadly though, this is the second movie in as many years that I feel has fallen short of the reputation he had begun to build for himself.As a whole, this movie annoyed me a lot more than it entertained me. The concept is undeniably quite cool, and some of the things the main character were able to do were also quite entertaining, but brief flashes didn't make up for a lacking storyline, and flaws in the scientific theory.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Along for the ride is Scarlett Johansson, who has spent the last few years honing her action chops at Marvel Studios and the prolific Morgan Freeman.The story revolves around Lucy(Johansson), no last name given, who is duped by a shady boyfriend to deliver a briefcase to a Taiwanese gangster named Mr. Jang(Min-Sik Choi). The contents of said case holds a new designer drug that Mr. Jang wishes to distribute throughout Europe using ""volunteers"", Lucy being one of them, as mules by surgically implanting bags of the stuff in their intestines. Lucy's bag ruptures inside her and the drug circulates through her body with unexpected results; she has the ability to access more of her brain than any human has ever before.What follows is a high octane pursuit of the remaining bags of drugs. Lucy wants them for herself, Mr. Jang would, of course, like his merchandise back. As her brain power increases, we are updated periodically with screen shots informing us of the current percentage of her brain being used. Unfortunately this is where the movie loses it's focus. It becomes a mix of questionable science and gunfights with an ending that is ""The Lawnmower Man"" meets ""Transcendence"".You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned Mr. Freeman yet. His talents, I'm afraid, are wasted here. As Professor Norman, he serves only to inform the audience of the ""science"" involved. In the end, I feel this would have been a better movie if they stuck to Lucy simply enacting some revenge on the drug lord who enslaved her. Using, of course, her ever increasing intelligence and a Glock 42. Johansson proves she can handle the action scenes and carry a big budget film. I am already looking forward to her own Black Widow movie.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

First Scarlet Johansson  is fantastic, she always was in every film I watched, I remember her  role in a girl with a pearl earring, and other films, she was so  outstanding. Here she shines two.   Acting a doctor fits so well Morgan Freeman, in those roles he is Mr.  Number One. I guess he will be remembered for these types of roles in  the history of film making.  Plot is very interesting and general audience have to use 1 per cent of  their brain capacity (usually they do not use any) to understand what  is going on.   All in all a very entertaining and enjoyable film. I recommend it!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story is different, it is not like something you will watch everyday, and you can't even predict what will happen next like most of the movies these days.

Morgan Freeman's part is perfect with the new twist I have not seen where the story moves back and forth from his Academic Speech on the Human Brain's usage based on those of other living things to Start. I can believe that this movie was given a 6+ rating, as the ""Dumbing Down"" of American Society is at it's peak and Movies like this are just not comprehensible to most, as the Star Trek original TV series wasn't to the Audience back when it aired on TV, with many of it's futuristic idea's (thought as completely far-fetched) are in use today. If we do do not shift from our paradigm of thought, we will stop moving forward as a Society. Right up there with the movie ""Interstellar"" in my opinion & could watch over & over, which I cannot do with very many film's. Enjoy this movie, then watch it again to understand what you missed, as it moves very quickly along. Congrats to the Writer, Producer,Director and the Actors!

Luc Besson is a master of this, and you'll find yourself thinking ""oh man, this is so cool"".You might have heard already that the science behind the story (10% of the brain thing) is flimsy to say the least, plot holes are abundant but that is not a problem - this is a action sci-fi film and there are many good films with a far more ridiculous premise.The real problem of this film is that it spends very little time focusing on the main character and her (very interesting!) storyline and keeps insisting we sit through the completely generic car chases, gun fights and arrests. As you could see in the trailer Lucy gets superpowers but instead of featuring her abilities to the fullest, half of the finale is spent on showing us five minor characters shooting it out in a library lobby.As with almost all films dealing with the topic of human potential and transcendence there is a lot of pseudo philosophical drivel about how ""humans are sheep, we need to wake up"" etc. It's quite cringe worthy, and without enough of expected eye candy you will find yourself embarrassed on the films behalf in every other dialogue.All in all, this is a couple of cool scenes with a lot of generic action film stuff and penny-philosophy stuck in between. Skip it, you won't miss anything.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not from director Luc Besson, you would not expect a film that just touches the surface of the power of the human mind. Instead we are treated to standard cheap action sequences that make Scarlett reprise her tough girl image from the avenger movies and soon the movie drops to the level of the weekly mall movie tripe.

Our brain is a powerful instrument and it would be enough to speculate about its potential without all the psychic phenomenas the protagonist manages to perform while gaining access to her brains capacities.

Now, that's not to say there is nothing to be enjoyed or there is no fun to be had with Lucy, in fact far from it.Stop me when you've heard this one before; an average nobody takes an experimental drug which lets them unlock all of their brain capacity, because of this new power foreign gangsters chase after them. The ironic thing about Lucy is that the film is at it's best when it's most parallels Limitless, because that is when the entire affair is most lucid, once Besson is allowed to indulge himself things become overly complicated and bizarre.The pinnacle of Lucy's madness (Without giving away the ending) is that there is a sequence in a plane where Lucy quite literally disintegrates, we are never shown the end of that scene or how she is transported to an airport hospital. It is one of the most obvious gaping holes in a movie I have ever personally seen, and it feels careless, as if Besson doesn't care about the script or story as long as he can have the sequences he wants in his movie.It's true, Lucy filming has this surreal kind of schizophrenia to it, there are points in the movie that are spliced together with stock footage of human society and how we have evolved or an animal being hunted down and attacked, just randomly placed in the middle of a sequence as if Besson is having trouble concentrating on his own movie and needs to liven up the joint.I can't express how odd the ending of Lucy is and how much it degenerates into just a pleasure factory for Luc Besson's visual joys but by the end of the film we were all left scratching out heads in wonder of what the hell it was really all about.Lucy is portrayed by Scarlett Johansson who is trying her very best to make the role into something of merit, but she rapidly fails, the rest of the cast fit the weird tone of the film, with Morgan Freeman, Min-sik Choi and Julian Rhind-Tutt all putting in an appearance.Lucy honestly feels like an art house movie without the art. There are moments of pure beauty and brilliance but seconds do not make a movie, minuets do and no matter how hard it tries Lucy always feels like it's a couple of seconds out of time with perfection.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In his best films, the focus is often on a young woman who is aided by an older man, and he is true to his methods in this film, although he adds a significant layer of philosophy and epistemology. Some may find this distracting, and for some it may be above their comprehension, but for me it was marvelous, to the point where I actually could have used fewer car chases and a little less violence.Here is an intelligent script with wonderful photography and music, and a sly use of canned footage that will amuse you. Morgan Freeman is his usual awesome self, and Min-sik Choi (""Old Boy"") is appropriately menacing.Go see this film, but don't expect the normal Besson film. That's good.

I mean, she can manipulate matter, intercept radiowaves, see in x-ray vision, but she still needs to fly by plane, to drive cars, she needs the help of other people to make her a drip only to have at least 2-3 characters in the film.
She says she feels everything and remembers everything, yet she calls her mom to tell her that she loves her, even though she acts completely emotionless all the time. She says she doesn't feel fear and a couple of scenes later she seems frightened when she starts to disintegrate like in The Avengers on the plane. Inconsistencies like these just show how unaccustomed the writers were with the genre.The film also has a drug lord villain who is so unnecessary and incredibly not threatening to her it just makes no sense (also, great job on wasting Min-sik Choi in this). They make parallels to wild nature indicating that she was prey for a predator and then she sort of becomes the predator, but not really and they never come back to this...whatever.I'm not even going to start on the brain capacity usage, ok, a theory is a theory, whatever, but you've got to have rules in your sci-fi story or it will completely derail into absurdity.P.S.

One that is incredibly ambitious but so poorly executed that you can't help but feel sorry for the overall product. It pains me to type this, when a project has such great potential starts to stumble and ends up tripping its own feet over.Luc Besson the director and writer of 'Lucy' knows what he is doing behind the camera. Throughout it he creates undeniably beautiful images on screen. If only the rest of the film was on par with the camera work then I would be jumping for joy. I might have actually had more fun with Lucy if I wasn't treated like a dumb audience member from the get-go. Obvious imagery of a cheetah hunting its prey intercut with a scene of Lucy being surrounded by gang members – isn't what you want to show your audience especially if they have an IQ higher than a 10 year old.'Lucy' stars Scarlett Johansson in the title role; she is given a drug (against her own free will) that will increase her brain power from 10% to 100%. I can admire Johansson for trying to inject human emotion – for the first 15 minutes, then her character becomes devoid of any, which left me emotionally disconnected with her character; that and her blatant disregard for human life. After she has the drug in her bloodstream we get to see what she can do with her power. This ranges from being able to read people's minds to virtual omnipotence. Sound familiar? If it does then it should be no surprise that Lucy is what I would term a superhero. Yet the film lacks what makes them interesting – a strong villain and suspense.Min-sik Choi who plays the villain (Mr Jang) is given so little to do that he might as well be called obligatory henchman for unnecessary conflict. It is a shame when the lead actor of Oldboy (2003) is in a film far below him. His character is no match for Lucy; as with a flick of her wrist she can magically use the force and send her enemies flying against the wall. He can do nothing to stop her – see where I'm getting at with the obligatory villain concept? Lucy can do anything and her enemies virtually nothing, so we don't even need a villain present at all. No one can challenge her effectively, thus stopping any tension within the film. I'm really trying hard to find something positive apart from the visuals. Morgan Freeman is great – but when wasn't he? Unfortunately although he gives his all, he cannot stop the film from venturing on the wrong side of camp. Again I come to another element of the film which Besson can't seem to decide upon. The tone of the film; it never knows when to be serious or silly – in the end when he mixes scenes of seriousness and one-liners they end up just cancelling themselves out. Leaving me very confused as to what the director was aiming for.An intriguing premise but weak story stops 'Lucy' from being 'The Matrix' game changer it should have been. The biggest compliment I can give the film is that it isn't painful to watch; just irritating that a film maker with talent fails to make 'Lucy' suspenseful, or for that matter interesting.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The bad guy, in this case, is Mr. Jang. He is vicious, mean, a thug, and rotten to the core, but compared to his adversary there is really no contest. His adversary, a young lady named Lucy, is someone whose brain is operating at full-throttle, and that is gist of the story - everyone else's brain are operating at only a small fraction of its total potential, hence Lucy is literally operating in another dimension. Under these conditions, Mr. Jang cannot win. The premise of the story, that humans use only a small fraction of their mental capacity, is pure science fantasy and completely unsupported by fact, but for the purpose of this movie, it's as good as any other myth. In her normal state Lucy is harmless, but as her brain power keeps increasing so does her powers which enable her to perform acts that defy the laws of physics. And that too is explained by the movie. But to learn that explanation the movie should be watched. Why spoil an interesting story?","6 out of 23 found this helpful.

It's a film that from beginning to end bombards the audience with ""science"", when in reality it avoids all attempts at logic or even making sense. It appears to take itself seriously at the same time it comes off as Crank 2 meets the Tree of Life.That may be where it's charm lies though, it's a stupid movie. As you watch you realize it just doesn't care about making sense, it cares about being very entertaining... which it actually manages to do. The plot, the messages and the characters go from almost believable to ridiculous bit by bit and as all sense of reality falls off the ride gets more and more fun.So in the end if you're looking for stupid fun, this is probably worth a shot. If you're looking to take the film at face value, take it's ""science"" seriously or even it's message seriously, you'll probably feel insulted something like this exists.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's largely a study in theoretical nonsense which has a better place in a NatGeo ""documentary"" than on the big screen. Thematically, the movie has almost no weight and what it does have feels entirely forced.

Yes, amid all the mayhem, the shoot 'em ups, the science impossible there is something very redeeming about this and it has to do with what it means to be alive and to be human.What Lucy is able to do cannot possibly come about from taking substances into her system as in the movie. However the incredible power, knowledge and freedom she achieves is something that may be possible for humans some distant day--or rather possible for our intelligently designed descendants who will be cyborgs or something beyond that.The story itself and the way French born director Luc Besson (""Léon: The Professional,"" ""La Femme Nikita,"" etc.) moves the plot along with action that keeps us enthralled amounts to a first rate sci fi thriller. Johansson who plays Lucy and whose countenance dominates the film is wonderful. And I don't mean merely from the fact that her face is mesmerizing but also because she does such a great acting job in a demanding role.I am giving this film only 9 stars because of the rather lame idea that we use only ten percent of our brains. That idea was disposed of decades ago. Of course as a metaphor it works okay. However it could be better said that we are currently achieving only ten percent of what we could achieve.I also don't think Besson, who also wrote the script for the film, has the right notion about time. He has Lucy say, ""Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist."" However, time like other units of measure really just compares two or more things, in this case events. Many scientists believe that time per se does not exist and is an abstraction, or as I see it time is a mathematical point.But much of the philosophy and/or psychology in the film is if nothing else interesting and worth thinking about. For example Lucy says, ""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale."" This is true in a practical sense but I believe it is also true in a philosophical and a spiritual sense.I will be seeing this film again.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""The World Is Not as We Think It Is""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I don't really care about the current fashion for checking with Albert Einstein or Charles Darwin to ascertain if far-fetched SF stories are actually plausible (witness film critics currently checking their cosmological constants in order to test if Interstellar is actually scientifically feasible), but I do care that the stories themselves have something worth watching. From the beginning I felt Lucy was a messy, poorly paced, and (sorry Scarlett) poorly acted melange of confusing visuals, half-baked plot lines and unnecessarily unpleasant characters, particularly, and especially, Lucy herself.

I suspect the writer/director used less of their brain than the average person uses when the ending of the movie was decided upon.

The premise is interesting - it definitely extends beyond the realm of transhumanism into territory usually the preserve of spirituality and religion, most explicitly in the scene where Lucy and the first humanoid 'Lucy' touch fingers in an allegory to the Micheangelo fresco. It was all too easy to think of Lucy attaining god-like status, as she progresses to fully using her brain and cerebral capacities. How that works is never quite explained. Although there is a theory I came up with that brains are sort of 'receivers' of universal consciousness that ties in well with this, but in reality, I don't think using '100% of your brain' will really give you all these superhuman or superhero powers. The plot was probably the most disappointing part of the film. Beginning in Taipei, Lucy's boyfriend sets her up (presumably) with a Korean drug ring that is using people as mules smuggle in a drug (although whether they know the full capabilities of the drug is seemingly unclear) that is synethesised 'CPH4' a chemical that mother's release that stimulates bone growth in fetuses. Their goal here is not that clear. Basically another 'catch the bad guy' plot, intertwined with Lucy's (Scarlett Johansen's) evolution into some kind of superhuman and beyond. A lot of the action scenes and pseudo-science (which in itself is not a sin if properly worked out in the alternative logic of the universe) have been seen before. I'll give it 5.5/10.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

When she is taken hostage by Rio and his goons, they inject her with the mysterious drug that gives her mind-blowing psychological abilities that allow to use her full brain capacity. This, she is able to perform these incredible human abilities such as mentally time travel and not feeling pain or discomfort. Morgan Freeman plays Professor Norman, a college psychology teacher who assists Lucy on her escape from Rio and his evil gang.The movie boasts a pretty interesting premise, but its sadly executed with an incoherent plot and a storyline that, before too long, makes a less and less sense as it progresses. This movie tries to impress us with its flashy visual effects. The visual effects are quite intriguing, and sadly that is the only eye-candy you get. Scarlett Johanson shows off a decent performance as the main heroine, but it is not enough to save this movie. The concept of how the main character gains these mental abilities is interesting. The problem is the movie doesn't do anything exciting with it. Worse, it veers into the territory of predictable. Each scene featuring the titular character facing off against enemies, she's empowered with psychic abilities that render her unstoppable, and therefore results in action scenes that are tension less and fall short of depth. There is very little excitement and barely any thrills that by the end, it just stops becoming interesting. I have to say I was pretty let down by this movie. Lucy is a film that had so much going for it but was left watered down by botched execution. Unless you a die-hard Scarlett Johanson fan, it is worth looking elsewhere because you are not likely to awarded with the same charisma she has established in her previous roles.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Lucy is a female take of the Matrix that only goes so far with ideas, plot threads, and a grand cast to try and sadly not pull it through.Everyone does their best in this film, you can see that. But it's a story that just can't be saved. Even more so with the main lead, no one can relate too, just as Neo from the Matrix, becoming a superhero but not really as this gift was given, using it wise or not, falls through.Lucy is what it comes off as, with just a simple name as it is, comes along with the play itself. Too simple, with fruitful uncountable ideas that are just not going anywhere through the film and come off as just stages (As the trailers pointed out) of what could be fictional guesses if one had this power.In short, Lucy = The Matrix. If one does go see it, hold the bar low for it, and enjoy with a mindless judgment. As this movie could be a hit or miss to some, it just didn't work for me.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

The drug starts increasing her brain power in an unusual manner and she soon explores some exceptional super-powers much beyond the known capabilities of a normal human being, which in turn help her to break through the mysterious nexus of underworld, drug mafia, police and more. Her brain usage keeps on increasing as the film progresses further and it all ends when she eventually reaches to the maximum level of 100%.Now the short synopsis shared above sure sounds pretty interesting but I wish the film was equally engaging too justifying its novel concept. It has a promising start featuring a betraying friend and the Chinese don but soon starts giving away due to a weak script and too much focus kept on its style and presentation. The film actually doesn't work because of its thin storyline stretched for long and an unconvincing narration, despite having some excellent production values and superb graphics.With an otherwise fine performance by Scarlett Johansson, who later fails to leave an impact due to the ineffective culmination of a great plot, LUCY also wastes Morgan Freeman as the professor/researcher working on the brain concept. The film doesn't explode later as per the expectations raised in the first ten minutes and hence can easily be rated as a flat science fiction which keeps on giving some forced philosophical lessons at regular intervals in vain. In fact LIMITLESS (2011) made on a similar concept was a far better entertainer comparatively.In short, LUCY's brain might have reached its 100% in the script, but the film couldn't even reach 50% in terms of satisfaction offered, honestly. So you can opt for it only in case you don't mind watching Scarlett alone for those 90 minutes.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Interesting story supported by great images made this one work brilliantly. Don't see many movies as good as this these days. Luc Besson did a bang up job directing it on a par with the best films out there from any time period. Three cheers for this one. I liked the way it was maybe a homage of sorts to A Space Odyssey in terms of some of the images-anyone familiar with that film will understand the reference. Liked the way it cross cut images that were part rock video and part documentary in keeping with the eclectic nature of the times we live in. With one foot in the world of trendy and one foot in the world of science it kept viewers interested in what would happen next. Nice build up to the big finish-best seen on a big screen if possible.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The movie is perfect blend of Science fiction and philosophy. It touches on various topics like the meaning of life, Existence of God, Potential of Human mind, Origin of the universe, The nature of man and his role in the universe, overcoming the limitations and hurdles in life.It kind of draws a parallel with the film ""limitless"" in a way. But there is a difference in the message that both films give. In lucy, the main character dwells on the question of purpose of life and tries to think objectively and not subjectively. The science fiction stuff might have been a little overboard but its a science fiction in the end and has every right to venture in the unknown in order to have us flabbergasted. In my opinion it was not too eccentric. I liked the way the character of Scarlett evolves over time and is able to unlock the full potential of the human mind. I am unable to understand why this movie has been rated in the 6s. I think it deserves more than that.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Many of us have laid back on the grass, stared at the billions of stars, and been blown away by the size of everything, and the insignificance of mankind. By the end of this film I got a somewhat similar kind of feeling. There are a lot of graphics at the end and at least some seem to hint at current theories about the multi-verse and quantum theory.

This is what happens to Lucy after she accidentally absorbs a large quantity of a new drug she was supposed to deliver. As her brain gets more and more empowered, the story evolves with lots of action, one of the best car races ever seen on screen, a team of scientists dropping their yaws and Lucy setting everything straight and fighting the drug thugs.

The central premise revolves around Scarlett Johannson's put upon drug smuggler, who, after accidentally receiving a large dose of the product, has the ability to unlock parts of the brain previously untapped by humans. The dubious science behind the concept aside, the story progresses in a smart and intriguing manner (if not subtle in its underlying message) all the way to the ambitious denouement, which will have you either scoffing or, like me, completely enthralled. There are also a handful of exceptionally designed action sequences that keep the blood pumping; an early gun-tastic showdown in a hotel with a mirroring, gun-less confrontation in a hospital later on provide a couple of noteworthy examples. The so-hot-right-now ScarJo is fine in the lead role and Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman like nobody else (even when phoning it in), however it is the quietly impactful Min-sik Choi (Oldboy) who shines brightest as the drug kingpin looking for revenge. It has been a long time since the French director scored a hit (The Fifth Element back in 1997), but Lucy has everything necessary to snap that losing streak.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I didn't notice the clock during this movie until after the one-hour mark.Johansson is very good in this going from a regular person to a kind of robot to an all-powerful whatever-she-becomes.

I've just watched it on terrestrial TV, though, and I was sucked in by it after a few minutes.It starts off quite camp, but the ideas behind it I thought were more grown up, and they don't deserve the dissing that is meted out in reviews.Spoiler: | | | | \/ The idea that reality is very complex seems to be backed up by quantum entanglement experiments, dark energy conjectures, and variable speed of light hypothesis. We've even got to the point where physicists are claiming many universes might exist, continuously dividing, or that we are all living inside a computer simulation. The idea that the human brain is too primitive to process this complex reality also seems fair. The idea that the human brain constructs a simple model of the world in order to enable it to function in a complex universe therefore seems highly plausible. Some people have even gone as far as saying that time is an illusory construct to stop everything from happening at once. ISTR in the film, Lucy says that time is what gives legitimacy to matter. If a higher brained being did see things as they truly are, rather than in a mirror darkly, is it unreasonable to think that he might be able to smash the illusion, or to take control? I therefore don't think the antigravity, telekinesis, precognition etc is so silly.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When the bag of drugs known as CPH4 ruptures inside her intestines, the CPH4 triggers changes inside Lucy that allow her to access increasing percentages beyond the 10% humans use which leads her to teaming up with Parisian narcotics detective Pierrer Del Rio (Amr Waked) in tracking down the other mules so she can access the full 100% of her brain capacity.Lucy from Luc Besson was according to Luc Besson inspired by Besson's own Leon: The Professional, Inception, and 2001: A Space Oddysey. Released in 2014, Lucy became a massive financial success earning $460 million against its $40 million budget becoming Besson's biggest hit internationally. There's certainly some ridiculousness at play in Lucy (particularly the ""10% usage of the human brain"" myth), but Luc Besson's energy and drive anchored by strong performances makes Lucy an engaging ride.Scarlett Johansson is really good as Lucy and her transformation from ordinary person to superhuman to eventual omnipotence/omniscience is well done with Johansson's performance effectively committed to the outlandish premise with her character's evolution well-paced and believable. Amr Waked is a solid counterpoint as Pierre Del Rio to Johansson's Lucy and Waked's scenes where he reacts to Lucy's ever increasing powers are as entertaining as the elaborate effects and action sequences. The third act goes off the rails in the best possible way as it intercuts an elaborate gunfight with a mindbending sequence that evokes memories of Akira, Tree of Life, and 2001: A Space Odyssey in a visual feast.Lucy is a joyfully silly exercise in elaborately produced nonsense. Johansson makes a solid lead and Besson gives us some efficiently and effectively delivered action and spectacle with a visually arresting journey.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't really know, though I ""sensed"" what I was going to see, and I kind of expected the usual romp, like the professional or kiss of the dragon, but here the director went a step further, tackling with fundamental issues of human existence, and daresay existence in general. I don't want to give out any spoilers inadvertently, so I'll be very general. I honestly cannot understand all the people who saw ""logic"" problems with the plot. Or perhaps it is all down to the fact that everybody has their own way of processing things, despite what doctrinal science might say, science itself is a matter of consensus, everybody does really see things differently, and although many people reacted negatively, there was quite a reaction nonetheless, so Besson was successful in getting people to pay attention, which is already saying a lot. Personally, I found it enlightening.The ending is nothing new, saw the same thing when Dr Strange's the Ancient One died, oh, maybe forty years ago? But that's because there is nothing new other than people starting over and over again each new generation and having to realize the same old truths all over again, which is humanity's curse and bliss, for ignorance is bliss, but so is total understanding, it's the stuff in between, that which we call the human dimension, that struggles. Anyway, in a nutshell, this is what I got from the movie. I'll keep the ""deeper"" stuff for myself. On another note, Besson is the Tarantino of France, and came before him and is still here with his best movie yet. Might we expect the same of Quentin, or was Pulp Fiction really it? I'd like to see him give it another shot!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

All in all a very good film, if it isn't exactly a masterpiece.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Well, she is. She is one of those people one can't stop watching without knowing why. And then of course there is the talent, in which she appears to have been soaked like a herring in a brine barrel. Having taken a special drug, Johansson's character Lucy keeps getting her intelligence raised, as it keeps going up by 10% every so often (we are advised of this by a notice on screen) she becomes increasingly dangerous. You see, we mere mortals are said only to use a very small percentage (10%) of our brains. I would point out that the world is also full of people who use none at all, but then that is a sarcastic remark, and doubtless these days would be considered a 'hate crime', as it is no longer permissible to say anything critical of anyone, especially anything critical of brainless oafs such as many of the world's leading politicians. But Lucy is not interested in politics. She has become far too intelligent for that. The genius French director Luc Besson here has been given a whopper Hollywood budget to go over the top, and he does so in superb style. We have all known how original Besson is since his unusual film SUBWAY came out in 1985. ANGEL-A (2005) was one of his most impressive supernatural films. In this cinematic rampage of super-intelligence by the out of control Lucy, we see her taking vengeance on some vicious criminals. So we get the quota of violence which seems to be required to give bloodthirsty audiences their kicks. I wonder if some day someone will make a film about a super-intelligent person who does something constructive. Or would that be too boring for a jaded public of 2015? Would not the world be a bit less violent if films watched by the masses were a bit less violent? And do superheroes always have to show off their prowess primarily by how efficient they are at killing people? Also, is it possible to have a sci fi film made in America which does not contain guns and explosions? Is the subtext of American cinema always going to be one of violent conflict, and must all Hollywood film language be reduced ultimately to the phonemes and morphemes of machine gun bursts? In other words, is it possible for a Hollywood superhero to speak English today, or can he or she only communicate by spitting bullets?","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The characters don't act as ""heroes"", who do everything just the right way.No, this movie (and the characters in it) dares to go beyond the notion of good/bad, and beyond the notion of ""death is so sad"". This might put some people off, and I know it felt strange to me, but it's really refreshing actually.It's based on myths that have not been proved scientifically, but not really proved wrong, either (as other reviews say). Keep in mind that obviously all the parts of the brain are useful, But we have Conscious access to only a tiny percentage of it. Even non-magical exercises like simple meditation let you have conscious access to more brain functions (i.e. accelerating or decelerating your heart rate without moving).After having watched this movie, I got a nice feeling that life is simple and there's no need to create complicated problems where there are none.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

For this reason a complete film about philosophy would not attract large crowds in recent times. French director Luc Besson's latest film 'Lucy' has emerged as a different film as it mixes philosophy especially philosophy of mind with eclectic elements of a fast paced thriller. His film tackles the essential question of human brain especially its optimum usage. One learns many new pieces of valuable information about the brain. For example-dolphins are the only animals who use their brain more than human beings. This film pays equal attention to philosophy and actions scenes that no group of viewers feels the need to ignore any other element. 'Lucy' wastes no time to describe how criminal minds would go to any extent in order to achieve their aims. The highlight of this film is the phenomenal transformation of an ordinary girl into a colossal, brainy intellectual giant who uses her brain to the highest attainable level of 100%. Lastly nobody has to be a double of VS Ramachandran to appreciate this film but a lot of questions related to the human brain especially the manner in which it is used have not been answered. This might be the main defect an astute viewer can find with this film.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

If you do believe in God you'll still love this movie, because it will strengthen your faith in being created, rather then Besson's feeble, yet creative attempt explaining his beliefs. This film reminds me of a script I once read while I was working at Universal Pictures in the 90's called 'Mastermind'. The protagonist was able to utilize 100% of his brain. There were a lot of similar types of subplots as well, but this movie went one step further and tried to sell the scientific aspect of the theory, which is where it became a tad slow. Obviously a drug alone, cannot and will-not ever help us to reach those cranial heights of power, however the imagery was still unique and creative. It was very much like a great trip on Ecstacy, or magic mushrooms, or acid. All in all, we still really enjoyed the journey through time and the explanation of it all by the great Morgan Freeman.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Modern research tells us that we really use every part of our brain in subtle ways. And yet, isn't it remarkable to consider the possibility that there is room for human consciousness to become something greater than it already is? In this film, Lucy is an average person who unwittingly becomes the next step in human evolution, who uses more and more of her brain capacity in a struggle to survive and evolve. As she exponentially grows in power, she becomes able to control her mind, her body, other matter, energy, space, and ultimately time. Which, of course, is completely ridiculous and unbelievable, no matter how many neurons Lucy fires off. But it does make for a whimsical ""what if"" scenario, doesn't it? The movie's biggest selling point will be in watching Scarlett Johansson kicking a lot of butt with wild superpowers! And there is plenty of action scattered all about: the movie is pretty evenly-littered with big-scale shoot-outs, car chases, and off-the-wall mental powers. However, butt-kicking is not really the movie's primary focus; it's more about chronicling Lucy's journey. Moments in between the action slow down a lot, but it's rarely dull; the film dishes out a plethora of intriguing situations and implications. In doing so, the film will lay out a ton of exposition, which may bore the most critical of viewers, but engage those with a more open mind. Regardless, I found the picture to be trim, to-the-point, and it has just enough momentum to keep it rolling smoothly. I felt it struck the perfect balance in terms of pacing and structure.Ultimately, the story is an interesting affair, but falls short in numerous ways. The science behind the film's premise is totally unfounded. Other observations are interesting on the surface, but they amount to a few simple messages that audiences may or may not care for. Personally, I was intrigued by the way the film juxtaposed scientific lecture and imagery next to the events. As far as the plot goes, it's a short and simple affair, but with plot holes to be found. The film jumps right into the events without much background to the characters or events (seriously, who manufactured CPH4 to begin with? Who is Lucy and why is she in Taipei to begin with?). A few good scenes keep the characters from becoming total cardboard cutouts, but the film becomes increasingly whack as it goes along, until it reaches a really absurd ending. It leaves off with a rather blunt and empty message.On the plus side, the film is as slick as they come, with superb photography and editing. Acting is swell: I loved watching Scarlett Johansson, even when she does become monotonous. Morgan Freeman pretty much phones it in, serving the same role as he did narrating Through the Wormhole. The various cops and gangsters are decent. Writing is rather unrefined and blunt, but it gets the job done. This production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Special effects look good in some scenes and bad in others. Music is pretty cool.Lucy is a pretty neat ""what if"" scenario. It's not quite as big of a rip-roaring actioner as you might expect, but it's also not nearly as intellectually challenging as top-tier sci-fi pictures. However, as a crime thriller with a scientific commentary, I believe it's a blast.4/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Marginal | Film: Very Good)","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The film does avoid moral problems.However, the film does explore the human mind and the intersection between Morgan Freeman making a speech and the action taking Place is much in the same way as Henri Laborit making his speech in ""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"", the film by Alain Resnai. It does not disturb me at all - on the contrary! The question of what happens if humans would access more of their brain capacity does resemble a parable of what happens if humans became God. This might have been unintended by the makers of this Movie but it is nevertheless a fair comparison that can be made.The action scenes with all the killings and whatnot are for pure Entertainment, of course, and brings a relaxation from the very Heavy topic here concerned.Therefore, it would be unfair to dismiss this Movie as bad. How many Movies today pose philosophical questions. Matrix did for sure but how many more? A similar Movie with morals being the central issue would, of course, be most commendable but could such a Movie be made and would it be financed. Probably not, since it would rip our capitalistic World into shreds and leave nothing of it to be salvaged and who would finance something like that? So far, we will have to be content with that there are films being made that stimulate our thinking and hope that this take us to the journey towards absolute material equality, the very basic of all morals as far as we now can detect.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I suspect that Evan Rachel Wood's Dolores Abernathy character in ""Westword"" was influenced by Johansson's take on her title character. Both characters drift seamlessly in and out of a distanced robotic mindset. Especially remarkable is Lucy's overseas phone call to her mother.""Lucy"" is a philosophical film being marketed as science fiction - action adventure. Since it worked for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" back in 1968 I guess they thought it would work here. But the mismatch has caused ""Lucy"" to miss much of Luc Besson's intended audience and to disappoint those looking for Scarlett doing a ""Leon"" inspired ""Kick-Ass"" number in tight shiny ""Black Widow"" latex.The mismatch between the film and its promotional campaign is my only major criticism. A minor criticism is the poor quality of the digital effects (the car chase doesn't hold a candle to the old fashion way, insert 1998's ""Ronin"" here). Given the budget limitations, the POV, and the transforming mental condition of the title character; the film would have been far better served had Beeson substituted expressionism for realism. Cinema greatness was there for the taking.As in ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" the existential theme is not anti-God (or even pro Übermensch), but anti-ego. With a character slowly losing their connection with humanity, finally connecting with the infinite at the moment they become infinitesimal.""Man's task in life is the paradoxical one of realizing his individuality and at the same time transcending it to arrive at the experience of universality. Only the fully developed self can drop the ego.""

Either that, or it's seriously underrated. This film works on multiple levels, due to the science fiction side of the story. Your interpretation will swing one way, or the other on what the script-writers deliver to the storyline. There really is no need to develop many of the characters for something like this. You can, but that will either draw out the storyline too much, or enhance the tone of the film depending on the viewer. No, a standard 90 film length is perfectly fine for this plot. Why is it that we only use about 10% of our brain?? The real answer is simple and hard to understand, depending how you process it. The funny thing is,....the plot decides to leave God out of the equation, therefore, you're going to fall back on a more humanistic approach. This film is man's attempt to find the answers,.....but isn't that the REAL definition of 'religion'?? If you go back to what Lucy says about time and space, she specifically said that we are all subjected to time, the day were born to the day we die. We can't change that, therefore, we can't look at our lives in the viewpoint of a 'timeline', so to speak. In this sense, Lucy becomes like God. Does this mean we're destined to be gods?? The Mormons seem to think so, but that would mean we would create our own worlds, so to speak, and they wouldn't be as inclined to overlap to create the 'environment' we live in. The real reason why we don't use more the 10% is because knowledge gives power to do things. In a perfect world, no one would want to 'test the limits', or have the desire to 'sin'. It's temptation being removed from the equation, but in the 'world' we live in, the sin and temptation do exist. Where's the balance?? Wouldn't it then make sense to answer to the deity than ignore it?? Again, I go back to the idea that this story is about a world 'without' God in the equation. It's fine on its own, but to say that the material presented in this movie is real, would go back to the 'evolution' idea. Of course, what you see on the film isn't real. Everything that is linked together is purely fiction.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If I read them before watching, they would have succeeded in depriving me of an awesome experience — which is why I usually come to IMDb AFTER watching anything.In any case, this movie delivered exactly what it promised: a dose of science-fiction, a dose of fast-paced action, a great female lead, and an equally great plot. Since I'm no professional critic, I can only say the overall acting, directing, cinematography and incorporation of CGI were fantastic as well.But above everything, Lucy is interesting. It doesn't MATTER whether the science is correct or not. Besson himself stated that he knew the facts were wrong. But it doesn't make a difference — in the world the movie has created, everything is perfectly logical. It's a MOVIE. Entertainment. Not a documentary, as some people seem to expect. You don't take the concepts from Star Trek and apply them to real life, do you? Anyway, if you're a fan of Besson's Fifth Element, you will probably like this as well.

So for the people who are still on the fence, wondering, ""Is this film is worth watching?"" Just take a few minutes to read this review and your questions will be answered.Okay, let me inform you I am not a Sci-Fi fanatic but since everyone was raving about this movie I decided to give it a shot. OK now to the movie, the picture quality, one word Awesome! Great graphics and visual effects throughout the whole movie. It makes you feel like you're actually in the movie, like your looking through the eyes of Lucy herself. Which was one of the stronger points of the movie. I'm going to be completely honest in this review this movie had its good points and it had bad points but I definitely think the good out weigh the bad by far. Let's be honest have we ever watched a ""perfect movie"" a movie that you wouldn't change a thing about it? Not one thing......... doubt it. Lucy played by Scarlett Johansson is tricked into a awful deal where she is giving a mysteries briefcase and asked to deliver it by her new boyfriend. Lucy then find herself in a very bad situation not knowing the briefcase was filled with a rare synthetic drug , she's captured by a mafia kingpin and used as a drug mule, but when a bag of the synthetic drug erupts in her stomach she then experience unimaginable changes within herself. With the drug in her system it gave her great powers and abilities (physically and mentally) she goes from using 10% of her brain to using 100% of her brain. She then becomes unstoppable. She's on a mission and will stop anyone that jumps in her path, but will the drug who created her also be the same drug to destroy her? The first few minutes of the film will have you sucked in, anxious to know Whats going on? and whats going to happen next? . As soon as the movie starts I guarantee you will be intrigued. I personally like movies that makes me think and this movie does just that. Although this movie is fiction it really does have positive messages within the storyline that most people didn't even catch onto. Sometimes in movies we are so into the action and suspense that we tend to miss a very important message for instance a quote from the movie: for example ""Time is the only true unit of measure, it gives proof to the existence of matter, without time we don't exist."" another: ""Its funny, I use to be concerned with who I was and what I wanted to be and now that I have access to the furthers reaches of my brain, I see things clearly and realize what make us ""us"" "" Even though the film is not factual it does make you realize how interesting the human brain truly is. The thought of allowing your brain to sail into another world, another way of thinking,another way of life that's not our own. Its quite fascinating. Some parts of the movie are so far fetch that it becomes comical. The false scientific and philosophical information stated all through the movie is a little ridiculous, but keep in mind it is a fictional movie it never claims to be anything other than that. So in conclusion, I do believe Lucy is a good movie and I do recommend it. Just remember it is not a documentary. So yes this movie is filled with false information however don't let that be your focus point throughout the movie sometimes the best movies are the ones that take us away from the factual and drifts us into a fantasy.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Much easier to say her mental ability has gone from 10 to 20 per cent of full potential than her IQ has gone to 10000 or so. Suffice it to say that I know high IQ people who didn't make much of their life anyway. There was one goof that the goof checkers seem to have missed. In the movie, the original Lucy is as tall as Scarlett Johansson. In reality, she would have been around a meter tall or about three feet. Story well done otherwise and entertaining. The bad guys are really bad and much deserved to get mowed down. Scarlett is impressive and fun to watch as she changes from an ordinary young woman to a tough no nonsense avenger. I liked the bullet in her shoulder idea. I wonder who got the idea of a bullet hitting her after ricocheting off a wall. Good thinking!

In Besson's new film, a woman is again the main character. Scarlett Johanssen plays Lucy, a young woman who is contaminated with a new drug that allows her to use up to 100% of her brain's capacity. The movie posits that most of us only use 10 to 15% of our brain's abilities. As the movie progresses so do Lucy's capabilities: she starts to control matter and move things around with her brain. Morgan Freeman plays the friendly science professor-researcher who want to access Lucy's new acquired knowledge. If you want pure escapism for 90 minutes, this is your film. It's silly-serious fun. If you decide to accept the premise of the film, you will be entertained by the incredibly fast editing, beautiful earth and space images, and crazy metaphysical ending. I recommend this film for a Friday night after you've had a hard week at work. You will come out feeling refreshed by the possibilities this film explores. It's also funny and has some incredible action sequences in Paris and Taipei.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is exciting and thrilling with some fantastic visualization, and also refreshing to see Scarlett Johannson in this kind of character. Adding to that, it has a thought-provoking message about how it would be like if human can evolve so far as to use a 100% of our brain. It talks about how we would no longer see trivial things of life as a big deal, how we would use our psycho power so effectively, how we could remember far back into our birth moment, remember far back into the beginning of human evolution and understand the whole journey of humanity as a whole and then we no longer need to be in this world because in the end we will transcend it.Yes, I believe these are truthful and it's nice to have such food for thoughts, something reminding us that we don't have to forever be this way.However, I completely disagree with a few things that the film convey: - Once she is transformed to use more of her brain, Lucy was very cruel and merciless, she killed and killed. If we evolve higher and higher, I believer there is no way that we will be more violent toward each other! No way! We would have so much sensitivity and so much knowledge and wisdom to have deep awareness of how much life is precious and how much we all are connected to one another. It is bad to present Lucy in a form of heartless killer, although she only kills the bad guys.-I think in reality there is no medicine that could make this kind of evolution happen to us and we shouldn't try to produce anything like that. Meditation of the right kind can make some people use their will power and travel back and forth through time just as fine. It is a matter of mind, spirit and soul, not much of brain.But anyway, I'm glad they present something thoughtful and new in an entertaining way. At least it gets many people to think far beyond this body, far beyond our current level of existence.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then read on. Reading the internet comments, one comes across many pointless reviews and attacks about this film. (To name some) The USB drive, the 10% rule and the lack of science to support the ability for a magic blue pill that unlocks your brain's potential...To all those who fixate on this, I have only 2 simple rebuttals. Did you attack Star Wars for hyper-drive technology, what about Lord of the Rings for magic and elves? None of these exist in the world we know... You anger at this film is really your inability to understand its deeper message, so naturally you strike out. If you are an open, inquisitive mind, then I encourage you to watch this film and engage in the deep question, what is consciousness? The brain is simply a computer, one we barely understand. Imagine the potential of magnifying its power to connect to the universal consciousness in a far more profound way then you currently have. What would that be like? That is the question explored in this movie.Enjoy thinking brains, this movie is for you. For the rest of you, just because you cannot understand something doesn't mean it is not amazing.

The bag inside her breaks and the liquid causes her body to undergo changes that increases her mind's potential. She uses her new abilities to get back at the ones who caused all this, but later she discovers there is much more for Science to know and she needs to confer with top scientists. She is helped minimally by Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman).Science tells us that we use only 10% of our brain. But what would happen if we used 20, 30, 40,up to 100%? This story gives us some insight although it is stretched to extremes. Hey, that's okay because this is pure entertainment. Whether true or not, we don't care. We enjoy the possibilities and never want the movie to end (you just like watching Scarlett, right?) and kind of wish all this could be true. But there is some science in here for us to contemplate. Lucy tells us that ""we really never die."" Good to know. Professor Morgan tells her what to do with her abilities: pass them on via reproduction. Lucy understands. This science fiction movie is only a first step so no conclusions are made. More to come? Hmmmm..We enjoy Lucy's abilities and we see CGI used a little differently. We just marvel at what she does and how she manipulates everything. It's like magic or more than magic if that is possible. Yes, we are amazed and cheering too.The whole production is fast paced centering on the possibilities of humans using more than 10% of our brains. Great job. Kudos. Scarlett Johansson as Lucy is a pure joy to watch as she doesn't go off the deep end and wants to do the right thing, and this is what saves her and the movie too. How good is that? A Lucy II? I'm game. (9/10)Violence: Yes Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

This is Comic-Book Level Stuff and Brilliantly Dumbs-Down a lot of Heavy, Heady Things for the Action Crowd.The Director Spices the Space/Time/Evolutional Things up, maybe a bit too Much, with Gangland Drug Stuff that Makes this a Hybrid that doesn't Blend all that well, but the Film is just so Enchanting and Enlightening (albeit in sophomoric terms), that the Viewer is Mesmerized from the Get-Go.Scarlett Johansson, Fresh from Her Super-Hero Stint in the Avengers (2012), is a Natural as the Unwitting Transitional Link between Man and ""Super""Man. This Extravagant Exercise in Pop Culture Excess is too Rich to be Discarded as just another Action, Summer Movie and is a Good Example how Things so Familiar can be Taken to a New Level.Sure to have Bible-Thumpers and Fundamentalist Types Screaming Blasphemy, it does have a Secular Slant and there is one Scene that is a Poke in the Eye and a Direct Reference to the ""Sistine Chapel"". But if taken as Fanciful Fiction, no one can Deny this Movie is Nothing if not a Different, Diverting, Display of Artistic Flourishes and a Fun Time to be had for those that are Not Highly Discriminating.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Lucy is science fiction based on the reflective speculation of what if a person could access 100% of their brain. Lucy refers to one of the earliest humanoids, who happened to be female, and also the name of the female star, played be Scarlett Johansson. She happens to befall a strange drug smuggling ring becoming the first person to begin to ""revolutionize,"" a term introduced by Morgan Freeman's character. In the process, Luc Besson has developed an sci-fi action thriller evolving mind, space, and time. The pacing is energized and the mental evolutionary conception of Besson is consistently brought to the screen. This is a rare movie in that upon repeated viewings, the power and consistent developing emotive and mental presentation brought to the screen by Besson and Scarlett is impressive.Thus action scenes sometimes become overly dramatic and fake looking, for the sample the car chase scene, even the initial transformation of Lucy is a bit over the top. Overall it seems that Besson;s attempt developing this progressively leaping mental concept that is satisfactorily captured on film. The Outer Limits' Five Fingers episode (1963) accomplished the same speculative venture in its television spot while Christopher Nolan accomplished a much more creative and meaningful spectacularly looking backdrop in his Interstellar (2014). Overall, Lucy is entertaining speculation that's fun to watch, with decent intensity and thrilling action that's worth to experience. Scarlett Johansson underplayed performance really stood out. Nicely done.Other classic movies that Lucy follows in the footsteps of Brain Storm (1983), Charly (1968), The Time Machine (1960), Time After Time (1979), and of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and its contemporary, The Machine (2013).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes, the story line is simple as delineated by the trailer but the complex logic is presented in an understandable way - ""time"" is the real unit. Without ""time"", we all are nothing.The characters played their role well especially Johnson and Freeman. Story at times gets slow as in where is the protagonist heading to? It would have been more disappointing if the character was to return to normal life after such an unexpected event.At the very end, it went above the head of what was happening. But, it was just a message ""pass it on"" Though the logic and sequence appear to be way beyond imagination, it is quiet convincing at the end - all the more realistic may be.To be short, worth watching and no drag !!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The ""science"" is only a plot device to create scenes in which to have fun! Imagine if we bring the same critical scientific criticism to classics like X-files, Travellers, or Fringe? Sure, in this movie, they took it *way* too seriously, but even over-the-topedness that can be considered entertainment. Anyway, setting the science critique aside, the drama was fun. Even the hokey way in which the story culminates is fun. You have to see it as tongue in cheek. It's only gob smackingly disappointing if you try to take it seriously.This applies even to the story line. After all, Lucy isn't faced with a whole lot of challenges that threaten her. Yeah, yeah, maybe time, but not even that, really, For her objective, there wasn't any need for her to find scientists. Maybe not from an internet cafe, but why not from the comfort of a more private household.....","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A superhero movie with two very popular actors, one of which already has experience in the field, a short length and a R rating. It cost approximately 40 million dollars to make, which sounds like a lot but honestly isn't. Comparatively ""The Avengers"" cost 220 million. When you put all these variables together you get a movie with relatively little consequence for the studio to fund and with high potential for major gains in the box office. Even with all these positives though there ironically still seems to be something missing from it. The acting is good for the most part, and the special effects are awesome. The idea is also rather fresh, so what's the problem? Unfortunately, like so many movies with good ideas before it, the script, while far from awful, lacks heart and individuality. Morgan Freeman is hardly in the movie, and Scarlett Johansson isn't all that interesting in this film until the last 20 minutes or so. For these reasons, this movie will likely be forgotten in 20 years time, which is a shame. Honestly I liked this movie, it's just missing some heart.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film was 9 years in the making, well it's a shame then it wasn't made quicker as I feel it has been pipped at the post. Nonetheless it seems well made so far and entertaining and I will enjoy this as long as I blank out the screaming in my head saying Limitless Remake..

We made this a prime-time movie night selection as soon as it was available for rental. It was somewhat entertaining, but ultimately disappointing. Our take is that the first half was fun and curiously ""realistic"" sci-fi. The concepts explained by Morgan Freeman were very crisp and enlightening (although a bit academic.) We were quite engrossed in both the academic and gangster story lines. About 2/3 of the way through, the film ""jumps the shark"" with some absurd sci-fi leaps. We would give the first half of the film a solid 8 and the second half of the film a 5. Average is a 6.5, so we'll round this up to a 7. This film had great potential to reveal some breakthrough new ideas, but it lost its way.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
