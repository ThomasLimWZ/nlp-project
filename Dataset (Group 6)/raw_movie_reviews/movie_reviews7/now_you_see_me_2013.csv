"6","/10","Turn your brain off and enjoy...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3023735/?ref_=tt_urv","planktonrules","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2467618/?ref_=tt_urv","27 May 2014","At this time, there are already 530 reviews for ""Now You See It"", so I'll try to be brief. The film is about a group of four magicians and mentalists who have been given a brilliant plan by an unseen genius. Again and again, the quartet perform seemingly impossible stunts and always seem many steps ahead of the police. And, in the process, they do HUGE magic tricks that are pretty much impossible. The presentation is VERY smooth and very slick and the overall production looks great. It has great music and effects. But, on the negative side none of this really makes a lot of sense and there is no way you can enjoy it if you think. This is especially true at the end (where there is a profession of love that comes from absolutely no where!!)--which is a gigantic cliché and made no sense whatsoever. The bottom line is that if you turn off you brain and enjoy it on a very superficial level, you'll enjoy it. If you try to make sense of it all, your head will explode. 'Nuff said.","77 out of 93 found this helpful.

The plot is convoluted as we don't know what the main characters are doing or why. In fact, everything we know about the 4 magicians is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie and after that there is ZERO character development! The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.Like a magic show without magic, you may find yourself somewhat entertained but inevitably wind up disappointed in the end because they left out the most important part of the show.","670 out of 1,014 found this helpful.

"6","/10","trying desperately hard to be more intelligent than it is","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2826520/?ref_=tt_urv","HelenMary","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2655139/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2013","Overall a showman of a film. Flashy, loud with bells and whistles and big personalities, an exciting premise... illusionists rob banks using (supposed) magic but the four horsemen are just puppets in a game, but the hype is more than the substance of the film itself.You'd expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas (Eisenberg) says, ""Always be the most intelligent person in the room"" or something similar, this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away, isn't as unpredictable as it should be (really, you couldn't see that ending coming?) and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious, were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement, as it's been laying clues all along - and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the ""twists"" coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie, the end is the big reveal. But, unlike Oceans Eleven, for example, it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show, of course, with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting, stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while, Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the ""glamour"" rather than a serious character, which was a shame as she was good.This was supposed to be a big blockbuster film, big back drops, epic stunts and huge crowd scenes, but it failed to deliver. As heist/magic genre films go it's not that great, and The Prestige was far more cerebral and gripping. Entertaining to a point but I got a bit bored, and some of the scenes were too long - chases etc. If you are a fan of heist films or magic you'll enjoy it, or are a fan of particular actors, or will just enjoy it for what it is and don't want to be challenged intellectually, it's a great film. I think Hollywood endings are just too commonplace. 6/10 for me.","302 out of 449 found this helpful.

"","","Promising idea sunk in key areas","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2869000/?ref_=tt_urv","Wizard-8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0101706/?ref_=tt_urv","13 September 2013","""Now You See Me"" came out of nowhere and became the sleeper hit of 2013, getting good word of mouth during its theatrical run. Having seen the movie for myself, I am kind of puzzled by its popularity. Certainly, the movie is far from the worst movies I have ever seen - it's colorful, and doesn't have a dead spot despite running almost two hours long. But there were some things about the movie that annoyed me enough to prevent me from liking it. The biggest problem is with the characters. Except for Freeman's character, there is not one likable character in the movie. The law enforcement agents investigating the magicians are loud and obnoxious, and the four magicians come across as extremely smug. (Also, there is no attempt to give the magicians real and separate personalities - they all act alike.)The characters were the main reason why I didn't like this movie, but there were other problems as well. One other major annoyance is the depiction of the magic acts. They have been jazzed up with CGI and other special effects so they don't feel like REAL magic acts - they come across as artificial. Also, as the movie progresses, the various feats the magicians pull off slowly become more unbelievable (and not fully explained) that eventually I wanted to cry out loud, ""Oh, COME ON!"" Less slight of hand and a more realistic approach would have been a much better approach.(Note to Michael Caine fans: His role is really just an extended cameo appearance.)","42 out of 55 found this helpful.

Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily, but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.The story follows four Vegas magicians, known as the Four Horsemen, who rob a bank in the middle of one of their shows. What follows is a cat-and-mouse thriller where the FBI chases after these magicians, always one step behind, trying to figure out how they did it.Where Now You See Me works best is when Leterrier creates cinematic sequences showing us how these magicians used real-life magic tricks to befuddle and dupe both their victims and the FBI. As well, if you want a film with twists and turns, this one will not disappoint. While most of the major twists can be found out before revealed, there is still a joy in watching those twists unfold, thanks to Leterrier's Sherlock Holmes' style of visual deduction. However, the script often falters in one of the most crucial areas, that of character.Leterrier and company are constantly trying to balance the breakneck pace with the large cast of characters, and it just leaves the characters hanging out to dry. Character development is sorely lacking in Now You See Me, to where I never really cared about any of the characters. Part of this is because the film is constantly shifting points of view. The first thirty minutes follow our Robin Hood-like magicians, and then it switches to the FBI agents tracking them down, but then the film has the magicians constantly one step in front of the FBI to the point that it makes the FBI often come across as buffoons, and I find it hard to care for characters who are so easily fooled. Ultimately, I feel that had the film focused entirely on one set of characters, like the magicians or the FBI, the film would have been stronger and been easier to find a focal point, but as it is the film's core is often muddled.While Now You See Me may not be a grand slam, it's still entertaining, thanks to the thrills and visual style of the film. Bottom line, if you're a fan of the heist genre, you'll like this movie. For me though, it just lacks a further script rewrite to have become one of the best examples of the genre.I give Now You See Me an 8 out of 10!","318 out of 519 found this helpful.

The cast is jam packed with all stars giving great (but not their best) performances. The missing piece of the puzzle? Character development. That's not to say that there is any lack of interesting characters, each of the four horsemen bring a very unique style to the movie (besides Henley, she's rather weak as a character), and the sheer amount of Talent present in each scene guarantees that you'll be entertained. 10/10? Hardly. But definitely a solid 8 for me. Entertaining, fun, and definitely a concept worth exploring on the big screen.

It is a good movie, because it's not a boring movie, but it is that kind of movie that you watch once and walk away and forget all about it. First off, let me tell you why movies involving magic tricks don't work. Because magic is for live audience and everything made on camera loses the main purpose of magic. In order to enjoy it, we have to subscribe to things that defy plausibility, we are obliged to take unrealistic facts for granted. But let's say we're OK with that. The Illusionist or The Prestige worked that way. The real problem here is that the storyline is cynical and walks on a path of plain 'by the book' twist after twist after twist scenario, even though they lack of substance, motivation, trying to create an undeserved WOW effect. Plus, they forced in a classical fling to satisfy all viewers. There are major unrealistic events, but I guess the movie is not for us who try to find logic, but for those who just want to be entertained and see sparkles.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I've ever seen before. ""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to ""witness"" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers?The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. ""Now You See Me"" is definitely not one to miss.It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language. Overall I give ""Now You See Me"" 5 out of 5 stars. See Raven's video review on kidsfirst.org","127 out of 236 found this helpful.

The movie fails, however, to develop any of them beyond these lifeless, cardboard cut-outs. The same is true for the rest of the cast as well. There's a pair of bumbling FBI agents, a washed up magician aiding the feds, and the Horsemen's benefactor who are never given enough depth to make for really compelling characters.This movie does contain some relatively cool tricks, but some are a bit too grand to be believable. One in particular involving Isla Fisher floating above a crowd in a giant bubble is a tad ridiculous.

"","","A bit of summer magic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2806680/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2013","""First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room."" J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) In the case of the magical little entertainment called Now You See Me, you don't have to be the smartest person in the audience to be charmed by the illogical ""magic"" of the tricks or the script. In a takeoff of traditional heist films and homage to recent films like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and The Prestige, with a smattering of smart, sometimes humorous chatter, this film moves at rapid pace (French director Louis Leterrier knows how from his Transporter films) with a lack of seriousness about the tricks, which are mostly explained as the film moves on.Those revelations will bother purists who don't want to know the secrets or critics who demand a reasonable arc for the story. Like the magic itself, the film eventually captures the imagination enough to suspend disbelief and just go with the fun.The ""four horsemen"" (Atlas, played by Eisenberg; Merritt by Woody Harrelson; Henley by Isla Fisher; and Jack by Dave Franco) create three successive magic shows, one in Las Vegas, a second in New Orleans, and the third in New York. The stakes rise incrementally as they appear to be playing Robin Hood to their large, American-Idol type audiences by showering them with money from their magical heists. The FBI with Agent Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) is in hot but bungling pursuit.As in most thrillers, there are minor twists, and the final one that stretches credulity, or that some will see coming, along with a hopper full of smaller ones even naïve I could see from far off. Besides, like the Oceans films' heists, it's not about the heist or the magic. It's about the slick magicians, their easy banter, and comeuppance for the real baddies.Outrageous set pieces like the car race will disconcert those looking for a tightly-told narrative. The magic is as always questionable because film deals in magic with practically every frame. However, the cast is delightfully comic, the direction speedy and tricky, and the entire film wants you in on the magic. For a summer film, that's a magic formula.","10 out of 14 found this helpful.

I gave it a 6/10 for some entertaining bits, and because I did like the characters, but the overall storyline was very annoying and *tedious*. A movie should be enjoyed, not tedious. And I think the reason it was hard to figure out what was really going on was because the explanations for so many things were just not plausible or believable. Also, I would have liked for the story to give more time to the skeptical side of magic and skepticism in general. The story alludes to the reality that magic is just distraction and illusion, but it doesn't tie that deception into life in general—that we should be more skeptical in all areas of life, for example.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Gotta say the ""cool"" factor got to me in every crucial aspect of this flick. It is difficult to be ""cool"" without being corny or coming off silly. Even Woody H. is getting to be enjoyable to me and he's never been one of my fav actors. The storyline is simple and it moves fast with no time to get bored. Each character is acted out really slick, not superficially deep (although I would have enjoyed more character development) and kept my attention.The two heavies, M. Freeman & M. Caine, were very good, of course, and give the movie two solid performances that complement very well the other cast members. Mark Ruffalo was spot on - gosh he's good, why hasn't he made more movies I wonder? (Love him as the Hulk).Jesse Eisenberg is so dang believable that he better do something else quick or he's going to be forever etched in my mind as an illusionist! His character's glances and demeanor are great with, to me, an underlying sense of he can't believe how good he & the other 3 are at what they do. I loved that about each character - they weren't arrogant to the point of unbelievability or boredom. It's like they all were on a ride they could hardly believe. LOL, I kept looking at Isla Fisher and thinking, ""Is that Amy Adams?"" But I knew it couldn't be. And Dave Franco - the look-alike baby Franco brother did a good job with his smaller part.I know I've said it already, but this movie is cool. It had me believing that the tricks could be done. One of the best movies for what it is - entertainment, plain and simple. My friend and I left saying, ""good movie, I liked that."" Definitely a big screen movie.Oh, and guess what? They guessed the card I & my friend picked! How'd they do that??","33 out of 60 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Caper film that is a little too dependent on surprises","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2805386/?ref_=tt_urv","rparham","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0637916/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2013","Now You See Me is a film that is all about obfuscation. Focusing on four magicians that perform feats of wonder first separately and later together, from the first frame on, the film engages in cinematic sleight of hand. However, that formula backfires on the film: by constantly trying to engage in trickery, the audience finds itself always on the lookout for it, and by the time it starts winding down, most of the potential surprises are rendered moot by the fact that we were looking for and expecting said surprises. Thus, while Now You See Me is fun and engaging at times, as a twist-filled surprise machine, it falls flat on it's face.As the film opens, we are introduced to four illusionists: fast talking street-level card sharp Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), ""mentalist"" and small-time con man Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), spoon-bending junior magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and show-stopping high-thrills Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). All of them are given a special card with an address and time on it, and when they all show up at the prescribed time and place, a small apartment in New York, they discover what appears to be a quite elaborate set of plans. Flash forward one year later, and the four magicians are performing as a single act under the moniker The Four Horsemen and are being bankrolled by millionaire Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) During their debut performance in Las Vegas, they close their act with a rather spectacular accomplishment: they transport a French audience member to his bank in France and proceed to steal several billion dollars from it and magically transport it back to the Las Vegas auditorium where they pour it onto the audience.Unsurprisingly, this gets the attention of the FBI, and agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is assigned to the case. He teams up with Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent) and interrogates the Four Horsemen, but with nothing to pin on them, is forced to let them walk. Rhodes seeks the counsel of former magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who now spends his time debunking magicians, revealing what is ""behind the curtain"". With Bradley's help, Rhodes is able to unravel what happened at the first performance, but the Four Horsemen are already moving on to New Orleans for their next show and Rhodes and Dray are trying to stay one step ahead of them.Now You See Me is a film that is intended to keep us on our toes, to leave the audience guessing and wondering what the next revelation is going to be. Sometimes these kind of films can work well, engaging in misdirection and providing red herrings and dead ends for us to believe in before showing us what is really going on. Where Now You See Me missteps is that, from very early in the proceedings, the film telegraphs its intentions so loudly that most of the enjoyment of being caught up in twists is lost. That the twists are such a central part of the film is obvious from the start and makes them less engaging than if they evolved more naturally out of the narrative. Now You See Me is designed and built almost exclusively to keep us guessing but by focusing almost exclusively on that, it overreaches.Now You See Me isn't helped by the fact that the main characters are, save for some quickly introduced character moments and a few exchanges of witty dialogue, almost completely ciphers. Atlas, McKinnney, Wilder and Reeves are barely developed at all, and frankly, excepting for the moments they are performing their stage acts, are not even afforded that much screen time. The screenplay does play a bit with the intentions of the characters, but it is obvious that we are supposed to be rooting for them at times, and it makes it difficult to work up much enthusiasm for them when we barely know them. More screen time is afforded to Rhodes and Dray, and the two develop a romantic chemistry that is palpable at times, but, much like the other characters, they are largely pawns of the screenplay, but they are at least given more to work with than the magicians.Director Louis Leterrier films Now You See Me in Michael Bay mode: the camera rarely stops moving for more than a few seconds. During the magic acts, especially the first one in Vegas, this does bring a degree of style to the proceedings but at times the over reliance on an endlessly moving camera can prove distracting. However, Leterrier does keep the pace brisk and the energy level high. Now You See Me certainly can't be called boring.If Now You See Me succeeds anywhere, it is in the casting. Leterrier has pulled together a strong set of performers and, especially regarding the Four Horsemen, what is sometimes lacking in the screenplay is made up for by likable actors. Eisenberg makes Atlas a fast talking smart alec with a nice streak of charisma, Harrelson gives some fun wisecracks and Fisher is, once again, a strong sensual presence with a degree of toughness. Morgan Freeman can't help but class up anything he appears in and his turn here is no different, his Bradley is nice mix of arrogance and charm. Ruffalo is also at his dependable best, a man fighting to stay with his fugitives while barely managing to stay on top of their capers. It may sound like I am down on Now You See Me, but that isn't completely true. By the time the film was over, I found myself pleasantly engaged and entertained at times, but so much is wrapped up in the film's obvious Rube Goldberg plotting that you can't but help feel disappointed when the film doesn't really deviate from where you expect. Now You See Me is like sneaking a peek at your Christmas gifts: knowing what is coming isn't as much fun as not knowing.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Wow, such pizazz and showy stuff, and such a thin veneer of a plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2911346/?ref_=tt_urv","secondtake","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20961309/?ref_=tt_urv","25 November 2013","Now You See Me (2013)The entire movie is about pulling wool over your eyes—as clever as you might be, you'll never figure out what's happening. So you just have to rush along for the ride. And quite a ride it is, filled with legerdemain and fireworks, sleights of hand and feats of prowess. People disappear and people get out of and into handcuffs with one frame of the movie camera. You want to look one way but the camera looks the other and wham, another surprise.Yes, it's the movie the wins, without quite succeeding as a movie. It's like someone winning at a game by cheating. Impressive—not! And yet it seemed like fun for awhile.There is quite the starry cast here, though two of the biggest stars have only a few minutes (literally) of screen time, sprinkled throughout the film. Michael Caine is shown as the money man behind the hiring of the four magicians in their sudden rise to the top. And Morgan Freeman is shown as the hunter of magic charlatans. (And no, there is no connection to Batman here.)The four magicians are kind of a Dream Team pulled together in the first twenty minutes of the movie, and at first you think you'll see more of their individual acts, which are kind of fun. And different. One is a shyster on the streets, another a kind of trickster mind-reader hypnotist (played beautifully by Woody Harrelson), another a showy big production woman, and the fourth a wizard with cards. After they get together, however, it becomes a version of ""Oceans Eleven"" with magic thrown in. The big sham even starts in Las Vegas.If all you want is pizazz, this movie is for you. It's nothing but! And it's quite well made technically and very fast paced. But if you want to get in on the tricks and be not only surprised but also held in suspense, there are too many easy twists and tricks of cinema illusionism at work. In fact, a key problem with magic in the movies is that you can't quite believe it because you can't trust the camera-work and editing. And there are certainly many tricks here that are only possible by splicing one piece of film to another—you know that seeing it on screen, and just have to say, ""It's a movie, it's okay.""One final element is the convincing, hard-boiled detective, played by Mark Ruffalo. He seems to be the dependable thread a viewer can cling do amidst all the swirling and disarray. A necessary element. Never mind his Interpol sidekick from France, which is meant to add a love story to the whole brew. This movie isn't a mess. It's just a shame because it is so close to having the stuff of a great (entertaining) movie. Even so, though, it's quite entertaining. Quite.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

To sum it up in one word is ""entertaining"". It has the special affects you would expect from ILM behind the scenes. While a few plot mechanism may seem familiar, there is enough original content and spin that it will keep your attention throughout. It has light humor throughout which keeps the experience light hearted. The strong points are the script, acting, directing, cinematography, and visual affects. Yes, it is about stage magicians, but movie magic is used to keep the illusion alive and not actual stage theatrics. The only noticeable weak point is it has potential to be a little bit better in execution of some of the plot twist and it keeps a few important details a little too subtle for one viewing for some viewers.It is a story driven film and not so much a character driven story. There is enough character development to make sense but not balanced enough to feel as engaged to every character. You will understand the characters but may not root for them as much as I'd like. Morgan Freeman certainly holds the screen well and his lines keep people up to speed if they miss something. His character is something of an in movie narrator, but done well from a writing and acting perspective. Jessie Eisenburg's character is also entertaining and engaging as one of the Four Horsemen (the name of the magical stage performers).It has multiple plot twist, some big and some small. These keep you engaged and trying to guess the next move or explain what just happened. A good film to watch with friends and talk about afterwards.It has a good mass appeal and has only a little cussing (3 words I can remember), violence (from car chases), or intense scenes (magic tricks gone wrong where possible bodily harm is implied but not seen) to not keep the younger viewers away. The plot twist may be too complicated for non-teenager youth. Overall it is very entertaining.","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

Like most summer blockbusters it doesn't make perfect sense, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun film to watch especially with that incredible, though unbelievable, ending.What Works – The misdirection is impressive. The story isn't about the four magicians or the heists they ""magically"" perform. While that would have made more sense this movie moves in cheap tricks and clever nonsense.What Doesn't Work – All the unanswered questions. There is a scene where a romance is sparked, but it never ignites and another scene where they argue about where they will go once they perform their final trick, but they don't actually go anywhere. There are a lot of missing parts that leave this puzzle filled with too many holes to see the big picture.What I Thought – Wait for DVD Now You See Me is what any magic act should be – fascinating to figure out and tricky when revealed. Mark Rafflo stomps around most of the movie so upset at any moment you'd expect him to turn into The Hulk and Jesse Eisenberg plays the same smart and smug ""genius"" he did in The Social Network. That's not a great mash-up – at least not great enough to see in theaters. Instead of having audiences leave in awe and applause, there is a residue of deceit and dissatisfaction.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Obviously they were looking out of their window when the film was on and maybe watching a pigeon fight or something. This film is a good bit of fun with a good bit of action in it. The movie is about illusion, and of course the whole premise of illusion is, 'You can do anything'. It's actually very cleverly woven together with enough twists and turns to highlight the distractive techniques used in 'Magic'. There is a great twist at the end, which some people may have got, but not many. So, yeah, I'd say to the reviewer who says 1 out of 10, stop reviewing films because you're not good at it.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) robbing people blind whilst performing his magic tricks and finally Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), an escapologist with a penchant for the macabre.This eclectic band are pulled together as a group following the receipt of the mysterious Taro card requesting them to meet at a certain time and place. Unbeknown to this merry band, they are being played but by whom and why? We then jump forward in time and the group are performing sell out shows on a huge stage at Las Vegas as the ""Four Horseman"". The act is all about illusion and after showing their appreciation to their benefactor Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), the grand finale showcases a multi million dollar fake bank heist. The group then distribute the ""proceeds"" to a highly receptive and appreciative audience.Following the realisation this may not be an illusion but a bank robbery hiding in plain sight, the FBI are called in. Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), who looks like he slept in his clothes, gets to meet his classic mismatch partner in the form of Interpol agent Alma Vargas (Melanie Laurent).The couple then attempt to track and unscramble what is real and what is not. They are aided and not so much abetted, by another shadowy character Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). An ex-magician for hire who now earns a crust unmasking magicians tricks by explaining how they are performed, which seems a real killjoy way of earning a living.The set up is good and the cast list has great depth of experience to call upon. However, despite this fertile ground many opportunities are wasted. Freeman and Caine get very little to do, Ruffalo and Laurent have zero screen chemistry with the former giving every appearance of needing to phone his agent to ask why he is involved at all The four horseman actors acquit themselves well enough but the whole enterprise is let down by a very weak and implausible story which does not hang together or stand up to scrutiny. A bit like the art of illusion itself, distract the audience with lots of shiny glitter and movie stars and maybe they will not notice the plot makes no sense.I suspect when all the reveals are complete many will ask, really was that it? The film did well at the box office so we may see another go round, lets hope the next time they pull the rabbit from the hat, it's clutching a better script.Summary Fun on a very superficial level but overall with so much talent available and an exciting premise, this is disappointing and could have been so much more.As the tag-line says ""The closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see"", which is very apt for the film.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

There was a lot of misdirection and blank holes to be filled. Figuring that they would be filled in on the course of the movie, I continued watching. (I'm a curious guy.) Step by step, more and more of the objective of the 4 Horsemen was revealed, learning more and more why they were doing what they were doing. Now, I like a bit of misguiding, but I don't like to know that I'm being misguided. It makes the movie progress slow and the tid-bits of action and special effects feel like they were included to up the pace. It's like watching a mediocre magic show, knowing you'll be misguided in the usual kind of ways.There is nothing wrong with the acting, you can't go wrong with this cast. I just feel that there was more in this concept than there was done with and you can't only rely on the actors to fill that in. All in all, it was an entertaining movie and I gave it a 7 because the twist on the end surprised me. I had a feeling it would go in that direction, but I couldn't put my finger on it. So +1 point for that.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was undecided but I opted for choosing ""Masters of Illusion"" or ""Now You See Me"". We look at your poster and title, we denote the illusion that there could be around the movie and noticed even the fantastic cast. Liked of power greet one thing. I went to the cinema through the coupon of newspaper Sol, what is of praising, discounting three Eros. Think this yes is benefit the seventh art, the reading and the easy access of spectators a movie.The film was not a disillusionment. It wasn't exactly the best movie that I saw, but I think that earned the ticket. Despite a history slightly weak, had each good dialogues and some enthusiasm, and some attention in their characters. The film speaks us of a group of four illusionists each with your specialty since hypnotism, hands savvy, magic with objects and surprising tricks of evolution of technology. Found themselves due to a superior strength and magical (that after revealed-if be more surprising and Funny), that the joined, forming the Four Horsemen. So far, nothing mysterious, just a beginning of film to know the characters, so one filled to go to the main story. After make a fantastic bank robbery Créditique Republicaine of Paris, that maybe if reveal a simple magic trick. How is obvious, the FBI needs make your own research to ascertain how can the assault have occurred in Paris if were in Las Vegas.The film was very Soft Spot in the its history base, but perhaps had a good development. It smells the Oceans's Eleven, but with more skepticism and mysticism, and it is clear that this film surprising when we know the true nature of the tricks. The essence of film is what has to best: their tricks, their premonitions, and the background of history similar to of Robin Hood, only with more secret and enigmas. The dialogues showed become quite good and epics.The cast shone without major excesses, but were glitzy as illusionists. With guy of who knows trick, but not wants tell. Loved the character Woody Harrelson, the comic side of the film, and the character Morgan Freeman, the destructive side of the mystery we really want to know, but we were disappointed after he destroy the fantasy that is the trick.Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt were writers of this argument, and Louis Leterrier was the filmmaker. Changed of a register sci-fi and fanciful for a movie with new meanings and full of illusion. Several are the ideas that come of the film. We begin by having faith in what feel and then we let ourselves fantasize by little fantasy that still exists in the world. E we still have let people from stealing at those corrupt rich to give to poor and worthy.Think one sentence of film is very characteristic than is the world of magic and illusion. ""Closer you look, less you actually see."" Or ""Closer you try see, least certainly shalt see."" Try having curiosity and try to discover the illusion, which then end dead, like the cat.You go see, but not wait a movie astonishing.BETTER: The tricks and smells of Ocean's Eleven.WORST: The weak arguments, filled with pieces of pudding.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

For them to work one of the most important things is to have a creative approach to the heist or the heist itself. Lately there have been very few adding anything new to the genre, but with Now You See Me they look to have tried to add a bit of magic to the struggling genre literally. With a great cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine does it create the spectacle it promises or are the trailers all an illusion? Now You See Me follows an FBI agent and an Interpol detective track a team of illusionists who pull off bank heists during their performances and reward their audiences with the money. For once a film got the heist element right and delivered a clever and engaging story to go along with it. This isn't a perfect film by any means, but thanks to the magic element, which is usually a film killer, it takes it to a level that keeps things moving in an interesting direction. While the trailers showcase the magicians as the leads, this isn't quite the case. Make no mistake they are in the majority of the film and deliver the best parts of the film, but this movie follows more of Mark Ruffalo's detective as he is obsessively trying to solve this case. Typically Ruffalo is great and he is decent here, but just not up to par of his normal performances. Most of this is due to the character not being all that interesting and the attempt to thrust more depth into it that was really not necessary. The rest of the cast have great chemistry and chew up the scenery around them with Michael Caine really the only one with very little to do. The heists are fun to watch and ponder how they pulled it off even though some of them are predictable, but for the most part create a great presence on screen. While not a lot there are some great action moments here and there that were pretty surprising featuring Dave Franco that probably were not all him, but still fun to watch none the less.With the exception of some of the useless character elements to the Ruffalo character the rest of this movie is pretty entertaining adding a unique twist to the heist genre that has been missing. It probably would have been even better if the main focus had been on the magicians also known as the Four Horseman, but who knows maybe the less is more approach is why it worked so well.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

All that's missing is the second half of the saying: ""now you don't"". It goes to say that at some points this movie is fun and entertaining, hence the ""now you see me"", and at other times it can become almost the opposite, ""now you don't"".The movie presents an interesting concept from the start: a group of illusionists who perform bank heists during their shows and reward the audience with the money. The plot is interesting yes, but the amount of plot holes overall over-lap the amount of a well structured story. There are times where the movie simply makes no sense. I found myself struggling to keep up with the excess amount of twists thrown in, along with the brutally fast pacing of the film. On the plus side, some of these twists are exciting and lead to some great moments, and some of the ""action"" scenes, if you will, are fun to watch. The magic tricks and illusions are especially interesting. However, more often than not, the plot as a whole fails to deliver, despite the occasional exciting scene.Director Louis Leterrier's direction style didn't always seem to fit this movie. The pacing was way off, and there was little to zero character development, making it seem like a group of characters were thrown together for almost no good reason. Now again, there are occasionally parts where I felt the movie was moving along fairly well and it had me interested, but too often the movie lacked proper pacing, and suffered from non-existent character development throughout.The cast ranges from the mildly to the highly experienced, with the likes of Dave Franco to Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg. It's a talented and diverse cast that is brought together, and each actor does a great job in their respective roles. Again, the one thing that hurt the cast was the lack of character development. Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, and Michael Caine round out the solid cast and to reiterate, all give great performances.In Now You See Me, there was a great opportunity to create an interesting take on the heist-related genre. At some times, the movie is entertaining, showing off some fun, mind-stretching action scenes that leave you wanting more. Unfortunately, more often than not, the incomplete plot, under developed characters, overly fast pace, and misleading feel for the movie prevents it from being something bigger and better. 6.5/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In this day and age, the con men wear suits and run corporations and banks, and in spirit there is no netter group of people to challenge them then magicians.In addition to getting the small stuff right, this movie gets it right in the large. Just when I was shaking my head and saying ""this can't be done, the safeties aren't there and it depends too much on people doing the right things at the right time"", the movie pulls out the ONLY solution that solves all those problems.Like all great magic tricks, there is only one good solution, but the magician distracts from it to the point that we don't even realize its there.Sadly, I think this movie suffered from the problem many really good movies about magic do... they are so faithful to the hidden art that no one but practitioners believe its real. Ironically, the more absurd a movie about magicians is, generally the easier it is for the audience to swallow.

"","","A complex brain twister that is fun, brilliant and stylish","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2808415/?ref_=tt_urv","Remy_Azhary","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2514938/?ref_=tt_urv","6 June 2013","WOW!!!That's exactly how I feel about NOW YOU SEE ME. Frankly, I don't see why many dissed the film. Perhaps, because this one constantly urged them to actually use almost 90% percent of your brain to decode the tricks in the entire movie from start to end.No doubt the movie is a mixture of numerous tricks ranging from optics to numbers to common logic. And there were also some that still remained to be explained; supernatural maybe. Nevertheless, the movie was both totally mind-blowing and mind-boggling.To be honest, I'm not all too crazy with Louis Leterrier as the director. I mean his take on the 2010 remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS was quite a disappointment.However, the ensemble cast was amazing, cool and slick; just as I had expected them to be. But the intricacies of panning out the plot was a complex one. So much so that there was an essence of solving a mystery a la the Nicholas Cage's film, NATIONAL TREASURE. There was also that essence of Dan Brown's ""Robert Langdon"" style which we saw in THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS.However, the more intriguing charm about NOW YOU SEE ME is that it actually compels the audience to think as to how the ""magicians"" were able to literally trick the audience. In other words, it's like watching that TV show, ""Secrets of Magicians Revealed"" with Morgan Freeman played its TV-equivalent of Mitch Pileggi who revealed how each of the tricks were pulled off.No doubt there is a twist to this one and you would constantly try to figure out who was behind the whole grand plan. At times, I was convinced that it was Freeman himself but he was none other than a red herring.I mean the plot got so twisted that I simply gave up and chose to sit through the movie as the end revealed the real mastermind. In actual fact, this person was right under our very nose that we didn't see it coming.I'd see it again.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

And, at times, we appear to be treated to explanations as to how tricks were done, but sadly, in doing so, many important pieces of the descriptions were simply ignored because they were inexplicable. It kind of takes the biscuit when you explain the easy and, perhaps, most dramatic parts of trickery but fail on the subtleties where the real tricks occur. But the context of the film is how trickery can be used to fool us all via the many diversions the film uses along the way.Of course you have to suspend reality watching this film or it can get a little tiresome, which is probably why I found it enjoyable but only in parts. It is a good twenty minutes too long and kind of waffles it way through the final five minutes or so. The actors seem like they're having a good time and the sets are fabulous. But the whole seems to add up to something a little less than satisfactory.Six out of ten.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It shouldn't have been entertaining as it was, but I was able to suspend my disbelief for two hours and I was able to be transported into some sort of fun alternate reality. But the CGI is great and it was used at the right times instead of just constantly.Louis Leterrier's film is about a group of magicians named The Four Horseman who are magicians on the outside, but on the inside they are actually bank robbers. When FBI and Interpol catch their scent, this ensues a thrilling chase where the Horseman must stay one step ahead of the FBI.This film boasted a nice set of attractive actors and actresses. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson were excellent, proving their A-list status. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were great supplements to the previous two. Franco actually had a great scene involving a tense car chase. Mark Ruffalo was really good as the lead FBI agent. Finally, who can forget about the great Morgan Freeman and the great Michael Caine?Overall, Now You See Me is a really fun movie and I was certainly dazzled. The CGI and the set pieces were great. I can also say the same for the acting and the directing, which makes up for the lack of a good screenplay and characterization. It is action-packed and it is funnier than I thought it would be. Out of the two films based on magicians that came out in 2013, this film is the better one. Sorry Jim Carrey! I rate this film 9/10.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's all about appearances and show in this one, rather than actually being brilliant, the characters and story just ask you take their brilliance for granted. The story revolves around illusionists (implicitly portrayed as demigods I would say) and how they manage to fool everyone and get a little fooled themselves. Of course, with all this fooling around there are always chances that something might strike the funny bone, that is to say it has its humorous moments now and then but on the whole the illusions and tricks etc. is just more of a dazzle than something logical and realistic. There is not much depth to the characters and a lot of misdirection to make the climax more effective, but the misdirection only adds to the illogical nature of the plot and makes the story hollow.Having criticized enough the good parts for me were the cocky-as-usual Jesse Eisenberg and some of the funny moments but nothing else. Even the dazzle of the magic tricks was made slow and plain by all the simple filler like dialogues. Final word; skip it unless you don't have a better choice for a movie in mind.","255 out of 406 found this helpful.

A group of illusionists are brought together and within a year they are playing Vegas together and appear to rob a bank in Paris remotely. This draws in the FBI and Interpol but how can they prove anything when it all seems so impossible and so hard to prove? This setup offers a twisty and engaging plot but sadly it is one that never gets delivered upon. Instead what we get is a constantly moving film that is loaded with stars, money and special effects but nothing of nay real substance.This approach works really well when it comes to the slickness of delivery and how polished it all feels, but it is so very unsatisfying as a whole product. The twists and turns of the film are almost all nonsense – slickly elaborate and delivered with pace for sure, but with nothing behind of any substance. As a result I stopped caring about the plot or about working out what was going on behind the theatrics. Movement appeared to be the all and after a while I tired of it. The slick delivery is all well and good and it is added to by the cast – so many faces, so many quality actors all getting handsomely paid but doing very little. It felt like a waste.It isn't a terrible film by any means; the pace and slickness makes it work on that level but it does very little else which is engaging or memorable. It is fluff that fills the time but leaves you with nothing after that.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

It's done for its shock value. Sadly, by then I was out of shock. All sound and fury signifying nothing.","114 out of 180 found this helpful.

"","","Magic and Character development were lacking, but surprises entertained","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2800416/?ref_=tt_urv","manuscriptna","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24123130/?ref_=tt_urv","20 May 2013","It is very important to realize that this movie must not be spoiled. I will not be discussing anything not shown in the trailers, and I ask you not to go looking for such secrets online, but only by watching it yourself. This movie is designed to entertain, and to a degree it does just that.I haven't seen many of Leterrier's films, but I enjoyed this about as much as The Incredible Hulk, but more than Clash of the Titans. There were still disappointments. Magic movies have been a great interest of mine, and from the trailer I had to wonder, does Michael Caine + woman in a tank = The Prestige? Truthfully, the similarities stopped there, including magic's screen time.Despite magic taking up most of the trailers, it was too scarce in the film itself. I wanted more magic. I know that doing so would take screen time from Ruffalo, but he wasn't the best of the bunch. In fact, they were Freeman, Caine, and Laurent, respectively.The screen writing didn't allow for many to develop character well. The Four Horsemen were usually smooth-talking brick walls. And was that Dave Franco I saw? He had no screen time! (except for brief fancy dodging falling fighting)These character holes would be acceptable if the movie were a large show. But as mentioned before, magic only came in smaller pieces, when at all. Some were amazing, some were old already, and some were hilarious.It seems like I didn't appreciate the movie much, but I could only talk about what I didn't like. The rest, the secrets, I loved but can't talk about. Suffice it to say that many surprises are in store, and they're worth watching the movie for. That said, it's best to go in without guessing and predicting, because seeing the many reveals is where most of the entertainment lies. Don't spoil it for yourself.This is a film some would be happier seeing in theatres, but if you don't think you'd spend ticket money for this, you'd probably regret it, so wait for DVD.As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside. Also, there's a moment in a Mardi Gras parade that needs to be avoided, and minor language throughout. I'd recommend this movie for 17+, not only for these, but for the understanding of the secret material I can't bring up.","26 out of 58 found this helpful.

I had high expectations for this movie, knowing that it is full of great actors. It was a very well written movie and the plot was genius which worked hand in hand with the great actors. The plot twists in this film are just spectacular. It will have you on the edge of your seat throughout and wondering how they perform each trick. But the end is what makes the movie blow your mind. For some people, you may get lost during the movie or even bored. But if you stick it out through the end you will appreciate the greatness of the movie. As the movie progresses and the conflict becomes even bigger and bigger it results in more wonder and curiosity. It was very unpredictable throughout which made it all the more enjoyable. One of the best movies I have seen this year and is with out a doubt worth seeing. Any movie lover would enjoy this film and i recommend to all. I hope to see Eisenberg in even more movies after the way he preformed in this and The Social Network a few years back. Truly a solid and well written movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I don't think that it was spectacular like many critics are saying. Now don't get me wrong, this movie had one of the most interesting ideas I've seen in a while. The idea of magicians using their act as a front to rob banks and give some money back to the little guy was what drew me into this movie in the first place. But once you're sitting there watching its just kinda like ""eh"". I don't mean to sound snobby, I just think that maybe the movie talked itself up to much and it suffered because of it. For one thing the movie moves really fast for itself. By this i mean that once the horseman acquire their act in Vegas and Mark Ruffalo is called in to catch them after the bank robbery it just feels like i'm already in the middle of the movie. As the movie progresses it eventually catches up with itself, but regrettably this made it hard to watch. Also i felt like the protagonists didn't get enough screen time, I get that if we saw too much of the 4 horsemen it would have given away the secrets to their tricks and such thus sort of ruining the twists at the end but i felt like they could have given them a few more scenes that didn't exactly inform the plot but kind of provided some fan service. I think the thing that baffled me the most though was how supernatural the film got. I was expecting the usual magician tricks or y'know things that seemed a bit believable. But after the scene with the curtains and Isla Fisher floating in a giant bubble, all preconceived notions of reality sort of went out the window. So in conclusion i give ""Now You See Me"" a 6-10 it was so-so.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Maybe. However for centuries there are those who don't have one ounce of true magical ability in the literal sense of the word but are able to convince others they do, usually audiences willing to suspend their ""disbelief"". These people are called ""magicians"", and magicians have been performing before amazed crowds since Antiquity and the Middle Ages to the present. The film in question ""Now You See Me"", the first half of the phrase ""Now you see me, now you don't"", takes us into the world of magicians. The main performers, four diverse magicians of mediocre talents, have been brought together to become the Four Horsemen, I assume their name deriving from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as labeled in the Book of Revelation.Four different magicians have been summoned by Tarot cards for an unknown purpose: Merritt McKinney, whose card is the Hermit, a hypnotist and mentalist (Woody Harrelson), Daniel ""Danny"" Atlas, whose card is the Lover, an arrogant illusionist (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves, whose card is the High Priestess, an escape-artist similar to Houdini (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder, Tarot card Death, a sleight of hand illusionist and street magician (Dave Franco). At the beginning of the film they were magicians who performed spontaneously for small crowds. Through the Tarot cards, they are summoned by an unknown ""benefactor"" and eventually financed by Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), an insurance magnate. In a year, they evolve from unknown street magicians to a nationally-known headline act, the Four Horsemen. They perform in large venues in Las Vegas and New York. Their escapades catch the eye of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and U.S. law enforcement when they appeared to have enacted a magical heist from a bank in France. Interpol in Europe also gets involved, and they send a young inexperienced agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), a French criminal researcher who has interest in the occult. As the stunts of the Four Horsemen keep getting larger, involving ever-larger sums of money, Alma and Rhodes find themselves battling a formidable foe. The Horsemen use their magic ""act"" as a kind of misdirection, and the FBI and Interpol always seem one to two steps behind them. The FBI starts to question the motives of Alma in part because they wander if there is a ""fifth horseman"" as yet unknown but pulling many of the strings.Also on their trail is Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a modern-day skeptic whose show and DVD's expose ""magic"" fraud, similar to Houdini's exposing of séance frauds in the early 20th century. Thirty years previous to the events of the film, Thaddeus exposed another magician, Lionel Shrike. His career was all but ruined at the hands of Thaddeus, until he decided to engage in a comeback by attempting to escape from a safe thrown into the Hudson River. He never escaped and was presumed dead. As a result, the ""magic"" community has had an adversarial relationship with Thaddeus. FBI agent Rhodes tries to ingratiate himself to Thaddeus, hoping the exposer of magic fraud will help them capture the Four Horsemen. The game becomes a kind of cat and mouse in which Rhodes is bent on exposing and arresting the Four Horsemen and using Thaddeus as a kind of double-agent. However, Thaddeus appears less than impressed with the FBI, and although he's not entirely on the side of the Four Horsemen, he seems to admire their tricks. He also has his own agenda, wanting footage for his upcoming show.A fun-filled, action-packed heist-thriller with a certain amount of intelligence. The acting is superb, and the cast of the Four Horsemen are diverse enough we buy into their little eccentricities. Freeman makes an excellent Thaddeus Bradley, constantly pointing out the ineptitude of the FBI. And Caine is a good billionaire magnate who stays somewhat behind the scenes to finance the money-making endeavors of the Four Horsemen. During the film, different miss-directions are explained by Freeman which is half the fun. A good escapist film. But don't try the stunts at home!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

But apart from that, the movie had a good pace where everything is happening at quick sessions where you don't see scenes wasting time. Jesse Eisenberg was great again,I was so impressed with his arrogant character in ""The Social Network"" and he has actually inherited some of those characteristics to his character in ""Now You See Me"" too. His style of speech gives a great personality to the character he plays. In stories like this, (like Italian Job, Ocean 13) although our story leaders are robbers or con artists, we want them to win. We like them to succeed. But will NYSM story leaders win their game against the determined FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo)? What is Thaddeus Bradley's (Morgan Freeman) role behind all these?

After a bank robbery for which they have an air-tight alibi, they were performing in front of hundreds of fans at the time, they are brought in by the police to be investigated.

But, is this a movie about magicians performing magic? Please stop thinking on the lines of Nolan's ""The Prestige"". It is hard to look at the movie from this ""magic"" perspective because magic does not form the essential crux of the story. Well, there is magic throughout the story, some of which well explained and some of which totally bizarre and unexplained, but the magic is simply not the central theme of the story. Of course, towards the end of the movie, people disappear in carousels, and re-appear in France; however, a simple climax twist not-so-well connected to the movie proceedings does not do enough justice to the infinite number of unexplained magic tricks throughout the movie. It would have been amazing had some of the mind blowing tricks been explained; the only plausible answer to the question: ""Why were these tricks not explained"" is that the story is simply not related to those magic tricks. Is this a heist movie? It started looking like one initially; though there is some stealing involved, it did not feel like one at the end. Wait, is this simple, plain revenge? Ah, the final minute of the movie conveys this idea, but at that moment, the viewers can definitely figure out the answer to the million dollar question: ""What type of a movie this is?!"", with the answer being: ""Who cares!""""Now you see me"" is a perfect example of taking a good story, getting an amazing cast to work for you, but spoiling the fun for the audience with some poor screenplay writing and direction. For most part of the film, the story does not seem to head to any particular direction or with destination in mind at all. The magicians are supposed to perform three acts - first in Las Vegas, second in New Orleans, and third in New York City - and each act is supposed to top the previous one. While the first act sets up the stage for the movie, the second act creates so much excitement for the audience. Unfortunately, the final act along with some preceding and succeeding scenes is mostly responsible for the letting the entire movie, and hence the viewers, down!It is easily possible to write pages after pages praising for the entire cast, and they actually deserve it. Be it Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco who star as the Four Horsemen, Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent as the policemen who try to catch up with the magicians' tricks, Michael Caine (who, I thought, did not have much to do!) or Morgan Freeman, all of them have performed extremely well. Halfway into the movie, I started thinking whether Mark Ruffalo or Jesse Eisenberg was the main character, especially since Eisenberg appeared so sparingly after the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and it was a full Mark Ruffalo show from thereon. However, what was supposed to be a cat and mouse game between them did not create sufficient tension to captivate the viewer.The real problem lies with the script and direction. Though the first half of the movie sets up the stage well, it drags between the first and second act, and right immediately after the second act as well. Good writing should have upped the ante after the second act, but the movie sets off as a torn kite without a clear direction. May be that's why when the final twist - which is supposed the awe the audience - appears, the viewer is already frustrated with the one million unresolved plot holes, and hence, the reaction to the twist is: ""Oh, OK! The movie is over, let's get out of the theater!"" Worse, if somebody were to try to make some sense out of it, there are a million questions about the story, particularly regarding the fifth horseman whom Mark Ruffalo has been searching for throughout the movie - very contrived, the entire episode looked.In all truth, I liked the overall story and in parts, the movie was fun. Even the climax twist was not a let down, only the events that culminated in it were! If alone, they concentrated some more on those plot holes, if alone they had a more taut script to tie down the viewers, if alone the movie had a clear destination instead of the dumb third magic act, if alone Louis Leterrier and co. had steered the ship better, the film would have turned out to be an amazing heist-cum- revenge-cum-magic movie! Unfortunately now, the movie is none of the three!What I saw:Direction: 3.0/5 Writing: 2.5/5 Acting: 3.5/5 Music: 3.0/5 Cinematography: 3.5/5What I felt:Degree of Tautness: 2.5/5 Emotional Quotient: 2.5/5 Intelligence Quotient: 3.0/5 Entertainment Quotient: 3.5/5","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It was red - Hearts, I think. Honest(!) And yet, it wasn't SUPPOSED to be the Queen of Hearts; it was supposed to be something else, something more obvious and yet at the same time just as random. ""Now You See Me"" is like that - cheeky without necessarily being obnoxious, playful without being disagreeable. You know what you saw, sort of, and your head tells you one thing while some other part of your body cries out something else. It's a good opening - one that commands your attention as the character literally speaks into the camera, but ultimately one which opens a film unable to command as much awe as it thinks it is able to. Like any slight-of-hand trick, it is more style than substance.Much has, of course, been written about how cinema itself is essentially a magic trick; an illusion created by projected light and a series of still images moving rapidly in order to create the impression of motion. We know what we watch is often not real, though sometimes it can be, and on other occasions it is difficult to entirely discern. ""Now You See Me"" is a strange, warped celebration of this fact - a little fatuous, but it uses the bare-bones of the joyous idea of trickery to propel it, and it is good fun while it lasts.The film tells the story of four New Yorkers, bound by the ability to feign illusion to varying extents, being brought together by an unseen character in order to conduct a series of daring public shows. Danny (Jesse Eisenberg) and Henley (Isla Fisher) are your standard stage-magicians, while Merritt (Woody Harrelson) and Jack (James Franco) more resemble con-artists, with Harrelson in particular specialising in the conspicuous art of mentalism. One day, out of nowhere, they each receive suspicious tarot cards which inform them to frequent a local address (a Youtube analysis by Plebtier questions as to whether or not anyone would actually go), only to find it mysteriously unoccupied but for a small presentation which binds them for the rest of the film.Within one year, the group, nicknamed The Four Horsemen, are in Vegas conducting what looks like the robbery of a bank on the other side of the world via the bending of space and time. Here, the crew pick a Parisian man out from the crowd; send him into his bank's vault and then seemingly suck millions of currency out, over the ocean, and into the arena - betraying science in the process. And yet it must have happened, because we saw it happen, don't we?The actions of the Horsemen attract the attention of Mark Ruffalo, who plays an FBI agent by the name of Rhodes, and who, along with a French Interpol agent, seeks to find out just what the Hell is going on. His introduction sees him storm, typical for the archetype, down a corridor in a police station; enter an office; fire off his dialogue and get on with things. Later on, he will sit dishevelled at a bar and consume alcohol in very small glasses. Cliché or diversion? The Horsemen in custody, no one can actually prove anything in spite of the show - are you REALLY going to charge someone for defying physics? Propping the film up is their manager Tressler (Michael Caine), who keeps them under his wing. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, plays Thaddeus Bradley - an ex-magician who profits from revealing the secrets behind other magicians' tricks and who serves as a sort of direct communiqué to the audience when they are most scratching their heads.The film repeats what it does during its opening stunt on a further two occasions, the last of which ties in with the film's climax, creating something which is at once quite stupid but strangely watchable. The film is stuck in a strange no man's land between what is believable in the real world and what we consider movie escapism - if we accept that aliens can come down to Earth and turn into automobiles in one film, why can't a handcuffed magician transfer the keys to his cuffs into a coke can AND break free in the process? Because it's impossible, that's why.It is a curious thing the film has essentially drawn influence from the first ""Ace Ventura"" for its plot, though more curious is that we are asked to believe a Frenchman could've been so persuaded to go to Vegas in the first place; that this motley group might be able to perform armoured van heists; rig explosive getaways and that Caine would be stupid enough to go back to New Orleans if he had history there. Again, we turn to the analysis of Plebtier - when a character steals a black sedan during an escape, it seems as if he does so by chance, yet the film would have you think it was part of a wider, carefully constructed plan involving a crash on a bridge.By the time the film ends, what have we actually seen? The idea, though far from watertight, is quite good fun - it is too convoluted, though is a good crack up to the point it stops and I was, to its credit, still into it by the time the final act was rounded off. There is a whole ream of questions one could ask related to FBI background checks; the presence of GPS bugs in cell phones; how you organise all this without even meeting your insider; why Danny and Henley would even turn to high-scale crime in the first place, and I don't think all of it adds up, though I did enjoy the journey to realising that not all of it adds up...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And by that, I assume they were referring to the plot. Nice one guys- I was fooled! This is what happens when a screenwriter writes from the ""outside in"" instead of the ""inside out."" It's all about outside elements (plot plot plot, twist twist twist) and no inside elements (human motivation/emotion). Honestly, I couldn't give a spoiler to this movie if I tried, because I have no idea what it is about. No-one does. It was just the filmmakers making up whatever cliché was convenient for them at the time and trying to twist the plot so much that YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. Oh spare me that horse crap! It's always sad when movies TRY to be 3 steps ahead of an audience.NEWS FLASH TO DIRECTOR Louis Leterrier. We're smart now. You know.. audiences. Maybe this flashy, celebrity packed mis-direction movie would have worked in the 90s, but unexplained magic tricks are boring to us now. We don't fall for stupid, predictable camera manipulation anymore.We know you've been rubbing one out to The Illusionist and The Prestige every night for the lat 3 years, but let's be honest... you can't one up The Illusionist, or the Prestige. Those are masterful movies that should be left alone. You might have been able to pull this off had it been a TV series. But you had about 20 plot points that went nowhere, because you have no time to develop anything substantial with a feature film with 20 plot points (Cloud Atlas being the only exception). When you finally revealed the big secret, the audience I was in was disinterested and distracted by all the gaping holes left over from Act 1. Forget Act 3. Car chase sequence? Really? (no that's not a spoiler, because it was not a central part to the story). Speaking of story... It was interesting that the filmmakers choose not to include back-story- or motives- or subtext, or indications of character inspiration, or clues onto what certain symbols meant. It was just all one big, fat convenient mystery that ends in the most overdone Hollywood cliché one can imagine. We didn't know who to root for. Just because Morgan Freeman looks like he does and talks like he does doesn't give you a free pass to bukkake your action sequence fantasy all over the screen. Morgan Freeman is not Marlin Brando. His presence doesn't transcend the story. Even Brando himself couldn't have made this a good movie, because you wouldn't have time to invest in him because it's BAM BAM BAM, next plot point, next plot point, twist, twist, twist. The audience was thinking, ""Hold on! Slow down! Wait, what? Huh?""Honestly, I don't want to waste any more of my time thinking about this turd. Just do yourself a favor and wait for it to come out on Redbox. At least then you'll only bitch about throwing away 1.50. (and you can get your grocery shopping done at the same time). Oh and BTW... we get it Louis Leterrier; you're French. Thanks for ramming the French thing down our throats the entire movie in characters and location.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

A year later, they are ""The Four Horsemen"", the world's greatest illusionist attraction. The grand finale of their most spectacular performance is to perform the illusion of bank robbery from the stage. It turns out that the bank is really robbed and the police, with the help of the former illusionist, who has reoriented to exposing the illusions of others, is trying to find out what happened and catch the mysterious four.This film does not possess depth, philosophy, and hidden messages, nor aspire to some sort of artistic value. This is an illusionist action movie, whose purpose is to entertain, and in that purpose, it succeeds. If you're not a film snob and enter this adventure with realistic expectations of this genre, you can expect an awesome ride and you will not lack the adrenaline. Although not comparable to the greatest cinematic achievements, within the framework of its genre and goals it is trying to achieve, this film is perfectly executed and deserves the highest rating. In addition to the other qualities, there's really exceptional cast, among which are Mark Ruffalo (three Academy Award nominations), Woody Harrelson (also three), Morgan Freeman (one Oscar won out of five nominations) and Michael Caine (two out of six).10/10","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

With a fun plot and premise centering around four street magicians united by a mystery character, the movie moved at a quick pace. These four main actors were well casted and likable, with memorable quips and sarcastic retorts. Albeit, that's really all they were: likable. They were not developed at all, but rather introduced quickly to set up the plot of the movie. The movie lacked any real conflict for these main characters that would take them from flat descriptions to more dynamic people. They conveniently eluded the police at every turn; they all survived; and they all were happy. You couldn't help but root for them, but something felt like it was missing.Aside from the four magicians, Melanie Laurent, Mark Ruffalo's love interest was almost unbearable. I couldn't help but cringe each time her and Ruffalo interacted; it was beyond corny. At certain points, I was admittedly even laughing at it. Furthermore, at the end of the movie, the ""surprise twist,"" was so unrealistic and impossible that it made the rest of the movie slightly more absurd. The cool plot and idea of a hidden player who united them became droll because it lost all believability with this ending. And when the characters got onto a magical merry-go-round at the end. I mean come on, really?Take this movie at face value, and know what you're paying for. It's no cinematic genius by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun, light-hearted action with likable and interesting protagonists. All these elements combined to make this a nice, feel good movie. I was entertained and distracted for a solid two hours, and hey, I think that alone is worth something","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The only thing maybe impressed is the end that the stupid cop is the guy behind. It has some attractive scene like car chasing run cool etc. The main line seems reasonable as well. And one thing I have to say is the Franch blondy acts very well although her character has little chance to express. Comparing with these old famous Freeman and Tressler the youth do a better job, but I'm not here suspecting there acting skill maybe it is because the wrong character. Especially that I have to say Morgan you are too calm sometimes, you can't be that peaceful all the time for this character and the only moment you are dismayed is apparently pretend.

An FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and a former magician (Morgan Freeman) try to figure out exactly how the tricks are being done and especially since there's no logical explanation. If the trailer for NOW YOU SEE ME left you feeling somewhat cold like me, then the movie itself is actually much better. The trailer would make you believe that this is just going to be a silly little movie and it is to a point but there's also a few nice tricks being done in the screenplay and director Louis Leterrier also manages to do quick a magic trick himself. Throughout the film we're told to believe in magic you can't look too closely to the trick. I think if we look too closely at this story we're going to have many logical problems but the director does a good job at making you forget these and just takes you along for the ride. There's no question that I was entertained from start to finish because the screenplay is good enough to keep you on your toes and you're never quite sure where the story is going to take you. Another plus is that we're given a pretty good cast and each one does a very good job in their parts. Eisenberg plays the brain like no other can. Harrelson has that sly charm working well. Ruffalo is good as the cop and pros like Freeman and Michael Caine never fail. Melanie Lauren is also extremely good in her supporting part. The film offers up some dazzling cinematography and there's no question that the look of the film is very impressive. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't a masterpiece but I think it's a very well-made film that at least does what a cheap magic trick does and that's entertain you.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

That might be what I wanted, but director Louis Leterrier was more interested in putting out another flashy summer action movie. The movie's not much more than a flashy spectacle that attempts to shoehorn a big ""twist"" into the end of the film, but it all left me feeling a little disappointed at the end. As a big fan of THE PRESTIGE, I have a nasty tendency of going in to movie's centering on magicians with high hopes that it will strive for that level of drama in the world of magic. This year I've been let down twice: this and THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE. Though Leterrier's magical heist film is nowhere near as derivative as that Steve Carell dud. Instead, it's just your average ""turn off the brain"" summer entertainment. NOW YOU SEE ME opens with introductions to four low-level magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) is a semi- successful street magician, Henley Reeves (Fisher) is Atlas's former assistant who's gone on to create her own act, Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) is a mentalist struggling to regain his former fame, and Jack Wilder (Franco) is a street-level sleight-of-hand artist. Each of them receives a mysterious invitation that soon leads to an immensely successful show together as the Four Horsemen. When their show in Las Vegas concludes with the seemingly magical theft of millions of Euros from a bank vault in Paris, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) is assigned with an Interpol agent (Laurent) to put an end to it before the Horsemen strike again.There are a couple problems I have with this movie. I was hoping, if nothing else, that it would treat the magic in the movie as true illusions. I loved the idea of stage magicians using their craft to dazzle audiences with their show while baffling the authorities with their crafty heist jobs. The movie abandons any hope of that by incorporating CG effects into the illusions, giving them an otherworldly appearance and ruining any feeling of grounding in reality. During the first Horsemen show in Las Vegas, Leterrier uses some horrible CG effect for some floating black clothes in the reveal of the ""transporter"" and reinforced it in New Orleans when Henley takes flight in a giant bubble over the audience. Feasible? Maybe, but it felt like a little too much and suddenly the magicians didn't feel real. Next is the whole concept of ""The Eye"". The Eye is some secret society of magicians dating back to ancient Egypt that was dropped into the plot as some sort of motivation behind the magicians' heists. I don't know about anyone else's opinion, but personally I would've enjoyed it more if the magicians weren't supposed to be anti-heroes but really were just incredibly talented thieves that used their shows and complex illusions to get away with incredible robberies. The Horsemen's selfless acts are secretly manipulated and funded(?) by an unknown fifth figure a fifth Horseman. The reveal at the end of the film of the fifth Horseman's identity is one I saw coming but also hoped I was wrong about because it was just too lame. In addition to being somewhat disappointing, it also raised a lot of questions/problems about everything that had preceded it. Not to mention all the logistical problems behind it.But, if you're ready and willing to shut down your brain, NOW YOU SEE ME is a decently fun two hours. There's a fair bit of action in the film and director Louis Leterrier has proved skills in the genre (yes, I liked THE INCREDIBLE HULK). There's a pretty wicked fight scene about halfway through the film between Ruffalo and Franco that ends with the obligatory overblown car chase every successful summer blockbuster needs. And the glimpse into the Horsemen's more grounded illusions and how they pull off some of their heists is pretty cool. Plus, you really can't complain with such an awesome cast on hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, and Melanie Laurent. It's a pretty stacked team here. If the material were stronger, we'd probably have a real killer movie. The material doesn't live up to the potential of bringing all these choice actors together. Still, they bring their usual quality performances to the game and that alone is enough to earn the movie some brownie points. All things considered, NOW YOU SEE ME balances it strengths and weaknesses to be a serviceable summer action movie. Set your expectations to mid-level and you'll be fine. With a sequel on the way and that lame fifth Horseman reveal finished, maybe the filmmakers can wow us with the next inevitable movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Deception but to entertain, as one guy in the movie indicated.The greatest question though, is that if the mentalist is so amazing, why does he not simply use mass hypnosis on everyone?

You find yourself waiting for information that never comes. Questions are posed that leave you wondering why something happened, but then they're just abandoned and never reexamined.

Their first show at Las Vegas as The Hourseman when they rob a bank is really interesting to see and I thought this movie would be promising, complicated and mind blowing. But unfortunately after that scene, this movie becomes slow and tries to be smart for audience which is actually not. I found myself bored and exhausted watching half of the movie. There are many questions to this movie that has no answer to be explained. The trick itself is kind of impossible and not makes any sense that only could happen in a movie. In other words, audience is forced to accept that the concept of the movie is brilliant. The chemistry between characters here are also poor development, chemistry is one of the most important aspect if people want to create this kind of movie. It's too shamed, they have so many talented casts here that should be exploited. Compared with what ""Ocean's Trilogy"" had done about their casts, ""Now You See Me"" not even close with that. Overall, ""Now You See Me"" is an enjoyable movie to see and quite fun.

You will not leave the theater being disappointed. This film does not disappoint. The true magic is its ability to capture your attention. It engages you in the story whether it is outlandish or not, that is the thrill of the film. I was let down by the lack of character development overall. It was evident throughout the movie, and the audience never gets a true look into the protagonists' personalities, which could be argued 'adds to the elusiveness of the magicians' but it was definitely lacking in that department. This is partly due to the writing. The writing could have been better, but then again no writing is perfect. However, the film was a solid 8 overall for me. It delivered a perplexing plot of a chaotic and mystical game of cat and mouse. It did not fail to induce good laughter. The overall story inspired thought in the audience, and the resolution was closed well, yet still left room for interpretation which I enjoy. Believable? Hardly, but is magic believable?

Although CGI was noticeable it didn't take anything from the scenes. They ventured into their imaginations formulating these types of tricks that were well presented. Obviously they weren't really done to a realistic tone, but the scenes made you feel like you should believe.The character development lacked heavily, giving the magic tricks on screen more character than the characters themselves. You're introduced to an array of characters immediately with them all impersonating a certain cliched stereotype, leaving the audience to decide the rest.Timing was an element that could have been worked on a bit more, with lines and certain parts of speech being overlapped by others saying their lines, with the main contributor being the incessant overacting of the few actors.Mark Ruffalo does a brilliant job expressing his character, making the audience take in every breath and every bit of frustration he lets out.Overall the movie was promising, and did deliver up until the end.

I am also a magician. One said to me that he expected the whole movie to have actual magic tricks. If that was the case go to a theater magician production. THIS IS A MOVIE. Everything that was done was based on actual magic tricks and could have been done with real effects but a lot was done with editing or CGI. This was done because the amount of time that all the actor/actresses would have had to put in to be able to pull off the effects would have been almost a year. No one has that amount of time to put in for a single movie. I enjoyed the movie a great deal. I thought the writing was tight, the acting good, I have two problems with the movie. One the editing, the fight scenes are editing so badly you cannot understand what is going on. Either the editor or director wasn't comfortable with themselves and elected to go with fast editing which ruined that part of the movie and actually pulled me out and I had to push my way back into the movie. Second, everything was resolved","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Isla Fischer appearing in a crowd instead of being eaten alive by piranhas...Then... holes began to appear. By the middle of the film, i knew who the employer of the Four Horsemen was. And i am not a magician either... it became quite predictable. All in all, i still enjoyed. The end really popped the balloon and deflated the hype. Simpler would have been better.

Which is why I was particularly excited to go see ""Now You See Me"". However, I am somewhat superstitious when it comes to watching movies in theatres, every time during a movie when someone leans over and whispers to me something like ""this is actually pretty good"", my expectations start to dip, and with that they are met. It's almost a self fulfilling prophecy I think a film is about to head down hill and it does.""Now You See Me"", is a perfect analogy for Common's film career, as well as his starring role in the movie. The scenes that lead the audience through the first two acts of this movie are all very enjoyable. The action is of course fun to watch and well staged, and the characters, though all mostly one dimensional are played by good looking (the women anyway) and very charismatic actors, and the film has many funny moments. I felt duped though as the magicians themselves are pretty much sidelined, and the majority of the screen time is given to Mark Ruffalo. It's the Ruffalo show! His romantic sub-plot with Melanie Laurent really doesn't go too far or is that compelling, which is ridiculous. Because it seems Mark Ruffalo phones it in here, yet how can you not fall in love with Melanie Laurent? (shown below) In short on that matter, I'll just say its not on the ""13 Going On 30"" level of romantic tension.Oooh stop it! Melanie Laurent you are too cute! The Director can't quite pull all the threads in this film together. The whole film hypes up its ending as something to amaze, but it seems to lack any meaningful resolution or conclusion in my opinion. I mean it all comes together, just not with much sense A lot of it just kind of happens, entertaining but meaningless. As the credits suddenly rolled I was left disappointed and bewildered knowing the marketing team got the slight of hand on me. Overall Scale: +1","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nonsensical ""magic trick"" after nonsensical ""magic trick"" goes completely unexplained, and save for one minor trick near the start of the movie, the explanations behind those few for which explanations are attempted become more and more nonsensical. Few films ask you to suspend disbelief to this degree, and the rare few which do are universally terrible.There is a great cast in this movie, and although the CGI is often mediocre, the cinematography is of the standard you'd expect from a mainstream Hollywood film. And yet, all is wasted because of a plot with gaping holes in it, the size of the Holland Tunnel. No attempt is made to fill them in, either. You watch scene after scene, asking yourself why you're even continuing, and hoping above hope that all will resolve itself in the end.It doesn't. The ending is even more childish and ham-fisted than the rest of the movie. Now You See Me is a staggering disappointment, and it all comes down to one of the weakest scripts in recent memory.What a shame.","15 out of 21 found this helpful.

They give away the money to the audience, making them an overnight sensation. It also thrilled me to see it, as it is refreshing to see a heist in Robin Hood style! All the magic involved in the heists is explained, with credible explanations as to how they did a seemingly impossible thing. I like this a lot, as it is easy for a film to fall victim to movie logic, i.e. it's magic and therefore it can be ridiculous and non-sensible. The constant cat and mouse game is thrilling, and the end gets even better. When a group of people seem to be two steps ahead of the game, they are in fact three steps behind. Nothing is as it appears, echoing the theme of magic.""Now You See Me"" is a visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza.

In such shows, the magician is the main character and the assistant distracts the audience. Here 'the magic' is the main character and it is the qualities of magic that are developed throughout the movie. The 'human characters' are the stage dressing - the 'attractive assistant', for the magic.Viewed in this way, the plot is not scattered but flows from one aspect of magic to another throughout the movie and does not lack substance.The tag line in the movie says it all - the closer you look, the less you see.My conclusion - good entertainment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think that it tried too hard to be clever, and I clearly didn't 'get it'There is nothing wrong with the cast, I like them all and there's no one I would single out as having an 'off day' or providing a poor performance. There are many twists and turns in the script, which I would normally approve of but I'm not sure that the lack of a story is the problem. The main story is unnecessarily convoluted with a condescending need to re-cap events and explain how you were misdirected the first time you saw this. When the director keeps showing me something and then saying that wasn't what happened it doesn't take long for me to stop caring about what just happened. The result is a film that's much too long and takes far too long to get to the point so that when the final twist did happen I just didn't care anymore.I was intrigued by the great trailer for this film, but it over-sells the actual film which was very disappointing.","129 out of 229 found this helpful.

People who were just looking for pure action and thrill have really enjoyed this movie but those who wanted more said the plot is lacking and there was really no development in the movie. I didn't even know where the climax was. It has aerial shots that was used in big budgeted movies and you can see the modernity of the visuals used. Some parts were really corny like Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent's love affair and the time Isla Fisher went inside a big bubble and just levitated.

In spite of that, Louis Leterriermanaged to direct an alert movie which amazes with every scene.The script isn't that abundant in originality, borrowing sketches from another genre films. Even if it's exaggerated in some points, it still manages to remain plausible until the very end.Full review here:http://cinefilul007.blogspot.ro/p/blog-page_15.html","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

French director ""Louis Leterrier"" Attempted to replicate the same feat on film but unfortunately failed to reach the heights of even a decent Las Vegas show. Most of the magic/illusions and tricks were no great surprise and were fairly predictable. Although Disappointing in this area, the movie was actually very entertaining. Jesse Eissenberg has proved that he is no ""flash in the pan"" and really shone in this movie proving that he can handle a sizable role. Isla Fisher was as gorgeous as ever but with no real meat to her character she was there more for the aesthetics. Melanie Laurent, a relative newcomer to American audiences really caught the eye and could be one to watch for the future. With thematic elements including robbery, deception,and car chases coupled with an energetic cast, it was a nice distraction from the reality of every day life.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well I'm not sure what the tagline is getting at, other than a possibly general warning about magicians. The plot is a lot of smoke and mirrors, rather like the tricks the magicians play, and apart from the major twist near the end, is confusing. It was all rather like ""Ocean's Eleven"" but with a weaker cast. Having said that, the script was pretty good and the actors carried it off very well, Woody Harrelson probably being the best of them. Jesse Eisenberg brought the same smug confidence he brought to ""The Social Network,"" Morgan Freeman was excellent, as ever, but Michael Caine was underused. The tricks themselves were impressive, until you remember that Hollywood can do anything with special effects anyway. There looks as though there may be a sequel, but I'm not sure I will bother with it. ""Now You See Me,"" won't trouble the Academy when they dole out the Oscars, but it's worth an evening of your time if you are at a loose end.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The magic in Now You See Me was lost on me because it is too outrageous, too unbelievable, as opposed to being clever. The combination of magic and heist in this film fails because magic is about fantasy and ludicrousness. Heist is about reality- about careful planning and coordination. Many of the films revelations(which are inevitably the most satisfying part of any such film) may not be entirely predictable, but are still anticlimactic because the qualities of a good heist are absent- the stunts pulled here are too ridiculous and too fantastical for the audience to suspend their disbelief. While the cast is strong and does have individual flavour, the Mark Ruffalo and Marie Laurent characters are really not written well. They are given stock characters to portray, and the ending is quite unforgivable. This is a shame because the first portion of the film was actually quite entertaining- it proves that when a heist film has a witty script, a suave, assured sense of direction, and a clear focus on its protagonists(rather than some outside FBI agent), it can really succeed quite well. But of course the rest of the film never quite lives up to this quality in the first portion, which made for a terribly overall average film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed watching 'Now You See Me'. Amidst the mindless violent crap and the overdose of special effects that Hollywood usually produces (I admit, perhaps I'm a bit prejudiced) this film stands out. It's a fast-paced, well-acted and original film that doesn't give you a chance to get bored. Of course, It's light-hearted entertainment and nothing more, and in some scenes the Hollywood predictability gets the upper hand. The car chase is a tired cliché, and the developing romance between two detectives is out of place in this film. I would also have appreciated a less cheesy ending. On the other hand, the start of the film is wonderful. In four short, fast scenes, the leads are introduced. Each of them is a magician and we see them performing their tricks. It's exciting, it's funny and it's spectacular. The scene introducing Woody Harrelson is the best: he is great as a mentalist who can blackmail his adulterous victim in a few seconds, while his wife is standing by. The film is essentially a traditional heist movie (think: Ocean's Eleven, Reservoir Dogs, The Italian Job) with a bunch of specialists who come together for a huge bank robbery. Only this time, the specialists are not professional bank robbers, but magicians, who call themselves The Four Horsemen. And they rob the bank while performing their show in Las Vegas. This original concept is worked out very well. The tag line 'The closer you look, the less you see' is not just a phrase, but serves in fact as the main theme throughout the film, even up to the last surprising twist. I was also pleasantly surprised by the soundtrack. For a change, it is not full of rock songs or spectacular sound effects, but has a nice, catchy orchestral theme that is being played during the magic shows of The Four Horsemen. A little detail I didn't like is the title. It's bland, forgettable and not related to the theme. Why not 'The Four Horsemen', or 'The Eye'. Something more intriguing would have fitted the theme of illusion versus reality.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is not a whole lot else to this, though, other than those two things. I do believe this film has substance, but not too much. It is mostly just an entertaining crime thriller with some comedy and romance mixed into the equation, which spells out 'fun' for me.I like this movie, but it is not the best. Sometimes, the movie felt somewhat contrived, trying to be really smart and unique, when it really does things that have been done hundreds of times before. Now, this movie does it all fairly well, but like I said, it feels a tad bit forced sometimes. The ending had a huge twist which I sort of saw coming, because as I have said, it has been done before. It could have been done a little better, I must say. Also, I do think the film might have been more interesting had it been a more science-fantasy-like film, although that is just my opinion. The film presents an interesting concept, but the twist ending tramples on that concept a bit. Maybe I set my expectations a little too high, but whatever the case is, it is a fine flick that is great for watching with family or friends.""Now You See Me"" has a great cast, consisting of mainly big-name actors and actresses. I enjoyed their acting very much. Plus, the film's special effects were superbly done, and some of the more action-like moments were very thrilling and kept you close to the screen, wanting to see what happens next. That is saying a whole bunch, considering I am not even a fan of action at all.Maybe a second viewing will change my perspective of this film, but for now, it is a solid 7 out of 10.

"","","Magical Fun and Clever Schemes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2806729/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2013","Abra Kadabra my friends, and like magic another weekend is upon us and another round of movies. This week I start my reviews off with a Crime/Thriller that chooses to use stage performance, illusion, and trickery to pull off the heist. That's right I'm reviewing Now You See Me, a movie that promises to be magical, just not Lord of the Rings magical. So put away your wands and spell books, and get out your deck of cards as I give my two cents on this movie.Let's get right into some of my likes for. First thing has to be the clever plot/execution of this movie. Now we have seen plenty of crime movies over the last decade that use the same stale plot of a highly skilled team pulling of an impossible task of bringing a corrupt man to justice. Now you see me takes that stale plot and reconstructs into something that seems fresh and new. Instead of an elite band of mercenaries, we have four misfits who practice different tricks of the magic trade. They are pulled together by some mastermind who opens the door with a rather shady invite and a year later the adventure starts as the Four Horsemen are forged. Cue the Vegas scene, made famous in the trailer, where the audience, both fiction and real, are dazzled by an elaborate show where the eyes are fooled by the sleight of hand. Only rather than making a simple toy appear, the result is money robbed from a city bank miles away. This allows me to transition into another aspect of the movie, the design of the tricks. In this film, many things were planned out, every detail intricately laced into an adventure that is both intense and impressive. While there are some classic magic tricks done, pick a card and making rabbits disappear, there are some other acts that have more complexity to it. Although these CGI heavy stunts are a bit fake and far-fetched they still were creative enough to wow me. Even more impressive to this reviewer, was the fact that the tricks were linked to the master plan, many specifically chosen for a purpose other than entertainment, cleverness at its finest.Another trend you might notice in other crime movies, is that nine times out of ten the police force are either ignorant or idiots. Well good news, they still are, but this time there is a little more ingenuity to some of their force. Led by Mark Ruffalo, the police actually learn a little from their mistakes and with a little guidance from an outside source, attempted to change their strategy. Ruffalo and company not only bring on the opposing force to the Horsemen, but also provide an opening for other characters to enter into the movie, often to explain how the tricks work. You heard me right, the magicians' secrets are revealed in this movie, but done so to help tie together the loose ends left behind after the excitement has passed. How could this explanation get any better? Simple bring on Morgan Freeman, an actor whose voice and talent bring the retired magician bent on deciphering secrets to life. Like many of his roles, this character has humor, wits, and a little input into helping with some of the shallow character development. With this in mind, if you don't want to find out how the connections fit you need to either leave the theater at points in the movie, or avoid seeing it altogether. Bottom line the movie is connected and all the characters are involved in some form or manner. So with a bunch of characters you may wonder how the acting is in this movie. In a nutshell most of the actors are playing the same roles we've seen in other films. Jesse Eisenberg still plays the arrogant jerk, who is incredibly clever and gifted, and insults everyone else. For some reason though, I do like his character in this movie, as the attitude goes with the theme of the movie. Isla Fisher is still bubbly, but this time she isn't some shallow air head who only cares about sex and shopping. Ruffalo does a good job as well, acting as an integral cog for most of the movie. Similar to what we saw in Avengers, Ruffalo has quirky one liners, a smart ass attitude, but still retains a serious demeanor that rounds the character out. My favorite actor of the night though is Woody Harrelson, who has all the qualities from the Hunger games, minus the drinking and add some running. Overall there are really no surprises when it comes to acting, I enjoyed all of them and I am sure you will find someone to latch onto in this movie. This movie is definitely a fun summer movie with creativity bursting at every seam. Yes the plot is fairly predictable, and I do agree the plot is a bit old. Yet this movie has many good things about it that makes it worthy of taking a trip to the theater. It is exciting, with a plethora of chase scenes and fight scenes to keep the pace going. Although some of the mystery is ruined by Freeman's deductive reasoning, there are still some underlying secrets that keep you intrigued into the movie, like who the mastermind is and what are the motives for pulling off the pranks. Yes there is a bit of cheesiness in the plot, and some of the stunts they pull are again a bit far-fetched that some people may roll their eyes, but for those who like a lot of imagination and clever execution, this movie is for you. So what do I give this movie? My scores are Crime/Thriller 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Though it's entertaining throughout, and has two actors from the Nolan franchise (Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman), don't compare it to Nolan's masterpiece in the magic realm, 'The Prestige'.The whole cast is incredible, and play characters different from their previous roles, but the characters lack depth and texture.

The entire cast is excellent, and their acting is just brilliant. To play the roles of magicians, I think, is not an easy thing to do. However, the main characters played their parts in perfect ways that when I watched this movie years ago, I was convinced that they all were true magicians and that magic is real. This movie is a mix of talent, hard work, and passion. Because without that mix we would not have this type of a great movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But, hey, even the movie itself says 'come in close, because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you'. And that's what happened, I saw the trailers and thought I will be seeing an intelligent crime/thriller movie; and I was fooled. Instead I got a boring, fairly mindless movie with some, clearly, needlessly long action scenes.Let me start of with the plot first. So, what is Now You See Me about? I could say that Now You See Me is a movie about 4 magicians called the 4 horsemen - consisting of J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) whose magic acts are a front for robberies, and try to escape an FBI agent who is after them. I could also say that Now You See Me is about an FBI agent named Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who, aided by an Interpol agent named Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), is trying to catch these magicians. I could even go as far as to say the movie is about an ex-magician named Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who tries to expose these 4 magicians and make money off of it. Furthermore, there is Michael Caine somewhere in the equation.I really applaud the movie for assembling such a great cast (maybe the best cast I've seen in a while), however Now You See Me's greatest merit is its greatest flaw. There are just too many characters in the movie, and none of them get enough screen time. Moreover, there are too many subplots, and the movie constantly changes its focus. Who are we, the audience, supposed to root for? For the magicians to succeed in their plans? For the agents to catch the magicians? For Morgan Freeman to reveal the magicians? As a result of these rapid focus changes and the undeveloped characters I completely lost my interest for the movie half way through. Which is a shame, since the majority of the cast are wonderful actors who could have shined in their roles - had they only had something to work with. Eisenberg and Harrelson have no chemistry whatsoever nor do they share much screen time, in spite of the superb chemistry they showed in Zombieland. The only pair that's worse than them are Laurent and Ruffalo, who are awkwardly forced into a romantic subplot.Of course, if you don't care about the characters and just want to see some pretty good scenes with amazing magic tricks (which were the best part of the movie), a somewhat decent and original story and obligatory car chase scenes, knock yourself out! Your money will be definitely well spent if you're not looking for anything more than a forgetfully fun movie. As for myself, I think the movie's title - Now You See Me - is pretty fitting. This is, hopefully, the only time I'm seeing this movie and never again. Since I don't want to get fooled again.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Maybe the editing had to do with it sucking big time. Other than this, Now You See Me is a shocker!Why? Because it has twists, turns, chase sequences, betrayals & most importantly, revenge juxtaposed into its screenplay. The story is nothing to boast about, but the plot definitely cracks a punch. Writing is fresh, like I said.About the staleness, performances are tad cringe-worthy. Mark Ruffalo & Jesse Eisenberg are what I'm talking about. Maybe it had to with their characters; that is the point - lots of maybes here! So, 7.3 out of 10 for this surprising attempt by the guy who gave us the Transporter series.Music is gold, cinematography is silver while CGI & VFX are platinum.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended to people who love caper stories, with Hollywood smeared onto it.

How established stars like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (who usually appear in good films) were persuaded to take part in this rubbish is beyond me (although Ben Kingsley was recently in a worse one, so they are not the only offenders).

The whodunnit's appeal came from the use of ""magic"" tricks and it also was generous with action, making for a truly exciting movie. I was thrilled through the entire film.The characters were each sharp and specialized in their own tricks. Eisenberg was, of course, given a snarky, arrogant personality with witty lines and the magic tricks to back it up. I felt that Ruffalo was taking to much time away from the amazing magicians, but he also did a good job. The only downside is that Dave Franco had almost no speaking lines and little screen time. All in all, the film was excellent and full of FUN.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Needless to say I've already read some of the hate posts here on IMDb, and while on a reasonable note, these complaints don't actually resonate with me, as I found the movie to be great and exciting, despite its flaws. The basic premise is that a group of former solo magic performers, team up at the request of a mysterious figure, and end up robbing banks during their performances as The Four Horseman. This action quickly gathers the attention of the FBI who assign an agent who, along with an Interpol detective will try to decipher the ultimate trick. As was said, the plot execution is borderline insane and one can see the problem some of the viewers had with the film. Also the four main characters seem to act merely as plot devices and lack any real development. As far as my view is concerned on these points, my conclusion is that it doesn't really matter to me, since I watched this movie to have a little fun and to enjoy being tricked, as is the case here. As much as I enjoy a well crafted movie, Now You See Me is a perfect example of a movie that has worrying flaws, yet achieves what I wanted from it, and that is top notch entertainment. And I'm 100 fine with it.Rating 9/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now You See Me is filled with great distractions that attempt to hide obvious flaws within the plot and characters. However, the big twist (which is to be expected in a film centered around magic) is a good enough final act to make the film superficially entertaining and enjoyable.The film has a wide variety of cast members, including Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. In the film, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine's characters are portrayed negatively, which is a bit off seeing these old gents play personas that are far from their usual, likable statures. However, Morgan Freeman still gets his scenes of explaining exactly what is going on at the moment. The four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco) aren't very interesting as characters, mainly because they aren't given the chance. The film jumps back and forth between the escaping artists and the FBI, Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent), that it becomes confusing as to who the main protagonists are. The way the film is put together limits character development, which is why even by the end of the film I found myself not caring about the magicians whatsoever. Their over-the-top personalities are smart distractions for the lack of character development.Story wise, the film is pretty much one big setup for the final plot twist. The viewer isn't told exactly what the motivations are for the magicians to continuously break the law. Therefore, it becomes slightly confusing as to why the magicians would abandon their successful lives in Las Vegas to become fugitives. The act of leaving their elegant lives goes directly against their personalities - street performers (who obviously love the attention) finally get their own Las Vegas show only to throw it all away. It seems as though even the magicians themselves lack information as to what the end goal holds for them. Perhaps if the viewer is shown that the magicians care more about being the best illusionists rather than having an endless amount of cash, their conflict throughout the film would be a bit more believable. Showing them to be con artists and thieves in the beginning of the film (both which have the end goal of making easy money) doesn't really help the story. But, the twists are elaborate enough to distract from the holes in the plot.The chemistry between Dylan and Alma, along with the action and chase scenes, round out the film for a wide range of audience members. While the film isn't focused on action, the chase scene of Dave Franco's character running from Dylan has interesting choreography and a good amount of suspense. Other similar scenes demonstrate that the film looks great visually. However, the CGI makes some of the illusions look fictitious, even though the film does not cross over into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi like The Prestige. In addition, a number of scenes are filled with real life impossibilities. It is important to note that Now You See Me can be best enjoyed by following the big picture rather than paying too close attention to the plot and character development. Ironically, the closer you look, the less there really is to see.So in a way, the film with a budget of $75 million is a $10 distraction for people who want to have a fun time with magic. Sure the plot and some of the characters are trivial, but that doesn't mean that the film can't be entertaining - and it is. And that's what really matters.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

My attention was immediately captured by the film's energetic intro which will not lose you through the entire movie. This isn't a type of flick where you really need to turn off your brain, at times it has mildly ingenious tricks which will easily please you. The main thing this film exceeds at is the way it keeps the audience guessing the conclusion/twists, it will work your brain actually tricking you in the process. The movie takes advantage of Eisenberg's usual ""smart-ass"" character, Woody Harrelson also shines, raking in most of the laughs. It truly is magical, in it's twists and action sequences. This is really like a 2 hour Las Vegas show without the Las Vegas cost.

This was tremendous fun from the beginning more or less until the end (more on that later). We meet our four magical heroes in montage fashion that recalls Ocean's 11: each is shown working their own routines and then receiving a tarot card telling them to meet at a specific place and time. A year or so later, they have a magical act together in Las Vegas under the name The Four Horsemen, where they tell the crowd that they will rob a bank live on stage. They then – supposedly – teleport a French banker to his Parisian bank to steal thousands in Euros and leave a calling card, the money is then rained down upon the crowd. Later shows in New Orleans and New York follow the same format. In New Orleans, we see that their act is a kind of Robin Hood gesture, as money is stolen from an insurance magnate and redistributed to foreclosure victims.Morgan Freeman stars as a former magician who now makes a living debunking magic acts and trying to figure out the gang's method; and Mark Ruffalo is the federal agent attempting the catch the Four Horseman committing a robbery. The main cast – Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco – are wonderfully charming. There are a few one liners that fall with a thud, and a couple plot points that might have been better developed, but the movie is a breezy ride most of the way through. Dave Franco, as always, should get more screen time.The central mystery to this plot is who is pulling the strings; who summoned the Four Horsemen to their meeting and organized each of the heists? The answer, when we receive it, is a bit unfair and leaves many open questions. The more you examine the questions, the less they make sense; though repeat viewings may disprove me. This isn't a Sixth Sense kind of ending where you should have seen it coming all along; it's more of a Murder of Roger Ackroyd solution where the perp wasn't even really a suspect.I think that many people will feel cheated by the ending. Still, this movie was an hour and 50 minutes and I thought some more development and additional scenes could have been included. When I want a movie to stretch longer, it's definitely working for me.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Luckily, it's one of those movies that do not lose their appeal that fast, and then it's summer time, so the right time for fun and entertaining films. The only detail that seems overcome by time in this film is the usage of phones phones with geo-positioning systems.As smartphones took over the market, and applications as Google Maps became ubiquitous, the cops using keyboard based not-so-smart mobile phones seems to have happened twenty and not four years back. It's kind of a lesson for film-makers which may find more and more difficult coping with the pace of progress of our smart gadgets. Maybe the sequel avoids this mistake.'Now You See Me' combines two genres - the big robbery and the magicians movies, with more emphasize on the later. 'The closer you look, the less you see' is the key saying of the film which tells the story of four magicians with different specializations brought together in a team that combines huge magician shows a la David Copperfield with bank robberies. They are supported by a finance tycoon (Michael Caine), followed by a former magician (Morgan Freeman) whose pastime is exposing on TV the tricks and frauds of magicians, and have of course all the FBI and Interpol on their tracks. The roles of manipulators and manipulated, suspects and innocents change all the time, and as in a good magic show we are never sure what we exactly see on screen.The story may have a few holes that cannot be filled even by magic, but the convention works well, and is well supported by the actors. Watching Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine is always a delight in this kind of roles that they enjoy playing in this epoch of their careers. The rest of the team does a good job as well, with special mentions for Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. 'Now You See Me' is a film to enjoy, like a good show with magicians.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There's nothing clever or even very fun on display in this movie. You spend 95% of the film wondering why an actor as great as Mark Ruffalo agreed to play the dumbest cop/federal agent ever put to film. When you get the answer, it validates the film's own shallow stupidity. What a waste of a great cast. Morgan Freeman is useless and absolutely wasted in this effort as is Woody Harrelson. None of the Four Horsemen magicians are fleshed out at all and the narrative shifts suddenly between Ruffalo's character and brief peeks in to the actions of the four magicians. It just doesn't work at all as a compelling story.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I'll confess a slight aversion to the work of Mr. Eisenberg, who inexplicably annoys me. The movie also stars Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman in supporting roles.My reviews will never give away significant plot twists or spoilers but you might want to know what the movie is actually about.Four moderately successful (depending on your measure) street magicians are summoned by an unknown party for initiation into ""The Eye"". ""The Eye"" is an ancient secret society of magicians who ""protect real magic from those who would use it to rob, steal""....vote the wrong way...etc. In order to be accepted, you must follow instructions with blind obedience and be a pretty talented illusionist. The rest of the plot centers around a series of high profile robberies and pursuit of the magicians by the FBI and a professional ""de-bunker"" of magic (Freeman).Where the film works: A very talented cast. James Franco's younger brother Dave does very well. Harrelson is great and ended up with most of the movies funniest lines. As the group's ""mentalist""/hypnotist, he is also arguably the most dangerous. Caine & Freeman could bring complexity and depth to reading ads for the 64th street Hy-vee meat counter, so you know they are always solid. Obviously the movie is going to contain some wild and exciting stunts that stretch the SOD (suspension of disbelief), but they play well. Where the film let me down a little: Since ""you've gotta put a girl in it"", Mélanie Laurent, is cast as a French Interpol agent. She is sent to America to work with the FBI. Ruffalo plays the FBI agent, but his performance is lacking in depth. ((Hmmmmmmm .... man.....woman.......I wonder what is gonna happen with that.....)) Honestly, what I disliked the most was that I was expected to root for criminals. Not a new plot line, but I didn't particularly find the justification for larceny that compelling and a number of hi-jinks they pulled in order to escape capture (in the real world) could have easily led to the harm of hundreds of innocent people. The ""sexual content"" referenced in the MPAA rating relates to a couple of brief non-explicit comments. There is profanity/vulgarity and a couple of fight scenes (very well choreographed, I must admit)My wife only said ""Come on.....(side eye)"" a handful of times, so it isn't entirely preposterous. My rating : 6.5 out of 10 (a little better than average, but just ""ok"")","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The more you roll, the more you will have! Here's one movie that is a sphere in its own entity – 'Now I can see you'! It didn't entice a title, does it as a movie?The movie teasers let the plot out! So it's all the more fun to see how the script has been executed. Magicians turn infidels! That's the only thing we can leak out. How they use their talents is what is enticing! Looked like an old story to us but there's something new in here! Director Louis Leterrier, where have you heard that name before? Transporter series of course! His work seemed like an 'Oceans 11' extension but it is only a mere comparison because both the movies deal with heists. The director hasn't tried too hard. He's kept things simple and scripted quite a decent movie. Technically sound, the movie does have its share of flaws and importantly blank spaces in the plot itself. That's because the director has chosen to get the characters called 'The Four Horsemen' to do the talking rather than the plot by itself. When you see bad, there's always a good bloke who wants to end the menace. Mark Rufallo as the cop has his FBI shoes on and tries his best! Let's talk about the pace of the movie. May be the first 60 minutes were like a Japanese magnetic train and then the following time frame till the end seemed like a tad tiring disclosure of facts. Should the screenplay be a little faster, the movie would have been even more engrossing to watch. Seasoned actor Morgan Freeman gets his bunch of dialogues, at a very nagging time of the movie, making it all the more tiring for the viewer. Explanations for most unanswered questions were answered towards the climax. It seemed like, 'a few questions, don't have answers'! Finally an element of suspense that we wouldn't want to leak here doesn't quite go with the audience because the entire premise of the movie is not convincingly explained. Let's give the errors a pass, the almost convincing robbing techniques, highly imaginative modern day illusion depiction and not to forget the characterizations of each of the individual street magicians, this movie has every reason to be a time spending investment!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Nolan-esque spectacle. Illusion, crime & superb cast.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2836538/?ref_=tt_urv","TheSquiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34414709/?ref_=tt_urv","22 July 2013","Some people spend the duration of magic shows trying to spot the sleight of hand, to work out how the magician fools the rest of the audience; others sit back and allow themselves to be amazed by the illusions; a few convince themselves from the outset that all magic is genuine, that they are in the presence of a miracle worker and the naysayers be damned. Audiences will inevitably approach Now You See Me in much the same fashion, and that will have some bearing on how much they enjoy it.Take heed: don't think; just roll with it.Four magicians each receive a mysterious tarot card invitation to an address that holds secrets and a challenge. The reward is membership of the exclusive, perhaps mythical, magic circle known as The Eye. A year later, rebranded as The Four Horseman, they perform a spectacular sell-out show in Las Vegas that culminates with an apparent bank robbery and redistributing the cash to their audience. Is it magic or just a remarkable illusion? FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) regards it as nothing more than an elaborate crime and launches an aggressive hunt for the truth to expose and capture the Four Horsemen.Though Now You See Me lacks the drama of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, it's a thrilling romp that begs to be seen at least twice; once for the spectacle, twice for clearer understanding. It's no mindbender, like Inception, but is a thoroughly enjoyable romp that will keep some people guessing. The biggest surprise is that it comes from Louis Leterrier, the director of clunking bombs The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans. Who'd have thought? Take the bling and blast of David Copperfield (who is credited as the inspiration), give it a screenplay with some criminal zing and what would once have been known as an all-star cast and that's pretty much Now You See Me. Dave younger-brother-of-James Franco holds his own as street illusionist Jack Wilder against the 'above the title' star power of Woody Harrelson (Merritt McKinney), Jesse Eisenberg (J. Daniel Atlas) and Isla Fisher (Henley Reeves) as the Four Horsemen. There's very little in the way of character development but this isn't that kind of film. This is a movie where the stars play second fiddle to the spectacle and the quips, snaps and asides to each other are seasoning to the visual feast.Now You See Me feels like a Nolan film (though he appears not to have been involved) in tone, character and casting choices, not least of all for the double act of Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler, multi-millionaire financier of The Four Horsemen, and Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, the debunker of all things illusory. But it never feels like a rip-off because of it, more a case of beneficial influence.It's difficult to pick out a performance that overshadows all others here because Now You See Me is a superb ensemble piece that deserves to be seen for the grand scale. I'm not claiming it's a modern classic, nor that it will feature in the top ten at the end of the year, but like last year's Chronicle it's stomping good fun and a flick worth having on the hard drive for one of those evenings that require a beer, feet up and a small amount of thought without the need for pure reality.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you..."" Not only do the distributors of Now You See Me use this piece of gripping dialogue as the tagline for the film, but exhibitors will also utilise it to trick international audiences into delving into their pockets and wasting their time with this enormously disappointing and unexciting caper film. Now You See Me follows the story of four magicians, known as The Four Horsemen, as they captivate the world with 'magical', near inexplicable bank heists before rewarding their audiences and supporters with the money they take. The only trickery happening here is being hypnotised by the highly intriguing trailer, only to find you yourself have been robbed as you sit in disbelief that you paid to see a film that is about as unique and intricate as a card game of snap!Despite the sensational ensemble of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, they fail to assemble accordingly. They all deliver satisfactory performances but are not given the opportunity to flourish as we may have seen them do so in past roles. This is primarily due to the fact that director Louis Leterrier, along with the writers, attempt to pull too many rabbits out of the hat at one time and so rather than enjoy one bunny at a time, we instead see a ton of terrific actors be undervalued and restricted in showcasing their talents. Most oddly, The Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Fischer, Harrelson and Franco) are even given surprisingly little screen time after their thirty minute introduction as the film begins.In all fairness, Now You See Me does remain consistent. Consistently unintriguing that is. The film's aforementioned tagline, along with unsubtle hints scattered dubiously throughout regarding the illusionary concept of misdirection, completely ruin any surprise and twist that the 'suspense' film has to offer. By doing this the film leaves little to be unveiled during the climax, one would think, though time is actually wasted explaining all of the plot points you already guessed, while conjuring up new components to the story that remain unresolved and/or illogically explained to the extent that even in a film about magic/illusions, you fail to believe any of the tricks being performed. The illusion of cinema fails as much as the illusion of magic fails to prevail in Now You See Me.Now You See Me is comparable to the student who believes they are the cool fresher on campus, the funniest, with a unique personality, and a mistaken sense of self-intelligence that causes them to continue to contribute to seminars despite the fact they never answer anything correctly. No, in fact, Now You See Me needs to be told by its peers (let's say that's us) that it is not nearly as intellectually gifted, cool, witty or exceptional as it pretends to be. You most certainly will not miss out on anything if you chose not to befriend this dull, generic and embarrassingly misleading film, that is posing as an intricate and sophisticated figure on the surface.When the first thought on my mind after exiting my cinema seat after Now You See Me was ""I actually wish the film had been sold out so I could have returned home to watch The Prestige (2006) or see Man of Steel (2013) again"", it pretty much encapsulates my attitude towards the disappointing Leterrier film. While there is nothing necessarily evident to hate in Now You See Me, there is not a single component to commend as great either. Now You See Me is truly a forgettable 115 minute time thief, and though I have Seen it Now, I would have preferred instead to have missed it and been kept under the illusion that it was in fact an intricate tale, rather than a misdirected fail.","178 out of 347 found this helpful.

They meet up. They know each other, at least by reputation, although two have worked together before on magic shows. Together, they create a magic show that takes them to Las Vegas. Here they perform their magic show with a magic act that teleports a member of the audience into a bank vault, then transports the money to the show. Yes!, the bank has really been robbed!, by magic! Enter, the forces of law and order, who then arrest our magicians. The rest of the film is a battle of wits between the magicians and the forces of law and order.The early part of the film has our street magicians working their magic while engaging in fast, and smart, patter. A little irritating, but not half as irritating as the always moving, spinning, and swirling, of the camera. Thankfully, this calms down somewhat after a while. So stick with it in this early phase because viewing will become more comfortable, although the pace does not slacken during the film.There are car-chases, and other chases, fights, magic-fights, funny magic-fights, funny scenes and magic scenes.

No, I'm talking about that convoluted ""twist"" at the end that is completely fake, unrealistic and implausible. Because that particular character has zero reasons for acting the way they did during the entire movie.The times when he was alone with other characters, the rage, the anger, the zeal, the passion, the motivation: none of that should have been there, particularly when he turned his back to other characters, particularly when he was alone. And for that reason, the movie fails.Actually, the writing, the script fails. The movie is highly entertaining! It is fast paced and has a great cast. Mark Ruffalo. What a despicable human being. I'm not sure he can even be called ""human"" but whatever. It's good to know what he is because then I can be aware and not confuse him with his highly likeable characters.Isla Fisher: a completely different character than she does in The Green Scarf. Not ditzy, not vain nor shallow but quite compelling, poised and classy. Funny thing is she is much more elegant here than she ever was in that ""fashionista"" comedy. The characters are alright, all of them except the twisted one. And poor Morgan Freeman! Seems like, try as he might, he can't escape Shawshank! But that's ok because Mark Ruffalo ain't White!Nobody had a problem with pronouns here, which is a plus. I watched this film maybe in 2018 for the first time and today I saw it the 2nd time. Both times caught in the middle. I have no idea how it starts. Anyway, it's very entertaining but ye gotta take stars off for the idiot twist that COMPLETELY RUINS THE MOVIE after you've been entertained by it, and for the idiocy of promoting tossing keys in the Seine, the Paris river.NEWSFLASH: Parisian officials removed the stupid and very unsightly padlocks that weighted the bridge down and had its sides collapsing. And every imbecile who placed a lock there saw their ""love"" get a massive curse which will follow them and progeny for 7 generations down. Because if you defaced such a gorgeous city as Paris, you had it coming. Entertainment value was an 8/10 but removing 3 stars for the aforementioned stupidity.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And though some may find the plot convoluted or characters underdeveloped, I found the movie to be fast paced and entertaining.Synopsis: A team of Magicians who calls themselves The Four Horseman pulls off a series of flashy heists, thereby being chased by the FBI and Interpol. As FBI agent Dylan (Ruffalo) and Interpol officer Dray (Melanie) begin tracking them, they start to suspect that something bigger might be at play behind these flashy heists.Plotwise, I could predict almost all of the twists (movie is full of it), and was even able to circle out the mysterious Fifth Horseman. But I admit the final twist was really cool and unpredictable. Almost all the characters were quite good, but my favorite character from the movie was Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). The one scene where Wilder fights FBI agent Dylan was nothing short of exceptional. My other favorite would be McKinney (Woody Harrelson). His wise-cracking mentalist persona was quite entertaining. The only actor whose talent was under tapped was Michael Caine. His role was too short and could have been easily done by any other actor.The soundtrack of the movie was good and matched seamlessly with the heists. The pace of the movie does get a bit slow towards the end of the movie, but the surprise ending more than makes up for it.This movie is no 'Prestige' or 'Illusionist', but it holds its own. If you are expecting some sort of character development or serious drama, be warned its not that kind of movie. In fact, lack of character development is what keeps the pace of this movie fast. Possibly one of the better heist movies in recent times, it's meant to be enjoyed and not pondered upon.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's another thing... I found the tricks weren't explained that well (especially the last one) and didn't make that much sense. They were all just covered up with loads of glitz and glamour, loud self-satisfied music and random crowds cheering as if that would rub off on the audience.The story is pretty entertaining and unpredictable with some good chases, cop banter, cool magic and romance (although they could and should have progressed with the romance element more). It just lacks depth and was too self-indulgent and clumsy for my liking. Worth a watch but not amazing","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The wonder has been ingrained in us since our childhood. And movies about magic are usually just as enjoyable. This one is no exception. Four individual magicians--each with a different specialty--get summoned by some mysterious master magician to join together and perform ""tricks"" to steal from the rich and give to the poor. Meanwhile, a frustrated FBI agent, played by Mark Ruffalo, can't seem to figure out how it's all happening. He teams up with a female Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) to put a stop to the madness.The dynamics among the magicians are fun and kept very light. The tricks they perform are, at times, very fascinating to the point that we wish we could go to Vegas to watch their show. We become invested in the lives of these people because the writers let us. But then something happens--our focus is forcibly changed.For the last 60-90 minutes we are pretty much solely focused on Ruffalo's character. We don't want to be, but we are. And as we travel deeper into the story, the befuddlement steadily increases. Luckily, the film makes itself fairly easy to focus on to somewhat help negate the convolution. It helps to rewatch this movie. But then again, seeing behind the curtain--which is the ending-- may cause you to feel like you've been manipulated. Realizing the filmmakers trick you into seeing what they want you to. And depending on how much you like magic tricks, you may or may not be happy about it.But see, putting together a movie is different than live magic tricks. Filmmakers can make up their own rules, using cuts and edits to change your perspective--not slight-of-hand--making much of it feel contrived. Personally, I wouldn't say that it bothers me. It just feels too easy here.We do get a good bang four our buck with plenty of subplots. There is one about Morgan Freeman who plays a magic debunker smugly trying to crack these elaborate tricks. He has a rivalry with Michael Caine, who acts as a financier for the magicians' performances. Caine exits about an hour in, but Freeman has much left to accomplish. And amidst all the action, there is an obvious romance building between Ruffalo and Laurent.But all of the story-building amongst the characters only helps to thin them all out in the process. There is little depth. And the depth that's established feels forced.Mind you, none of this changes the fact that this film is wildly entertaining. How can you call it anything but? It's gripping from beginning to end, and the way it's set up, you will probably end up wanting more. Give it huge points for that. Beyond that, though, I can see why people feel slighted.Twizard Rating: 84","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

They're a bit of an odd pairing, since Jess is inexplicably and unbelievably a ladies' man, Woody keeps hitting on Isla even though she doesn't like him, and Dave seems like he's playing dress-up to fit in with the grown-ups. But, they get along for the most part and manage to amuse the movie-going audience. When they rob a bank during their magic show, it puts the FBI and Interpol on their trail. Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent are the agents, and even though she's pretty grungy, he starts falling for her anyway. Add in Morgan Freeman, a man who makes a living out of exposing frauds, and Michael Caine, the owner of the robbed bank, and The Four Horsemen don't have many friends left!If you like quick-witted scripts with lots of twists and turns, this is a great one for you to rent. Yes, I've criticized the casting a bit, but Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt's script is very entertaining. It's fun and flashy, with surprises you'll never see coming. Plus, every little boy who learned card tricks when he was little can get a front row seat to a truly incredible magic show! DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not your friend. There are lots of camera swirls and flashy lights during the magic shows, and it might make you sick.

The final reveal got me a bit off guard as I guess my brain went by the basic Hollywood standards (the foreigner is the ""bad guy"") but nevertheless, 90% predictable down to the actual ""magic tricks"".Especially these magic tricks, however, are the biggest flaw of this movie. If you want to sell ""magic"" as elaborate tricks you should stay away from CGI effects that do not work in real life and/or you should at least try explain these tricks (especially the complex ones) more so if you already have a debunk character in the movie anyways. Otherwhise you have a merger of tricks and CGI-real-magic, that this movie is trying to permanently deny. The tricks that get explained in the movie are your basic stuff that has been known by every schoolchild since ...I don't know the past 100 years? and their use within the movie is soooo predictable, so many MANY ways of using more clever tricks.... and all failed.Writing of characters and dialogues definitely not based on reality, and filled with typical American stereotypes of ""balancing the world"".

The film has some spectacular moments granted, from car chases and explosions to FANTASTIC visual effects, but in turn almost swaps what could have been a very clever storyline for a thinly plotted film that is expected to hang on star quality and humour which usually fail to hold a film. My advice would be to see it for yourself. It's by no means a masterpiece, but will entertain for a while.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This may be mainly due to its incredibly good pacing. Right at the beginning we get to know the 4 magicians with their respective extraordinary talents, each character has a unique quirk and personality. The whole thing happens so crisply that you are immediately captivated by each one. There are no deep character details with information about their past in the foreground but the concentration is on the high art of distraction and illusion in the here and now. All four are embodied by great actors (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher), who are completely convincing and make a smart witty troupe that complement each other wonderfully and harmonize perfectly. As if that weren't enough, the cast is also supplemented with Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Mark Ruffalo as allies or adversaries. So there is nothing else to say than that the entire cast was chosen magnificently and each shines in his role.""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I have ever seen before. The plot is so original, full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. The movie is entertaining like a gigantic Vegas show, with mega beautiful and successful effects.The camera shots and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures that draw you into the magic and make the illusions seem so real. The strengths are the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography and the visual effects. Yes, it's about stage magicians, but movie magic is used to keep the illusion alive, not actual stage theatrics. The soundtrack is also great. It fits each scene very well and maintains a consistent theme and feel throughout the film.I especially love the fast pace, coupled with a plot and action that kept me wide-eyed and interested every step of the way, and that doesn't really unfold until the end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns, it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and provides a great addictive factor.I really liked the idea behind it, being a sort of magician-Robbin Hood. The magician's cousin is the con man, they try to expose them wherever they can. Nowadays con men wear suits and run businesses and banks.The film is full of suspense, action and incredible stunts and you are curious to see the next trick on a larger scale. Very nice also that it is explained how the riders did div. Tricks, so there are no important open questions.Personally, I do not feel at all the desire to look for possible logic errors in such a film, but can fully engage in the illusions and magic and simply enjoy.This movie is a lot of fun and contains a lot of action. It's all about illusion, and of course the premise of illusion is ""you can do anything."" It is actually very cleverly interwoven with enough twists and turns to highlight the distraction techniques used in magic.-------------
Conclusion:
Outstanding - This movie completely enthralled me from the first minute to the last. This is a movie that I can watch multiple times with and always be swept away. It is an absolutely entertaining popcorn action movie full of mystery, drama, action and humor. This film is simply fantastic. A very clear recommendation from my side, this film should not be missed in any case.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's exactly what it's supposed to be; the tag-line ""The closer you look, the less you see"" couldn't be more accurate, and I'm pretty sure the sole point of Hollywood summer fare is to be entertaining. That it is. The Four Horsemen will take you on such a fun ride that you might not notice how terrible the script is.Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco work exceedingly well together as a rag-tag group of magicians. Their individual talents and personal egos are brought together to create magnificent illusions to entertain and please the common folk. They rob banks and rob people but it's okay because some banks are bad and some people are bad and they give the money back to people who unfairly lost it. They're Robin Hood and his Merry Men and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is the Sheriff of Nottingham.The tricks were exciting to watch with a particularly appealing style and choreography. Story-wise, the tricks build in significance, visually the tricks build in cinematic wonder. People like that but eventually you'll get concerned that the film doesn't have anything intelligent to say.Dylan Rhodes was a frustrating character. He worked his way up in the FBI, takes his job seriously and snidely communicates with co-workers (whether they should be there or not). He doesn't care about magic – doesn't believe in it but also doesn't have an interest in how the tricks are actually accomplished. Each step closer to the Four Horsemen and he's pushed two steps back. The frustrating part is that we don't want him to catch them but we do want him to get close because whenever they're on the screen, the film is fun again.Obviously there's a twist, it wouldn't be a heist movie without one, but how unfortunate that is. I wasn't the only one hoping there wasn't a twist which was guaranteed to undo all the fun that came before it. It would have been a much better movie if the entire thing was Harrelson, Eisenberg, Fisher and Franco performing magic for the masses without even an attempt at a story. That would have been written better.As is, ""Now You See Me"" throws in a romance subplot for no good reason, destroys meaningless characters for no good reason and a twist that undoes that glorious good the Four Horsemen accomplished. The Four Horsemen did accomplish a lot. Their personal issues never got in the way, the lack of character development wasn't a problem and they obeyed one of the golden rules of performance art: Have fun and your audience will too.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's hard to pinpoint where the movie hits all the wrong spots but my personal issues were the lack of likable characters, lack of character development, the mediocre plot and the overall execution of the movie. Of course this is my personal opinion but the 4 ""main"" characters in the movie appear to be the 4 horsemen. They are not. The only time you'll really see them is during their show and a few short scenes here and there, the rest of this 2 hour long movie isn't about them. That's first. Second is the fact that I was completely unable to like any one of them. They are arrogant and are just s uninteresting because they have no personality, no sympathizing or deeper moments at all. And the half attempted ""budding romance"" moments feel so out of place and forced, the movie would've been better off without them. But the worst thing is that I can't even properly dislike them as ""persons"" because there are almost no personal moments with them. They're just so uninteresting and cast aside that I couldn't feel anything watching them. There have been a few background story hints/mentions but really, not even close enough to begin character development, which doesn't happen anyways so no loss there I guess.I also didn't like the police guy (whom seems to be the main character according to the screen time he gets) or the woman he works with. What is she doing, especially at her final scene in the movie? What the hell man. Anyway it's ridiculous and not in a funny way, the whole police force and their inability to capture these 4 guys is just painful to watch. It gets old so quickly and painfully predictable that our magicians will pull a trick out of their sleeve to escape. I quickly started rooting for the FBI because I couldn't fine even a small reason to like these guys but the FBI was so damn incompetent it made me want to fast forward thorough the entire movie.Another major point is the plot. Or perhaps lack thereof. Yes you do wonder; ""where does this all lead to"" but really, the ending feels rather a anti-climax and I didn't even care anymore at the end of the series since you can guess what happens. Yes. The plot is so freaking transparent that you can literally guess the ending after watching a third of the movie. Maybe not the entire thing or all the elements but for the bigger part you can. And that's not a very good thing if you ask me. There are also a few plot holes/ridiculous things that really bother me that you can't cover up with ""it's magic"" that make the whole thing even more ridiculous.I don't want to spoil to much and yes, some complaints can be rebuked after watching the whole movie but it's not a good movie. So freaking much wasted potential, flatter than cardboard characters and in the end it's nothing more than a C-rank action movie ""thrilling chase"" that keeps dragging on for over 1.5 hours. To summarize; is it a good, well thought out movie with in depth characters? No way, not at all. Is the movie entertaining? Kind of, it's dragged on for way too long but it's not bad. Should I expect something of this movie? No. Don't. Do not watch the trailer, it's several times better than the actual movie. But the movie is time killing and in the end it's not bad. It's just not that good, not that good at all...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Just not what is expected and seen in the trailers and story line. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong, worth seeing for sure.

Witty comedy The plot is complicated, and there are many turns. But keep the audience guessing all the time and shock you. The acting in the film was incredible that The fast-paced action is not boring and has surprising tricks that we didn't expect. I like that each character has their own unique quirks and personalities. But they all work together very well. The special effects in the film are magical. It's full of rich colors and textures, pulls you into the magic and makes the illusion seem real. The background music is also amazing. It fits well to each scene while keeping the theme and feel consistent throughout the movie.
I love the Four Horsemen 'brilliance that is always two steps ahead of the police. And has dramatic and stunting action scenes The abilities of each person on a team are different.It's a good movie, Overall I give ""Now You See Me"" 8 out of 10 stars.

So 1 ratings seemed out of anger for people who's expectations were poorly metI can't really discuss the plot much, other than to say it's quite twisty. But hardly the incoherent mess some people claim. Heck, I know of a top rated detective movie who's plot makes less sense. If you are looking for a brilliant plot, this is not it, but it's interestingI enjoyed the characters quite a bit. The acting was quite acceptable. There were some very charismatic characters, which I always appreciate.There's a lot of cool effects. The tricks are not totally unreasonable. It's not as clever as say, Oceans 11, but I think they tried. Consider it a sort of weird heist movie, with some twisty stuff thrown in.I watched it all the way through, and did not hate it. In fact, I would probably watch it again. I admit I like illusion and heist movies and a reasonable amount of plot twists so why notThis is neither the best or the worst movie ever made. Not even close to either probably, meaning it's average. Maybe even above average, because there's a pretty girl and some fun stuff.Don't watch if you can't suspend disbelief.

But when we are talking about a bank heist using magic,that is another level of level of astonishment altogether. 'Now you See me' is an intelligent thriller with great characters,breakneck pace and plenty to keep you interested.Jessse Eisenberg looks fresh and lends that youthful and charismatic persona.It was great watching him after 'The social network'.Mark Ruffalo does a superb job in his portrayal of an FBI cop. Ishla Fischer and Melanie Laurent are charming.The chemistry between the four illusionists is kinda good too. In the backdrop we also have Morgan Freeman playing an antagonist who is keen on thwarting the illusionists.There are perhaps one too many characters in the movie.So the character development is a bit low. What works though is that the story is told in a thrilling fashion and it is always interesting to see 'tricks' unfold. You realize that in the end it is all a trick but u keep wondering 'How the hell did they pull that off?'Therein lies the strength of the movie.It is also full of unpredictable turns at every corner.

Indeed, this twist is ridiculous because totally unbelievable, it doesn't produce any effect on the viewer, but most seriously it instantly annihilates the credibility of the film as a whole ! And it seems like a dream when, just before, Morgan Freeman serves us up with a totally absurd and unrealistic demonstration... having to explain an outcome, above all in such a didactic and unsubtle way proves well that the script doesn't hold water.This quite incredible failure of the story inevitably cripples the movie, which anyway only possesses two assets that are its dynamism and its cast, except the unbearable Mélanie Laurent who makes one grammatical mistake every three sentences and seems to be reciting her lines more than anything else, and Jesse Eisenberg who seems stuck in his Zuckerberg role, mumbling all the time. As for the cinematography, it isn't fundamentally bad but very cliché — as the soundtrack — with, for example, a lot of circus shots, a technique Leterrier used and abused of, apparently as little inspired as his writers.","36 out of 63 found this helpful.

At least it's entertaining and fun, but not because of plot but through witty dialogue and charismatic cast. Though the film is about magicians the magic vanishes pretty quickly and leaves us ridiculous and implausible heist schemes. Characters, though charming, are rather one dimensional and not as mysterious as one could expect from magicians be. This film tries to convince you how clever it is, but if you take away all the flashing show scenes and sloppy action scenes with all the unnecessary jump cats and camera shakes, you'll get quite a flat movie. Just another film that purely relies on fast paced action sequences than actual storytelling, clever twists or complex characters. And those action scenes and editing aren't very magical (creative) either.Nonethless, 'No You See Me' is nice fun ride that can be easily enjoyed second time when it's on cable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Prestige and The Illusionist are among my favourites, and I believe their strong plots and my childish imagination make these movies seem magical to me. Although Now You See Me is more of a theatrical act for contemporary audiences, the one category this movie completely fails in is acting. The magicians themselves are fairly amiable. You have Jack, the humble boy who wants to make it big. Then you have J. and Henley, who have some kind of relationship going, but that is all but disturbed by Merrit, the old pervert with a good sense of humour. Now don't get me wrong, this movie was quite amusing and funny at times. But at others (especially in emotional scenes), I felt like cardboard could have had more expression. The acting from the detectives was generally dull, and even when there was a fair bit of tension, it just felt too insincere. I am glad nonetheless for watching this movie, as I was entertained for the whole duration. Just make sure you enjoy the movie, and don't look too closely (you'll understand).","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Kept me interested the whole time. Some said the twist at the end was bad, but it was actually pretty nice, I liked it, it was not ""predictable"". The beginning when the four street magicians were introduced one by one as they did their tricks nicely hooked me in. I was continuously intrigued by each of the shows these ""Four Horsemen"" performed. And Morgan Freeman coming out from time to time definitely made the movie even more funny. The police pursuing the Four Horsemen was thrilling yet humorous. Then a surprising twist along with a little touch of romance perfectly ended this movie. People who did not like this movie probably did not even understand what happened. If you don't get it, just watch it again. It's a great movie.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Now You See Me is a good attempt to pull the rug out from under my eyes, but in the end, what we're not supposed to see coming I managed with ease. Perhaps all the tricks have been played in the cinema and it's rare to be able to fool an audience anymore.PROS: Ed Solomon is a great writer and this is another one of his excellent scripts, creating great, comical characters with whimsy lines and personalities, namely that of Woody Harrelson's character. Bryan Tyler produces some excellent music for this film. He has a knack for big, bold scores that can make a scene larger than it actually is.CONS: Jesse Eisenberg. I can handle him in small doses. The film is not as intelligent as it pretends to be, but if you put all the problems and extremities of the plot aside you can just enjoy it for what it is.OUTRO: I've never really been a fan of director, Letterier, but here he has probably produced his best work. I compare this film to ""The Prestige"", which is far more superior, yet this manages to be far more fun.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The preamble is good: a group of mentalists and illusionists gets picked up by a mysterious third party who turns them into a team and turns them into a Las Vegas sensation while a secret plan unfolds underneath. But that's where everything stops making sense. From then on it's a series of car chases with the police, magic shows in prominent theatres around the world while a man tapes the illusionists to try and unmask their tricks. But why he does it is never clear and never will be until the cheesy, predictable finale. Besides the spectacular special effects and camera movements, there's nothing here. And two incredible actors like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are completely wasted in roles that hardly make sense in an already disconnected storyline.","169 out of 338 found this helpful.

All four of our Horsemen have charisma by the bucket load, with Eisenberg and Harrelson's banter being a particular high point. I thought Isla Fisher was good too. I haven't seen the sequel as yet, but I imagine she'll be missed. It's testament to the film too that people like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are popping up in small roles too.Yes, the plot has holes in it, and the final third is chaotic to say the least, but if you stick with it you get a great twist that isn't unlike a magic trick in itself.I'm surprised Hollywood felt this needed a sequel.

This movie displays this analogy in a fun and profound way.There is also this beautiful element of surrender and faith to the Teacher (the lovely Maitrei) as analogous to the higher ""secret"" teachings. ______FROM ACIDHARMA.ORGCourse II, Class Seven, Answer Key, cont.193) Explain the three different perceptions of the three different people in the metaphor of the magic show. Who are the three types of real people that these three represent?A magician in ancient India throws a small stick on the ground, utters a magic incantation, and sprinkles some special powder in the area. This makes people who have been standing there see the stick as a horse or cow. Other people join the crowd later; they don't see the animal, because they weren't there when the spell was cast.The spectators see a horse and believe that there is one there. The magician sees a horse as well, since the spell affects him too, but he knows it's not real, and doesn't believe in it. The latecomers neither see a horse nor believe that one is there.The spectators are like a person who has not yet seen emptiness directly, since they see things as self-existent and also believe that they are.The magician is like a bodhisattva who has seen emptiness directly but who is not now in the direct perception of emptiness: things still appear to them to be self-existent, but they don't believe what they see. The latecomers are like someone who is not a Buddha but who is in the direct perception of emptiness: things neither appear as self-existent to them, nor are they believing them at that time to be self-existent.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The police want to know how they did it, and why.The trailer of Now You See Me, was quite short, to be honest. It didn't reveal a whole lot of information, however, it gave just enough to engross the viewer. The idea of magic and detective worked quite well together and since it was a story never touched before, I decided to give it a shot, and so I booked my ticket for Now You See Me.My immediate conclusion at the end of this film: IT IS ONE HELL OF A TIME. Yes, magic and good acting has managed to get the better side of the audience. With such a great star cast, Now You See Me is a smart, intelligent film with many twists that will only be understood when watched under close attention. The final twist, at the end, is one you don't even see a mile away; its that good.So, Now You See Me is a great time. It takes a lot of thought though, but if you do so, its possible to understand the whole case and have a great experience.

It had a lesser impact because I knew the twist and turns, but the magic tricks were still awesome, the escalation of the whole con and revenge well done and the movie has no malice, no unnecessary deaths to give it ""meaning"", nor any casualties. You have to see this movie. It worths the time.Having said that, It is true though, that the dialogue and parts of the story seemed forced at points. Also, some actors do some amazing work while others are, at least in my opinion, quite awful.Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Freeman and Caine are amazing. Melanie Laurent and Ruffalo do their best effort to sell some too forced story beats, and Ruffalo in particular struggles to give his character any charm or believability, stuck in the middle. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were a cringe fest.SPOILERS! SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSA LOT of people saying that Mark Ruffalo's character being in the FBI, just to have revenge about his dead father (another magician) is too much work not to be ridiculous.IT WAS ""THE EYE""!!!!! The secret organization called ""The Eye"", has enough power (and in a too obvious comparison to the Illuminati) to pull some strings and easily make Ruffalo an FBI agent.Now. You can call the tricks unbelievable to your taste, and that's your taste. But they are more or less as unbelievable as the one of the Ocean's Eleven movies.

All this made the plot complex to follow at times - the line of possible and impossible was gone and, until the end, it was difficult to realize whether it had fairy-tale elements or not. At least to me, the solution (= who was behind all this) was factitious, bearing in mind most of preceding actions, especially the fight in an apartment... Nevertheless, the events were catchy to follow, and actors like Jesse Eisenberg (as J. Daniel Atlas), Mark Ruffalo (as Dylan Rhodes), Woody Harrelson (as Merritt McKinney), Morgan Freeman (as Thaddeus Bradley, Michael Caine (as Arthur Tressler) are always up to their scratch... The others were nothing special, but nobody was annoying, i.e. settled their characters in a decent manner.Another pleasant thriller movie directed by famous French director Louis Leterrier - not an eternal masterpiece, but far above average.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I didn't expect to like this movie just for the fact that I am not a big fan of magic. I expected a lot about this movie, which I can say led me to loving it. Like saying, it's unexpected. Most parts of the movie, as I watched it, I played in my mind trying to figure out how they did this and that. The thing that killed magic for me, is my curiosity on how magic works led me to knowing how it actually works. Now, during the movie, Thaddeus (Morgan Freeman) does give away how the tricks work, because that's what he does. And even before he explained it, I thought I knew how it was done, but I was completely wrong. There are so many schemes here and there that make you believe this and that, but it just twists stuff around, which is what makes me like this movie so much, they did an amazing job tricking you.I suggest watching this, yes. It's quite well made.

I am a fan of Jessie Eisenberg and had high expectations for this movie and it did not disappoint. You never feel less entertained in any of its parts.The movie opens with such a bang, right from the very first scene. Whenever a magic trick comes about, you feel like you've let out your inner kid. The first half hour is just pure joy for watching.The pace of the movie lasts and amps up till the very last parts of the movie. Leading to this point the tricks seem to get a little ridiculous and even more so as it ends. But at this point you would have left behind worrying about the logic and would just be enjoying it.At the end things move about so fast that most average movie goer tends to miss many things and can leave them a bit confused and leaves critics hard to grasp in all minute details.There are a few things that bothered me a bit. There is no way Morgan Freeman knew all that so correct to every inch of particular details. I did not find the character of Alma Dray to my taste. The romance is totally unnecessary in the movie. There definitely are few blunders and errors in logic as it is in any movie. But my views are put together in a dialog from the movie, paraphrased: ""It's not how it's done that is important, but at the end it did put a smile on your face and that is what I paid to watch"".It is one of those movies that you need to watch more than once to absorb in every little detail of it, though there might be few details that might not be to your liking.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, as the plot unveiled, it turned out to be an average- Not bad but not great even as expected.

Good action to dialogue ratio.Nice, great ending, but they could have explained it in 5 minutes instead of 1 a lot to take in. Great cast. All the characters struggle, A lot of tension and nail biting. So many wow!!! momentsGenius tricks.Neutral: Character development was just enough, but there could have been more. But then again, these guys were solid actors, you got the gist of who they were, and there was emotion for each character. Cons: Pacing (its not too bad, mostly at the end) Michael Caine was not necessary for this movie. He is too out of place.

The film talks a big talk about deception with its Morgan Freeman voice-over narration (""the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see""), but in spite of its high levels of ludicrousness, it delivers exactly that. ""Now You See Me"" treats its audience as the spectators of a magic act, luring us in and giving us the razzle-dazzle with a stunning reveal of what's behind the curtain in the end.The two reactions you will have to this film is that you'll either hate being duped or you'll be really impressed that you were. It begins with the exceedingly elaborate script from Boaz Yakin (""Prince of Persia""), Edward Ricourt and Ed Solomon (""Men in Black""). They craft something so totally compelling that no one is bound to turn this film off or walk away before it's over. Plot holes and leaps in logic and belief are stashed aside until the final minutes because the mystery simply envelops you, just as any good magician in his or her act.Four magicians with unique talents, slight of hand master J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), escape artist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and trickster Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), have mysteriously been recruited to create a magic act unlike anything ever seen. Fast-forward a year later and they reveal their act in Las Vegas, with a grand finale in which they rob a bank in Paris while on stage. Their little display catches the attention of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) who work together with famed magician debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman) in order to guess their next move.And their moves only get more and more complicated and astounding. The script teases with little bits that make you think you're inching toward an answer only to be caught looking the wrong way. Director Louis Leterrier (""Transporter,"" ""Clash of the Titans"") adds plenty of movement and excitement to the proceedings as well.If you so desire to dig below the surface layers of ""Now You See Me,"" it goes from wildly entertaining and engrossing into downright horrible. No, it's simply not feasible that anything that happened in this movie could happen. Yes, the characters are only as interesting as their different talents and witty remarks, and their motivation to execute this grand plan comes from something we do not know until the very end. It's too slick, too neat, too glossy.""Now You See Me"" will only be as good as the person watching it allows it to be. Bite early and lay back and you're bound to enjoy it; stay skeptical and bank too much on the payoff and you're bound to dismiss it entirely. It's the same with any movie that's building toward a big reveal right from its opening scene. Live by the twist, die by the twist.Personally, I bought in. Fantastic performances from Eisenberg and Harrelson plus the gravitas of Freeman and Michael Caine as the executive who funds their show helped keep up the appearances and cover up the blemishes that really only became apparent to me upon reflection post-credits. I came in open-minded and bought into the entire aesthetic of the movie and enjoyed it presumably a lot more than if I had paid too close attention to the details. And the ending had me fooled, which happens a lot less these days.As easily as one can find the seams ""Now You See Me"" and tear it apart, it does exactly what it set out to do: beguile, trick, deceive and entertain its audience. Regardless of the artistic qualities or merits of a film, if it does what it sets out to do, it's a success.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Plenty of twists, turns, face time with noteworthy actors and a story that doesn't force you to believe in magic in order to believe what's happening on screen. All that being said, there is a minority of viewers, myself included, who know they could have done much more with all the talent and potential lying within Now You See Me...or maybe they couldn't, and shouldn't have bothered to try.I'm hesitant to say the movie is bad, because deep down it truly isn't. Everyone, from Woody Harrelson to Michael Caine and every name-drop in between does their job and fits in snug with what's going on. Somewhere between the intriguing first 20 minutes and the disappointing last hour or so, I kept asking myself, ""why am I not enjoying this?"" The answer? It could have been so much more.Hasty references to the ""why"" of it all do nothing to satisfy the curiosity of the curious, and when the final credits rolled, I realized that this was the point all along. Even after the major reveal takes place and you finally understand the ""how"", the ""why"" never materializes. The introduction of the film makes that question the focal point, and the rest of the film does its best to make you forget you ever had the question in your head to begin with.Again, I can understand the praise, but I felt as if left the theater having been cheated out of my money. Considering a couple of the main scenes in the film, perhaps this was the filmmakers' entire goal to begin with. It wouldn't surprise me in the least. Regardless, most people seemed to enjoy it, so there's no reason to bash it any further than by saying it simply wasn't what I wanted it to be. It happens sometimes.","14 out of 22 found this helpful.

No doubt this is something that people would have to like in the era of the Great Recession. Even apart from that it's a pretty good movie, showing the characters pulling their tricks and figuring out how to always stay ahead of the authorities. In addition to the cast presented on the poster, the movie also includes Mélanie Laurent (Shoshanna Dreyfus in ""Inglourious Basterds"") as an Interpol agent who isn't about to take crap from Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent. That also means that Shoshanna Dreyfus costars with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) costars with Batman's butler (Michael Caine) costars with a frequent narrator (Morgan Freeman).I really liked the movie. It always seems as though each character knows something about the others that can ruin them. But the best parts are without a doubt the magic tricks (or are they tricks?).

The story line and the main character played by Mark Ruffalo, keep your attention, entertain and give you all you expect from a movie, all without giving away anything. The magicians, played best by Harrelson and Eisenberg, prove their screen worthiness and create a believable collaboration both as magicians and actors. Its an adult movie that will prove its worth once the DVD is out. It will be a part of my permanent collection.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, on the day it was released, i searched up for reviews about it, just for my own satisfaction, and for some reason a lot of critics didn't find the movie interesting or suspenseful enough.My answer to that is: WHAT?The entire movie, every single minute was hugely interesting and suspenseful. And i have to admit, i was pretty impressed with the cast as well, except for maybe the interpol agent, since her character seemed a little too weak overall.Anyway, i went to watch the movie with low expectations, and good for me, because my mind was blown a thousand times more than if i had high expectations about the movie. It's an overall fun movie, and i would definitely recommend everyone go watch it, particularly teenagers. Everyone else as well, of course, except for maybe people who have a tendency to figure out the entire plot in the first 15 minutes.It's an entertaining watch and i am flabbergasted that there has not been much hype about it!","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

"8","/10","""The closer you look, the less you see.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2806921/?ref_=tt_urv","Al_The_Strange","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24364152/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2013","Any show you go to see, whether it be magic shows or the movies, rely on dazzling and guiding the audience to a surprising and enjoyable outcome, ultimately making the audience believe that what they see is real. In Now You See Me, the principles of magic are used in this interesting premise: magicians who use their skills in deception and illusion to stage daring bank heists in front of the eyes of their audiences and the police.This film is not as deep or thoughtful as other magician-themed films, like The Prestige or The Illusionist. As a heist film, however, it's phenomenally entertaining. The film sets up the cop and robbers characters with playful energy and chemistry, before breaking out the visually-impressive theatrics and action scenes. It's not big on action, but the film does move fluidly, and above all, the characters are fun to watch. I'd say it's every bit as enjoyable as a film like Ocean's 11, The Italian Job, or The Thieves.Critics will likely find fault in the plot, which requires some huge suspension of disbelief to accept. Given the twists and the liberal use of magic tricks, plot holes are bound to be present. It might be especially frustrating to watch the more fantastic moments and wonder how these characters could pull off such trickery; the film does reveal the particulars of what's going on with the overall heists, but there are other moments where the film seems to assert that magic is actually happening.However, there is a certain theme to the picture, stipulating that ""the closer you look, the less you see."" Indeed, if you scrutinize this plot too closely, you'll miss out on the larger experience. The film practically implores you to just sit back, take it as it is, and enjoy things as they are. If you can suspend disbelief and go with the flow, you'll find that the plot is structured in wild and unpredictable ways. There are certain things to the story that could have been explored more, but perhaps a sequel is in order. Critics would say that the characters are all unlikable, and it's hard to know who to root for: I was personally enthralled by the whole cast, and was actually rooting for the magicians, for I found them all to be lively, rounded, and surprising at times. They aren't terribly deep, but they have surprises of their own.Some of the film's action scenes get a little jittery, but most of it has solid photography and editing. Acting is superb all around: everybody puts on a playful and energetic performance. Writing is not bad. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and okay special effects. Music is really hip.The film asserts that magic is not about understanding how tricks work, but in making audiences believe in it, and making them smile. If you're the type who wants to look closely and find something deep, artistic, or even logical about Now You See Me, then the less you'll see. I was able to accept the film's illusion, and it made me smile at times, for it is an enjoyable show. If you can accept the film's illusion, then you might find it enjoyable as well.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even now I'm still trying to think of the good things to say about this film if any. If I was to pick a highlight in the film it would be Woody Harrelson, whose on screen presence adds some interest and comedic value to the story but apart from that this film was pretty much downhill from the moment it started.The motives for the characters are half baked and there is no build up to any of the plot points. Everything is rushed and gives off a this film is too smart for you to understand vibe when it really isn't. Every scene consists of constant blabbing and for the amount of dialogue in each scene none of it is worth remembering. The main problem I had with the film is the over all story or lack of. Maybe the screen writers ran out of ideas and just thought to themselves ""Lets throw in another plot twist for good measure"". It's surprising that such a good cast would agree to be in such a poor film and that so many people on IMDb gave it a good review. If you want to see a good magic themed film then watch the Prestige or the Illusionist as they are well written, tense and enjoyable films compared to Now You See Me, which is just a mess. Don't waste your money on it.","86 out of 173 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Fun Magical Ride That Will Keep You Thinking","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2807537/?ref_=tt_urv","3xHCCH","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4294858/?ref_=tt_urv","4 June 2013","This opened as a very low key movie release locally. However, I kept reading praises about it from social media, I resolved to give it a try and see for myself. I had a lot of fun watching, and I believe, so will you.The fascinating premise of the film begins even before the opening credits. We meet four talented magicians who had been summoned by a mysterious hooded stranger who left them each a invitation card marked by an eye design at the backs. A year later, they were the toast of Vegas, calling themselves the Four Horsemen, staging big elaborate magic shows. One performance, they picked a Frenchman ""randomly"" from the audience to create the illusion that he had robbed a bank in Paris. Police and Interpol get involved when money really disappeared from that bank! That incredibly staged heist is only the beginning of a puzzling roller coaster ride of a film that will keep you wondering to the very end. Director Louis Leterrier (whose debut was ""Transporter"" in 2002) has executed a very energetic, intelligent and most importantly, entertaining film. The actors were all so eager, smart and funny in their roles. Jesse Eisenberg is believable as a control freak street illusionist. Woody Harrelson was a down-on-his-luck mentalist is outstandingly hilarious. Isla Fisher has gone a long way from her awkward debut in that Scooby Doo film. Just when you thought Dave Franco is just a minor player, he will surprise us with an exciting fight scene and car chase. And on the other side, Mark Ruffalo is just so right as the harassed police officer who always seemed to be two steps behind the magicians. Veterans Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman add their cool credibility to the mix, as they always do to any film they are associated with.While it is a pity that we do not get to meet the four magicians more in depth, and some of the illusions and action stunts were too impossible (and too CG), I think we can overlook and forgive those little quibbles. Do not think too hard and over-analyze about the twists and turns this film takes you on (especially in the final minutes), just sit back and enjoy the fun ride while it lasts. It is, after all, all about magic.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

So what is left when it's over is like to have seen a fantasy, at times funny, superhero movie and nothing else. It is absolutely not credible, too many flaws and exaggerations. A shame, because the heist/magic plot could have worked also for an extended audience.If you take it for what it is, you could end up to enjoy it more or less, for the fast-paced action and some entertainment shows, and because it is not badly executed technically speaking, but if you want a deeper and much more serious movie, that turn around magicians and tricks, then watch ""The Prestige"" or ""The Illusionist"", both from 2006.6/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I've seen a certain mainstream film in the past that did the same thing and I hated it for cheating the viewer. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't as blatant as that, but it still has one ridiculous scene after another which would have been physically impossible in real life, thus making this a delusional fantasy of a film. Having all the magic done in-camera without cutting away would have done much to remedy this situation.A problem of having an over-confident group of protagonists in a movie is that their characters are all annoying, and that's the case here. A smug Jesse Eisenberg is the worst, but Woody Harrelson is little better. Isla Fisher only seems to be around so she can show off her body in tight clothes and push-up bras. Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent do better as the cops investigating the cons, but it's left to the seasoned old-timers Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine to give the most professional performances.In any case, NOW YOU SEE ME is an unlikeable film. There's a lot of incident going on here, and with it a lot of cheese. The CGI effects of fire and the like are very disappointing. Throwing in random car chases and fight scenes is over the top and doesn't work very well at all, as by the end it all seems rather overblown and pointless. Needless to say that this was a hit in America and a sequel has followed. Great, I can't wait.","20 out of 34 found this helpful.

The high points of the movie were based around the actual magic, as a whole the tricks were good, and I think that they did a good job of explaining how they pulled everything off. There was a little bit of comedy that lightened the serious mood, and once again the tricks made the movie worth watching. I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because the movie was cohesive until the end. There was really an incomplete ending with no explanation of what made their common goal so worth it. Overall, I'm iffy on recommending this movie. I wouldn't pay full price to see this movie in stores, but I think it is a good movie to just watch. - Christian J.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The casting was absolutely wonderful; I wouldn't have changed a thing. They all brought something to the film, and didn't take away from the storyline. The cinematography was very effective. Like watching a magic trick live, your attention was brought to various places. As soon as you thought you caught up and were one step ahead of the supposed con artist, they were really three ahead of you. ""How did he do that?"" was a constant thought throughout various scenes for me. Although camera angles were constantly changing and some may argue it can distract from what is really happening, in this type of film it was very effective.Although the ending to the movie was slightly predictable, the moments leading up to it on the silver screen were impressive. The special effects were fabulous. The action going on keeps the audience on their seats, and whenever the characters would explain what really happened as far as certain tricks go, a wave of ""oooooh!

Anyone who enjoys the ""Ocean's"" movies or ""The Prestige"" would enjoy this flick.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Their amazing magical abilities soon draw to attention to FBI agents Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (played by Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent) who go investigation in search of an explanation behind their robberies, and an eccentric mastermind Thaddeus Bradley (played by Morgan Freeman) who desperately tries to expose their illusional power, leading a wild chase in search for secrets and hidden plots.Now You See Me boast some creative ideas and executes them in an ""okay"" way. I can't say I was too impressed with them. With the plot involving magicians who use teleportation techniques to rob banks for living, you would expect few plot twist and turns somewhere along the way. Sadly this film doesn't have much of these. But that's okay, the thoughtful storytelling, decently constructed characters, and strong pacing make up for some of it. The biggest disappointment however, is that the film lacks suspense and thrills that make it more exciting. The whole premise of how the characters use their magic to manipulate the minds of people is clever, but it's never gets interesting. The cast is very great on the other hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco demonstrate some great performances as the main characters. Morgan Freeman did an alright job as the main antagonist, although he felt a bit miscast. Overall, Now You See Me isn't too bad of a movie. Maybe if the plot was better developed or at least was a given a better direction, this will would feel more captivating. Also, suspense and thrills are what is this film is missing and really needs.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jesse Eisenberg's Daniel Atlas invites our fullest attention, claiming ""the closer you look, the less you see"", in an opening gambit that promises intrigue and suspense, which also acts as a (possibly) unintentional device for viewer reaction, namely, will we be taken in and wowed by what we are about to witness.Any film of this type is likely to bring about comparisons to Christopher Nolan's excellently dark 2006 thriller ""The Prestige"", with the on screen presence of Michael Caine only serving to reinforce such correlations. However, where Nolan's effort looks to explore behind the façade and mysterious surface of the tricks presented, ""Now You See Me"" chooses to shy away from much that could be seen as real explanations, instead allowing a high paced caper to take place, largely centred around the cat and mouse chase between the four conjurers and the law enforcement team led by the slightly unbelievable pairing of Mark Ruffalo's exaggerated sceptical field agent Dylan Rhodes, and Mélanie Laurent's inexperienced desk agent Alma Dray. This immediately takes the film tonally away from the territory of ""The Prestige"", thus placing it firmly in its own space, but leaves the viewer pondering upon the potential lack of substance that shying away from the deeper explanations may indicate.However, as the 115 run time of the movie progresses, it becomes clear that to dissect and over analyse every move of the twisting narrative is clearly not the point of this film, and as such, the best way to approach it may be to simply sit back and enjoy the tumult of events as they unfurl before your eyes. The 100mph plot rarely takes a break to allow for reflexion, preferring to let the A-list cast take centre stage, with performances admittedly sometimes bordering on the edge of credibility, Morgan Freeman's disgraced ex-magician Thadeus Bradley being a case in point, in a demonstration which, in the end seeks not to deceive, but instead to entertain.Undeniably, the film does fall down in certain aspects, such as a shaky script, and the lack of depth which wont allow the audience to ""see more"" on repeat viewings, but, in a summer dominated by comic book heroes and city-levelling CGI, ""Now You See Me"" at least offers an entertaining alternative watch which can be largely enjoyable, so long as the obvious thematic comparisons which have been made to more accomplished past films are not kept in mind for too long.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's also moderately entertaining. Four great magicians are chosen by a mysterious benefactor to become the Four Horsemen. Their goal: to astonish with spectacular tricks and, Robin Hood-like, rip off the criminally rich. Their first big trick involves robbing a Parisian bank from a Las Vegas stage. This puts detectives Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent on their tails, along with famous magic debunker Morgan Freeman. Very little in this film makes much sense, and I think it makes zero sense after the huge twist it ends with. It moves along so fast it's hard to care too much. Director Leterrier is a very good action director, but this isn't really an action movie. The movie's best sequence, though, is an action sequence and involves Dave Franco, one of the Horsemen, using his magic to dodge and trick the cops who are after him. The Horsemen (besides Franco there are Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher) get very little characterization and they probably have less screen time than Ruffalo, Laurent or Freeman. Michael Caine also co-stars. There's a lot of talent here and it's all wasted. Still, not a bad time waster. I saw it because I thought the trailer for the sequel looked even better. I'm not convinced by the first installment, but if reviews are good enough I may partake. I'll probably do so on video at any rate.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The actors play the characters with believable sentiment. And the script does not treat the audience like idiots- constantly spoon feeding exposition.All of this comes together in a way which endears the viewer to the characters, you don't pity them and you don't fear them- they are just people you might call friends if they existed in the real world.The direction is crisp and keeps the story flowing, the cgi is both believable and awe inspiring at the same time.

Considering film was founded on the principles of perception, illusion, and amateur craft, it's a wonder why it's so rare we get a modern picture exploring mentalism in a greater sense. Finally, there's Louis Leterrier's Now You See Me, a film centered around magicians and magic that examines the world in such a style that it should be taken in carefully and with a potent sense of admiration. It's easily one of the more surprising pictures of the year, combining effective mystery with plot-twists to make for a ravishing experience.The plot: four crafty magicians, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), are united by an odd-force and a year later are seen as the ""Four Horsemen"" by a sold-out Vegas crowd. For their final act, they decide to summon an assuming audience member to state the name of his bank so that he can be teleported through time to rob it accordingly. The bank is in France and in mere seconds is the man transported, given instructions about what to do when there, and finally, the money begins to rain from the ceiling of the arena. Of course this summons national attention and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is soon on the case trying to infiltrate the Horseman and discover what the underlying secret is to their tricks.Leterrier's directorial game has always been in the field of slick action productions, such as the first two ""Transporter"" films and the recent remake of Clash of the Titans, which he later apologized for. His talent for directing a picture that relies heavily on visual trickery and giving the audience the idea they are ""getting it"" when they aren't even close is meticulous and surprisingly precise. An interesting footnote is ""Now You See Me"" was shot with an anamorphic lens on film in order to make the effects appear not too hokey but not too realistic as if they were showing them done with certainty and complete accuracy.The trio of writers — Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), and Edward Ricourt — however, encounter one issue and that is the issue of greater emphasis on plot and twists as opposed to character and development. The film features such an ensemble cast that does wonders making the material accessible, interesting, and immersing in the first two acts that, by the third, the events and twists have almost overwhelmed the picture to the point of the actors having to run to catch up with the pace of the film. This isn't a huge issue, but it isn't until the final twist is explained – that does feel a little rushed and sketchy – that you begin to realize you really know nothing about these magicians besides they each house enough cockiness to make up for two stubborn hockey teams that are entering Game 7 in the playoffs.Nonetheless, Now You See Me is a good film, but due to the cinematic mastery of special effects the power of magic and perception inevitably feels tainted. I'm reminded of how cinematic shorts got by in the late 1880′s when all auteurs had were cameras and the power of illusion; not slickness, shock, and trickery all created by a hefty budget.

So unless Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman would be there ,being marvelous as they can be ,I would not grade this film with more than 3- 4.Mark Ruffalo is giving a convincing performance ,and so are the rest of the Magician crew for that matter.So to sum up:Nice 1.5 hours of Las Vegas style entertainment brought to your local Cinema with some quick unexpected turns in the plot","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am more in the way that it needs a good storyline, that is what makes this movie so good, it has it all! I will buy this movie and watch more times. So i don't matter what kind of movies you usually prefers because this has something for everyone, all from suspense to romance, from humor to action.

It is simply fantastic entertainment that keeps the viewer glue to the screen trying to figure out the impossible things that are happening to a superlative groups of actors playing well written roles (written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) and directed with aplomb by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2, Unleashed, and the soon to be made Now You See Me 2!) whose imagery and imagination is endless.The story is simple but inordinately complex in the way it is shared. Four magicians each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (Mélanie Laurent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see. Add to this rather amazing cast the talents of Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky, José Garcia, and Elias Koteas and the talents of Brian Tyler, musical score and the cinematography by Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong and this film becomes addictive.

The first part is developed through dynamic and vigorous sequences. The link to America's tragedy of Katrina, with an attack to insurance companies could also be interesting. Moreover, the rational explanation of the tricks results quite involving and intriguing, and the viewer feels torn between the need to understand how the tricks were made and a more subtle desire to believe in magic.And, to tell the truth, the picture never loses the viewer's attention, it's fast- paced, never a dull moment, but then, in the second part, something changes and the movie turns more into an action movie with chase sequences, punches, violence and moves away form those promising premises, hurrying towards a hasty finale with an interesting twist but lacking the solidity of the first part. The cast helps make a difference, although I found the big Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine a little under tone, I appreciated the boastful performance of Woody Harrelson and in general the freshness and vitality of the younger cast. On the whole, the picture is worth the ticket, two hours of real entertainment are granted, but I cannot deny some disappointment in the end.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's fun and flashy enough to be entertained for a few hours but lacks more substance to be memorable. It's the kind of movie you can have fun with for 2 hours and then forget the next day.With a cast of well known actors and a plot about a group of people pulling off what seem like spectacular robberies it's clearly that it is aiming to be a ""Oceans Eleven"" kind of movie, but it dosen't quite get there.My main problem with this movie is that the basic idea here is that ""you think it is magic but it actually isn't"", and that would have great if they would have shown them use clever and creative tricks to fool people. But ,sadly, more often than not we see the main characters use tricks that seem too fantastic to be true, and it dosen't help that most of them are done using CG animations and special effects. All the magic they use is just taken too far to be believed, not only in the illusions but also the fact that one character seems to have super human hypnosis abilities and others can pull off crazy tricks with no preparation.Movies like Oceans Eleven are more enjoyable because even though you know robbing a casino is hardly as easy as they make it look... almost all of what they do has some form of rational explanation backing it up. I don't know if you can Robb a casino making the stuff they do, but I do know that at very least that stuff can be done, and that just isn't the case with ""now you see me"" as only a handful of tricks are explained and the writers want the audience to just believe that all the CG/FX tricks going on have a rational explanation.If you take what I've already said into consideration and add the fact that there is little to no character development (we hardly get to know them)and a ""shocking"" ending that feels so forced that no one will be ""shocked""... it's easy to see why this movie is nothing more than a fun and flashy flick to watch and forget the next morning.I have been told that there will be sequel, and hopefully they manage to make a movie that is as clever as what they think this one was","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With the exception of the last quarter, the movie is actually surprisingly smart, and entertaining. While there are let downs within the filmmaking (The amount of CGI they use for the magic is baffling), the narrative is smartly weaved throughout.The cast work well together, and as soon as we pass the ""catalyst"" moment, the characters stop being quite so annoying (and... shouty... in Isla Fisher's case), and settle into their roles quite well to the point that they're all very likable. Eisenberg in particular was a standout to me, I was very happy to see him play a more confident character than we've seen of him.As for what didn't work... The ending was stupid. That's all I'm saying about that, because that's all I could work out.I would recommend the movie, but I'd also advise the viewer not to raise their hopes too high.

There are some unanswered questions, but none that I thought were overly important. The ending was slightly disappointing and a few of the relationships between characters seemed a little forced, but the strengths of this movie outweigh its weaknesses. It has a fantastic plot and lots of great lines. Most of the questions I had throughout the movie were answered, or clearly intentionally unanswered to be mysterious. Some other people seem to have confused style choices of the movie with plot holes. I have no idea why so many people have been so harsh about this movie.

It had amazing acting and a lot of cool well known people, personally I am a huge fan of Jessie Eisenberg, and I also really like Dave Franco so I was really excited to see this! The story was very well set up and had a lot of surprises and some plot twists, so if your a fan of plot twists I suggest this movie. But there was one thing that wasn't very clear (WARNING- may give away a plot twist or may be a spoiler so caution if not wanted anything spoiled.)So while I was watching everything was fine and I didn't really think of this until I looked back on it and someone pointed it out to me, Dylan the main FBI agent who first had the case was Lionel Shrike's son or whatever, and he wanted to get 'revenge' on some certain people, now I only thought he wanted to get 'revenge' on Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman's character) but my dad pointed out to me that it was more than just that, it was the insurance company, the French bank, the safe company and Morgan Freeman's character. So that was the only thing that was a little unclear.But besides that I loved it! It was funny, suspenseful, questioning, thought provoking, action filled, interesting movie. And I liked how it had some fiction added into it, and the special effects and animation was great, the whole ending I had my mouth open and was saying ""oh my god, oh my god, oh my god."" Cause I didn't know what was going to happen next. It had magic and wisdom and fantasy reality all piled up into one film. So I really enjoyed it, I hoped other people did too.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

We got to the movies to be entertained and lose ourselves for 2 hours for a price of an admission ticket. I can say without flinching that this was totally worth it. It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.Overall, this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you shouldn't sleep on. It clocks in at just under 2 hours, but it won't feel that long","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first 90% of the movie is captivating, riveting, engaging - yes, magical - and really quite good. I thought I might have to see it a second time to understand everything. But, there are subtle hints of something that went wrong years ago that became the actual focus of all that we see. In other words the twist at the end within the last 10%, was, IMHO, contrived and this is where the movie falls apart. I found it hard to swallow and when you get to know the characters, you may feel the same way too. To say more would be to give things away. There are questions I would like to ask of the character Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) but to do that here would give away too much. Sorry. Okay, here's the thing: I looked at him as the key to why everything worked the way it did, and my question to him would be: how did you become the Four Horsemen's benefactor? We were under the impression he was their banker. At the end of the movie you will surly have that question too because there is no way he can give a good answer: that was contrived too. CGI played a huge factor and it was spectacular in places, but the car chase on the bridge actually made me dizzy. It was one of those things where they sped up the film to make it like the cars were going 90-mph when they were actually going about 5-mph, if that. See? A little gimmicky. The crash was CGI. The heists or robberies that you will see are probably the most involved ever put on film. Kudos. One interesting scene I saw was on a bridge in Paris, France. The screen alongside the bridge had key-locks all along it. I believe, if you have secrets, you are supposed to attach the lock to the wire fence and throw the key into the river below. Thus your secrets are forever safe. Or, for the amorous: they can lock their love forever. Cool. To see what is up with that bridge, Google: Bridge in France that has key locks attached to wire fencing.All the actors performed well, and it will be up to you whether or not to believe them. Hey, these are professional actors and it's what they do: convincing you of what they say is true. Good luck. Overall, this was still very entertaining, but contrived when you see the ending and because of that we shall never see sequels regarding the Four Illusionist Horsemen. At least I don't think so (never say never, Bob). (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Since my first encounter with Leterrier's work (Transporter 2) I was looking forward to his upcoming projects. Clash of the Titans was a well made summer blockbuster with one condition: you have to tun your brain off before watching it. It got a lot of hate but the problem wasn't with the director. Then came his best movie yet and that is the kick-ass The Incredible Hulk. A film with great characters and great action scenes. But after these movies Louis Leterrier had a problem: he was typecast in Hollywood as an action director. When he showed interest in making Now you see me, the studio didn't want to let him direct this movie since they were afraid he wouldn't handle the characters well. No one thought that he could tell stories. But Leterrier proved them wrong once again. Now You See Me is a great very fast paced heist movie where the crew pulling off the heist consists of magicians. There is plenty of action, magic and the camera has no time to stay in one place. That is probably my favorite aspect about this film the camera work. There is no shaky cam in this film despite that being Hollywood's biggest trend in movies. Yet still the camera is never static, it is always moving. Circling around the characters,spinning or zooming in and out.The cast assembled in Now Yoou See Me is truly marvelous. Jesse Eissenebrg who has two on screen personas - the shy stuttering neurotic or the cocky and arrogant smart ass. Here he plays the second one. And well he is pretty good at it. Woody Harrelson is always a fun addition in any movie. Mark Ruffalo who probably has the most screen time is becoming more and more likable in recent films and here he does a great playing the FBI agent who is incapable of catching the Four Horsemen, the group of magicians. Seeing Morgan and Michael Caine is always a pleasure and just seeing these two act is a joy for a every movie fan. Isla Fisher plays one of the Four Horsemen but she serves more as a distraction for the audience so you pay attention to her and not what is happening in the film. Dave Franco once again gets his chance to shine. He has proved he can be very funny in 21 Jump Street and here he shows he can pull off a serous role too.If you are looking for a well made suspensive heist movie with some action or just looking to cool yourself down in the cinema I believe that you can't go wrong with Now You See Me.P.S. Solid cast, original story and a good word of mouth helped to make this film one of this summer's biggest surprises. When something has success in Hollywood it gets a sequel. Even though the film is a wrapped story. Not sure where they want to go with these characters next but I'm cautiously optimistic about the next film.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A bit all over the place but ultimately entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3411001/?ref_=tt_urv","juneebuggy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27077890/?ref_=tt_urv","8 February 2016","Lots of bad reviews out there for this but I didn't hate it. It is a bit all over the place though so that even with the fantastic cast, original story and all the flash it just failed to impress me much in the execution. It sorta feels 'Oceans'ish except with a with a group of magicians known as ""The Four Horsemen"" who pull off brazen heists during their performances, the proceeds of which they share with the audiences. This raises the attention of FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) who spends the rest of the movie trying to catch them.Its a caper film and very watchable, in fact there were moments were I thought it was going to be a really good movie but it never quite lives up to itself. Some parts of it are clever, others stupid. A lot of the story happens off screen then is just briefly explained by the characters or assumed by the viewer. There's a big car chase in the middle that comes out of nowhere and a crazy lukewarm romance going on between Ruffalo and a French Interpol agent. Towards the end it becomes almost fantasy-like with shades of 'National Treasure' thrown in and the actual ending just goes on and on; its over, wait another sub ending, another explanation, the credits, another thrown in bit scene.I did enjoy the extended cast though, as well as the initial set up and coming together of The Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco) The banter between them is entertaining and there's also Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman who are such pros they can do no wrong. 1/10/16","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The gang's cat and mouse game with the FBI, their display of magic tricks, fluid stunt scenes and Mark Ruffalo's banter with co-cop Melanie Laurent keeps you engaged. The film works as a crime-thriller. However, it's unconvincing when it comes to dissecting the magic. As the film progresses, the antics of the law- defying 'famous four' start defying logic as well. The scattered plot runs out of steam eventually. The film goes into a different tangent altogether in order to be unpredictable, leaving you more perplexed than pleased. The filmmaker sends out a similar message to the audience - don't dig into every aspect of the 'tricks' and you will be entertained.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I've always been a fan of Jesse Eisenberg, and I don't think the movie would of worked if he wasn't cast in the main role, and the same goes for everyone else in this movie. Each and every actor brings their A game from start to finish. Dave Franco and Mark Ruffalo are good actors but neither really made me think, 'Wow, they're good freaking actors!' But after this movie I can say that about both of them.The story is original and fresh with some mesmerizing action sequences and some even better thrills! All of my respect goes to Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt, if this was just a movie about four young bank robbers it wouldn't have blown me away as much as the magical element did, even with these actors. Now much like this movie, the title of this review could be deceitful, there were a few moments where I found myself thinking 'Really? He just turns every light bulb he comes across?' (You'll understand about 15 minutes into the movie). Some of the audience at the magic shows didn't impress me either, but they're minor speed bumps on an otherwise fulfilling, truly beautiful film.I can tell you that this movie will most definitely take your breath away. Some have complained about the four horsemens character development, don't let that throw you, they're probably just angry that they couldn't work out the twist, which by the way, was also a beautiful moment. Overall, this is an amazing movie, with awesome action, great actors and characters, a nice soundtrack and a brilliant script. Woody Harrelson had everyone in the room laughing. But maybe I'm biased. There is nothing I love more than a great heist movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Now You See Me boasts a lot of well known actors and they were all great in their respective roles. A positive thing was that each character was interesting in their own way and it was also amusing to see their relationships develop as most of the main characters only meet as we the viewers meet them too.There were several twists throughout this film, most of which I didn't see coming at all and each new revelation made the film even more exciting.

Good actors namely Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine were wasted here. Many of the tricks and illusions, although quite lavish, were not inspiring and appeared quite unrealistic in the context of the film. There was no awe or wonder regarding the performance of illusions due to the fact I never became immersed in the film and always regarded the stunts as staged. In one opening scene I developed such a dislike for a character, in the space of just 2 or 3 sentences, it was my hope the actress would simply drown during her stunt and save everyone the misery of listening a moment longer.

Magicians don't seem to have played much of a major role in the history of movies, outside the world of fantasy such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) or the Anthony Hopkin's occult Magic (1978) that earned him a best actor Golden Globes nomination. This rare resurgence this year of magic with the beautiful 3-D fantasy film Oz The Great and Powerful (2013) or the less than well received hokey comedy movie The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013) along with perhaps never to be released comedy Desperate Acts of Magic (2013) brings along with it this rare crime-thriller movie where magic forms the basis of the storyline of Now You See Me.The screenwriter's seem to have taken a lot from the television series Leverage (2008-2013) which itself won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Drama (2013) and oddly enough that show doesn't use magic as its theme but uses creative deception and misdirection like a grifter in all its episodes for rebalancing the scales of justice. The most comparative magic-themed movies would include the more personally involved competition between two rival musicians in this psychological thriller between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in The Prestige (2006) and the period crime psychological, mystery thriller without the action The Illusionist (2006) which included its own powerfully surprising twist both which focused more on the human drama rather than on the spectacular crime mystery action thriller or even the more poignant and perhaps even more emotionally, more intimately personal and bitingly delightful performance of John Malkovich in The Great Buck Howard (2008).Now You Can See Me suffers somewhat with its omission of a flashback at the beginning of the movie that sets the basis for this story and instead uses a present time narrative to eventually flesh out the back story which is a crucial element of the emotive humanity of the entire movie. Overall this movie is fast paced, with at least three major plot twists along with others and seemingly magical sequences that sometimes are rather predictable and at other times unexpected, but none that exceed that of the television episodes from Leverage or perhaps even the old Mission Impossible television series (1966-1973). This fusion of magic, crime, and psychological gaming becomes a who and how done it audience game on the big screen, even the opening sequence of the guessing the playing card number and suit by the theater-going audience gets them ooh and awe. It's hard to disassemble this movie from many other clever action thrillers because the use of the magic theme is new and exciting like a new Disneyland ride and rarely used, if any on this level, as the actual part of a movie as opposed to actually making the movie. Nevertheless, the movie is refreshing and entertaining, keeping the audience interested and guessing throughout.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It seems like the actual performances they were doing started out good but then just became spectacle with no real point.I was also a bit annoyed that the magic was special effects and not actual stage magic, and some of it was implausible, in particular the mesmerism: They describe a full _superpower_ like The Shadow, not a stage mentalist.But DO watch this one.

The approach to hypnosis is patently absurd, the plot is full of holes, the denouement makes little sense, and in spite of all its twisty twists, much of it is predictable (oh look, the police are stupidly doing the obvious thing!) and clichéd, and character motivation seems beyond the grasp of the writers.I don't care, I love it.This movie is pure showmanship, starting with a card trick that shows exactly how amazing magic tricks can be. The stars are playful and relaxed (Harrelson and Fisher are particularly good), the constant twists are fun, and the movie moves like lightning and plays like opening a series of Christmas presents.But yeah, it's stupid. The stupidest thing is probably Morgan Freeman's character, who exposes magician's secrets. It's an odd premise, in that he acts like he's on a mission (think The Amazing Randi's attacks on psychic fakery), when no one thinks magicians are terrible tricksters who must be exposed. It's just bizarre. And while Freeman is, of course, great, he cannot make his character's actions or attitude make any real sense.So yeah, dumb, stupid, irretrievably ridiculous movie.

The cast is formed by well known actors as Jesse Eisenberg, famous for his performance as Mark Zuckerberg in the movie "" The Social Network "", Mark Ruffalo again impressing everyone with his excellent performance after ""Hulk"" and the eternal Matt of "" 13 going on 30"". Among the writers Ed Solomon stands out, more famous for his work in ""Imagine that"" with Eddie Murphy.As a plot that leaves no loose ends ""Now you see me"" tells the story of a group of FBI agents running after four famous magicians who use their tricks and illusionism to rob banks and all the money is given to the viewers of their own shows. However, there is much more beyond this abracadabra, because before the four magicians reach the high position they are in, they were recruited by an entity type called The Eye, which selected them, but never introduced itself. Moreover, they do not know The Eye's purpose, motivation and goals. In the middle of the trajectory the magic four - titled as The Four Horsemen - Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg ), the leader of the group, illusionist and showman ; McKinney (Woody Harrelson ), the mentalist ; Henley ( Isla Fisher ) the escapist; and Wilder (Dave Franco), illusionist, street magician, and pickpocket, are faced with Thaddeus ( Morgan Freeman ), an ex-magician who earns his living revealing the other magicians' tricks. In addition he is willing to help the agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo ) and Alma Dray ( Mélanie Laurent ) reveal illusionists' tricks.Most of the scenes take place in an amazing setting that is Las Vegas, where bright lights, many special effects give the movie an extra shine. Very well built, as already said, the plot leaves nothing without fit. The actors are perfectly engaged and each of their character makes the whole thing seem somehow real. The end is surprising, and unusual, apart from an interesting scene after the credits. Rating: 9","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

My family wanted to go so I took them, not eagerly after reading the Rotten Tomatoes assessment. Darned if I didn't like it. I think the key was, early on, just letting myself go and suspending belief. Some of the illusions just would not seem viable otherwise. What helped was the breakneck pacing. It starts out at 90 miles per hour and does not let up. No chance to reflect or get bored because once you start, BAM!, it's off to something else. The plot, generally, I do not find plausible. I saw the ending criticized elsewhere. Again, suspend belief and it is not a problem. Magic is kind of fun to me, and I think that helped get me through.

First it has good actors, I like them all in their roles. Morgan Freeman is outstanding as always. Second this movie is incredibly intelligent and has a good story, unpredictable ending..it is very exciting to watch from the beginning to the end. The third is music , I really liked the main theme which goes throughout whole movie.. music is glamorous so as they are the shows from ""Four Horseman"". It seems that this movie will have a sequel I know it will be hard to beat first one but let see and wait for another advantures of the ""four horseman"" and the ""eye"" I give this move 10/10 best movie in 2013 so far!!

The actors chosen for this movie, isn't your average group, but they fit the part so well as if the role was made for them, the co-operation between all actors/actresses was perfect and I can't see anything wrong with ""Now You See Me"" as a whole. The movie is another movie that you would have never seen, so you can't expect something like you do in re-makes.

Good actors aren't always a sign of quality. The beginning of the movie is okay, but we soon notice that it is total nonsense.Magic usually doesn't work in movies, and this one takes it to a new level. When you do magic with cgi-bubbles, you are doing something wrong. The idea in a magic show is to wonder ""I know this isn't what it seems, but I wonder how they do it"". When you see crap like that in movies, you know it is just a guy holding his hands out and a geek on a computer has made the bubble. Ther is no magic in that, just stupidness.I think the director tried to get an ""Ocean's 11"" feeling to the movie. He failed. The music is that generic casino/Las Vegas swagger crap that is supposed to be just right for this movie. It is not, it is annoying.This movie offers a surprise plot-twist. It's not enough to tell (smart) viewers that the most unlikely character is behind all this. They should explain even a little how that person made all that possible.At one point in the movie we get the ""One year later"" routine. I wish this movie would have been about that year.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

But, obviously, I can't stick with one word to talk about this film! Yes, it was incredibly entertaining. You will remain interested in the overall plot the entire time. Another one of this film's selling points was its uniqueness. This summer, we've gotten a lot of explosions, big names, superheroes in powerful suits, several versions of the impending apocalypse, and an overdose of hype underscoring the madness. And in Now You See Me, there's some action. The roster is pretty much loaded; unless you live under a rock, you will recognize at least two of these actors. But the premise, magicians using tricks to pull off heists, is something you're not going to see every day. Even its title, ""Now You See Me,"" is unusual. It's different. And that's a good thing.The recurring idea, ""The closer you look, the less you'll actually see,"" is truly the theme of the movie on a whole lot of levels. You'll have to watch it to see what I mean, but it explains almost everything, including the feel of the movie itself.I'll admit, character development was comparable to that of a Mission: Impossible film, but this was also a plot-based movie, not a exhibition of the human emotions. That being said, many of the characters were quite entertaining and at times hilarious, especially Harrelson's and Eisenberg's. There wasn't a whole lot of a message or social commentary here (which was actually a relief). Instead, they kept the pace fast, the production quality high, and the corny drama levels at a blessed minimum. Alright, the ""romance"" is pretty cheesy, but it's a sideline story and does not really affect the main plot.There are a couple of bad words, a few suggestive dialogues, and one somewhat inappropriate scene (it's near the beginning), so the PG-13 rating is probably fair, but don't let it scare you. I've definitely seen a lot worse out of this rating category.And finally, the much-debated conclusion. It is certainly surprising but in a good way; I have no further comment but you should decide for yourself what you think about it.Rewatchability: Unless you were totally disgusted by the conclusion, it's likely possible to watch this movie again when it comes out on DVD to explain everything, and to see the tricks again. However, do NOT read spoilers before seeing it at all, because that would take away all of the fun! At the end, they have certainly set the stage (pun not intended) for a sequel. I personally think it's a one and done enterprise, and a follow-up will only ruin the magic (another ""accidental"" pun), but the film's done well enough at the box office that they might give it a shot, if they can get all of the Horsemen back together. Like I said, though, I really hope that they won't.You will not be bored by this movie. You will not fall asleep. It's got a little bit of everything in it. Will it amaze you with its deep meaning? Not really. You can't look too closely at that, because it doesn't really exist. But it will engage you in its intrigue and attitude. Definitely recommended.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now You See Me did a fine job. I'll try to keep any info that may ruin the movie out of this review. Starring Jessie Eisenberg (Social Network), Mark Ruffalo (Avengers), Woody Harrelson (Seven Psychopaths), Isla Fisher (The Great Gatsby), Dave Franco (21 Jump Street), and Melanie Laurent (Inglorious Bastards), Now You See Me is about four magicians who all specialize in a different field of magic and are brought together mysteriously and hence forth perform around the country using their talents to carry out heists, pretty much in front of the FBI's noses, specifically Ruffalo's and Laurent's characters'. I was well pleased with the direction of the movie. The acting while pleasing lacked depth and the ""love story"" if you can call it that, was weak at best. The movie kept me engaged the whole time, while I feverishly tried to figure it out but it was difficult because it was so entertaining! :)In the end I wasn't completely oblivious, I figured just a few small things out but the ending was a surprise and right in front of my face. I kept replaying the tag line, ""Look closer, because the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see,"" in my head. I tried not to look close but I did and I saw less. :) Regardless though, I was thoroughly entertained and after all isn't that the point of a movie about illusion?

The magician was David Copperfield and show was pure magic and at the end of the show magician shook hand with all the peoples at the first row. I was sold. Maybe that is the one reason I liked this movie very much. It started at Las Vegas in MGM Grand hotel. This movie is great illusion entertainment, almost perfect. This is visually and fantastic movie. Four magician works together perfectly and Brian Tyler's music full fill excitement. Viewer is constantly derived to think what happens next, just to see that you were wrong. That is why the end of the movie is too annoying and frustration.

The story is cleverly developed and the acting excellent but in total the project, although entertaining, just misses the mark. The biggest problem with the movie is the ending, which will not be revealed here. Suffice it to say, however, that it could have been treated better. Also, James Franco, although a wonderful actor, seemed to be not the right actor for the part of the FBI agent, which is the principal character in the story. Not that he does not do a good job with the role, but it seems that the story required a different kind of character than the one played by Franco. As for the rest of the cast, they are excellent. Morgan Freeman again delivers a strong performance and Michael Caine is superb. These wonderful actors, both up in years, defy time. One thing this movie shows is that inside information plus some cleverly staged tricks can produce some interesting results, especially when money is involved.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Clearly, the film's greatest trick was getting the green-light in the first place. I'd like to know how they did that!Ridiculous plot twists abound, countless scenes are left unexplained, and characters conveniently behave exactly as the convoluted plot demands. It's all so far-fetched, and yet played with such seriousness, I was sure there would be an incredibly clever and hugely satisfying pay-off that would make it all worthwhile. Sadly, director Louis Leterrier fails to pull the rug from under the viewer's feet with a mind-blowingly brilliant ending. What he actually delivers is even more ludicrous than all that has gone before. And that takes some doing.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

It is also unique in that not many films (that I am aware of) feature the criminals as master magicians and tricksters!Each character uses a specific skill set that aids the team in different ways. For example there is an illusionist, a magician, a trickster/pickpocket and a mentalist. Each character has some development and background throughout the movie, however the character with the most depth would be the FBI agent who chases them around the globe to stop their crimes and arrest them!The scenes where the ""magic"" is performed, is absolutely breathtaking. Thanks to the use of high end CGI sequences, the stunts and tricks are added with just that extra touch of glamour and ""wow"" value. Scenic areas are appropriately chosen and show a diverse visual range.The plot, while as simple as it sounds, also has a few tricks up its sleeve and provides an ample level of depth, obviously not as in depth as a movie you might study in high school English class (like inception or the matrix), but nonetheless it is sufficient. I only found there was one or two parts which i was a tad iffy about.All in all, the movie hits the spot and is a breath of fresh air from sci-fi, action and teen-drama type movies that tend to dominate the screens these days (although I am a fan of several of those)!.

The cast was so balanced. I have seen such a perfectly chosen ensemble after a really long time. Though Eisenberg should have been given some more screen space. And Isla Fisher is much more prettier than her 'Wedding Crashers' days.The first half is not that slow, but actually not much is shown in the first half in comparison to the second half which manages to keep you at the edge of your seats, mounting to a satisfying climax in the end.Morgan Freeman looked frail for the first time on screen-diluted pupils, weak mouthing of lines. And that made me really sad and worried. People might end up hating the movie because of the simple fact that it lets out secrets as much as it elevates the magic trick in the next sequence, and so on and so on- which is a bold thing to pull off. The mythological connection should be explored more in the sequel if they make one(confused if they will or not) . Overall, Eisenberg-Freeman-Fisher-Caine-Ruffalo & Co. will ensure you don't come out of the theater disappointed. The illusion-shots are superb. And please, don't keep guessing the ending before it comes. Let it grow and flow as designed.

""Now You See Me"" is the kind of heist film that cockily displays the lighter side of entertainment in the crime genre with oodles of style and chutzpah. But the discerning viewer too gets his share of the pie with the ample twists and turns, which keep you riveted and guessing right till the end - a rare feat to accomplish in movies these days. Boasting of an all star cast, each actor brings forth a unique charm and persona to his/her role.The icing on the cake is the jolting twist at the grand finale, which knocks you spellbound and leaves you with a savory taste in its aftermath. You can't help but yearn for a sequel to this intricately wound tale at the earliest.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

In this new thriller, four former street magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco) are brought together to pull off the heist of a lifetime, all while putting on a performance that no one will ever forget. When a level-headed woman from Interpol (Mélanie Laurent), a frazzled FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo), and a former entertainer turned magic buster (Morgan Freeman) start to hunt them down, the Four Horsemen must pull out all their tricks in order to elude them, and to be able to perform their greatest spectacle of all.Not only is this film extremely entertaining, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. What is amazing about this movie, is that it perfectly reflects the feelings experienced at a true magic show; the feeling of awe, the questioning of how it is done, the expectation of what will happen next, and the thrill of not being denied the enjoyment of a good, quality, show.There are multiple twists in this movie, yet none of them cause the audience to despise the surprises (unlike the recent disappointment of a good number of movie goers when they met Trevor from Iron Man 3). The story line has an impeccable balance of thrill and comedy, where one moment the atmosphere will be tense during an interrogation, and the next the mind reading member of the group (Harrelson) will start giving a therapy session to the two agents about their relationship, although they just met.There have been many complaints about unanswered questions left by the movie, though perhaps that is the point. Who hasn't left a magic show with a question or two buzzing around in their mind? And can we say . . . sequel? Taking a break from wizards and spells (looking at you, Harry) Now You See Me reintroduces the art of the true magician, and their amazing ability to enchant us with their clever tricks and performances. With a spellbinding cast and mesmerizing storyline, Now You See Me will make you believe in magic once again.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Beware, anyone who like movies, do not let this movie ruin your evening like it did to mine, where it literally (in its right sense) turned my nose red from constant face palming.

The visuals were good and the cinematography was well done.I felt the cast were very well picked and came across together very well. Woody Harrelson was brilliant in this film, very quirky and interesting.The movie is very well paced, from the 1st minute to the last I found myself very entertained and didn't once feel my attention slipping. The main scenes in the movie come and go very well and it never feels as if they are dragging out a scene/situation.The only gripes I have of this movie is the character development. I found it near non existent. I didn't feel as if i cared much for any of the characters, be it the magicians or the FBI. The film is so fast paced and it didn't seem to slow to build any characters stories.The magic scenes are good, the cat and mouse chase scenes are good but I still can't help feel disappointed about the weak character development, especially with it being such a strong cast.I would recommend this film to anyone, plenty of twists and turns, laughs and suspense to keep you thoroughly entertained.8/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thank you. I know a lot of people are going to dislike this straight away because of the summary title. But I just want to quickly justify the title(This is only my opinion, Im not forcing it) The reason I liked this a lot more is for one thing, this seemed more believable. Being a small time magician myself I know for a fact everything in this film was possible, unlike The prestige where that went too sci-fi for my liking. Although both films had a great cast, this film just outdid it. Every character was played by very talented actor. Now about the film. I loved mark ruffalo in this movie, he was amazing. Ever since Shutter Island he's been impressing the hell out of me with his performances, for me he stole the show the entire film. Followed by Jesse, he was great too, although he plays the same kind of nerdy character, he was just perfect for this role. Another actor who I thought stood out was Dave Franco, I thought he was great and he's character was really believable. And I loved his act of the film, it was very entertaining. All the cast did great but I don't have time to talk about everyone, but I must say, every actor added something special to this film and It was a pleasure to see them all in one film. Now about the filmography. The directing was good, I bit shaky and quick at times but I got used to it. Because the film is so fast paced,which leads me to the editing. The editing was so sharp, every frame just seemed to fit in great and cut with great timing. Again one reason the film had such a good flowing movement to it. Also the opening scene had great cinematography, its not consistent throughout the film of course, because the film becomes fast paced, but the opening scene was great. The score. Oh my goodness, Im I the only one who thought the music in this film got to repetitive and annoying. Im not sure but for me the music was a downside after a while It got too annoying. Also the whole film does seem to become a bit repetitive, its like you've seen one scene and then its onto to the next scene which is almost identical. Also the film could of answered a few more questions but I suppose it did leave it open for a Sequel and I do kind of the think it adds to the film to make you wonder a little after the credits show. Apart from that I cant find anything really wrong with the film. I thought it was a highly entertaining film, that you can go and watch with your younger brother.So Im going to give Now You See Me, 4 Stars. IMDb rating (8/10)Thank you for reading my review and have a great time watching this movie. :) :)Also please forgive any bad punctuation lol, my writing is not the best.(As you can tell)","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Long story short: it's a heist movie with magic as a background turned into a huge visual attraction, almost glamorizing burglars. It's not something new, you probably saw this a thousand times before with movies like The Prestige or Ocean's Eleven, in fact, this movie not only takes a lot of the concepts from The Prestige by Christopher Nolan and being two steps ahead being the smartest guy in the room in Ocean's Eleven and mix them to work together with great visual and art concepts that would make a director like Baz Luhrmann applaud as loud as he can but also elevates these concepts to the heights, putting into practice everything we saw in the famous Christopher Nolan movie.So, there's nothing really new here, but it's well made, well orchestrated, gives you tons of fun and a thousand twists, I mean, holy moly, this movie has more turns and endings than Return of the King, when you think you had it figured out, it just fools you once again! Anyway, it's a nice spectacle, worth the admission ticket, go watch it! And also has great actors like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson and others.I've just saw it and I enjoyed the ride, so yeah, it's worth of your attention.

The tricks, turns, tears and shock this film brings work together in perfect unison bring a perfect mixture of flavors blended perfectly for such a film.The only downside I have with the film, as pointed out by a friend, is it gets a little bit Sc-Fi towards the end. That being said, this is easily plausible considering the thoughts of magic and illusion, as most magic is, and still bring about a very enticing story.

Both Harrelson provided the comedy relief and Jesse Eisenberg displayed the cocky arrogance from The Social Network. Isla Fisher debuted in the movie amazingly, but then her character got pushed aside and later, reinstated as fighting for control of the group subtly along Eisenberg. Franco was also very funny and did an amazing fight scene with Ruffalo, using fire, cards, and a high-speed car chase with fantastic explosions. Ruffalo's character was pleasingly befuddled with a humorous chase down in New Orleans which ended when.....oops, spoilers. However, his partner, Laurent's character was earnest and passionate about the subject of magic but was rather pushed to the side and later suspected of having choreographed the whole thing herself. But the movie itself was funny, intelligent, witty, action-packed, and everything you could ask for if you don't want a thriller/psychologically stimulating movie. It's an action magic movie and that's that. There's no philosophical meaning, no deeper layers like in The Prestige. But The Prestige was dark and meaningful, and this movie is more lighthearted, something to laugh and ""wow"" at. The stunts and tricks were amazing and the effects were great. However......... The movie could stand to have had more character development. I felt it was all action, action, action. Freeman's character was frustrating because he spoke like he knew everything, but he knew nothing. Caine's character was actually well placed, used for the purpose of showing the audience what a lying cheat he was. I liked the way the Four Horsemen's tricks were conducted to achieve a higher end. None of the stealing or giving back to the deserving was for their own good. Like a magic Robin Hood mafia. All in all, it was what I wanted it to be. You won't be disappointed unless you're looking for a psychological thriller, in which case, you're in the wrong theater son.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first and second acts are explained but the final act is not explained which leaves a big question mark. The end of the movie seems to be a set up for a sequel to come. One might be reminded of the movie The Prestige but this movie does not have the credibility behind the magic tricks that is so evident.A little more time devotion to the background of the tricks could have struck a chord with the audience and made it more entertaining.Overall , Now you see me is an engrossing crime thriller which is sure to keep you on the edge of seat. Good 3/5","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Cheesy, predictable, pointless and with a plot ridden with holes. Like a real magician, this film was pretentious and obnoxious, however it lacked any ""magic"" or wow factor. The whole movie stunk of trying so hard to be clever that it forgot to be, well, clever. There is a build up throughout that what they're doing is for some greater purpose, something to make all their efforts and risks worthwhile. There is not. The justification was as weak as how everything was tied together. The romantic side story made no sense, there was literally nothing to draw the characters together. Mélanie Laurent and Michael Caine are the only positives, but weren't given much to work with. I will never watch another Jesse Eisenberg film. The most enjoyable part of this movie I found was pointing out all its flaws.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

From flesh-eating piranha scares to robbing banks from a stage, ""Now You See Me"" never ceased to wow me. I loved the illusions and tricks brought to life with the movie. The plot revolved around a group of magicians,( the Four Horsemen) and their quest to fame using intense skill, and illusions like no other. Their heists are very well thought out and kept me on the edge of my seat.This movie required me to think and kept me guessing until the final scene. I highly recommend NYSM to those who love the art of illusion and fantasy itself. ""The closer you look, the less you'll actually see.""

Actually, i don't know why people felt this way, i'm guessing they either didn't get the movie (didn't understand the twists) or either they just don't like magic shows...Personally, i loved it... This movie was original, exciting,and filled with CLEVER TWISTS that i just love and think are absolutely Necessary for a plot or a movie to be successful... It's mainly about tricks and illusions of the magic industry.. and combining it to good old Bank robbery excitement make it a good success... The acting is Great! no exceptions (Jesse Einsenberg seems to stand out a bit with a focused performance) the camera movements were extremely nice, and the special effects were awesome and subtle enough to keep it beautiful and real !... The movie was obviously well thought of. (and that's its main attraction) and well executed as well. usually, i Only give a 9 star ratings to movies that have something new or ""something"" that makes them Stand Out from all the other movies.. and i guess for this movie, it was: 1) The theme itself (magic tricks, not overused in movies, and i think it's better than the Prestige), 2) All the above 3) AND the fact that it kept me smiling and entertained throughout the most of it ! (which is rare, especially for 2013 movies). Must see ! :)","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

From the moment the card we picked is seen projection mapped onto the side of a building, there is one question constantly asked: How did they do that? As the bank robbing 'magic' pulses along, a sub-plot involving a fatal attempt at escapology in the past hints at relevance to current events. The cast are outstanding, there is a brisk line in jokes and put-downs, and most of all, the audience is trying to constantly keep up without ever managing to get ahead. The reveal at the end is fiendishly tricky and emotionally poignant. It also has the two qualities required of any perfect twist - it is both surprising and inevitable. Yes, there are plot holes and incongruities, but they only occur to you after the credits have rolled, and the more pedantic viewer can have a field day going over them. Some films you just have to give yourself over to and enjoy the ride, and Now You See Me is a perfect example.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The character arch for Dylan Rhodes was terrific, however, I felt the Four Horseman were very underdeveloped, we learn a very scarch amount of information about their lives prior to the events which unfold in this movie, hopefully we will find out more in the confirmed sequel. The cast is top notch, with the Four Horseman, Eisenberg, Fisher, Harrelson and Franco, all working very well off each other. They are joined by two very experienced actors, Morgan Frreman and Michael Caine, but Mark Ruffalo steals the show as the hard working detective trying to crack this complicated case. An exciting, magical experience with no poor performance in sight, I would recommend Now You See Me to anyone looking for a good crime film or mystery. An FBI agent investigates a case involving a group of four magicians that managed to rob a bank in France while performing in Las Vegas, as well as several other groundbreaking, illegal stunts. However, it is impossible to get his hands on this team. Best Performance: Mark Ruffalo","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Let me start by saying what I missed was a creditable storyline, good acting, drama, romance, action, and virtually any element that could make this movie even somewhat enjoyable. What you get should you decide to waste your time, money, and brain cells watching this trite is long boring journey into a muddled inconceivable yarn about 4 magicians who thanks entirely to camera special effects bring the magic industry to tears. Every magic act is simply crap to be polite. The line up of actors who tied their wagon to this insipid hunk of junk is quite impressive, but don't be misled, they obviously did this movie strictly for the money as there is no artistic value anywhere to be found in this pitiful attempt at movie entertainment. With this movie the magic is gone....stay away!!","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

Penn & Teller, Magic secrets exposed, etc. And the Prestige is without a doubt one of my favorite films(top 20). I seen the trailer for this film back in 2013. Never gave it a shot, because it looked to much like a Oceans/Italian Job/Prestige all thrown in together. It was unfortunately, but hay! I enjoyed the hell out of it.The plot is no different from something like your typical heist movie, comparably Oceans franchise. Throw in some magic and you got yourself a unique narrative that should be blockbuster worthy? Yes, and no. Yes, because the magic of course drives this movie. No. Because the twist to me was way to out of left field(and that's all I'll say). But me loving the Prestige so much, I have to say I can't deny this movies charm and fun. I embrace a movie that holds to true to exposing the art of magic for all it's glory.The script could of been better though. The characters where not to fleshed out(especially the Daniel/Henley relationship). Woody Harrelson did a fine job again(playing the hermit/Merritt) as he always does. The only flaw of the cast would be Jack played by Dave Franco. He didn't have much screen time to deliver his dialogue, and for the most part was just there. But overall, the casting was on point.I love movies about magic, and the art/science of it. It's the oldest spectacle in human entertainment. This movie felt like I was in Vegas(never been there. I know right?), and makes me want to go their even more to witness something like this live in person. 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is a typical show-boating movie that has only one purpose: to look cool. The easiest way to do that is to turn the characters into some infallible ""winners"" who are always in control of everything. To me, all that control is seriously boring rather than cool. I like to see movies where the characters face challenges, have doubts, are faced with tough situations and sometimes fail. That feels real. This one felt like some perfume commercial where they're trying to sell you a cool image, rather than a product. It never had any soul.I think it may appeal to some teenagers or people who are into ""reality"" TV and celebrity culture.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

I've still never seen it in one sitting from beginning to end but I think I got it all now. During staged acts the Four Horsemen, ace magicians all, appear to be invading bank vaults or bank accounts and distributing their contents to the unwashed masses. What is really going on and why? You'll have to watch and find out. Mark Ruffalo, my new favorite actor, plays the FBI agent working with an Interpol agent to break the Horseman. Add Michael Caine, wealthy owner of an insurance company/victim, and Morgan Freeman, the great debunker of magicians, to the mix. Ruffalo and, of the Horseman, Eisenberg, are just great and this is good if somewhat complicated fun. Docked a point because the audience to the big stage acts comes off strangely unreal and hokey, otherwise just grand.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main objective to not tell you how things really work out in the plot are met. You dont see any of the important stuff on screen like any real life magician would if he performed on screen. Therefore there is no way to know what happened unless you really watched because it gave the slightest of clues. Of course these clues would have to fitted into the puzzle and that was up to you, so anyone who did not realize that this happened need to rewatch the movie. Also i believe that the ending is the best ive ever seen. ( its the same for the 2nd movie which is out, we will see if this goes for the third too. ) It shows how they made their tricks come to life and yes they seem a bit much. But thats why its a movie not a theatre play. Its a horrible argument to say that because the tricks seem unrealistic the plot sucks. No, if it did not come to mind the four horsemen seemed to be capable of it all. Just like harry potter could use magic and not die to voldemort as a kid. We didnt question that either. So why are these characters that are clearly portrayed as being capable of doing these tricks questioned. My point is that people are unhappy because they expected a real life magician on a movie screen. but that is not how movies work because there is no fun in that. Thats why movies always have a bit of imagination because the mind/brain thinks its more fun than actual things that happen. So the whole 'it does not seem real' thing should never be a fricking argument for any movie unless its clearly stated that its a bloody biography or something that ACTUALLY HAPPENED.Also morgan freeman is the best actor in the world","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was also Mark Ruffalo's one of a major role in his career and did nice work. Woody Harrelson also supported very well with young and rising actors like Jesse Eisenberga, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco.Like I said vast cast and diverse with layers, anything could be happen and anyone could be the end twist. The movie was kinda similar to 2012s 'Red Lights' about exposing the secrets of psychic and magic tricks. Here Morgan Freeman as the chaser and four young magicians called 'four horsemen' are being targeted by him. After theirs first and second show they instantly become national talkative. Along with illusion exposer, the FBI joins them who are after them for their bank heists during the performances.Kinda cool, very thrilling and entertaining, like a cat mouse-chase. The magics are not really magic that we expect them normally, but very modern and fictional tricks that specially made for cinematic. So don't expect any sense or logic, it has been just major commercial element used as the movie theme, that's all. I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you see the movie poster you will know that where 'The Illusionist' meet 'Ocean's Eleven'. One of 2013s fine commercial entertainer and it can be watched once.8/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The purpose of magic is to watch and be amazed, and for one moment, just enjoy the fact that you don't know how a trick is done. That is exactly the best way to enjoy this movie. To pick apart any plot hole, or any twist or turn that may be 'predictable', would ruin what is a great film.From the very start, we are made to side with the magicians, until they rob their first bank. This brings in Mark Ruffalo's character. Can I also add that this guy is on fire at the moment. Underrated actor. Anyway, from this point on, and for the rest of the film, you are on his side, hoping that he catches the 'bad' magicians, and the thrill ride which goes on while he slowly but surely tries to piece together each piece of the puzzle, while Morgan Freeman continuously believes he knows what is happening and becomes a nuisance to the FBI, is perfect for the inevitable reveal at the end.In review, this film is enjoyable to watch.

After reading negative reviews on this title, I was ready to be disappointed. I was not. If you appreciate a movie that will make you keep guessing and are one of those people who have a brain that spoils so many movies for you, whether you want it spoiled or not, this one does a good job. I am not saying that no one will be able to figure any of the plot before it is shown in the movie but it isn't completely transparent the entire time. I am hard to impress with titles that have twists but this one impressed me. If anyone tells you they knew every piece and part of this before it was revealed, they are bending (if not breaking) the truth.The cast all did a wonderful job. I was a little let down seeing the guy from the last season of Scrubs on here (everyone should have hated him from his role in that show) but he did a pretty good job of proving that he has some range. Seeing Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson together again was really cool. Morgan Freeman is in it, need I say more in that department? Really, they all did quite a good job.Last thing I am going to say is that this is the first time I have reviewed a title on IMDb and I created my account for this one. That's not to say I wasn't really tempted before but this is the one that actually made me pause the next movie I had started watching, sign up and type out this review. That has to be saying something since I have seen untold numbers of movies and IMDb is my go-to for movie related information.There you have it. Someone notorious for spoiling movies for himself just by thinking about the plot and someone who hasn't cared enough to sign up and review a title before... this one flipped both issues around for me. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie is fast-paced and the plot seemed very attractive & enchanting ... The very first scene of the movie introduces the four magicians in a very charming way, I mean the the charm the first scene of this movie creates will be lasting to the very last minute!!! I didn't feel boring for even a single moment... And not all movies can do that.... Many people seemed to have a problem with the main motivation of the protagonist. Well, if you finish the movie watching carefully, you'll certainly get the answer- it's just plain vengeance, which I think is not unfair considering the incidents of the past ...

This film is another one, and I think it's one of the most interesting and appealing that are circulating out there.The story is simple: four illusionists who acted alone and had no fame are brought together by an invisible hand for an audacious plan that they do not quite know what it is, but it implies performing magic tricks at the highest level and that promise makes them the most famous and successful group of magicians of the moment.I'm not going to argue about the movie's incredible magic tricks being feasible in real life because I don't understand anything about illusionism. Even so, it is quite obvious that many would not work, or would have to rely on voluntary collaboration from third parties. In any case, it does not seem to me that this will ruin the film if we see it as an entertainment piece and not as an illusion documentary. Louis Leterrier's direction seems to be very effective and ensures a pleasant pace, knowing how to make the film appealing and fun. The roadmap, despite credibility flaws, works reasonably.The cast is led by a small group of actors: Jesse Eisenberg was effective in the role of a convinced and conceited but talented illusionist as well. The most obvious problem he will have is the fact that his character is irritating, but I think that was part of his personality and the actor did well to be true to what the character demanded. Woody Harrelson was also very good as a mentalist, and Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent were impeccable as policemen, and she knew more than just a pretty face. The same can be said of Isla Fisher, perfect in the role of an ex-partner who is now an escaping artist. Of course, the film made use of the physical beauty of both actresses, but without exaggeration or removing depth and interest from their characters. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are impeccable.Technically, it is a very good film: the cinematography was very well done, adapting well to variations in light and color. The sets and costumes seem realistic and credible, within what could be expected, and the same can be said about CGI and the visual effects used. The soundtrack is excellent and is in the ear.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you want a film that explores magic, why not check out the quintessential The Prestige by Christopher Nolan, or even the slightly overrated The Illusionist with Monsieur Edward Norton. Don't look at this utter garbagefest.This movie commits many of the major crimes of bad movie-making; clichéd stock characters, a lack of directorial restraint, a reliance on poorly integrated CGI and a very, very rudimentary and poorly realized plot. Scratch that, there were two plots in this movie... and at least one of them was totally and utterly redundant. Actually I think both plot lines might have been redundant.The movie contained some very fine actors. In fact, it contains some of my favorite actors. By the end of the film, I pretty much hated them for appearing in this affront to my intelligence.Like the infamous ""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Remember His Past Lives"" before it, I feel that Now You See Me has a mind-altering effect upon the weak-minded; I fear that all the IMDb reviewers that rated this above 5 out of 10 must have had their brains addled by the sheer horribleness and meaninglessness of this cheap, patronizing, irrelevant cavalcade of drivel. And they should all be heartily ashamed of themselves for showing that IMDb scores- long a useful method of telling good films from bad- are now totally unreliable.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

When I watched it shortly after its first weekend of release back in May 2013, I left the theater curious and constantly pondering over what happens next for the main characters. It certainly took me a while on how to properly critique it, but here goes:The story about a group of four successful illusionists who step out of their average parlor trick performances and into something much bigger when they are given mysterious invitations. When they are caught by the FBI at their sold-out act in Las Vegas, there is little to no evidence to land them behind bars, and therefore released.Stars Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco did outstandingly well as the Four Horsemen with wit, humor, and an intricate amount of knowledge to understand how to enact their plan. For example, I enjoyed the 'Zombieland' nod between Eisenberg and Harrelson (as their personalities in this film started to remind me of their previous work together). Another example is that Dave Franco really stood out when his Jack Wilder character is caught. When confronted by FBI agents while all alone, his knowledge of 'sleight-of-hand' proved beneficial in getting him out of tight spots. Although it does seem deluded and ridiculous that such a thing may happen, it was clever and witty on how it played out on screen. Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent pursuing the Horsemen was good for a few laughs. Every time he thinks he's got them in his grasp, he would usually be left outwitted and dumbfounded as to how it happened to him. The reunion of stars Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine since 'The Dark Knight' films was really interesting. They delivered impressively as supporting characters who are also in pursuit of these performers (usually out of their hands and into that of the authorities) and are just as significant to the film's storyline. In one scene, Freeman's character Thaddeus Bradley quoted as saying, ""leveling the playing field"" for both the FBI and the Horsemen, but his true intentions still felt shady.Director Louis Leterrier (Transporter, Unleashed) did a splendid job crafting the entire set-up. It's like Robin Hood meets David Copperfield creatively spliced together. Judging by the various heists the Horsemen pull off, mysteriously robbing a bank without getting caught was only the beginning. I can tell that the film did not rely too heavily on CGI for the complex stunts and that most common tricks shown on screen like sleight-of-hand or disappearing acts were practiced countless hours by the cast. Story-wise, it does feel cliché in terms of a typical caper film (albeit adding illusionary elements into it), but still it's a movie that is worth pondering over because with some surprising twists and a few scenarios left unanswered, it's very possible that Four Horsemen's quest is FAR from over.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But around the midway point, I was beginning to wonder how they were going to tie everything together and make it work. The more I think about it now, it almost makes me angry I spend nearly 20 bucks for this tripe. I might have felt a little better if the arrogant Jesse Eisenberg character had received the punishment he deserved. The ""twist"" ending should totally insult your intelligence (unless discovering Mr. Withers was the phantom of the haunted amusement park totally still blows your mind).Unless you're 13, or have the the mentality of someone that age, do not waste your money at the theater.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

Yes there is a lack of character development and there is very simple dialogue that is because this is a very stylized, fantasy type of movie and relies on that only to entertain the viewer. In that aspect the film does very well! Now You See Me is fun and you will be glad you watched it. No it will not make you ponder, no you will not fell a deep emotional connection with any of the characters, yes you may discover the twists before they are revealed and yes there are plot holes, but none of this matters!

It's a pretty preposterous premise for a film.But darn it all...it's pretty entertaining.Featuring an all-star, charismatic cast - Jesse Eisenberg (THE SOCIAL NETWORK), Woody Harrelson (ZOMBIELAND), Isla Fischer (WEDDING CRASHERS) and Dave Franco (THE DISASTER ARTIST) play ""The Four Horsemen"" - NOW YOU SEE ME is a fun romp that will find you rooting for these Magicians to pull off their ""jobs"" while outsmarting their opponents.But this film does an interesting thing - it also makes you root for the cops that are on their tail. Mark Ruffalo (SPOTLIGHT)and Melania Laurent (fresh off her great work in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS) make a charming pair and so your loyalties are split. Do you want the Magicians to get away with it? Or...do you want these cops to catch them?For the thankless role of Thaddeus Bradley - the former Magician who explains to the police (and the audience) how these Magicians are pulling their pranks - the filmmakers make another smart choice. They cast Morgan Freeman., so even though this character is a smug sumbitch...you can't help but be drawn to him.Oh...and did I mention that Michael Caine is on board as the billionaire who is bankrolling the Magicians' shows?This whole circus is wonderfully brought together by Director Leterrier. It is the best work of his career, for - I think - he spent most of his time working on the action and spectacle of the magic and let this stable of terrific actors work their magic on an screenplay that is strong enough to act as a basic framework for these characters.Like most magic tricks, if you start looking too hard at the edges of things, you'll start to see the seams - and the magic will start to fall away (somewhat). I would recommend that you not do that. I think you should just sit back and let the magic unfold in front of you. You'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was tempted to headline this review as ""The closer you look the more you see"" as the opposite is often asserted in this movie concerning magic...i.e. ""The closer you look the less you see"".Anyway, the plot of this movie concerns a group of disparate magicians who are brought together by a mysterious person and instructed to follow directions without question. These directions involve making money disappear, which leads to police interest in their activities.There are many herrings provided in this movie. It would be inaccurate to say, I think, that you can deduce the identity of the mystery organiser but the movie does often throw out little titbits which are fun to make you surmise who knows more than they are letting on. I was half expecting a revelation a la ""The usual suspects"" as to who the mystery mastermind was. In any case, that revelation came as a surprise to me. Of some consolation to me was that I guessed (or at least was open to the possibility) of how the final heist in the movie was achieved, no doubt thanks to a little titbit on how a previous magic trick in the movie was accomplished...but, thinking more about that latter trick, I doubt that it would actually work in the way you see it in the movie! The closer you look, the more you see it doesn't stack up!Maybe it was on ""At the movies"" where I heard the suggestion that ""Now you see me"" is structured like a magic trick...all misdirection and sleight of hand. Not sure that that is right. It seems pretty conventional...insofaras all movies utilise camera angles and editing and plotting to create an illusion of coherent narrative. These movie tricks make it seem that something extraordinary is occurring whereas if you pulled back, you might see, for instance, that a very dangerous looking car stunt was actually very safe and only camera angles and editing made it look life threatening.Like I said initially, I was inclined to headline this review as ""The closer you look the more you see"". By that I mean the movie has plot holes which make the illusion disintegrate once you analyse them. One would think that the use of captions in the movie would be a sign of objectivity, but it seems to me, from memory, that even they misdirect...e.g. that scene early on in the movie where a French man takes part in an onstage magic trick. The caption used for that scene seemed a quite obvious case of misdirection (but I'm relying on my memory here as to what those captions assert).To the extent that I have a 'problem' with this movie is the very Hollywood like leaps faith required to make the story gel...hence my comment that the closer you look at things the more they fail to make sense. Maybe a movie like ""The game"" is another example of this...there is a certain sense of implausibility when 'going with the flow' of this movie. The illusion is quite fun though, once you focus on the 'big' picture...and not get bogged down in details like how anybody could have the ability of foresight required by the plot of the movie.My headline also states that this movie has substantial style...a play on ""style over substance"". That would be my only quibble with this movie and why it does't score higher...since it doesn't hang together logically that much, you really want the principle magicians at the heart of this movie to sweep you off your feet with their charisma and make you swoon. They don't quite make you forget the artifice of this movie but they do display wit on occasion...but a bit more chutzpah would have been nice. Maybe it's also a pity that later on in the movie it becomes clear that the magicians have actually crossed the line between seeming to be criminals and actually qualifying as such.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What follows sure is fast paced but also laughable in terms of character building and cleverness.
Take for instance the final twist, the chararcter reveal: it brags about how insanely clever it is while completely ignoring that it forgot the setup to the payoff. The setup to the main plot point! But it's by no means the only one lacking foreshadowing or at least coherence. Twists and reveals are thematically particularily interesting in a piece on stage magic, but most of the turns come out of complete nowhere, defy any logic and sometimes even invalidate previously, apparently carefully established plot points.
Another symptom of this sickness are the ""magic tricks"", that in a number of cases are just flatout high fantasy literal magic, sometimes poorly explained by throwaway lines or just dumped on the viewer in the hope that the insane frequence of plot turns won't leave any time to ask questions.
The characters also fall victim to missing foresight: the initially very intriguing mystery about the four horsemen and their final motivation actually never gets lifted and leaves them as ultimately mindless plot devices.
As a result, the amount of cringe in the final two scenes that this mess of a plot culminates in is simply awe-inducing.There could have been a world of trickery and deception to be playfully explored in the context of professional magicians, but all the movie does is throw the viewer a ton of impossible to chew bones and require them to swallow those with next to no help. All the while bathing itself in its aura of self-proclaimed genius.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course by watching the trailer I expected a high tech, sfx and enjoyable laid back consumers experience, but the story itself is quite smart and complicated and until the plot was completely revealed, I did not know whodunit. The acting itself is good, as you would expect from these A class actors. The chemistry is there between all four of the magicians, between Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent (yes, that's her from Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards) and between Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. It is nice to see the two last ones performing as not really friendly characters, and Mark Ruffalo as an asshole. Castingwise this movie hits bullseye on all fronts. After the introduction of the four magicians, we step into a roller coaster of special effects and illusions while the police is trying to catch them and they always have to be some steps ahead. And they are. That much you can get from the trailer. Watching the movie it makes me break my brain on how they do everything. It is so witty and smart that I can't help myself having a lot of huh?-moments during the movie. But of course, without spoiling the plot to you, most of it will be revealed at the end. The plot is very strong and surprising up until the end of the movie. They didn't got too far in it, you will see all the pieces fit together in the end. I really enjoyed this movie much more than expected and I want to advise you to try to step into it as blank as you can.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What we get is a vague, overarching background plot, a contrived love-story that just kind of pops up for no apparent reason, a few predictable plot twists, a huge plot twist pulled out of thin air and some really overdone CGI magic. For a film boasting such a strong cast it falls surprisingly flat. I suppose someone has a lot of dirt on the main cast, or maybe they didn't read the script before signing on to this Titanic of a movie. First of all, there is no of urgency or excitement what so ever. The four horsemen are certainly closer to being super villains than actual human illusionists. The FBI and Interpol are no more than comic sidekicks, never ever getting close to catching the bank robbers/magicians/demigods. I get the feeling the writers want me to root for Jesse, Woody and the rest of the illusionists but they just come off as being so ridiculously overpowering and vastly superior to the police it's like rooting for a UFC fighter beating up a puppy. The would be heroes are at best people who the movie never tries to make the audience care about, at worst they are smug and utterly unlikable. There is no back story worth mentioning, all we get are some short intro sequences. The main characters meet and then the main plot just kind of fast-forwards off into action without any further explanation. The character development is so insignificant it cannot even be measured. There is no change and nothing is leaned. At the end of the film the characters are exactly the same as when we started. Yes, there are some references to a back story but that never effects the plot besides setting up a few one-liners and in a clumsily thrown together ending twist. I read quite a few reviews saying this movie thinks it is much smarter than it really is and I think that sums it up quite nicely. This movie is like a pompous street magician with a self satisfied grin, quite certain he's got the audience in awe when in reality everyone in the crowd has seen that he's got a card up his sleeve and that his fly is undone. I gave this movie 1/10, if only to balance the notoriously generous IMDb-crowd and lobbyists that for some reason beyond think this movie is worth 7.2/10. If I was drunk while watching and feeling particularly benevolent I might give it a weak 3/10.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Loving magic, I decided that it would be worth seeing - and it was worth every penny for the ticket.Apart from the stunning magic and special effects, the most unusual part of this film is that there is no real lead character: most of the characters seem to take up roughly equal time on the screen, so no particular star seems to be carrying the story.That said, Morgan Freeman's role was very much an enlarged cameo performance, which he played magnificently. But then it's always a pleasure watching Morgan Freeman.The only thing that riled me was that, despite all the wonderful things in it, the story just didn't hang together: it simply didn't make sense, especially the ending. Normally this would drive me mad, but the film as a whole was so mesmerising, that I actually didn't realise that there were a million gaps and logical failures until I got home.I'm giving the film a solid 8/10, which would have been higher if just a little more time had been spent on working the plot through.All in all, it's the best film I've seen so far this year and, judging from the upcoming offerings, it's likely to remain that way until the 2014 releases his the big screen. So allow credulity to take a back seat and go to the cinema to enjoy probably the wildest ride available.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It feels like it was conceived as a Jonathan-creek or The Prestige-like story where the plot is enriched by real behind-the-curtain knowledge of how magic works, then got handed around until someone with no knowledge of or interest in magic got a hold of it and let their right-brain go wild. Instead of a clever insight into how misdirection and trickery could be used for crime, we just get magic that can do anything and therefore is a very convenient and unsatisfying plot mechanic.We step entirely outside of reality and rely on CGI to make props appear, even in a supposed stage show. Fortunately you only have to watch the first 20 minutes or so to know that this is not going to satify magic geeks or people who enjoy realistic characters or a coherent plot.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

One of them is that for such a sterling cast, there's very little in the way of likable characters. One, actually, and he takes the fall in the end. But it's hard to see good actors playing awful characters (Woody Harrelson's the one who escapes largely unscathed because he's Woody Harrelson) and it speaks to the flimsy writing. This movie plays fast and loose with internal consistency, straining credibility way beyond acceptable limits. I could even stomach the completely artificial ending if the rest of the movie was grounded in some kind of reality. But all of the tricks and sleights of hand are just flashy effects - these people are more superheroes than magicians.It all really comes down to having a laugh at your audience, which this movie does with glee. Add in the intolerable smugness, A.D.D. camera-work and editing and this isn't an ounce of fun.4/10","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

And, amazingly, it is! It's certainly a novel concept - four magicians rob banks while they're on stage and donate the money to the audience - live! Naturally, the FBI has something to say about this and a cat and mouse game ensues.The first thing to say is that it's an 'all star' cast. Of course the only trouble is that, having so many talented actors in one place, means not all of them get the screen time/character development they deserve. The direction is slick and the film looks and feels like part of the 'MTV generation.' It is a case of 'style over substance,' but there's so much style that you should just sit back and enjoy the ride. Once you get involved in the chase then you'll forget about any slight lack of substance.With any big budget movie, you may have to 'suspend your disbelief' a bit, but, again, if you're munching popcorn and just enjoying trying to guess what's going to happen, you should be able to forgive the film for one or two leaps of faith.Now You See Me is absolute 'mind candy' - simply something to enjoy. Don't take it too seriously and you'll be guaranteed a couple of very entertaining hours film-watching.It is 'original, exciting and unpredictable,' but don't go adding 'realism' in there, or you may end up being a little disappointed.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The cast was great and the twists throughout the movie were unpredictable. As I hadn't read any of the reviews, I didn't know what was going to happen at the end, which made it more enjoyable. It was good to see some old faces, like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Woody Harrelson, who were a great addiction to the new faces like Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo,Dave Franco and Isla Fisher, who was a brilliant choice by the director. It's has a very original concept which was well put together by the director and the pace of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's not very often that I say this, but i hope that there is a sequel. Brilliant!Round-Up: After watching the first half an hour of this movie, I didn't have a clue were the storyline was going to go, but it just gets better from one scene to the next. It was also good to finally see a movie that doesn't include a romantic element because it gets straight to it, right from the beginning. In a lot of Jesse Eisenberg's movies, I find his voice really annoying and he talks way too fast, but it seemed like someone had a word with him because he was quite good in this film. The mixture of wit and seriousness was put together well, along with the action and drama. The only question that I have about the movie is, what happened to Michael Caine's character? Apart from that I couldn't find that much wrong with it.Budget: $75million Worldwide Gross: $234millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there movies about magicians robbing banks with the FBI on there tail. 8/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Also, I really like the score of the film, after watching it, it's actually always stuck in my head.

Like the Stanely Donen classic, ""Now You See Me"" is built on a series of plot twists and character turns in which no one or nothing is quite what he, she or it appears to be.The always engaging Mark Ruffalo is the skeptical FBI agent trying to catch the criminals in the act, while old pros Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman have the time of their professional lives as a veteran magician and a veteran magician debunker, respectively. Their scenes together are alone worth the price of admission. And Ruffalo is perfection as the slightly disheveled and perpetually outmaneuvered law enforcer who finds himself up against a quartet of antagonists who always manage to be a good half-dozen or so steps ahead of him.It's hard to overstate just how much fun this movie turns out to be, with well-earned kudos going to Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt for their infinitely imaginative screenplay, Louis Leterrier for his turbocharged direction, and all the technical wizards who've engaged in a little legerdemain of their own by making the magic scenes so seamless and convincing.And if it all doesn't seem entirely plausible in the end, and you walk away with the nagging suspicion that the writers must have cheated in some way - well, that IS the power of magic, after all.Hollywood filmmakers please take note: THIS is how you make a crowd-pleasing blockbuster!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

From the beginning the movie was screaming for its dismal quality with the trailer-like opening but since I rented it I decided to soldier on at the expense of 2 hours of my life. The first thing that struck me was the theatrical acting of the stars. You can probably put up with one or two and tolerate the overly pretentious acting of the minions for the magicians and the cop for a while but when heavy weights like Morgan Freeman and Michael Kane join the crowd with the same bad acting the movie becomes just unbearable. Everything about it; the french cop who fills up for the pretty brainy character, the car chase scenes, etc. so cliché, so cheesy that I can't remember a single scene which deserves a few good words to balance the score. On top of that, the never ending background music of the soundtrack is very distracting and annoying. Just when you think you deserve some peace after sitting through with this typical Hollywood trash your intelligence takes a deadly blow with the stupidest final twist which is beyond description. This is a bad, bad, bad movie you should avoid even if you're offered money to see it.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

I was definitely disappointed that we didn't get to see much of the four illusionists and learn more about them, but i still enjoyed the movie and all of its plot twists.

The previews make you think that story follow the four magicians, played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco. However, the characters with the most screen time are actually an FBI agent played by Mark Ruffalo, an interpol agent played by Melanie Laurent, and a washed up magician played by Morgan Freeman. Guess what? I didn't know any of those actors were even in the movie. The movie also didn't seem to have an identity. It constantly jumped back and forth between magic not being real and then certain things not being possible without magic. This constant uncertainty from the film's perspective created a lazy feeling in the script. As for the individual characters, Woody was hilarious, Isla was absolutely gorgeous, and Eisenberg was, well, the same character he always is. Which reminds me, can we stop calling Jesse Eisenberg a great actor? The kid plays the exact same role every single time and that's who he is in real life. He isn't ""acting"", he's just playing himself in different situations. Back to the movie, it had decent plot development but with so many characters involved, none of them were really fleshed out properly. Lastly, it had the typical twist in the end that's become almost clichéd where it wasn't written into the story well but just forced on the viewer. All-in-all, if you want to be mildly entertained with over-the-top magic tricks and a chaotic story and then toss in a romance for no reason, this is the movie for you.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

They twists are so frequent that it will not give much time to the viewers to settle.Acting is average to good and probably the weakest part of the movie, first of all the characters hadn't been introduced properly in the movie and few of the actors were not up to the mark. Jesse Eisenberg is a talent but the way he acted it seems that he is still in the hangover of 'The social network', Mark Ruffalo was very impressive so as Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were good, Melanie Laurent seems to be lost throughout the movie, Morgan Freeman is a genius and was spot on but sadly the talent of the great actor Michael Caine is purely wasted as he was totally underutilized. The only problem with the movie is that the movie had lots of talented actors and stars who were either not utilized to their capacity or wasn't given enough screen space to showcase their talent.The Climax of the movie is fantastic and will give a feel good factor for the layman viewer like me. Climax the strongest part of the movie is nicely written and beautifully portrayed, for me this is a decent one time watch movie which will keep you engaged throughout and will put a smile on your face at the end of the movie.

Wait, that's the key to a great magician's illusion. Actually, here's the real trick: both are very similar in structure. Each requires a setup of events which lead to an amazing reveal, followed by an explanation of how the heist/illusion was performed. In Now You See Me (2013), both the heist and magician genres are found to be so closely related that it was nice to see them meld together so well.In a page ripped straight from Robin Hood, the main characters justify their thievery by stating that their actions are to right the wrongs done to the general public. Of course, when a movie uses CGI to enhance the magic of the actors, it's just that much more fun to see how they are able to pull off each heist using their skills as magicians. A successful magic act relies a lot on the stage presence of its magician, and the comedy of the ""Four Horsemen"" certainly helps the levity of the film remain high, even during moments of doubt.Part of me is a little surprised it has taken this long to combine the heist and magician genres. Sure, there were more character-motivated magician movies like The Illusionist (2006) and The Prestige (2006), but neither of them had the heist angle that Now You See Me does. Plus, with modern technology making traditional magic more difficult to fool an audience, the more advanced magic of the Four Horsemen made this film just that much more enjoyable.A film full of flash and fun and the requisite number of twists, I give Now You See Me 4.0 stars out of 5.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm not really into summer movies because most of them are just great at first look but when you really think about it, they're somehow awful; barely a number of summer movies are really commercial and critical success, and I think I could count Now You See Me in the list. I just saw it yesterday and I thought it was pretty good. It reminded me of Chris Nolan's film about magicians also, The Prestige, starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Anyways, watching the film makes me feel the suspense, drama, action, humor, wit and most of all, wonder. The acting from the stellar-looking cast makes it wonderful, especially Freeman, Ruffalo, Eisenberg and Harrelson. Louis Leterrier did a great job directing this film. The visual effects, art direction and the score is amazing- not that awe-inspiring but amazing. The story itself is awesome but the screenplay really needs some polishing. I mean, sure the story is witty and fun and mind-bending, but the characters' back story and development through the story wasn't presented very well. The four magicians remained stagnant and Dylan the agent is just a gift wrap to make us all believe that he is just an ordinary man when he in fact is the most important character, which is not really a good way of storytelling, considering none of them actually got a chance to develop throughout the film. Anyhow, that pretty much sums up my view of the film. I hope we would get to see some improvement on its sequel, but for now, all I can say is ""Kudos"" to every cast and crew involved in the film, and for those who haven't watched it yet, go see it. Trust me, it will make you see wonder for 2-hours length of the film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In the scene Jesse Eisenberg's character does a magic trick with a cards, and even through few GIFs the trick works, and that blew my mind. Another reason was that I saw the trailer for the sequel, and I wanted to see that, but didn't catch it at the theatre.The cast of Now You See Me is excellent, and that's the first thing I noticed even before seeing the movie. All the actors and actresses are well known, and while they quickly feel like a weird combination, they all work well together. For example it's always a joy to see Woody Harrelson in a movie - if the movie is good, that is, because I've had enough disappointments with movies he was in.While the cast is amazing, the characters are even more awesome, and every actor does their job wonderfully and with skill. In the beginning you very quickly learn the basics about the four magicians, but towards the end they don't have so many lines and it's mostly about the FBI and the Interpol trying to catch them, but during that short while you are introduced to four interesting characters, and while I think there's much more to know about them, I am content with what this film offered me. While it's easier to root for the magicians, Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent's characters also turn out to be more than two-dimensional Lawful Good characters what we are used to in a crime mystery movies where the criminals seem to be more like heroes. The plot of his movie is sensational and clever. It sweeps you off your feet right in the beginning: you see characters and you want to know what that mysterious party wants with them. And as the movie goes on the plot just keeps getting bigger and bigger, larger than you'd think. The film is full of delicious plot twist, and each and every one of those work instead of just being there to confuse the audience. Now You See Me is like a magic trick, with misdirection and all.But this film was so great and well written I'm pretty skeptical about the sequel. How could it be as good, because how could they introduce just as amazing plot twists? Also it never feels good when a director changes between two movies.I'm not familiar with Jon M. Chu, but comparing his filmography with Louis Leterrier's makes me a tiny bit suspicious. But still, I wouldn't want to miss out on Now You See Me 2.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, it tends to be more flash than actual substance.The concept of the film is intriguing, but it isn't done in an all too interesting way. It's just a fast paced film that throws a lot of stuff at you, but never truly lets you absorb what is happening. The magic show scenes are one of the highlights of the movie as it's full of energy and the right amount of flash. My personal favorite moment is a fight/chase scene in the third act of the movie with Dave Franco. It's shot well and has some really nice fight choreography.My biggest gripe with the film is the cinematography and editing. The camera is always moving, either rotating around actors as they talk or around the scenery. It's hard to focus and at times I became nauseated. Editing in the film is incredibly quick, which takes away from taking in some of these elaborate shots. On a positive note, it does get more tamed as the movie progresses mainly in the third act.The cast is fine, but only two characters really stand out. Not that everyone else is giving a bad performance, but the characters they play lack substance or any really good one liners. The best characters are Woody Harrelson's and Mark Ruffalo's. Harrelson's character has the best lines and the best moments. He's funny, charismatic, and at the same time wise. Ruffalo's character is the most developed and intriguing. He's an FBI agent, who seems to have luck always against him and we can't help, but cheer for him. The rest of the cast is either throw away, like Isla Fisher and Dave Franco, or interesting, but underdeveloped, like Jesse Eisenberg and Morgan Freeman.Overall, ""Now You See Me"" is an enjoyable film that chooses flash over substance. Characters are mainly paper thin as they're underdeveloped or pushed to the side aside from Ruffalo and Harrelson. The film has a nice soundtrack that gives it the right amount of energy. However, the dizzying camera work and rapid editing make it really hard to be absorbed into the story. I give it 2.5/5, an enjoyable film that doesn't always engage with it's high concept and original story.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

There's also some French pastry, slender and pouting, along for the ride.Jesse Eisenberg leads a cast of smart ass punks who easily outwit the NYPD and FBI performing magic all over town such as creating a rollover on the Washington Bridge packed with traffic and no one getting killed or I believe injured. Amazing. I realize you have to concede something inside a dream palace but this is not worth it.

Now You See Me is really well done, it's swiftly directed and there are no odd parts, and I knew what kind of movie I was going to watch so I am not disappointed.On the other hand the movie did not surprise me, and the plot is mostly a gimmick you don't care about by the time the trick is revealed. The casting was great: gathering Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harelson... is a key factor of success here. These three are the most powerful and impressive performers of the lot, and Melanie Laurent comes just behind with a different kind of character that does help keep the story on track in between extravaganza scenes. Mark Ruffalo does the job but is not entirely convincing, yet I reckon the part was written in such a way that he must alternatively appear a funny fool and an a-hole, to end up looking a nice handsome dedicated copper... By far, not the easiest job on the lot.I was surprised Jesse Eisenberg received top billing. He must really be hot property after the Social Network, but frankly Woody Harelson is by far the best of the 4 horsemen. Eisenberg looks as if he is not able to play something else than the Mark Zuckerberg type. Isla Fisher has little to play with and is thus underused, as always alas. And there's also a fourth horseman who picks locks but is quite pellucid.All in all the movie runs very smoothly for its 115min runtime but it is mostly ""in your face"" entertainment and will leave no mark as a clever or intriguing movie.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Daniel Atlas, a sleight of hand artist who specializes in close-up magic. Woody Harrelson is Merritt McKinney, a mentalist using his talents to con people out of their money. Isla Fisher is Henley Reeves, an escape artist on the rise and Dave Franco is Jack Wilder, a pickpocket magician with street ninja abilities. The four find mysterious cards that summon them to an apartment in New York. One year later they are working together as a team known as The Four Horsemen, performing at a sold-out show in Las Vegas, where they apparently rob a bank and reward their audience with the money. The film then shifts as we follow Mark Ruffalo, as FBI agent Dylan Rhodes, and Mélanie Laurent, as Interpol agent Alma Dray, as they try to figure out how the trick was done while tracking the Four Horsemen with the help of Morgan Freeman, as Thaddeus Bradley, a professional illusion exposer.Now You See Me starts very strong and is highly entertaining. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect as a young magician and Woody Harrelson's mentalist is great fun to watch. These two actors have always been great working together and their characters in this film just don't get enough screen time. In fact, they deserve a film of their own as we're left wanting to see more of them. Mélanie Laurent stole our hearts as Shosanna Dreyfus in Inglourious Basterds and it's great to see her back on the big screen in such a big movie.As the story races forward, it takes on too much for it's own good. The plot only continues to get more complicated and the more it tries to explain itself, the more questions rise that the film doesn't seem to have the time to explain or answer. Instead of slowing down and proving the story isn't full of plot holes for it's more observant, intellectual viewers, the filmmakers seem to assume that we are just going to trust them. The problem with this is that neither the writers or the director have produced anything in the past that suggests we can trust them. Screenwriter Boaz Yakin past credits include co-writer of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and wrote last year's Jason Statham action flick, Safe. Screenwriter Ed Solomon co-wrote Super Mario Bros, Men In Black, Charlie's Angels and the 2009 Eddie Murphy family comedy, Imagine That. The film is directed by Louis Leterrier, who has also directed Transporter 2 and Clash of the Titans. Enough said.What really ruins the fun is the final twist. This time it isn't just sloppy writing as it was made clear though-out the film, even from the very beginning, that someone else is involved with the Four Horsemen. When the reveal happens it's unexciting and the performance from the 5th horsemen comes off lazy. It's very anticlimactic for such a fast-paced film that was racing towards a climax that was promising us greatness.Now You See Me is just another Hollywood thriller that starts out strong with great characters, performances and promises much but leaves us feeling cheated. Another magic trick that for all it's elaborate and exciting build-up, leaves us with no sense of awe. This is one illusion you'll wish you never knew how it was done.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians that call themselves ""The Four Horsemen"". The group consists of (big surprise) four people: ""Daniel Atlas"" (Jesse Eisenberg), ""Henley Reeves""(Isla Fisher), ""Jack Wilder""(Dave Franco) and ""Merritt McKinney""(Woody Harrelson). They all possess very colorful and somewhat obnoxious personalities. Before banding together to form their group all of them were either street performers or rogue magicians. After each of them receive a mysterious card that leads them to a dingy apartment where they are given access to blueprints depicting amazing magic tricks they establish ""The Four Horsemen"". We then fast forward a year later, they have all become accomplished magicians and are pulling off mind bending performances together. During their show in Las Vegas they claim that for their final trick, they will rob a bank. They pick an audience member ""randomly"" and supposedly teleport them to a large bank in Paris. Inexplicably, they manage to steal the money. Soon enough FBI detective ""Dylan Rodes"" is teamed up with a young ""Interpol"" agent named ""Alma Dray""(Melanie Laurent) and are assigned to capture ""The Four Horsemen"", but they just keep slipping through his fingers.Whilst undoubtedly being fun and entertaining, the story of ""Now You See Me"" is so over the top and ludicrous that at times it feels a bit insulting to someones intelligence. The magicians pull off stunts that could only be described as ""paranormal"" and since this movie is supposed to be grounded in reality, it seems rather silly. The acting is..alright despite being overly comical that comes off as being pretty obnoxious and annoying. The visual effects aren't great, but they're not bad either. The problem with them is that it is extremely obvious that everything is computer generated. The best part of the film has to be Morgan Freeman. He can always make a film feel entertaining and always brings life to the screen. The greatest damage to the film has to be the utterly stupid plot twists. Although everything seems to add up and come together, the plot twists feel childish and unnecessary.The film is entertaining, but chances are that you will forget it in a few days. The characters are shallow, the plot is ludicrous and the twists are childish. The best that ""Now You See Me"" provide is some good popcorn entertainment that you can watch with your friends. This film continues Louis Leterrier's streak of mediocrity.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

If the first rule in magic means you have to be the smartest person in the room, then the first rule to enjoy this movie is that you have to be one of the dumbest persons in the audience. The movie tries to make us think that the more we look the less we will see, kind of like telling us the more we think about the movie the less we will enjoy it. So it is trying to keep our mind centered on the nice tricks and great cast, but trying to keep us away from thinking too deeply at the absurdity of the plot. Now You See Me is all an illusion and the more you think about it the more you know that the tricks and twists are a bit beyond belief. It is a pity because I really like this cast (seeing Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine back together after the Batman trilogy was something I was looking forward too) and they aren't bad in this movie either, but the problem I had with it was that the screenplay was pretty weak and the tricks were unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against smart heist films that use magic and illusions, but this doesn't even deserve to stand against other films in the genre such as Oceans 11 that accomplishes this feat way better than this. The characters could have been developed so much better, but the film introduces them in such a lazy way that I didn't really get emotionally involved with them. I know all the movies don't have to be smart and believable, but at least those that aren't manage to engage and involve the audience in an entertaining way. I didn't feel that way about this silly movie. I didn't feel tricked either, I felt cheated on with such dumb twists. The film begins by introducing us to four different magicians that are all being recruited by some sort of mystery man. First there is J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) who is doing a classic card trick in front of an audience in the street and picking up a girl while he's at it. Then there is Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), who is hypnotizing a woman while blackmailing her husband. The third magician is Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) who is performing a dangerous stunt involving a pool and piranhas. And finally there is Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) a con-magician who distracts people with cheap tricks while stealing from them. These four magicians are all recruited by a mysterious man who gives them a blue print of some great tricks they can work on together. The film then jumps a year forward where we see these four magicians working on an act together in Las Vegas. They are known as the Four Horseman and they are about to pull a live bank robbery from the stage. This is where the FBI comes in as lead investigator Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) begins to pursue the case along with his assigned partner from Interpol, Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). With no definite proof to arrest these magicians they must work together before their next heist takes place. For this, they enlist the help of Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a professional illusion exposer and former magician himself. But be warned, nothing is what it seems in this film as the twists begin.I had high expectations for Now You See Me because it had an interesting premise and the cast involved was excellent. They are all really talented and honestly they did a good job with the weak script they had to work with. My biggest issue was the story which didn't make much sense. I won't mention the issues because I don't want to give away spoilers, but everything pretty much seemed false. I didn't believe the twists and turns the film took. I also thought the entire hypnotic sequences were kind of a cheat to explain how they could perform most of the tricks. The film really defies logic and I had a problem with that considering I never got emotionally involved with the characters in order to forgive those faults and simply enjoy the movie for what it is. I can forgive films that don't make sense as long as the audience is allowed to have fun with the premise and be entertained with what is going on, but that didn't happen with me. I won't be recommending Now You See Me to anyone, but I know some fans will have a good time thanks to the illusions and tricks that the director plays on us.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The ""magic performances"" are lack luster on the big screen. I'm not saying I can't suspend belief but in this film anytime something ""magic"" was happening it was rather underwhelming. The rest of the film you are following a cop that has no idea where he is going or what he should be doing next. If the director was trying to invoke emotions of pity and boredom then job well done. In the scene where the 4 horsemen are in New York worrying about being caught made me realize that I knew nothing about them besides they are magicians and they don't have the best group chemistry. So who cares if they get caught? At this point you have invested more time with the cop and you begin wondering who this story is really about. If you like crime movies there are a lot of choices and some really stunning ones but this film would not be one of them.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

If you must watch this then be forewarned that it lacks any substance whatsoever. The acting is minimal. The writing and dialogue are amateurish. It's billed in the crime category but it falls way short of that. It's billed as a mystery but twenty minutes into it, I didn't care whodunit, I wanted it over. Drama? A big miss there, too. Thriller? Don't get your hopes up. So what does it offer? Not much. It wasn't even entertaining as I lost total interest very quickly.

Just one look at the cast was promising enough, but most of all I was intrigued by the film since it seemed to deal with magic. I guess I wanted to be fooled, as they said in another (excellent) movie about magicians. Being fooled was pretty much everything I got out of seeing this one.'Now You See Me' is all style and no substance, a Potemkin village of sorts. It looks great, has great cast and great special effects, all built to hide the fact there's a key ingredient missing, namely a story. The plot raises a lot of questions which remain unanswered (or get an answer in a ""because-I-said-so"" fashion), and is generally inconclusive, naive and unbelievable to the point where no great names or great acting can save it from wreckage.Some people may mistake this film's incoherence for intelligence and I firmly believe that those people are its target audience. I don't take myself to be any smarter than anyone else, but when I watch a film and see half the things from way too far ahead but can't understand exactly why the other half happens, it's clearly either not a film for me or I'm not the right audience for the film. I could be wrong, but I guess it was made primarily for the people who didn't understand the other (excellent) movie about magicians I mentioned previously. I did find some enjoyment in this one, mainly from an aesthetic point of view, but, honestly, the only thing that kept me watching it past one hour mark was simply gorgeous Melanie Laurent.I read that there is a sequel already scheduled. I don't know if it's going to be called 'Now You Don't', but I for one know I surely won't.4/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The other part of this movie that bothered me was the cast. Whilst you may think it has a stellar cast for me the characters lacked depth and interest, i couldn't find myself engaged with any of the characters and to be honest i thought the acting was poor. If the director cut down on the long meaningless trick scenes and instead built in a story and a background for the characters i would have been more interested.To wrap up my analasys i would say that this film was poorly executed. i think the basic idea for the story was quite good with the twists that it produces but somehow the makers got caught up trying to make an ""epic mindf**k"" movie they forgot to add a story. throughout the whole film i didn't have any emotional responses and quite simply couldn't wait for it to end.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

What if the dollar bill, no longer based on gold, was the only measure of everything, and a grand illusion? Has one become too jaded after watching such blockbusters on end? Well, here we are. Watch my eyes, watch my eyes, don't look around my eyes!Should we first go through character exposition? Please meet an illusionist (Jesse Eisenberg), a mentalist (Woody Harrelson), a spoon bending sleight (Dave Franco) and an escape artist doing (or not) an Houdini routine with piranhas (Isla Fisher). Is that enough of a random crew for you? Good, let's proceed.Teaming up through tarots (no, really!) our ""Four Horsemen"" (of what?) are confronted with a Jigsaw-like setup which, let's say it once and for all, is impossible to achieve without a hefty dose of CGI. Any magic which will follows will be equally impossible to achieve without a green wall. Consider yourself warned – and bored in equal measure.One year later, they are onstage in Las Vegas, for a grand illusion performance that has nothing to do with their conjugated talents apart from throwing card decks to the audience and explaining where a bunny goes when it vanishes. The show is a decoy for an elaborate heist to rob the Crédit Républicain de Paris (again?) to rapturous applause. Morgan Freeman is in the audience, playing The Eye in the Sky with his trademark bonhomie.Sir Michael Caine is there too, of course. Ah, Michael Caine, him of the endless list of cardboard characters requiring a British accent. So can we establish that Caine is evil and Freeman good in this movie narrative? Thank you.Siphoning money through a conveniently placed air duct, the heist relies on CGI and Jose Garcia's innocent-abroad French idiomatics, from La vache to Oh merde. Interpol Agent Dray (Mélanie Laurent) flies in from Europe and is pitched against FBI's Agent Rhodes (Marc Ruffalo, awful as usual). The Four Horsemen are interrogated, leading to more impossible tricks which will be explained by surveillance cameras played in slow motion.Excusez-moi, the French heist being debunked by Morgan Freeman by way of a trapdoor, should we move on? Caine says to Freeman he has little eyes; the plot hinges on who does/did not believe in magic during a money transfer scene shamelessly appealing to Katrina hurricane's victims before dragging forever on a protracted gag. Agent Rhodes reads with his fingers and Agent Dray knows everything as per the plot to progress.Suddenly the Four Horsemen become fugitives and someone imperviously asks ""Now get me an airplane"", which one guesses is part of the perks of featuring in such big budget endeavours. Come on, how many times were you able to shout that, then get one?There is a Fifth Horseman masterminding the whole thing. There is a not bad car chase, lifted from other movies from the most part, but one has no idea what it is doing there. One Horseman appears to be down, not that it affects in any way the somnolent viewer. There is also a red herring or two.A safe full of balloon animals pops open, a scene glossily but ineptly made, and one's heart goes to the prop crew. Now, what could possibly be more insulting than a Katrina's ripoff? Well, a 911 light show of course!No one barely educated in such big budget thrill rides will have any hard time guessing who's the Fifth Horseman: the only reason why being ""Because we say so"". Money IS magic. Everyone is dumb. The true marker of fame is Times Square. Oh la la.A sequel is due in a couple of mouths.

It's a dumb and lazy movie trying hard to look smart for dumb people.Tha cast is stellar but it doesn't matter because plot is stupid, tricks are plain bad and overuse of CGI to make those tricks look cooler is even worse. It's almost as if it was created by someone who never saw a magic show in his or her life.Photography plays a huge role here, because with those constant moving, circling shots, movie tries to make everything look cool and grand and whatever but it just makes everything look even more fake and stupid. It visually tries to hide it's stupidity behind dynamic camera work and lots of CGI.Characters are dumb, cheap and not interesting. Even if he's first billed, the main role isn't actually Eisenberg, however hard promos for this try to make you believe that. It's Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent, everyone else are side characters. Motivations are dumb, plot goes nowhere.There is a reason why Prestige is considered on of the best magician themed movies and Ocean's Eleven as one of the best heist movies. Both movies primarily wanted to tell you a story, a cool story in a smart way. Now You See Me does the opposite, it tries to dazzle you with it's hollow and cheap jewelry, hoping that you're too dumb to think about it, care or see through it. It's like you have two dumb persons of the same level of dumbness but one is dressed in fancy clothes made of white, shiny paper and tries to impress the other dumb person, that also has poor vision.Usually movies like this are around 5/10 because they have the cast and it looks like a movie and it has some OK parts but just because it also made me groan in small fury at moments I'm giving it 4/10.

As a person who LOVES magic and slight of hand, when I saw the trailer to this movie I was very excited. It looked like a crossover between David Blaine and Ocean's Eleven, which I was totally into. But the problem here is: the magic is more out of Harry Potter than out of Penn and Teller. It is not a clever use of techniques or age old illusions, it's CGI and totally unrealistic ""tricks"". This movie would have been amazing if the magic was something that the actors could actually perform, something clever, with thought and actually use of illusionism. Here, the plot is so unbelievable and unrealistic, that to me, it lost a HUGE edge and didn't realize it's potential. I know many people who loved this movie and are confused as to why I dislike it so much. I dislike it cause I have seen run of the mill magic shows that could've been integrated into this film and made it so much better. I came for the magic, I left because I don't BELIEVE in magic, like this movie wants me to.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Besides The Prestige no movie has really captured the (in lack of a better phrase) magic that a good illusion possesses. ""Now You You See Me"" does not help change that fact. The premise is rather enticing. 4 magicians/hustlers are brought together by an unknown player who apparently has seen something unique in each one. One year later they're a rather successful magic act, and in their grand finale one night they apparently rob a french bank from the US. They get arrested, but for some reason the FBI lets them go despite the fact that they left a calling card, and surely had to be at least accomplices. But still it does create some fascination. How did they do this? Who are these magicians? Who is this secret character whose brought this rag tag-team together? Unfortunately the answers are less than satisfying.In a rather sudden switch of focus, the movie from there on in mainly follows Mark Ruffalo's FBI character. It tries to build up a cat-and- mouse game. We're introduced to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine who basically just takes up time in the movie. Which, considering the caliber of those two actors is no small feat. Freeman is supposed to be a successful magic-debunker, but his only real function in the movie is to move the plot along. Caine's character is mainly just a gruff businessman who for some reason uses most of his time jet-setting with his magic act. The movie's biggest weakness is its utter disregard for character and plot focus. The premise is okay, but from there on in it's basically a ""Let's throw ideas at the screen, and see what sticks"" kind of movie. None of the characters get any kind of development. An example is the introduction of a romantic past between Eisenberg and Fisher's characters. This is actually given quite a lot of attention throughout the movie, but it's at a total standstill. Basically, the characters are cardboard-cutouts whose only function is expository speeches.The movie tries hard to be a kind of Ocean's 11 for magic, but fails where that movie triumphs. In the former you always get a feeling that the parts of the team need each other. The heist will fall apart without it. This element is totally absent from ""NYSM"". The characters are given some idiotic cards which is supposed to ""define""them"". Harrelson's character is supposed to be some kind of mind reader, but only seems to be there for comic relief. Isla Fisher's use is also not clear. Furthermore the twists and turns in Ocean's felt somewhat believable, this is not the case in ""NYSM"".That being said the movie does keep a quick tempo, and should be commended for some set pieces. The acting is rather bland, but that's mostly because of the characters. I'm sure the movie will entertain quite a few viewers. Unfortunately this movie seems to believe that it's a lot smarter than it is, and for anyone looking for satisfaction in that regard will be thoroughly disappointed. An okay popcorn movie, but riddled with so many plot holes, and disappointing pay offs that anyone looking at it with a critical eye will tear their hair out.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I mean Inside Man, Set it Off, and Catch me If you Can just to name a few. So 'Now You See Me' was a movie that I wanted to see from the first time I seen the trailer. Not only is it a high class heist film, but it also is starring Jesse Eisenberg (Who reallllly impressed me in the Social Network), Morgan Freeman, and Mark Ruffalo. Needless to say the star power is there. With that said, it's an entertaining movie, however I was extremely disappointed.OK honestly there is more character development in the trailer of World War Z than there is in this movie! You gain ABSOLUTELY NO connection to any of the characters. I mean in the first 4 minutes of Superman there is more character development than there is in this whole movie. (Oh yeah superman review coming shortly after this one.)The story was OK, they didn't go deep enough into the actual motive. The tricks were cool, actually I am convinced Jesse Eisenbergs opening number was a real trick, because I even picked the same number that shows up on the tower. The story took the easy way out at the end, and makes the whole movie feel somewhat pointless, and the journey to the end wasn't very fun because the lack of connection, or feel of motive.OverallAs A Heist Movie 1/5....This is a tough category for me because of other heist movies, and this one DEFINITELY lacked.Entertainment 3/5 It was entertaining, It was bearable. Nothing great, nothing horrible.Billys Overall Movie Scale 5/10 Probably won't ever watch it again, but I'm not mad I wasted my money on it in the movies.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I thought to myself it's got a great cast and an interesting premise that made it look to be a cross between the Prestige & Ocean's 11. Whilst this film has elements of these 2 films, it completely fails to be anywhere near as good as either of these films.NYSM starts off interestingly enough; we begin with 4 magicians; J Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) Merritt McKinney (Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Fisher)& Jack Wilder (Franco) who are all working as 'small time' magicians. They all find themselves drawn together when they each receive a card telling them to meet at a specific place at a specified time. At this stage, they are unaware of who has brought them together and why they have brought them together. We then jump forward 1 year and the 4 magicians are now working together and collectively they are known as 'the 4 horseman' (which is strange as one of them is female). They quickly find themselves being pursued by the FBI and Interpol when they discover that they are pulling off bank heists during their performances. FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) and Interpol Agent Alma Dray (Laurent) are sent into investigate the magicians and try to 'expose' their magic and ultimately bring them down. They also receive valuable assistance from Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman), a former magician who is paid substantial amounts of money to expose magician's tricks.I think the main problem with NYSM is that there was a distinct lack of character development. We get next to no background information on any of the magicians (the only thing we learnt is that Reeves & Atlas used to work together). This meant that I was unable to connect with any of the characters and meant that there was no-one that you cared for or felt sympathy for. The story wasn't particularly engaging and at times I felt rather bored. The acting also wasn't great and I must admit I expected more from veterans like Caine & Freeman - they were both OK, but I've seen better from both of them. I found Eisenberg to be annoying more than anything else. Fisher was OK, but nothing more than that. I was however impressed with Harrelson & Ruffalo and felt that they gave the strongest performances.There were a couple of twists in the film which at least kept this feature slightly interesting. Also some of the visuals were great and I even enjoyed some of the magic tricks. However, for me, I need a film to be a bit more engaging, I need characters that are properly developed and characters that I'll care for. Sadly, you don't get any of that with Now You See Me.Overall, it's OK, but it pales in comparison to films such as The Prestige & Ocean's 11. My advice would be to watch either of those films and skip this one.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Cons:
Fisrt of all we dont get to know the characters at all. The movie fails to cutivate any kind of empathy towards their main characters.
Backstories are mostly non existent, dialogue is bland and consists mostly of pointless threats, cliche ironic comments, and friendly insults which are totally awkward since we never get to see the group actually bond.
The plot, especially anything concerning the actual magic/tricks, was completely inconsistent and full of holes and was the mst dissappointing part in my opinion.
The movie promises magic and tricks and crime and instead we get to see the Hulk be sad and whine for 2 hours.

'when is it OUR turn?'If you just want to watch (preposterously absurd) CG-eye candy and ignore the dialogue - all of it - then by all means, sit back with the beer and pizza. This film has nothing else to offer.It's analogous to bad, or boring, pornography - it's like watching somebody else eat a chocolate cake: it's fun for them, but it's painfully tedious to behold at length. I struggled to get to the end of it, and in fact my thumb was itching to fire-off the FF button through most of the last hour. Not even putting Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman together helped make it interesting.This is an expensive, over-baked, tediously rubbish movie.

Now You See Me is a convoluted gimmick that thinks it's smart but really it's laughably bad. The story is a complete mess, and it's so predictable that when twists are revealed you either rolls your eyes or just yawn, I did both. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but the tagline ""the closer you look, the less you'll see"" screams out the obvious pretty much the whole time, it's so blatant which character is behind the whole trick. I'll admit it's got a flashy cast, but the real shame is that their performances aren't that great. Eisenberg's nerdy charm is starting to wither away, Harrelson's comedic timings are poor, but Isla Fisher boasts the strongest stage presence as one of the four Horsemen. The real shame is that Dave Franco is severely underused. It's actually Melanie Laurent that delivers the best though, as a French interpol agent who is very witty and smart, and her character arouses suspicion as the camera seems to focus on her quite a lot hinting at something. The police in this movie are portrayed as complete idiots, always one step behind the magicians, and the cat and mouse elements really suck. The action is vapid and boring, the only decent scene is Franco and Ruffalo's fight which only lasts for a minute or two. This movie disguises itself as clever spectacle, when really the awe of seeing real magic is taken away by the CGI which makes all the tricks feel even more fake than they already do. Seriously, you're better off watching an episode of Dynamo.

But at the end, when it was confirmed, I felt no sense of elation at all. Compared to, say, with The Usual Suspects, when I figured out who Kaiser Soze had to be and it was revealed, I was absolutely euphoric in the theatre. I excitedly nudged the person I was with and said, ""I knew it!!!"" It didn't work with Now You See Me because it had no weight; it was totally unearned.Movies about magicians have to have some semblance of believability at the core; I'm thinking of The Illusionist and The Prestige, for example - both brilliantly realized films that manage to walk the tightrope between wonderment and plausibility. This piece of garbage takes the opposite route: it insults its audience in so many ways that I couldn't even begin to mention them in a decent-sized review.Can't believe they're actually doing a sequel, which I will NOT be seeing. And I can't believe Boaz Yakin(of FRESH fame) had anything to do with this train wreck of a monstrosity of a lame two-hour long plothole.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

So much so that I can't even remember her name or almost anything she did in the movie despite having just seen it 4 hours ago. Had she been cut from the movie completely, it would have lost nothing. The 4 horsemen were a little flat - they don't really go anywhere. Since most of this movie is from the FBI point of view I guess that's to be expected. It was a real waste of a really talented cast though. Things felt a little choppy throughout as well, but I chalked that up to the nature of the movie - distraction and misdirection. On the upside, I did LIKE the movie. The tricks really carried it and made it entertaining to watch despite the flaws. Or at least, they did right up until the last 15 minutes. I don't want to provide spoilers, you can hit Wikipedia if you want to know the plot. However, be prepared for a MAJOR splash of WTF water at the end of the movie, and not in a good way. Yes, you find out the ""big reveal"" and that's okay. But then you find out the WHY behind the whole thing, and it make absolutely no sense at all.

Unfortunately the tricks are incredible because they just aren't feasible. And the explanations provided and the reveals told as this movie goes on become incredibly insulting in the final third of the movie. And since virtually none of the characters are likable, it's difficult to know whom you hope comes out on top.

I don't particularly need a good guy and a bad guy defined for me - but I'd like someone I could empathise with a little.

It's far from horrible, but it definitely doesn't warrant the success that it got. There are magic tricks here, but I didn't feel any of it. Magic should not have such a dull aura surrounding it. Heck. Even the Incredible Burt Wonderstone was more entertaining than this movie. This movie is propelled by such an amazing cast, that one might be willing to overlook the lack of substance. I'm not one of those people. We don't know all that much about The Four Horsemen. We don't know what makes them tick, or what flaws they have. I'm more than capable of ignoring stuff like this, but it was really needed in this movie. It can throw all the flash it wants at me and it tries to do just that, but I didn't buy into it. I get the feeling they went out of there way to show the impossible instead of focusing on engaging their audience like they should have. It's just way too cute for its own good. You can only throw so many fancy escapes at me before I get bored. Am I being too harsh with it? Maybe, but with this amount of talent it should be much better than it is, and there is no excuse for it. My biggest gripe in this movie is the huge twist ending. It angered me in a big way. I actually yelled ""OH, COME ON!"" out loud as soon as they revealed it. Not only does it lack logic, but it didn't make much sense. I do like twist endings. They often knock me on my ass, but this one was just needless. Other people may feel differently, but I was already unimpressed with this film. The twist ending made it worse. Jesse Eisenberg is simply OK. He's proved to be very talented in the past, but he came across as arrogant with no depth here. It's not a great performance. Mark Ruffalo delivers a very good performance. His frustration is deeply felt, and he probably gave the best performance in this movie in my opinion. Woody Harrelson is always solid no matter what he's in, but he's also a victim of circumstance. He lacks depth like the others do. Isla Fisher is sassy and great to look at, but that's about it. Dave Franco is the younger brother of James Franco, and shows plenty of potential. Mélanie Laurent has her moments, and had decent chemistry with Ruffalo as his partner. Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine add class to the proceedings, but I just wish they were in a better movie. Freeman's part is a big bigger, whilst Caine's is rather inconsequential for the most part. Final Thoughts: I didn't hate this movie, but I was so disappointed with it. It's typical Hollywood. After I heard what a hit it was with audiences, I was actually excited to watch it. The lack of substance is too much to ignore. A sequel has been green-lit. I just hope they put a little more effort into the sequel than they did with this one. 5.2/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The illusion of magic is achieved through confidence and misdirection, perfect ingredients for a tricksy plot. Yet many of the best thrillers are also already confidence and misdirection without the aid of magic; confidence tricks within plots, but also, the guile of the film-maker in misleading his audience. And there's even a further layer – one watches a fictional story on an implicit assumption that it obeys a set of rules implied by the way that the story is told – but the film-maker can break this compact. In extremis, magic in movie can actually be real.Which means that the film-maker has many layers of illusion at his disposal; but also the temptation to over-egg the pudding. The set-up for 'Now You See Me' is corny but brilliant – four cocksure, mainstream, Las Vegas magicians may (or may not) have engineered a real crime under the cloak of their magic. To work, such a film needs to have a theory of how this could be done that is both cunning and plausible, one that can trick both the victims within the story, but also the real world audience. And if the film seems to hint that there's real magic behind the trickery well, that only adds to the atmosphere. But the power available to the film-maker can also be abused. In this film, as in Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige', a character ""disappears"" by falling through a trapdoor. I have no idea whether real world magicians are sufficiently skilled to distract their audiences from noticing. But I'm sure that in neither film was an actor filmed falling through the door, but rather that the disappearance was conjured only in the editing room. The director could defend himself by claiming to be showing what the in-story audience believe they are seeing (as opposed to what they really saw), but this means that the film's real audience have no independent appeal to their senses, have to take it on trust even as they're being deceived. Although it's not a magic film, the plot of 'Now You See Me' has elements that resemble 'The Usual Suspects',- a film whose final plot trick was both breathtaking and inane (with the appearance of a character the film had just explained to us did not actually exist in a layer outside the story in which he had been created).'The Usual Suspects' was, nonetheless, well done in a way that 'Now You See Me' is not. The tricks in this film might be technically explicable, but they're so over the top, so sophisticated, so contrived, they're not remotely plausible – indeed, they seem to have been conceived by the scriptwriters mainly because they make for good cinematography. And the plot's final bait and switch, and revealed revenge motive, are tired devices. One thing I did like, though, was the swaggering stage personas of the magician-criminals – you could certainly believe that such a crew could pull something off, though sadly not this – a more modest affair might actually have been good.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Come on ... who wouldn't get excited about a movie that mixes magic with the heist genre, and fills the cast with stars old and new? Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) is clearly engaged with the material, and maybe his vision of ""just one more twist"" is what keeps it from reaching the next level.Magic is inherently a very difficult subject for movies. Why? Because with magic, human nature is such that we are always trying to ""catch"" the sleight of hand. With movies, we have come to accept the fact that any special effect is possible. We rarely ask ""how"". That kind of takes away the mystery, eh? Maybe the best magic movie to date is The Prestige, but even that movie was made stronger by the story of its characters ... something this latest lacks.Heist movies, on the other hand, have historically produced some of the most fun and thrilling times on screen. Everyone loves a clever caper ... so long as we aren't on the wrong end. What doesn't work in either genre, and especially when they are blended, is a story that defies logic. We don't mind being tricked. In fact, it's kind of fun getting to the end and realizing you are part of the ""gotcha"". What we don't like is being cheated.The premise is terrific. An unknown benefactor secretly assembles The Four Horsemen - a hand-picked (by a hoodie dude) group consisting of Jessie Eisenberg, the smug super-illusionist; Woody Harrelson, the wise-cracking mentalist; tart escape artist (think Houdini with piranha) Isla Fisher; and street-hustler pickpocket (Artful Dodger type) Dave Franco. The group is bank rolled by industrial tycoon Michael Caine, and is soon enough headlining a giant Las Vegas extravaganza. Their trick is to rob a French bank vault by transporting an audience member, video streaming the job, and showering the audience with the stolen cash. They do this under the watchful eye of magic naysayer Morgan Freeman, a huckster who earns a buck exposing the tricks of magicians.Soon enough, an FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) are working together trying to stop the next job, which Morgan Freeman has warned them is really a set-up for a huge finale. The movie has some really fun moments, but with all of Morgan Freeman's warnings that we (and Ruffalo) are always a step behind, we can't help but think ahead ... and there is only one super twist that makes all of this click.In fact, I would argue that there are too many twists here. The basic story was enough and would have benefited from us getting to know the main characters. Instead, they are merely chess pieces who spout one-liners in order. In particular, the characters of Woody Harrelson and Melanie Laurent could have gone much deeper. But that clashes with what the filmmakers were after ... big, fast, wild, glitzy, cute, clever, and twisty. So don't be tricked into thinking. Turn off your brain and take in the wild, twisty ride ... even if it does defy logic, and we know ""it's all part of the show"".","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

There was no in dept story behind the characters, nor was there a clear cut idea of why they were doing what they were doing. It just seemed like a lot of fast pace needless action.

First, a good performance from Mark Ruffalo, though I remain skeptical of his 'talent'. Second, a very bland sense of boredom by the time it all wrapped up. I had hoped for a bit of The Prestige, just a little bit, but that wasn't there at all. I was ready for some fascinating tricks on screen, and got none of those either. Most of the acting is more like overly confident mugging for the audience. Woody, in particular, never seems to become all that engaged in his part. He moves from scene to scene beaming as if he is actually doing something when the only something there for us is his half sneer/half grin over and over and...then there is the Morgan factor. Mr. Freeman is in yet another film playing the same Morgan Freeman character you are already bored with. Over the years the cinema industry has always had a few aging stars that are inserted into way too many films. Thus, the Morgan factor. Think of him as the new Wilford Brimley. This is the sort of movie that most will soon forget, if they haven't already.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But still, it might actually turn out to be an alright movie, given the rather impressive list of cast ensemble.However, ""Now You See Me"" turned out to be nothing more than a mediocre storyline wrapped up in a display of impressive effects and topped off with some big names on the cast list. It was, for a lack of better words, not an overwhelmingly entertaining movie.The storyline was adequate, but it just lacked that one magical ingredient to make it truly outstanding or at least leave the audience with a resonating memorable movie. But no, director Louis Leterrier didn't manage to do that.What did work in favor of the movie was the fact that it was a rather unpredictable storyline, and the audience was left in the dark, so to speak, and were guessing about what was going on most of the time. And that kind of uncertainty and unpredictability did count for something.And some of the magic tricks performed were quite interesting and spectacular, for sure. But it just didn't really work out all that great to form a movie around a mould of magic tricks.Then there was the impressive cast list, of course. And I must admit that I had hopes for the movie given the fact that Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson and Michael Caine was on the cast list. And while the individual actors and actresses did perform quite well, they just weren't able to step out of the shadow cast by the concept of the movie.""Now You See Me"" turned out to be a mediocre movie experience for me, and I wasn't particularly impressed.

I consider ""The Prestige"" to be one of my favorite movies of all-time. There is just something about the concept of ""magic"" that I think really translates well into the cinema. Unfortunately, ""Now You See Me"" doesn't take full advantage of those possibilities.For a basic plot summary, this film sees a famous magician (Jesse Eisenberg), an up-and- coming conjurer (Dave Franco), a beautiful stage performer (Isla Fisher), and a mentalist (Woody Harrelson) team up to create the greatest performance of magic ever seen. When they supposedly rob a bank through the use of magic, they draw the interest of an investigator (Mark Ruffalo) and a ""magician debunker"" (Morgan Freeman) to try and find out just what the heck is going on.""Now You See Me"" is a movie filled with a lot of ""flash"". The chemistry between the actors is very entertaining, the action scenes are visually impressive, and the film moves along at a brisk case. Those watching it in theaters were likely consuming a lot of popcorn and getting a large number of thrills from the experiences.The trouble is (and what cements this movie as decidedly average) that the flick promises far too much than what it can actually deliver. For example, ""The Prestige"" promises to bend the mind but then actually does it. Here, director Louis Leterrier promises similar things (he sets up the movie like it will amaze you in the end), but instead just provides a ho-hum ending.Thus, it isn't so much that the film is bad, per se, but rather that it promises the world and only delivers a sliver. You might like it for the pizazz and crackling dialogue/action, but don't expect anything mind-blowing (confusion is more of the end result).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's the two words for me to describe this movie. Absolute lack of charm in a movie demanding one. A 75 million dollar budget spent ridiculously. Both me and my girlfriend left the theater with a bad taste, feeling we have chosen the wrong movie to watch. I was deceived by the trailer, the relatively good IMDb rating and the majority of good reviews. I didn't expect a masterpiece (based on the reviews), but it turned out to be much worse.The plot has some originality and it's mildly entertaining throughout but never lifting, never intriguing and never building real suspense. So when the end came there was almost nothing to look for. The resolution was quite bad, very loose, having a weak logical connection to the rest of the plot. Unfortunately, because earlier parts of the movie never built any suspense, I wasn't even disappointed.I think the director is to blame for all of the movies' faults. First is the lack of details. Sure, some of the tricks are shown, but some are not (how did they have access to bank accounts? how did they show immediate change of numbers on paper?). Some of the scenes look very awkward and very unrealistic (the chase part, all the last show). The second fault is the focus on the characters. Upon reading the plot and seeing the trailer, I expected the magicians to be in the center of the plot, but the focus is clearly not on them. Their characters lack substance and I ended up not caring about them throughout the entire film. The third fault is the CGI and the flashy lights. There is not much of them, but when they are present, they are boring and redundant. They didn't try to make them interesting, but to fill some space. The fourth issue is regarding the plot. There is no clear balance of power between the characters. What are the motives of each characters? What stands behind their actions? And the one-line explanations at the end to those question is just not enough. There is a good amount of reviewers here praising the movie, and so the score is probably representing the average. However, in my opinion, anyone who likes the movies to have a strong logic, with down to earth approach and with things to be explained (and not just happen somehow), should skip this (at least at cinema). To make my point, I loved 'Prestige' and 'Oceans' 11' and I didn't like 'The Illusionist' for the reasons above.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Remember the crushing feeling of disappointment as it is revealed that the trick is nothing more than smoke and mirrors? You will experience a very similar feeling after watching Now You See Me.Louis Leterrier's 2013 thriller follows Jesse Eisenberg and his band of magicians known as The Four Horsemen, as they perform audacious crimes disguised as tricks, all whilst being followed by Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent. It all starts off very promising, as the horsemen rob a bank in Paris from their stage in Las Vegas leading to a cat and mouse chase in which we are not quite sure who is the cat and who is the mouse.Leterrier adopts a fast paced, dynamic style throughout the movie, meaning we never really have a chance to get to know the characters or their motivations. There are a few action set pieces which, whilst impressive, feel slightly out of place. We are asked to suspend disbelief a little too much, as we see this band of magicians using fighting skills more commonly associated with Jason Bourne. But perhaps the biggest issue with Now You See Me is the lack of character development. Despite gathering a cast which includes Micheal Caine, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson and Mark Ruffalo, the movie never really explores these characters, they are merely tools used to enhance the story which isn't strong enough. As the movie progresses, a feeling of disappointment begins to seep through. The running theme of misdirection often leaves the viewer unsure of anything that is happening and you find yourself second guessing every plot turn. This wouldn't be a problem if the movie had a satisfying resolution but, unfortunately, this does not prove to be the case. Answers often fall flat, plot twists feel predictable and by the time you reach the end, you realise that it is nowhere near as clever as it would have you believe.

The monologues of the characters (and there are a few, so if your not into that, it may not be the film for you) felt shallow and basic, the characters were ok, but nothing particularly special. The only thing that kept my interest in any capacity was the sci fi technology used, and even my interest in that was severely sapped as most of the interest in it was routed around the mysteries of which were mad no longer mysterious to me.Main takeaway -
great the first time, but don't rewatch it
and don't watch the sequel.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I realized, movie was going down-south from this point and it indeed never recovered. I am not saying that the movie was bad, but if you go with high expectations, you will be disappointed. It's easy to build expectations with cast like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, one of them had literally no role.

I think we see quite a bit of nothing and if there are some ""secrets"" planted they're safely ignored. Watch and forget would be my advice.This is great for anyone wanting some empty entertainment without actual meaningful content. There's no character to feel or rote for as its little more than shadows dancing on a screen. The actors do a pretty good job for the most part. At least the males Jesse Eisenberg as Daniel Atlas, Mark Ruffalo as Dylan Rhodes, Woody Harrelson as Merritt McKinney and Dave Franco as Jack Wilder are both entertaining and act with some skill. Sidecharacters Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley and Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler are both old pros and deliver as usual, but not much more. Doesn't matter that much when you're one of the greats.The female actresses Isla Fisher as Henley Reeves and Mélanie Laurent as Alma Dray are not as good, but hard to tell if that's the lines they got or if they're simply boring eye candy. They're both OK if expected to just do their respective parts.The story itself is thin, a little bland and far-fetched and on top of that is built a mirage of claimed fantastic performances, that are well presented, yet are so boring. It's like a standard Las Vegas show without any titillation.At no point do we see anything that _feels_ remotely magical for real. You can compare to a great film like ""Prestige"" that is far more interesting with deeper story leaving you confounded and with a sense of magic on your footsteps. Not so here, but at least we got entertained.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This particular one throws in the magician angle, and it works surprisingly well. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco all do a great job as The Four Horsemen, the magicians in question, and I really enjoyed them. They all have a clear identity, even if Eisenberg's J. Daniel Atlas does get the most screen time, but then again every group needs a face. Would I have preferred for all them to be on the screen equally? Probably, seeing as Harrelson especially was a bit underutilized, but the movie works as it is.Mark Ruffalo also does a really good job as the FBI detective trying to catch these four. Usually in a caper or heist movie such as this one, you can either have the despicable mark that everyone loves to see fooled, or you can have the sympathetic mark, but in that case the actor has to be charismatic enough to pull it off. Luckily Ruffalo is just that. He's angry and arrogant enough that you don't feel bad when he gets fooled, but he's also nice enough that you feel for him and don't mind following him around.Unfortunately the movie is a bit crowded with unneeded side characters. And as much as it pains me to say this, Morgan Freeman is the worst offender. He's a fine actor and literally oozes charisma, but his character has little to no point being in this film. He's mainly there to spout exposition that could have easily been relocated to other characters. Mélanie Laurent has the same problem, though her character might have been bearable if it had been just her taking up precious screen time.Aside from that I can say that it's an okay film. The first half, when we get introduced to the characters and the mysteries, is easily the best part of the film. All the Horsemen are given a really good introduction, the first two show scenes are phenomenal fun and it feels like it's building up to something great.That something turns out to be something of a letdown and I cannot say that I enjoyed the final third or so all that much. It's passable, but when my friends and I discussed this movie afterwards, we very quickly came up with numerous ways it could have been made better. Mark of a poor film writing. It's hard to write a good ending, I know, but at least some effort should be involved.Still, all in all this is a good film. It's fun to watch, the characters are enjoyable and the magic tricks are both pleasing to witness as well as imaginative. The ending isn't the greatest one possible, but it doesn't ruin the film. Give it a watch if you like heist films or stage magic.One question though. Why wasn't the name of this movie The Four Horsemen?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pierce Brosnan, or someone like him would have been a much better choice. Ruffalo just doesn't exude the intellect to adequately pull off a part like this with confidence. Jesse Eisenberg has an ever/never ending ego I just can't digest in any movie. Dave Franco seemed to always try too hard to correctly pronounce every word instead of acting natural. Woody Harrelson, well, can anyone ever imagine him being this smart? Isla Fisher, just like Anjelina Jolie, seems to spend more time worrying about how she looks than how she is acting.

Now you see me starts with introducing four street performers (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco and Isla Fisher) doing cheap magic tricks in front of an audience to earn money. They all get summoned to an apartment in New York by someone in the form of tarot cards. After they get together we suddenly jump to Las Vagas one year later were the four of them (now called ""the Four Horsemen"") perform a big show on stage. During the show they rob a bank in Paris by randomly picking a Frenshman from the audience and 'teleporting' him to the vault of said bank. Robbing banks during magic shows draws attention from several big people, including the world famous Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who debunks magic tricks and insurance magnate Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) who sponsors them. To investigate the theft FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is given the case and is teamed up with Interpol Agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent). During questioning the four horsemen, they react incredibly arrogant and claim that they will always be two steps ahead of the FBI. Because they have no proof they have to let them go, but will Dylan with the help of Thaddeus Bradley and the lovely Alma Dray be able to stop them before they pull of more heists?I have to admit I'm not the biggest fan of heist movies but with well crafted characters, exciting action and a solid plot with believable twists it's possible to make a good movie. Unfortunately, apart from some good action scenes, this heist movie falls flat very quickly. Lets start with the characters: they are all very hollow, very little background is given for the four horsemen and they act so annoyingly arrogant (for unknown reason) that I started to hate them very quickly and was hoping for a scene where they get punched in the face. There is no motivation given for their actions and they can all unbelievably easily break into banks, FBI phones, steal top secret data and what not that I assume they just have superpowers! For example, the fight scene between Dave Franco and Mark Ruffalo had me believing he was the X- Men mutant Gambit, how else could he fight like that being just a stage artist? And normally I like to see Freeman and Caine in movies but here there characters are given so little that they seemed lost and just reading there lines. I only liked Mark Ruffalo but his character was given proper motivation (catch the thieves) and he acted like it. A good plot is what usually drives these movies but after the credits rolled I discovered that there simply was no plot here. No reason is given why the heists are done and there is no character development or chemistry going on. Yes there are surprises and 'big reveals' but they are so far fetched and rely on unbelievable 'one in a million' shots that I started to feel insulted. No I didn't see it coming but if you give your street artists super powers instead of using skillful misdirection in your movie, you can pull of everything and just force me to roll with it right? I also think the movie was given more money then they needed with all those ridiculous special effects and over the top sound editing. The sound effects used here made it feel like your watching the Rohan army charging down on the Pelenor fields but on screen you just see two people doing a 'make the rabbit disappear in a box' trick. Was there money left over or something? Added to the super sounds is the annoying moving shots and shaky cam, it made me feel dizzy at times. I think those moving shots were used in abandon to cover up the fact that there is nothing to see in this hollow movie. I really disliked this movie and felt insulted by assuming I would swallow all the ridiculous things happening on screen and not questioning anything. I think it had worked better by just saying the magicians where REAL magicians who can do as they please. Or if they said ""FOOLED YOU!"" in big letters before the credits rolled. Maybe if you don't mind lack of intelligence in a movie and just want to see some cool effects you might enjoy it. But there are a million other movies that have that so I see no reason to watch this one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Surprisingly disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3036830/?ref_=tt_urv","alexf-25-270614","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25691670/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2014","I had really big expectations for this movie. A number of good (if not very good) actors, a plot revolving around a series of heists, and an impressive trailer meant that I started watching it knowing that no matter what, I wouldn't leave disappointed... ... and I was wrong. I won't get too far into details, but this movie has many wrongs. First of all, though the actors are all pretty good (I liked Zombieland and The Social Network a lot, and am usually not disappointed by Morgan Freeman), they only play themselves. Jesse Eisenberg is a stereotypical pretentious-yet-unsure genius, Melanie Laurent a Frenchwoman with secrets, Morgan Freeman is the old-wise-dog, you get the idea. This creates two problems. The first is that this make it very hard to bond with the characters, but the biggest problem is the other one: the actors never actually play together. It's like seeing several one-man-shows mixed together.Then there's the plot. I promised IMDb I wouldn't include spoilers, and I won't, but let's say that in addition to chasm-sized plot holes, it appears that whenever the storyline seems stuck, we get a one-liner from an actor, dramatic music, and suddenly the plot has changed and the intrigue is back on the move. This would be disappointing if used once, and it just gets annoying when used multiple times. Probably to cover the fact that the plot is indeed not very good. I can see what Leterrier was trying to achieve by giving the movie its fast pace, but this also just leaves the impression that he's actually trying to confuse us so we don't see the movie's lack of actual interest. I'll give it 5/10 stars for its overall slick visuals and because it still didn't bore me enough that I wouldn't get to the -below average- ending. But you should use your time on something better than this, and keep it for that winter afternoon when you'll be home, sick, and won't know what do to.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But for a film that relies upon illusions, this one provides the worst fraud of all - the CGI that is responsible for pulling off the most of the tricks. The entire film is predicated on these guys being the greatest magicians of all and they couldn't even pull off the simple ones without some help from Hollywood.And then came the ridiculous trick about moving money between bank accounts. Who came up with this garbage? Anything is possible in this film because anything is possible in movie land. While it has high production value, it's all wasted on a pitiful script. If you want to see some strange magic inspired movie, see something like The Prestige.

Daniel Atlas"" (Jesse Eisenberg), ""Merritt McKinney"" (Woody Harrelson), ""Henley Reeves"" (Isla Fisher) and ""Jack Wilder"" (Dave Franco) who each have their own special skill set. For example, Merritt is a hypnotist while Henley is an escape artist. In any case, although they each practice their trade in different parts of the country they are brought together by a special tarot card they find after one of their performances and out of curiosity they meet one another at the same address indicated on the card. The scene then shifts to one year later where they have all joined together to form a team known as ""the Four Horsemen"" which is sponsored by a multi-millionaire by the name of ""Arthur Tressler"" (Michael Caine). Yet even though they have become extremely popular what nobody realizes is that all four of them are on a special mission which is yet to be revealed. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had an interesting plot and a lot of special effects which made for some fairly good entertainment. At least at first. However, the plot became more convoluted the further the film progressed and completely collapsed at the very end. That being said, those who enjoy special effects might like this film but in my opinion it should have been much better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

It's loud, flashy and trashy with about as much depth as an empty crisp packet with lots of big stunts and a try-and-keep-up shape-shifting story-line.Four very different magicians, later to be termed the Four Horsemen, are brought together by a mysterious supremo to contrive a high profile, ""impossible"" robbery of a French bank somehow coordinated from their Las Vegas stage-show with a Robin Hood touch of distributing the proceeds to their grateful audience. On their tail is cliché-cop FBI agent Mark Ruffalo, dishevelled, maverick, mildly sexist, you know, the stubbly, tie-needs-straightened type, always apparently three steps behind the criminal gang and a specially assigned, equally stereotypical ice-maiden French Interpol agent whose detective instincts outshine her boorish colleague. From there it's a harum-scarum catch-as-catch-can race onto set-piece number two in New Orleans before climaxing in a predictable big-finish in New York, where all is revealed including the identity of the controlling Mr Big.As for the acting, Michael Caine gets another of his blustering, needless cameos, Morgan Freeman is even more improbably cast as a TV star magician-buster trying to catch up with the group. Ruffalo blusters along gamely however, Woody Harrelson is the leery elder-statesman of the four and I liked the three other younger team-members too.Of course it's all unbelievable nonsense, with a predictable car-chase, martial arts fighting and from-nowhere romance between the seemingly unmatched cops but if like me you go for out-size magic stunts and an outlandishly twisty-turny story, it will happily eat up two hours of your flight time as it did mine.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Ridiculous, clichéd and unrealistic, this action thriller is largely forgettable but occasionally enjoyable.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3503268/?ref_=tt_urv","Pjtaylor-96-138044","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tt_urv","12 July 2016","In preparation for its sequel, I decided to re-watch 'Now You See Me (2013)' for the first time since its initial release. To be honest, it doesn't hold up and isn't a very good movie. It's alright, but nothing special. It thinks it's way smarter than it actually is, its direction is pretty disorientating, its unnecessary plot twist makes no sense retroactively, its characters aren't developed enough and its magic (as well as the film as a whole) is painfully fake and unrealistic. There are a couple of good scenes, but I wouldn't watch it again and the experience is largely forgettable.The film follows a group of magicians, who rob banks during their live stage shows, and the FBI agent tasked with bringing them down. This is a fairly interesting premise, I admit, but the movie fails to deliver on the potential of its story. The 'Four Horsemen' are initially all low-level street performers before they are each given a tarot card by a mysterious hooded figure. This leads them to discover the blueprints to a series of high-end magic tricks. All of this takes place before the opening title (which appears around thirteen minutes into the picture), setting up the rest of the plot. Unfortunately, the 'Horsemen' are largely excluded from the rest of the piece. By that I mean that, aside from a select few scenes, they are seen mainly on stage and we instead focus on the people trying to stop them. This weird perspective shift starts off slowly, but then builds to a point at which the 'Horsemen' are no longer the centre of attention and, therefore, no longer relatable. Since we are mostly at a distance from them, it makes it hard to care what they are doing and even harder to root for them. I think that the filmmakers were trying to instil a sense of awe, to make us feel like we are literally in the audience of one of the characters' shows, but they kind of failed. It doesn't help that the characters' motivations are very weak, as they are simply blindly following instructions given to them. The plot takes a few twists and turns but none of them truly amount to anything. The main twist, revealed at the end, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and is totally superfluous. It feels incredibly redundant, and it's no where near as clever as the filmmakers think it is. It feels very unearned as there are no clues during the film; the reveal is impossible to predict. It is genuinely pointless and stupid, making no sense retroactively. The scenes involving the character in question all fall apart when you know their true nature. It's completely nonsensical that they'd even be involved in the events of the plot. Their motivations are somewhat clear, though their actions are improbable and contrived, and in the end the twist tears the logic of the movie apart.The direction is pretty bad here, too. I don't understand why the director (Louis Leterier) felt the need to be constantly moving the camera. He almost always spins the camera around his characters, to the point where it is nearly nauseating. It really gave me a sense of motion sickness, comparable to a Michael Bay flick, and made the film very hard to follow visually. It also cuts incredibly often, and each of these cuts feels very jarring. The average shot length must only be a couple of seconds at the most. The action scenes rely on shaky-cam and even quicker editing to make them work. Another thing that's annoying is the lack of practical magic on display. Sure there are a few 'legitimate' tricks here or there, but the majority are absolutely ludicrous. For example, one involves the 'Horsemen' creating giant CGI bubbles with their hands, before a member dives into one and floats. The picture takes liberties with the power of mentalism and hypnotism, too, often relying on suggestion and preconditioning for some tricks involving 'randomly selected' people. It also makes the FBI look pretty incompetent, as they fail to see through some ruses which would be very obvious upon closer inspection.The acting here isn't terrible, though the actors do have to work with the material they are given. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are great as always (a scene involving the two was one of the highlights of the flick), but they are bogged down by a heavy-handed and on-the-nose screenplay - not to mention the fact that Caine's character disappears from the movie for no real reason. Freeman's character is largely there to provide exposition, explaining to the audience how some of the 'magic' is done in brief flashbacks, though he often feels omniscient. Mark Ruffalo does what he can, bringing the best performance from any of the leads, but his character is quite unlikable and fairly clichéd. The 'Four Horsemen' (consisting of Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco) are criminally underdeveloped and stereotypical. Each of them is an archetype commonly seen in film, and commonly seen in their own filmography. The first twenty to thirty minutes are awful, as its scenes are all conventional and its dialogue is tiring (it attempts to set up a history, and several personalities, but ends up feeling quite trite). There are a couple of entertaining chase scenes, though, and a fight scene that is as enjoyable as it is dumb. Plus, some of the middle act is actually engaging.Overall, 'Now You See Me (2013)' is a ridiculous and largely forgettable film that tries to be too smart for it's own good. Its twists and turns are irrelevant and nonsensical, and its characters are stereotypical and underdeveloped. The film isn't terrible, but it isn't great, either. It picks up a little in its second act, maintaining a fast pace and having a few enjoyable sequences. Ultimately, though, it's nothing more than average. It's entertaining enough to warrant a watch if it sounds interesting to you, but nothing to intentionally seek out otherwise: 5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, as they catch the interest of the CIA, they are forced on the run whilst performing these controversies. Why are they performing these tricks?

It's a real shame they never thought to actually meet each other and nobody told which kind of film they were supposed to be making.The film starts okay, and continues being okay for a good third of its runtime with some nicely done sequences. Then it starts to go downhill and I immediately started worrying that its vast ego was going to get in the way of a good story. Spoiler, it did.The plotpoints were pulled from a hat. I cannot think of any other way this story could have come together. Numerous scenes have little to no purpose and seem so out of place they could be from a completely different film. There are two plot twists that happen within a minute of each other towards the end that are both astoundingly nonsensical, as they go directly against the tone of the entire film - rendering a potentially decent climax utterly useless as the writers (probably completely unselfconsciously) demonstrate that they don't have anything like the skill required for what they've set up and just decide to throw reveals, dramatic music and camera sweeps into the bucket and hope to bob you don't notice that none of it makes any sense.It is a watchable film, I'll give it that, but I really really tried to turn my brain off only to find my spinal cord telescoping with shock at the unbelievable number of plot holes. I wouldn't definitely not recommend it, but be prepared that it it really seriously, seriously stupid.If the writers are reading this I might suggest they be a little more realistic about their abilities next time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you haven't seen The Prestige it's a brilliant movie by Christopher Nolan featuring two magicians performing illusions on the backdrop of a meticulously crafted character-driven story. Now You See Me however, is all about the dazzle without any of the wit, or overall content for that matter.Let's forget for a moment about the lacking quality of the characters and the story, and instead focus on one of my other main gripes with the film; it's cheapness, specifically regarding the ""illusions"". Throughout the film we are shown a few tricks that are fairly clever and that challenges the viewer to figure out how they were performed. The movie then proceeds to explain the trick, giving us a sense that ""I could totally have figured that out!"" (something The Prestige also did incredibly well). That's all very good, but then the movie puts a ton of CGI-effects on screen, expecting the viewer to accept that ""there must be some logical explanation for this"" even though the writers clearly didn't bother to come up with any. This takes all the enjoyment out of these scenes, which frankly are supposed to be the selling point of the film.That being said, the production values are good, the actors are not bad per se, and yada yada yada... I can't give it too low of a score because of basic stuff like that. But if you're looking for a smart movie on this subject, go watch The Prestige. And if you've already seen it, watch it again. I wish I had.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I tried the 30-day free trial for Amazon Prime because I wanted to see 2 movies on there: Ricky Stanicky; and the remake of Roadhouse. Both were garbage, and I think movie studios knew it and put them on streaming because they knew these movies would've tanked at the box office. Movies have been garbage for years now (The Lost City; Jungle Cruise; Uncharted; The Wolf Man; and the list goes on) and are simply not worth paying to see. I'll only buy the DVDs if they're $2 or less at a thrift store, and even then, as with Now You See Me, that is still sometimes a waste of money. What happened to Hollywood? I don't know, or care.

That's basically my fancy way of saying I didn't guess the ending, it did make sense, and the journey there was fun.I wouldn't say that this is a highly intellectual movie with layers and layers of philosophical questions to ponder over after it's over, but it isn't stupid either. You're not bored by over-complexity or insulted by the inanely simple. I appreciate that balance.The cast is solid but the characters could (and should have) been explored more without any worry over the plot getting spoiled. Because of this missed opportunity you may question the overall motivation of the antiheroes, especially since your first impression of the four magicians is that they are selfish and have no grandiose plans for their lives. This doesn't mean they aren't easy to like, but I feel it does clash with the story later on.The visuals/camarawork are nice (although occasionally too spinney and maybe just a little too glossy), the humor and the romance are felt and enjoyed- no baggage, no complication, no melodrama, and the magic is explained. In real life, we know that commercial slight of hand needs to be left unexplained otherwise it loses its worth, but the makers of this movie know that film must tie the loose ends because the satisfaction is the conclusion, NOT the mystery in and of itself.That being said, I will admit the overall conclusion was left just a tiny bit blurry, which may be due to the hope for a sequel. I'd honestly be okay with that as I feel this film earned it. Moviegoers may begrudge it that open-ended feeling though, if they felt that the explanation was not a justifiable payoff. My advice is to go see it, have fun, and let your belief be suspended. At worst the hypnotism will leave you disoriented and grumpy, at best you'll have a blast and come back down as soft as a feather.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Entertaining, but nothing special.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6436599/?ref_=tt_urv","jvicentecneto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur86831585/?ref_=tt_urv","2 January 2021","A lot of fun to watch, all the main characters have good chemistry among them and their banter usually made me chuckle. The cinematography is pretty good and the choreography of the fights and of the stage performances is quite good as well.
The tricks that are presented as smart, but explainable are all made possible by circumstance and most are only half explained and usually just plain impossible which certainly takes some quality from the movie.
The characters don't grow or learn anything and many of the side plots are simply glossed over and forgotten.
Concluding, it's a fun movie to watch maybe with some friends or after a work day to relax.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","It's like The Prestige and The Illusionist had a baby.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2807425/?ref_=tt_urv","steve-701-747186","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43936460/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2013","I found this movie's lowish ranking incredibly misleading, and I'm glad I decided to go see this one. It's a fast paced ride that will keep you guessing. My movie-buff sister who ALWAYS predicts movies failed to predict this one.Unlike Prestige and Illusionist, all of the ""tricks"" in this flick are actually feasible, and several are explained. This only adds to the thrill as your mind tries to work out, ""how?"", let alone who & why.There is some good action thrown in plus there's a fun mix of fantastic personalities, so it feels like The Avengers at some points.Worth a trip to the theater.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Engaging and entertaining, if you don't take it seriously","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3013648/?ref_=tt_urv","sdmama","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19749530/?ref_=tt_urv","11 May 2014","If you are just looking for some fun, this movie kept me guessing, and I was totally entertained by the big magic tricks and the show. It was not just a ""magic show movie,"" but had some purpose. Main characters are all very likable and funny. I hope some harsh reviews won't keep some people from giving this a try. Just stop trying too hard to make a sense out of the story too much, and let this entertain you. I do agree that this movie could have been better, more character development, more coherent story etc. But it moved fast, and some parts even dazzling, compared to other disappointing movies, I have to give thumb up to this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
