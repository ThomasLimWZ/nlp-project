"5","/10","It's been a while now, but the MCU has really run out of gas....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8879122/?ref_=tt_urv","flicklover","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0266568/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2023","Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being a complete snooze fest. I was actually bored fir much if the film.Just below average in an MCU that is just churning out film after film with diminishing results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films good when they first started. They are getting so formulaic and forgettable.Below average.....Grade: C-","310 out of 376 found this helpful.

What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.","702 out of 896 found this helpful.

This is the third legacy character that they've absolutely wasted. In fact, for Doctor Strange, Thor and Ant-Man they not only wasted great established characters but superb casts. Add that they made Kang, the main villain out to be a chump and it appears Marvel has no plan moving forward. Not Kiang the conqueror but Kang the chump.This movie adds to the malaise of poorly written disappointments that is permeated the MCU since Endgame. With one of the worst third acts of any movie in recent history. MODOK use and ""dick"" turn could be the dumbest thing I've ever seen and that's not even a spoiler. He also ended the movie as if they ran out of budget. What an absolute waste.","447 out of 562 found this helpful.

Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it.","251 out of 317 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A bit unfocussed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875350/?ref_=tt_urv","FeastMode","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104603847/?ref_=tt_urv","17 February 2023","I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe.(3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023, 10/5/2023)","228 out of 320 found this helpful.

Apparently this movie was focused on being acceptable to a broad audience range, including young people, Quantumania loses some of its sharp refreshing focus. The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions. Yes, this movie provides an amazing backdrop or canvas and yet the substance and plot of the movie does not rise to the same level. What one ends up with is a movie with a lot of flash but less than satisfactory bite.","52 out of 69 found this helpful.

Concerned with being picked apart by the internet and Neil deGrasse Tyson. I really enjoyed that Quatumania does more of that old school 70s style weirdness while still having things that hint at the science that inspired it. There are crazy creatures, landscapes and communities all over the place. It put me in the mind of something like 'Flash Gordon'(1980) and that's exactly what I've been hoping for from an Ant-man film.It's not Oscar bait, but it's fun with a cool world that they play in. The cast is entertaining and Johnathan Majors especially, is fantastic as Kang. The film does start to tie all the strings Marvel has been placing together. Which gives what is a popcorn flick a bit more weight.All in all, for me it was what I expected and hoped for.Note: there are two end credits scenes.","6 out of 6 found this helpful.

Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts.","188 out of 290 found this helpful.

"7","/10","It's okay for a standalone movie, but for setting up Phase 5. . .","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8888265/?ref_=tt_urv","chgames-28385","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135574361/?ref_=tt_urv","23 February 2023","Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!","11 out of 13 found this helpful.

There were some lines of dialogue that were a little 'cringe' and I think the ending should have been way different. Scott Lang didnt get sidelined as much, but I wish it was still focused on him, as he had to share the screen with four other protagonists. I think they did the story well, but it went from a darker tone to a more 'marvel tone' towards the end.

Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.","158 out of 265 found this helpful.

However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie.","32 out of 53 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out.","10 out of 14 found this helpful.

The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichés, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat.","15 out of 23 found this helpful.

But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh!

Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

I looked forward to it a lot but it just didn't fulfill my expectations, especially since I enjoyed the first two Ant-Man movies.I felt the plot was weak and quite weird. Something of an explanation just to introduce the concept of Kang the Conqueror. That guy definitely needed a better introduction and story, he was just too anonymous here even though I know him from the comics. They didn't succeed here.Also, the actors that played Cassie and Kang felt bad compared to the other actors.I had high hopes for the other villain (no spoilers here), but sadly they made him more of a joke and wasted his potential. In the comics he's a powerful opponent but here the director just wasted him. Bad character portrait, big disappointment.The movie definitely had cool moments and effects but overall it just didn't contribute much worth to the MCU except introducing an upcoming threat.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

I loved the first ant-man very funny exciting kind of heist movie. The second tho i didn't care for cause o felt the villain could have been a lot better. Which brings us to this movie.

Even the pace was good.The title was the single worst thing about this film; ""Quantumania"" implies some delving into or exploration of quantum effects. I could discern no meaningful connection with quantum effects at all, unless you count the ""probability storm"", whatever that is.The film refers to 'the quantum realm' as if it were a separate place from reality, which you could visit.I did read a comic strip years ago about atoms being like miniature worlds, inhabited by militaristic aliens who somehow escaped into the macro world and caused mayhem. As a fantasy comic strip, that kind of worked, especially as much less was known about subatomic level physics in those days.But the physical feel and production design of this film doesn't even feel like it has a connection with subatomic physics, - even a fantasy one.It comes across more as a kind of fairyland, or (if I'm feeling generous) as belonging to a parallel spacetime continuum.So, apart from introducing Kang the Conqueror, and the bit with the ants, the storyline is nonsense.Also, I felt that the whole concept of being able to shrink or grow with the aid of technology was not used well.Of course we all suspend disbelief when watching MCU movies, as we did with the original comic-strips, but one of the beauties of the MCU films is that they give these fantasies physical form, and make it seem almost as if they could exist in the real world.This film treats the shrink/grow technology as a 'blink of the eye'/'click of the fingers' affair, more like the waving of a magic wand than the activation of a technology. It is the poorer for this.I hope the Ant-man series runs to a 4th film, but also that it avoids these let-downs.Most of all, please avoid the use of terms like 'Quantum' or 'Multiverse' unless you intend to show some actualisation or representation of the science concepts behind these terms.And please may we have a sci-fi element to the story, rather than just some random, disconnected fantasy?","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not trying too hard to be any more than it needs to be. It's an introductory film to Phase 5. Honestly, this movie got bombed with bad reviews of people who forget this movie is a Marvel movie. It's not gonna be a cinematic masterpiece. I was entertained, so I liked it. It wasn't special and there are certainly better Marvel movies. But it's a good introduction to what is coming up next. This movie did what it needed to do, get us excited for Phase 5. Remember, people who didn't like this film are still gonna come back and watch every upcoming Marvel film from Phase 5 and beyond. While it does have a predictable and tame story, 90% of movies are predictable anyway. We don't watch movies for the ending, we watch them for what leads up to it. It's an enjoyable superhero film that people will come back to appreciate if Phase 5 gets it right.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.Overall an one time watch.

I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of.","133 out of 199 found this helpful.

The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair.

I did like the villains for the most part, Kang is definitely not a Thanos (yet), but he has the right tone and I like that he is considerably different from Thanos. The rest of the characters are just kinda rediculous and the Quantum Realm is apparently just a big Star Wars cantina.

Directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, the film delivers on the humor, action, and visual spectacle that fans have come to expect from the franchise. However it seems like the writers and directors are just mix mashing movies together such as Star Wars, referring to Mos Eisley Cantina scene and all of the various aliens you might encounter and other science fiction flicks which is not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn't leave much room for originality.The plot of the film centers around the discovery of a new quantum realm, which leads to a host of new challenges and adventures for the characters. Lang must team up once again with Hope van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) to navigate this new realm and save the world from a new threat.One of the strengths of the film is its cast of characters. The chemistry between Rudd and Lilly is as strong as ever, and their banter provides many of the film's comedic highlights. Douglas also delivers a standout performance as the cantankerous Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer's reasons for hiding the truth from her family were not very well developed or reasoned, while Newton brings a fresh energy to the role of Cassie.The quantum realm sequences are visually stunning and provide a trippy and mind-bending experience for the audience. However the CGI seemed low quality in certain aspects where the suits of Ant-Man and the Wasp looks like they were not even really wearing them, you could totally tell that it was CGI. At certain points it look like the film was trying to be Avatar in terms of visuals yet did not stand up to the quality of it. A plus was the action scenes which were well choreographed and exciting, with the use of size-shifting abilities adding an extra layer of creativity to the fight scenes. The film is not without its flaws.The villain, played by Jonathan Majors, is a pretty badass guy and I felt like he was a good villain for this series yet he seemed quite similar to Thanos in terms of his goals. He has his reasons for doing what he wants to do and I feel like this character could be developed even further. As We Know Marvel is planning to expand on this character because The Kang Dynasty film should be coming to theaters in 2025.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It delivers on the humor and action that fans have come to love, while also exploring new territory in the quantum realm. While not without its flaws, the film is a worthy addition to the franchise and is sure to leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next adventure of Ant-Man and the Wasp.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

The humor was so stale that the theater was silent almost the entire time any form of joke was made (attempted)
Plot was terrible and should've been used for another character that isn't AntMan. AntMans character isn't designed for anything heavily intertwined with plot, and he especially isn't someone to use when introducing MCU's new Villain. This movie seems like they just wanted to get AntMans movie out of the way because they had no idea what to do with him.There's no issues with the casting, however, the new writing makes it seem like they're taking two toys from opposing companies and trying to make it work.They also need to bring back Michael Peña - he stole both of the two movies .","29 out of 41 found this helpful.

Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU.","18 out of 31 found this helpful.

I am very much looking forward to his return and the arrival of his variants. It also is just such a visually stimulating experience. I felt tonally it was pretty decently balanced but as most of marvel's movies go there's never enough action in my opinion (given it is just ant-man i know but still). I feel like the comedic sections weren't too overused and overall the acting was much more serious as it needed to be, which i really liked. Overall as a film i'm giving it an 8 as it was very enjoyable and is a setup of future movies to come which will crave that itch for more Kang to come. The film isn't nothing too crazy or anything over the top but it's definitely something you shouldn't skip on.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible.","99 out of 219 found this helpful.

It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character.

The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.)

VFX were great. The MODOK with big head looked goofy but that's how it should look like. The MODOK did not look unrealistic unlike the floating head in Thor 4.There were some plot-holes, and logical mistakes but overall it was fun, as comic book movies should be.

I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi.

Some sequences are alright and a bit funny, but if funny is Guardians of The Galaxy - then this is not funny at all.. it's the worst Marvel movie...actually worse than Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness.

I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

The daughter grows up to be an annoying teenager that looks confused most of the time, almost like Bella from Twilight.The multiverse just added a whole bunch of nonsensical things to the already watered down marvel franchise movies and this is just going to get worse.

However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

Are sucked into, and subsequently trapped in, the otherworldly Quantum Realm. There, Scott is forced to make a deal with the Devil, or in this case the dictatorial Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the only one with the means to get them home. As the title suggests, the majority of the movie takes place in this subatomic universe, which doesn't look half-bad, considering it's basically a fully-CG environment. It is home to some unique creatures and residents, who have fairly minimal roles and are ultimately kinda forgettable, though the one named Veb was hilarious. The movie wastes no time getting the plot in motion, as we're off into the Quantum Realm within the first 10 minutes, and it's pretty well-paced overall. As far as the cast, everyone does a solid job. Paul Rudd is delightful as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne gets some time to shine in a larger role than expected. Newcomer Kathryn Newton portrays Scott's now-teenaged daughter Cassie, and while it was cool seeing her suit-up alongside her dad, she comes off as a bit unbelievable at times. However, it's Jonathan Majors' Kang who steals the show. He's menacing, intimidating, and has a calm-yet-confident demeanor. I've always loved characters who know how much of a threat they are, like Darth Vader, and Kang definitely fits into that category. I truly cannot wait to see more of him in future MCU projects. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention MODOK, the most perfectly goofy and ridiculous character I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in a movie. Overall, 'Quantumania' is much bigger in scale than the previous films in the 'Ant-Man' series, but still retains most of the humor and heart that they've become known for. In fact, I personally like it better than the last installment, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'. It's a fun, extremely comic book-y (in a good way) family adventure through an intriguing sci-fi world, and I definitely had a good time watching.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer also excel in their roles. The visuals are also well-done.The biggest issue with this movie is the plot. The characters don't develop, it's just like a singular occurrence at the end, like a bad dream, and nothing is produced from it save the conglomeration of Kangs. The humour is also lacking, it's sparse and when it's infused it's always wrongly timed.I hope phase 5 can move on smoothly from the spearhead of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Quantumania seems like an event movie like Avengers, despite never setting up the high stakes in like 1st Avengers, or Infinity War/Endgame.Despite the title (Ant-Man & the Wasp: ....), it's more a Cassie Lang movie than Ant-Man/Wasp movie. This would not be a problem if they had the charming actress (Abby Fortson) from the first 2 Ant-Man movies or the expressive young lady (Emma Fuhrmann) from Avengers reprising their role. But no, here we have Kathryn Newton, who gives a wooden performance in what feels like a completely new character rather than a continuation. This still would not be bad, if they gave equal weightage to other characters but that's not the case. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) tries to do his best but is forced to be almost a 2nd fiddle to Cassie Lang. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is reduced to lame comic relief. The entirety of the movie happens because Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) does not disclose some information in the prologue. This makes no sense as revealing it would not have changed her relationships to her family at all. She carries basically one expression in the film and has been turned into a generic character to cover the lack of creativity from writers. The worst fate befalls Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), who is given practically nothing to do, especially as Hope, and that's extremely disappointing. Kang is an interesting character who keeps us wanting to know more about him both through the character arc and the performance of Jonathan Majors. Jentorra (Katy M O'Brian) catches your eye but is not given anything to do. ALL other characters, including Bill Murray, are completely forgettable.Quantamania itself means nothing here. The story might as well have taken place on another planet or continent. We go in expecting a comic book movie, but there is no reality bending magic or Sci-Fi revelation or visualization about the quantum realm (or multiverses etc.), which was much better expressed in Dr Strange Movies or Loki.Overall, you could watch it if you have a Disney+ (or Hotstar) subscription and a couple of hours to spare, but don't spare extra for movie tickets, popcorn & travel etc. This is one of the weakest Marvel movies till date.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!","31 out of 67 found this helpful.

Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.

The cast is excellent and I've found CGI to be at a good level (considering the amount of CGI that had to be packed into a completely new realm, one or two weird glitches are fine).But the story is written horribly. There is an obscene amount of circumstantial events, multiple characters behave in the way that makes no sense considering their backstory, on several occasions the previously established events from previous movies are ignored, and the expectation of an impending danger in the Phase 5 does not live up to the level we'd expect from Marvel.People interested in storytelling will definitely find themselves thinking of dozens of alternative directions the writers could have gone with this material, because the idea of a quantum realm is incredibly interesting.

Basically so many Marvel films after Endgame have been completely forgettable. Ant-Man 3 is no different. I expected the Quantum Realm to be more wacky and out there just like I expected Doctor Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness to have well more Multiverse. The story seemed very bland to me, it was entertaining but nothing new, we've seen it all a million times before. It doesn't help that some of the story seemed like a carbon copy of Tron Legacy. Scott Lang was missing his heist team here and it shows, the film falls flat without them appearing. Kang is supposed to be bigger and harder than Thanos but was almost a complete throwaway. Watch if you've got nothing better to do but I wouldn't go out my way to see it. Marvel need to do better!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Lame punchlines that was just super cringe, felt like a Hannah Montana disney movie.Paul Rudd is still amazing but his character was lost in the movie. The rest of the cast is just mediocre - not their fault, they probably did their best.The multiverse idea was brilliant but I am afraid it goes into a way that the whole marvel universe will loose its value. Characters can come and go, there are millions of universe so who cares who lives or dies. I also dont feel the connection anymore between the movies.

This gimmicky kind of misplaced Marvel comedy is so redundant at this point. Also, how many times can Cassey and Scott hug before or after a fight in one movie. The best part of Ant-Man Came in the last 5 minutes. I feel like Marvel has done the bright cheery movies for too long at this point and needs to take their movies in a more serious (not necessarily dark) tone but definitely more serious. Tuning into a Marvel movie at this point you just know The formulaic movie that you're getting with not many surprises. Love Paul Rudd so I thought he was great. Jonathan Majors as Kang was great just like I said in Loki but with his personal battles I wonder what Marvel will do. Side note: total bs that Flash is getting RAVE reviews when Ezra Miller is an absolute legit psychopath and Jonathan Majors is being disbanded over accusations that have been dropped. Back to the movie: wasn't huge on the CGI/ scenery. Wasn't huge on the acting. Wasn't huge on the storyline. Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania gets a 6.6/10 for me. I'm on the edge of my seat for Guardians Of TheGalaxy to get Marvel back to that 8+ rating it so routinely sat at for me. Marvel has to step it up at this point as DC appears to be on their heels.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them.","38 out of 62 found this helpful.

He finally reaches the level of respect in the MCU. Of course marvel changed the actress and Google it but she only found out on social media she was being recast.. but Cassie was good and the relationship was cool.This film is basically an ant man titled movie about kang tbe conquerer.They didn't do him ultimate and true justice IMO as if they went clear comic book the outcome would be vastly different. But Jonathan majors is Kang aka he who remains aka lol you get it. This will be amazing once the story is complete but they need to make him a true threat..Overall 6/10. Without going into details.

There is some great acting talent in the film all of it was wasted though. Jonathan Majors was decent in it though, albeit the post credits scene almost ruined that. All in all it suggests that it's about time that Disney ended the continued pursuit of the MCU which has long been past it's best.

The film has some fun action sequences and visual effects, but the story is weak and the characters are underdeveloped.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are both charming as Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne, respectively, but they don't have much to work with here. The supporting cast is also mostly wasted, with Jonathan Majors being the only one who make much of an impression.The film's villain, Kang the Conqueror, is also a disappointment. He's a powerful and menacing figure in the comics, but he's reduced to a generic bad guy here. The film's story also doesn't do much to explore his motivations or backstory.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a disappointing film. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It's a forgettable entry in the MCU that fans of the franchise will probably enjoy, but it's unlikely to win over anyone who's not already a fan.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

He gets plentiful screen time, especially from the midpoint on, and proceeds to steal every scene while single-handedly raising the stature of the film. Some other positives include a fast-moving pace, a solid amount of quirky comedy, and a smidge of self-awareness, though some of Disney's recent fallbacks still lingered, like the cheesy dialogue and shallow relationship drama.

It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor.","18 out of 27 found this helpful.

No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful.","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney.","51 out of 89 found this helpful.

She should've had a bigger role in this story. Overall the movie was very well executed even though it was a little predictable, and it has some funny moments as well. They did a good job with Kang as well and the effects were good as always. I feel though that the movie could've been s little bit longer and I think it would do a lot for the story as well, maybe we will get some good deleted scenes in the future.

He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world.

Others may say that this movie is not as good as it seems, in fact this movie for any Marvel fan, is very important for people to see it especially for those who are optimistic for future MCU movies like Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, since the MCU is taking us far deeper into the Multiverse each time.","25 out of 57 found this helpful.

Its just another Marvel movie with a lot of shortcomings in the storyline.

In this movie, the Ant Family is taken hostage and spread across the Quantum Realm, discovering a truly dangerous madman at the center of this alternate universe plotting his escape. As always, the performances were incredibly fun to watch and it was nice being able to spend time with the Langs and the Pym's as they trek across this vast and surreal landscape.Certain characters get more play than others, which is regrettable. Evangeline Lilly feels sidelined in this film which doesn't feel right given her characters importance in these movies thus far. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer are charming as ever, Paul Rudd feels dynamic and confident in his third solo hero outing, but the real gem of this story is Jonathan Majors and Kang the Conqueror.Unlike He Who Remains, Kang is without whimsy. He isn't playful or charming, he is ruthless and deeply driven to escape the Quantum Realm to continue his conquest across time and space. He is played with genuine menace and arrogance, truly displaying the danger he represents to the Avengers and the multiverse as a whole.Overall, this is a strong, albeit inconsistent start to the MCU's Phase Five with the promise of more adventure to come.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans.

The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It had decent visual FX (I expected more for a film with a 200M budget) and has the humor you'd expect with Paul Rudd. Besides that, the movie is the weirdest and maybe the most unsatisfying MCU movie until now. It reminded me of Thor: Love and Thunder but with ants and a different story. The Story was all over the place. The whole movie is written like a Rick and Morty episode. Jeff Loveness is a talented sci-fi comedy writer, but his script struggles to make the characters distinct or take anything seriously.""Quantumania"" works on one fundamental level, setting up Kang the Conqueror as a formidable and ruthless villain for the upcoming Avengers movie, ""Avengers: Kang Dynasty,"" The movie's highlight is Jonathan Majors's role as Kang the Conqueror. His Kang was fantastic and pretty close to the comics, at least in terms of appearance.Overall I feel like this movie was just a very long TV episode.

So mission accomplished, and done so rather nicely.Without the hitherto spoilers, it's notable to mention that the ""Super Boss Villain"" of this particular excursion into Quantum Land, kind of steals the show, as he excels as easily the best character portrayal in this entire movie. That said, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and other Earthlings do make fairly good plot fillers.All together this is everything we've come to expect from Marvel, and is nice end to the Ant-Man trilogy.A fun and exciting watch, for sure ;)","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The start of a new phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9048745/?ref_=tt_urv","alekspredator87","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52780913/?ref_=tt_urv","11 May 2023","Although ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" promised to be a bright sequel to the franchise, I was disappointed after watching the film. The ragged narrative and lack of drama that were promised in the trailer made the film a disappointment for me personally. That's the problem of inflated expectations, which appeared to me thanks to a really cool trailer.I'll scold the script first. It seems that the screenwriters could not fully develop the potential of the film and forgot about the relevance of the whole action in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Again and again we see an emphasis on penny intrigues and a purely situational turn of events, which, of course, could work if it were combined with something grandiose. Viewers were promised a large-scale conflict between the new antagonist Kang and Ant-Man and his team. In fact, several new and little-remembered characters with jokes aka ""how many holes does anyone have"" appeared before us, and one of the comic villains turned into a laughing stock at all.One of the main drawbacks of the film is the ragged presentation of the material. The film unsuccessfully veers between drama and trash comedy, which creates an ambiguous impression. Sometimes it seems that the film cannot decide which genre it wants to represent and this reduces the quality of the project, literally dropping it somewhere below the baseboard.But the biggest disappointment for me was the expressionless antagonist Kang the Conqueror. The way it was announced by the creators, the way it was shown in the trailer, absolutely cannot be compared with what happened to be seen in the picture itself. The motivation of the character is poorly worked out, although it is worth paying tribute to the actor Jonathan Majers, who tried, there are no questions to his game, but there are a lot to his hero. The character turned out to be just boring and is forgotten literally five minutes after viewing.The already familiar heroes in the person of Ant, Wasp, Pym family and Scott Lang's daughter were not impressed either. Banal dialogues, movement for the sake of movement, scenario moves do not leave a chance for real drama in this project, although it begins a new chapter of the Cinematic Universe and was announced as a large-scale epic. However, it is worth paying tribute to the visual effects team. The picture is at a height. The quantum world into which the main characters fall is able to surprise the viewer with its scale and all possible colors. The imagination of the creators pleases, showing unusual pictures of a tiny world.In general, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" is definitely not the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A weak drama, an ill-conceived script and a passing plot do not allow this film to stand out from other projects. If you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, then this movie is certainly worth watching, but you should be prepared for the fact that after watching it, an unpleasant feeling of disappointment may remain.6 out of 10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

But then, Marvel had to weave movies together and every movie had to be part if some bigger scheme. I like standalone movies that just tell a good story. I don't appreciate that a villain is ""introduced"" so he can re-appear in some other franchise. And enough with the bloody multiverse. What a drag. Dr. Strange, Loki, Ant-Man, Spiderman..,
Ant-Man worked in the real world, much like Spiderman used to work. 90% blue screen does not do the characters or the movie any favors. It's just a boring mess of flashy images and lights.Take it down a notch, Marvel. You are losing that speacial ingredient that made for great movies.

It's a fun film; fitting with the tone of the first two.I have 2 gripes with this film, both cast related. First off, without Michael Pena, this isn't quite as funny. He stole the a lot of the scenes in the first 2 films. Also, I get why they recast the excellent Abby Ryder Fortson for Endgame (the actress would have been too young to play Cassie Lang for the 2023 time frame of Endgame (Emma Fuhrmann, 17 at the time of filming, fit Cassie's MCU age of 16 better, and actually resembled an older Fortson), so *that recasting* made sense. But in the time-frame of Quantumania (which takes places in 2025) Cassie's supposed to be 18, Furman was 21, but definitely could've played 18. Instead they recast someone even older... Katherine Newton was 25 during shooting, doesn't resemble the other 2 Cassies, nor quite as good an actress.Still, tons of action, comedy (that's funny within the context of the situation), and a mysterious backstory (but really only
mysterious if you haven't been watching the Disney+ MCU shows). It's a joyride, never a dull moment, although sometimes the plot meandered. It was nice that Janet and Hank got a lot more to do this time around.Modok (scene during the trailers) makes sense within the context of the MCU, Majors is appropriately mancing as Kang. I don't know what's with the low Rotton Tomatoes, I can't wait to see this again.A-, 9.1/103D: 3D usually doesn't work in dark movies (which was the downfall of both Wakanda Forever & Malificent's 3D), but surprisingly works here... when it matters. Scenes where the 3D wouldn't do much to enhance the experience, the 3D was practically non-existent. For scenes where it would make a difference, the stereoscopic imagining was pretty good (I noticed only 1 brief scene where the depth frustrums didn't line up creating a double image in the mid background, otherwise it was always clean)6.5/10 for the 3D. By comparison Shang Chi's was a 10/10, Wakanda Forever's 3D was a 3/10.","23 out of 44 found this helpful.

I've read all the reviews and seen several YouTube videos bashing this movie, so I was not expecting much. Despite this, I was still quite entertained.Scott Lang is living his best life with his girlfriend, Hope, his daughter, Cassie, and father- and mother-in-law , Hank and Janet. Then his daughter inadvertently opens a portal to the quantum realm and all five are sucked into it. They find a realm that is teeming with an entire universe inhabited by diverse characters, including a cameoed Bill Murray. The inhabitants are fighting against a dictator, Kang, who wants to leave the quantum realm and take over our universe.This has all been done before, for better or worse, by Star Wars. Some of the characters are interesting and some even have decent scenes, but its a little too much CGI and not enough heart like the other Ant-man movies. That is my biggest issue with this. Ant-man is supposed to kind of palate cleanser for the darker elements of the MCU, but its darker than the previous two movies and it doesn't really feel like an Ant-man movie. There is a serious element of girl-power as well, but its done properly and feels organic, not forced, which was refreshing.This is a visually stunning movie and Kang is a decent villain, but he doesn't have the same menace as Thanos. Kang mostly just screams in anger as opposed to having that simmering anger and focus of purpose that inhabited Thanos.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are also some plot holes when you think back to the end of Ant-Man and the Wasp.

I remember once when you were fun. You were appointment movie going. People clamored for the next movie and I would rush out to the theatre the first week to go and see it because I knew, I KNEW, that whatever you put on screen, it was going to be fun. It might not make me think too much, it might not evoke deep thought or emotion, but it'd be pure fun. Then came COVID and my faith was shaken. It's funny, because there was a line from Iron Man 2, ""If you make God bleed, then people will no longer believe in him."" Marvel, you're bleeding.Quantomania is... Fine. There were moments that were funny, but beyond that this movie was utter nonsense. There were no stakes, no sense of what was going on, if anything mattered, it didn't even try to... WHY WERE THERE PEOPLE DOWN THERE?! The only real saving graces here were in the actors. Rudd is as charming and funny as ever. Douglas had some amazing moments that were just really fun. And Majors. Wow. Great great job. I have questions as to how his powers shifted throughout the movie, but that's not him. He gave that character some serious gravitas and interest.For the time being, Marvel was still able to put enough fun in this movie to overwhelm all the stupid, but only just.

The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jonathan Majors is outstanding as Kang, a formidable and charismatic villain who sets up the next phase of the MCU. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had a monumental task of following up the Loki finale and introducing Kang, and it largely accomplishes it. However, it's not flawless. The story feels hasty and superficial at times, and Scott Lang seems like a passive protagonist who lacks agency or growth.

I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","101 out of 193 found this helpful.

I'm glad, it was a darker sci-fi tone for the movie. The visual and CGI is great even though a lot of people in this world, will always complain about it for every Marvel movie that has come out. Very good action, laughs and more!! The two credits scene was so good. I can say, that people already watched it and don't like, will regret it when they could bring back a clip from this movie in the future like movie Avengers Kang Dynasty because how important the plot for Kang will be in Kang Dynasty. Just like in Avengers Endgame and they bring scene from Thor Dark World which we can agree it was not good but it's was important to the story that's been told. I personally, really enjoy this movie!

It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark.

It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with.","17 out of 39 found this helpful.

The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development.

Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out!

The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once.","16 out of 37 found this helpful.

I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

They were exciting, funny and lots of action, this one was a snooze fest. There was a bad choice of costumes in the quantum realm. It just seems like the producer ran out of ideas and try to recreate a mixture of Star Wars and guardians of the galaxy. There was minimum action, dry humor, bad jokes and the list goes on. I literally fell asleep, that's how much dialogue was in this movie. It hurts me to write this because I'm such a huge marvel fan but these movies that have been releasing recently have been horrible. If you're a die hard ant-man fan, go watch it, other than that I'd say wait for it to be available to watch on Netflix or something.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Because to watch this movie we have to recall previous parts of the Ant-Man movies. Really pathetic story line it wasn't convincing at all. I wish I could not have watch this movie.

It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang. We get to see a throwback segment and find out more about Kang and Janet's time when she vanished into the quantum level.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It tries to be an adventure movie, an Ant-Man movie and almost an avenger movie of sorts. There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The character designs were great. The plot and backstory for why things were happening was explained well and easy to follow. All the characters from the previous films played their roles well.As far as new characters, Kang was excellent. Though he didn't show off too much of his powers. I wasn't expecting him to so I wasn't disappointed. I would say towards the end, the film did make him seem a bit weak. Great character played by a great actor nonetheless.Modok could have been better. His initial look was fine but once his true identity was revealed that's when he looked weird. They could have done with working on that CGI or not show that version of him that many times once they showed who he truly was. He was used too much for comedic relief and towards the end it was a bit much.The action in the film was entertaining but nothing over the top.The dialogue and forced comedy towards the end is what brings this movie down a bit. There were bits of dialogue/scenes that could have been taken out and the film would have been much stronger. Specifically from Modok and Ant-man's daughter and like one line from Kang.Overall it was another entertaining Ant-man movie that didn't disappoint. Don't believe the Critics, enjoy the film.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

None of the new characters have any depth therefore we don't care about them, the stories are pretty dreadful and I can't even blame it on the constant Man bashing that's going on in these movies now.By the end I was just wishing Kang had destroyed the MCU movie universe to save us from even more upcoming features. Please stop now Marvel or tell Disney to back off and get back to writing great movies/characters for both male and female superheroes.That's why we bought your comics in the first place.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as they explore the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dimension where they encounter strange creatures and a powerful villain named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).The film has a lot of visual spectacle and creativity, as it showcases the wonders and dangers of the Quantum Realm. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining, especially when Ant-Man and Wasp use their shrinking and growing abilities to fight their enemies. The film also introduces some new characters, such as Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter who becomes a political activist, and Jentorra (Katy O'Brian), a Mandalorian-like warrior who helps them in their quest.However, the film also suffers from some flaws that prevent it from being a great movie. The plot is convoluted and messy, as it tries to juggle too many elements and subplots without giving them enough development or coherence. The film also lacks the humor and charm that made the previous Ant-Man movies so enjoyable, as it takes itself too seriously and loses some of the fun factor. The film also makes some tonal departures from the earlier films, as it deals with darker themes such as trauma, guilt, and genocide.The most disappointing aspect of the film is Kang the Conqueror, who is supposed to be the new main antagonist of the MCU. While Jonathan Majors gives a good performance, his character is poorly written and underdeveloped. He is introduced too abruptly and without much explanation or motivation, making him seem like a generic and bland villain. He also does not pose much of a threat to Ant-Man and Wasp, as they easily defeat him in the end.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some positive aspects, such as the visual effects, the action scenes, and some of the performances, but it also has some negative aspects, such as the plot, the screenplay, and Kang the Conqueror. It is not a terrible movie, but it is not a great one either. It is a mediocre movie that could have been much better.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Scientific jargon tends to flow easily enough through a fair share of MCU films, particularly the better and best ones. The purpose seems to be to ground the story into something concrete, tangible and accessible, some relatable terra firma to allow us the audience even further immersion into the viewing experience. It's a neat story-telling device, which Ant Man has employed through all his movies so far- culminating in no less than the term quantum mechanics being integrated into the title of his third outing. And so ""Quantumania"" perseveres in the long MCU tradition of playing fast and loose with austere scientific concepts to engage the audience in a wild fantastic evidently neverending adventure. ""Quantumania"" isn't MCU's best, but it upholds the MCU's most tried and true science fiction fantasy tradition. And just as in science, once all the phases come into play, the sum should amount to greater than its parts. Ant Man has now cast his part in the lot, to be tallied later down the line, and it is a good part, if a bit part, from the character most likely to be overlooked- except for one thing: quantum mechanics, applied and theoretical, is a huge deal..! So here's to Ant Man- the hero no one cares about, but can't do without...!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

At the beginning of the movie, Ant-Man has to go down to the local police station to pick up his daughter from jail. She was arrested because the police were tasked with clearing out a homeless encampment (in reality, encampments are a serious crime issue on the West coast), but Ant-Man's daughter didn't like that, so she destroyed police equipment. The next scene at dinner, Hank Pym said he would've marched in there and broken her out of jail. Why is Marvel pushing anti-policing/anti-justice and having a teenage girl as their ""martyr"" or spokesperson or whatever. Shouldn't the Marvel heroes be working together with the police to stop crime? What is this leftist gibberish? I have grown to expect this from Marvel after the Disney acquisition, but man were the politics extra loud in this movie.Regardless of the extreme leftist political pandering written by someone who is completely detached from actual society and the real world being forced onto us, the movie was still trash. Kang was an absolute joke of a villain in this movie. I have no idea how they plan(ned) on making him the new big bad, someone on Thanos's level after what I just saw. The action was so boring and drab because you know everyone's going to be fine. There's no sense of danger or risk that something won't go as planned. So many scenes and sets were just blatantly ripped from A New Hope it's honestly pathetic.I know Disney owns Marvel and Star Wars, but keep them separate. Let them have their own feel to them, like back when the first Avengers came out. That movie had its own unique feel/aura and has aged extremely well. Marvel movies are now too busy pandering to politics to tell an interesting story with real fleshed out characters dealing with serious issues that have consequences. It feels like every Marvel movie is trying to be Thor Ragnarok now, and that only spells disaster.I'm more sad than mad. I thought this movie looked decent from the trailers too. After this, I don't think the days of actual quality films like Iron Man or Avengers are coming back, not from Disney.The most criminal thing about this movie is they somehow even made Paul Rudd unlikable.2/10.","26 out of 45 found this helpful.

Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending.","14 out of 37 found this helpful.

Ant-Man begins in a lighthearted way until Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has to spring his teenage activist daughter from the police cells.It seems Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been working with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) to explore the Quantum Realm with a newly built device. This is bad news as far as Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is concerned. She spent decades inside there and has harboured some secrets about it.Before the latest experiment is shut down, they are transported inside the weird, wonderful psychedelic world of the Quantum Realm. They meet an old friend of Janet, Lord Krylar (Bill Murray.)Now things have changed, everyone is afraid of Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors.) He once saved Janet until she found out what kind of person he really was.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is light and frothy. It has all the nourishment value of a McDonalds Thick Shake. It is CGI heavy made in the new fangled virtual production StageCraft set.The story is very much the kind of seen it before in superhero movies. I even knew it would have an offbeat intro and song before the movie started.The film introduces Kang but this all powerful enemy underwhelmed in his main outing.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie delivers the laughs we've all come to love from the Ant-Fam also adding sorta new comer Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) into the action. While the jokes aren't always slap your knee fall on the floor dying funny, Paul Rudd's likable charisma is enough to warrant at least a chuckle or a smile. The family dynamic really didn't hit as hard as I feel it wanted to, I definitely left the theater feeling a missed opportunity to dive deeper. Unfortunately as well we do see some of the other characters take a bit of a back seat during this adventure, they are there and have a place, I just felt there could have been a bit more from them. I am happy to report that the villain for this film hits the mark on every note as Jonathan Major's Kang the Conqueror is an absolute force to be reckoned with, he absolutely steals the show every time he is on screen and thankfully they left the jokes (for the most part) aside from the menacing presence that is Kang. I walked out of this movie feeling genuinely happy to see such a fun adventure, because even with my nitpicks I had fun, and that's all I could ask for! While I do miss the more grounded stories the Ant-Man films delivered previously, entering this new era of the multiverse saga with the MCU is gonna be a crazy fun ride and I can't wait to see where we go next!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The female resistance leader I also found very corny, the actress did her best but it didn't help. Michael Douglas and Michele Pfeiffer whoever were their usual amazing selves, probably the best part of the movie and worth seeing.Other then seeing him in Loki Series, I hadn't seen Jonathan Majors in anything else, but I was pleasantly surprised with him.

I was a little annoyed with Janet for a good portion of it and I'm still not a huge fan. I liked Cassie, thought her character was a pretty good interpretation of the comic character, but much smarter.

Perhaps it started to drag near the end of the 2nd. Antman & the Wasp Quantumania suffers from a problem that is recurring throughout the MCU films, and that is tying up the 3rd act in a satisfying end. This is usually in large part due to servicing the ongoing plot that is the MCU. However, there is a very noticeable decline in quality of narrative in the 3rd acts of most Phase 4 & 5 projects, despite the huge money thrown on screen. It all feels too manufactured, than created.The acting is all good, with Jonathan Majors absolutely crushing the role of Kang. The problems really rested with, in some part, the direction and, in large part, to the writing.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd and Majors are standouts, Scott Lang is as charming as ever and Kang is an interesting character that demands expansion. The rest of the main cast also tried their best and delivered enjoyable performances.I obviously cannot dive into more details without spoiling important plot points but, in conclusion, this movie had the potential to be exponentially better than what we actually got and it's a shame it ended reminding me of the plot and visuals of the Sharkboy And Lavagirl...","24 out of 42 found this helpful.

With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's disheartening to witness the amateur directing mistakes, and even the actors appear to be confused. It's truly incredible how this film came to be.

So I wanted to see another Ant Man movie of course and as soon as I saw this one was in the theatres I went to see it. I liked some things in this movie but not everything. One of the things that I really missed about Ant Man was the fact that in the other two movies all of the things that happened in the story, were set up in the real world; and in this one everything was just happening in the Quantum Real, which I though it would be great, but after a while I thought it was a bit boring. I loved the villain though, Jonathan Majors did a really good job, but didn't quite really cared about what happened while all of the characters were in the Quantum Realm. So, to me the script was just not so good in this movie. The visual effects were incredible as you could expect but I feel a bit disappointed because I really wanted this movie to be great. The Ant Man movies by themselves for me really worked outside the Avengers movies, and had their own style. But this one unfortunately was just entertaining and nothing else. I hope the next Marvel movies step up a little bit on the scripts because that really makes a difference. 7/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

These films in phase 4 and 5 don't seem so coherent? The plot is still a bit insignificant.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unbeknownst to him, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been working with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) to explore the Quantum Realm. They all get pulled down into the realm. Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) had hidden her lost time there spent with supervillain Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).Critical response seems to be middling or worst. I am more in the middling camp. I still really like Scott Lang and Paul Rudd's humor. He remains the best of this section of the MCU. One does question whether he is the one to introduce the big bad of Phase 4. He is the comic relief. He shouldn't lead the universe. I think that it should be Loki. His TV show is what introduced Kang anyways and he could be the unlikely heroic lead. The MCU is becoming unbalanced as the TV shows are overshadowing its supposed superior theatrical releases.As a movie, this feels trapped in the CGI strange world of superhero green screen. It's too chaotic at times. Most of it is super CGI. Kathryn Newton is the new hottie which is a strange thing to say. I miss the baby-faced cutie of the original Cassie. I don't like Janet in this one. Michelle Pfeiffer is stuck in playing the troublesome character. After some time, I realized that she needs to be separated from Hank. They could be arguing over the experiment when it goes off. She is just set up wrong. At the end of the day, this is a pretty simple story and it's the modern-day standard for the superhero movie. It needs more of Ant-Man's humor. He's forced to introduce the next big bad of the new phase which shouldn't be his job.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Which seems to be forced as we have no seen Cassie with any young men to compare it to. Sure some one of the same gender can be awesome but that doesn't mean we fall for them.

This has a positive and negative impact on the film.Kang is easily the best part of the film. He is played excellently by Jonathan Majors and for the most part, has a great on screen presence. He's by far the most menacing villain we've seen in the Ant-Man series and pretty much carries the film alongside Ant-Man.We also get to explore the Quantum realm which looks unique when compared to most other marvel properties. There was a lot about it that felt like Star Wars. For the most part the CGI in the Quantum realm looked really good but one of the sub villains is by far the worst CGI character Marvel has ever created. It was legitimately off putting.There was also a lot of exposition to try and fill us in on what happened off screen to tie the Ant-Fam and Kang worlds together. It felt like I was listening to an audio book and the explanations weren't always well thought out. Not to mention, we get another Marvel child genius pop out of nowhere.Quantumania was an average entry into the MCU. It's not as bad as some critics have suggested but not enough to get you really excited for Phase 5. Whilst the scale of the movie increased it did manage to keep some of the charm and wit that has made the series enjoyable although it wasn't as well placed in this movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's fun, but could also be likened to Spy-Kids.A strange tone is struck. The early stages are full of the humour from the previous two instalments, but the main plot is dove into fairly immediately and it doesn't take long for severity to ensue. Having Kang as the villain matches that, but backed up by M. O. D. O. K. Felt like a goofy combination, where a scene cannot be taken seriously with a giant floating head (with off-putting CGI) hanging around in the background. He's not necessarily a bad character, and certainly one who needed to be approached as a light-hearted sideshow, but one that doesn't suit the 'epic' consequence of the end of a civilisation/world/universe.Whilst they're all part of the same universe, and this does take place in a setting only really applicable to Ant-Man and the Wasp, Quantumania does lose a little of it's trilogy's identity. The plot may be heavily tied into the wider MCU saga, but the previous two in the trilogy still had that odd-man-out feel to it in a superhero world. This could have easily been a Guardians of the Galaxy film, complete with comically odd creatures, or any of the Avengers films where an ensemble take on an all-powerful being.That said, Rudd is still great as Lang, and the rest of the cast, far more involved in the plot, match the tone and atmosphere well. The CGI looks good for the most part, even if it is a little sad that the whole film is 90% greenscreen. I can't imagine this will be anyone's favourite film, but it's entertaining and contributes massively to the wider Marvel story.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I felt the script let Cassie down, very cliche and cheesy moments when the film was trying to deliver serious points. I felt the humour in general was there however, which kept the tone from the previous Ant Man films.Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of CGI. This was expected, as near enough the entire film is set within the Quantum Realm. I think you have to embrace the wackiness, not critisize it.

I would have to say this was the worst movie of the three that Marvel has created. In this movie the team is accidentally transported to the Quantum Realm where they encounter strange creatures and life that exist as small as the atom. The theme of Freedom comes back around towards a group of alien type creatures that are oppressed by the evil empire led by Kang who is played by Jonathan Majors. The storyline had a Star Wars feel to it, where the empire is trying to rule the galaxy and much is the same in the quantum realm. I think it was silly and couldn't take it seriously. Bill Murray had a cameo and Kathryn Newton played the older Cassie Lang. Overall it was an ok movie that I couldn't care for.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Phase 4 started early in 2021 with WandaVision and concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. That phase had its ups and downs. Now, with Phase 5, hopefully Marvel can prioritize quality over quantity and offer a better experience for both new fans and those who have been following them since the beginning. Kicking off Phase 5 is the third Ant-Man film called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. With a larger cast and a higher budget, it aims to break the norm of Phase 4 and deliver a quality similar to that of Phase 1-3.Scott (played by Paul Rudd) and the gang continue their lives after the events of Endgame. Scott is now an author, sharing his life experiences in a book. Hope Van Dyne (played by Evangeline Lilly) establishes the Pym Van Dyne Foundation, which utilizes Pym Particles for humanitarian advancements (this is the most interesting aspect of her character in the film). Cassie Lang (now played by Kathryn Newton) has grown up and unfortunately follows in her father's footsteps, burdened by his absence and other responsibilities. When Cassie creates a machine to communicate with the Quantum Realm (it's becoming repetitive how each younger character in the MCU is portrayed as a genius), things quickly go awry. Once again, they must find a way out of the realm and, preferably, survive. After that, you have your standard MCU fare, with an above-average villain and occasional scenes showcasing impressive CGI.One major disappointment is MODOK, whose entire story was rewritten to fit into the MCU canon. However, in the end, he turns out to be a completely different character. The decision to make him the primary antagonist of the first Ant-Man film was intriguing, but unfortunately, it didn't work out as well as anticipated. It would have been much better if he had never removed his helmet, as many fans love to see iconic villains maintain their mysterious appearance. Instead, we were constantly subjected to rushed and poorly executed CGI, making it difficult to understand how such visual quality passed quality assurance. This is one of the reasons why people are increasingly unsure about the direction of the MCU and whether it can reach the same heights it once did.Another weak point is the Wasp, who shares the title with the titular character but has very little to do throughout the film. Occasionally, they remember her presence and give her something to do. Everything about her character felt lackluster compared to the previous two films, and she ended up being the most forgettable aspect of the entire movie. We don't even need to discuss how she shoots her arm lasers/cannons at the bad guys, especially in the final fight scene. It simply didn't work.On the other hand, out of all three Ant-Man films, this one does have the best villain, Kang (who honestly deserved a better film treatment). Jonathan Majors portrayed Kang with a calm demeanor, implementing different strategies to achieve his goals without wasting words or actions. This version of Kang is quite distinct from He Who Remains (from the Loki series) and the other incarnations shown in the end-credit scene. I'm looking forward to seeing how his next incarnation will differ from the previous ones.Another significant positive point is the Probability Storm. The concept is fascinating from beginning to end, existing in a realm where rules cease to exist. Each possible decision creates an entirely new multiverse, allowing you to see the outcomes of different choices. The overall notion is intriguing, complemented by atmospheric sound design and captivating visuals, making the scene well-executed.At the end of the day, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is another MCU film that does just enough to be considered a standalone movie but falls short in striving to do something more. As the start of a new phase and an introduction to the major threat of this saga (Phase 4-6), it should have been better, and ultimately, it needed to be better. It simply exists without leaving a lasting impression. I am confident that the MCU will eventually connect the dots between the various films and series, as it did in the previous saga. However, so far, the previous saga handled it better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It seems strange, considering if any Marvel film needs a ton of convincing CGI, this would be it.The characters themselves get little development, and while there are some human moments that the cast spend together, it is mostly drowned out by the messy plot and the action.While it is a good way to pass the time, and still provides us with some entertainment as most Marvel movies do, Ant-Man 3 will most likely be a disappointment to fans of Ant-Man and the MCU in general.6/10 - OkayDon't count on Jonathan Majors to return , as it seems possible that Kang will be recast, due to the controversies the actor is currently embroiled in. Also what was the point of Bill Murrays character?","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

After saving the world - again - Ant-Man is asking himself hard questions, like did he doom the entire Multiverse or not. He goes ""Nah, it's fine"" reminding himself that the world doesn't make sense and we shouldn't be asking so many questions. It was a clear jab at the people who would predictably criticize the film for its lack of meaning or consistency. It's also an advice for viewers going in, if they want to enjoy the film: leave your brain at the door.That being said, the film was a bunch of familiar faces playing characters that didn't seem to fit their history in a full CGI dream world. That is it. The movie could have just as well been an Alice in Wonderland sequel, where she shrinks and grows using magic mushrooms to kill a multiversal Red Queen. It makes no difference whatsoever.So was the film entertaining? Barely. The visuals were nice, things went pew pew and boom, had a lot of McGuffins and Deus ex Machinas, we even had entire CGI bars (and some actors) borrowed from whatever Marvel are doing in Star Wars. The story was clear, too, as nonsensical as it was. The characterization was bad, though. I mean Evangeline Lilly was barely in it (the haircut did NOT help), MODOK as Darren was pointless, Cassie was annoying as hell - that girl needs a good spanking - not taking responsibility for anything and then telling people what they should do, and Hank... Michael Douglas came, did his lines like a professional, went back home and got drunk questioning his life choices. Even Ant-Man was swinging wildly from courageous dad to hysterical buffoon. Paul Rudd did what he could with it, but it was bad.That leaves Kang. I have to say that I have a feeling every time I see Jonathan Majors on screen. It's a creepy, filthy feeling. It does not feel good. I don't know why and probably I will never know, with the personal issues the actor has nowadays and the publicity around it. But he was a good Kang. Better than in Loki, that's for sure, his acting was spot on. I feel like the script did him a disservice, because he could have easily become one of those legendary villains that makes you root for while hating him at the same time. I didn't see it in Loki, but I did see the potential of a great villain in this film. With the expected two end-credits scenes completely shattering that potential.The classic comic book villain histrionics have got to go. They don't help stories, they don't inspire anyone watching, they don't provide any useful hint for real life just a small emotional catharsis that feels shameful at the end, like a bad wank. It's a made-up fantasy of the bad guy emotionally collapsing under the weight of their defeat while heroes somehow derive strength from theirs. Is it that hard to care for your villain as you do for your hero, writers?""Kang will return"", says the last image of the film. I now doubt that very much.Bottom line: a forgettable and completely pointless film that manages to be somehow entertaining based almost exclusively on CGI and the charisma of the (poorly used) actors. Alas, that's the standard of movie I now expect from Marvel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

While the first Ant-Man film introduced a refreshing comedic twist to the superhero genre, and the second had its moments despite a dip in quality, this third entry feels like a regurgitation of familiar ideas without any significant innovation.One of the main drawbacks of Quantumania is its heavy reliance on non-stop CGI spectacle at the expense of a quality script. The film bombards viewers with over-the-top action sequences that quickly become exhausting, leaving little room for character development or meaningful storytelling.However, there are a few bright spots in the film. Jonathan Majors delivers a standout performance as Kang, displaying his range and talent. However, recent personal matters surrounding the actor may potentially jeopardize the character's inclusion in upcoming MCU entries, which is a concern for fans of the franchise.On a positive note, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly enjoy increased screen presence, and their performances are commendable. Their chemistry helps to inject some much-needed life into the film, even if the overall product falls short.Unfortunately, the portrayal of M. O. D. O. K., a formidable Marvel villain, fails to translate effectively from the page to the screen. The character lacks the depth and menace that fans have come to expect, resulting in a missed opportunity to create a compelling antagonist.Curiously, the design and plot similarities to the Star Wars prequels are hard to ignore, as is the inclusion of several Star Wars cast members. While some may appreciate the homage and cross-pollination, it feels like a distraction and adds little value to the overall narrative.Despite the charm and charisma brought by Paul Rudd and the standout performance by Jonathan Majors, these factors alone are not enough to offset the criticisms of the film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania falls short of its predecessors and fails to deliver a fresh and engaging addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.AUDIO: 8/10.MOOFIEMETER: 6/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!","54 out of 123 found this helpful.

However those two actors can't help a film that suffers from feeling like you're not really invested due to all the visual effects sure it's in the Quantum Realm a place that doesn't exist but what made Ant-Man quirky and interesting was his grounding in San Francisco with his mates being a low level earth bound hero this film relies too heavily on special effects with an irritation that his mates have been sacrificed for new characters that do little to help us enjoy this story. Perhaps a balance needed to be struck with some of the action between Earth and the quantum realm or less stunt casting for parts that aren't actually necessary. The relationship between Scott and Cassie is fine but most of the time it's Hank that's got the best lines. It won't be one I'll be watching again which seems to be a familiar pattern since Endgame.

I would even say that one of most beloved movies like Endgame has daring plot-holes.So my assumption is that people are just tired of this formula of the movies, and if marvel won't change something, Phase Six is going to be their last phase (six cause they planned everything up to six for now).Some plot points are just explained as ""oh i guess that just happened"".Kang's motivation... There isn't really any motivation, we know there is something but they said nothing about it in this movie.Whole movie is one big CGI fest and, everything except the actors is CGI.MODOK looks like crap, but fortunately enough he isn't unmasked in the movie a lot. Mostly you will see him in the mask so that helps, they should just left him in the mask whole time.But looking at it as a big Only CGI movie, it looks ok, of course there is going to be some instances where it will look iffy.Oh end the credit scenes.

If you liked Loki Show, you will be happy to see that.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is busy, colorful and full of potential as it mildly misses to deliver on its promise. As MCU movies generally build on one another, here we knowingly (and interestingly) build more significantly on the streaming TV series ""Loki"" on Disney+. As we were introduced to Kang and his concerns within that series, ""Loki"" certainly helps viewers of Quantumania to have walked that path first.Bill Murray's ""Lord Krylar"" holds promise for a movie may never need to leave the realm (you heard it here first) and of course the Kang setups show promise. Marvel's MCU is on stable ground, yet not stretching its legs much on this run beyond the expectations of the chapter.Overall Rating: She gives it a ""C"" as I counter with a ""B-"".The Hot Take: Critics be damned, it's a Marvel release so you have to see it. Just don't worry about shrinking through the weekend's tasks to see it first. You'll have time, as time apparently is more or less than we think it is.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As someone who is a fan of the first two movies as fun heist sci fi movies that did a great job at just making it be about that. This film ruins what you liked about the first two films and just see that it got turned into a bland and boring film about characters trying to stop the new supposed villain of the MCU and it also makes an interesting comic book villain Modok become a joke and one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a superhero movie.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first 30 minutes are kind of rough to get through but after the movie isn't great, but isn't bad as a lot of critics portray I was scared that it was gonna be worse because of all the people exaggerating that this movie is not the best, and sadly that it didn't live up to its potential I think the Jonathan mayors as kang was the best thing from this movie. And I enjoyed the small jokes that were told and some funny parts in the movie.

Unlike earlier MCU entries, Quantumania fails to captivate with its characters or raise the stakes to a compelling level. Despite being visually impressive and competently made, it lacks the spark of inspiration that once characterized the franchise. The performances are adequate but lack the standout moments that used to be a hallmark of MCU films, with even Paul Rudd's typically engaging portrayal of Ant-Man feeling lackluster. While Jonathan Majors delivers a noteworthy performance as Kang the Conqueror, it's not enough to salvage the film from feeling disappointingly average. The MCU now feels like it's churning out films with middling results, and a return to the elements that made the early MCU films successful may be in order for Kevin Feige and his team.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's more of a standalone adventure that happens to feature not one but two generations of Ant-Man and the Wasp.The CGI effects for the Quantum Realm and the various action scenes look pretty; and lead to some rather original designs for the settings and creatures. I know that Marvel Studios has gotten flack for shortchanging their effects artists, but their work paid off here. There's some stellar imagery to behold in this movie.Paul Rudd is great in this along with Jonathan Majors as the new villain Kang the Conqueror. For all this movie's faults, Kang is not one of them. He's menacing in a subtle way but can be bombastic when the moment calls for it. But I will say it's strange that Kang is not in the movie as much as you would expect. With Rudd as Scott Lang, he's likable as usual and his motivations are immediately sympathetic. He's a good everyman for a weird story like this taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Returning cast members Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly are not bad in this but it seems like they have less to do. Kathryn Newton takes over as Scott Lang's daughter Cassie and though not badly acted, her character is kind of annoying. It's one of those daughter characters who are written as a know-it-all in the mistaken belief that it makes them look smart.For all the controversy surrounding Bill Murray, which I think is overblown, he is not in the movie that much. It's a glorified cameo where he plays a very obscure Marvel character. Corey Stoll comes back as Darren Cross who in this universe becomes the hideous villain MODOK. This is a character who should be threatening but he's really more annoying than actually sinister.The movie just kind of feels overblown with the stunning visuals and scope. Yet also underwritten. A lot of key information is told via flashback or exposition dumps. As if it was a re-shoot or a scene was just cut. I will say it didn't feel long since it's about two hours and that feels like enough. It really doesn't waste time .Without going into spoilers too much, you do think the movie is setting up high stakes and for some characters to make the ultimate sacrifice. And that does happen but not the way you think it might.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The special effects for his face made me laugh out loud everytime they showed him.This is the problem with what Disney is producing and writing these days. They spend a fortune on the effects, but the writing is as if they don't know what makes a good comic book adventure. So it seens their mandate is not great ,but good enough to get the normie Marvel movie fans into theaters. Although, the way the box office returns are going they may wat to rethink that.If your a die hard Marvel Comics fan, then this was Chipolte stomach turning. Just like the last 2 - 3 Marvel movies.

There is a little bit more contact with the character and also let's admit Jonathan Majors is blowing out the rest of the cast with his performance, he makes it a little bit easier to appreciate the movie.

They tried to make into this ""big thing"" from Janet's past that she never wanted to talk about. But it was poorly executed and came off almost boring, it had too much foretelling.I loved the Quantum realm itself. The film did a great job showing it and the creatures. But I think it could have dived more into showing the realm and the stories of the creatures. Instead it focused on other things it really didn't need to.

I can't say I was there since the beginning because I actually only started watching them religiously I'm cinemas since the first Avengers film - everything before that I watched retrospectively on DVD or Bluray. But anyway the first Antman film I quite enjoyed, it was humorous and action packed without being too over-the-top. The 2nd Antman film - Antman and The Wasp - was mostly pretty good but I didn't really like backstory of the villain that much. That brings us to Quantumania aka Antman 3. Since Spiderman Far From Home, I personally feel the Marvel films have become mostly lifeless and unintelligent. Sadly, although not the worst of the post Thanos storyline films, Antman 3 is nowhere near as good as it's predecessors. You could argue the stakes are higher sure and the scale of the story is huge which it is but there's also nothing new being done here... they've added in Scotts daughter Cassy as a new Antman (Antgirl?) and she's just a pointless as a character if you ask me and verh forgetable even though they try make her funny and integral to the story. The returning characters don't seem to have any depth to them and in some cases appear to have changed personalities to when we saw them last so I felt cheated. The overall story also retcons what we knew of the quantum realm.... and it's all explained away with a ""this is different."" Seriously that's it. Another bad aspect of this whole film though was the poor CGI and design. Some characters were dead basic looking and boring whilst backgrounds were bland and at times noticeably fake taking me out of the movie. Anyway, there was a couple things I did enjoy and one of those was MODOK. I usually don't like it when films change character backstories but this I didn't mind at all because it made sense and it was hilarious. The other thing I liked was Kang. I liked how he was portrayed, I liked his design and I liked how he was powerful yet still noticeably vulnerable. Kang by himself is not a Thanos level threat but as we saw during the mid credits scene, I think an army of Kangs probably is!Final Verdict: It really only serves the purpose of introducing Kang to the MCU and admittedly, it does that very well. Everything else about it is mostly forgettable except for MODOK who steals the scene. It's not as funny as previous Antman films and also not as smart, characters act differently and the CGI can be very hut and miss.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

During dinner at the home of love interest Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and the recently returned Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie showcases a device that can map the Quantum Realm where Janet was lost by sending signals which Janet is none too happy about for reasons she doesn't share. The device opens up a worm hole sucking in Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank, and Janet sending them to the Quantum Realm with Scott and Cassie in one area and Hope, Hank, and Janet in another, where they soon find themselves caught between a resistance between the denizens of the Quantum Realm and the tyrannical despot Kang the Conqueror (Johnathan Majors) who has a connection to Janet.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third film in the Ant-Man series and the first film in the fifth phase of the MCU. The third Ant-Man movie was intended from its inception to be larger scale with director Peyton Reed stating his intention was ""a massive world-building undertaking"" citing the aesthetics of Heavy Metal magazines as an influence. You can't fault Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania for its ambition, but in execution it has many of the flaws of Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness without some of the redeeming points that compensated for that film's messy screenplay.I will say once again Paul Rudd is good as Ant-Man with his likable down to earth charm making him an endearing presence in this universe. I also liked Kathryn Newton as Scott's daughter Cassie with the two having a nice natural chemistry and still building on the father/daughter dynamic that has been a strong emotional core of this franchise. The movie is also a bright and colorful film with lots of details and some inspired setpieces such as a scene involving multiple possible versions of Scott Lang or hyperintelligent ants but unfortunately the story and the nuts and bolts are where we begin to see the weaknesses. Quantumania is much more serious minded entry for Ant-Man in the same way that Thor: Ragnarok was a tonal departure from the prior Thor movies, but where it worked there by refreshing the character, here the tonal shift feels like it takes out a major part of the Ant-Man movie's appeal. The movie also has way too much stuffed into it as it's more focused on setting up Kang the Conqueror than exploring the Quantum Realm and while the Quantum Realm looks visually interesting, there's not much world building and the denizens of the realm they introduce just sort of get overtaken by the visual noise that makes this feel less like an Ant-Man movie and more like a Star Wars clone. We also have Corey Stoll returning as Darren Cross who is now M. O. D. O. K. And it's honestly a lateral move as he was underwhelming as a character in the first film and he's not much more interesting here.Quantumania isn't the worst MCU movie, but it's definitely one of the lower ranking entries in that it's so stuffed without much development on its own story and more focused on setting up plot points for other films. It's perfectly serviceable even if not particularly exceptional.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Great story, funny performances and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame.Finally it's all coming together.

It's as if that there is a checklist that they look through when they're watching a movie which completely destroys the point when you're watching a movie. You're supposed to just enjoy what someone else has created, and not try and knit pick and find every little thing wrong with it. There is nothing wrong with it because you didn't make it so your opinion has nothing to do with whether it was right or wrong. Yes there are some movies that are horrible because of how they were made or how the cinematography is or other things. I used to be able to check reviews and kind of get an idea whether I would like the movie but now these days I can't trust any of it because it's completely opposite of what I end up watching. This movie is a perfect example of where everything that I read was not what I watched. Did this movie suck? No. Was this movie amazing? No. But it was good in my opinion. And that's the point. It's MY opinion. These critics don't speak about their opinion, they speak as if their word is fact. This movie was dead on opening night when I was just there, and not because it sucked. It's because people listen to reviewers and choose not to go. And that's horrible cause this movie deserved more credit.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The Antman films have come to be known for comedic moments so when they pivoted to such a serious story with such a supposedly threatening and monumental bad guy, you expect a tone change, but then along comes a certain character and brings down the whole thing with absolutely pathetic humour and the worst looking special effects I've seen in years. This is on the level of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, or Jar Jar Binks. It's really bad.Then there is the tropes that have become all too common for mcu movies at this point; large scale battle, cross cutting between individual characters, misplaced comedy... All detracts from at least one really powerful moment, that could have made the core of a fantastic movie, a moment when Scott regains his focus and works toward one goal rather than being drawn in all directions, that was very powerful.This is just the latest MCU product though and exhibits the same issues that I have been starting to notice in the past few years. At this point it's hard to ignore and it's stifling any creativity and good storytelling. This will probably be the last MCU movie I pay for.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first 2 Ant Man movies. There was something comforting to the humble Paul Rudd playing Ant man. The characters all fit in perfectly with a simple story. Nothing spectacular, but simple , comedic, and worthwhile.This one on the other hand totally sacrificed Ant Man's character to serve as exposition and did a poor job with that. The characters themselves all felt like different people. Hank Pym feels uninspired , Hope goes along for the ride, and Ant Man is the opposite of his old humble persona which I loved before. His character served as some relief in the past for the other bombastic Marvel personalities. The casting of Cassie doesn't quite fit well with me either.This movie felt like a combination of the worst parts of Spy Kids 3D, Star Wars , and Sharkboy and Lava girl. There was a lot of opportunity to do much more with the quantum realm and this just felt like no effort was put into it. The sets themselves look like they were made in an early 2000s movie. At one point someone in the theaters chair broke and instead of laughing at the movie the audience got amusement out of that.For all the build up nothing ever quite adds up in the story. The one saving grace is that Jonathan Majors is a high quality actor. Even with his skill set they still nearly ruined him with a full and uninspiring script. I came into this so excited after how they concluded Loki season 1, but what a let down.They are going to need another stellar Loki season to try to get this phase back on track. I hope they don't spoil Guardians for me as well with their final send off not long from now.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

More than Eternals, Captain Marvel, Love & Thunder you name it. I'll start with what I like as it will be quicker to type.Pros:
-Johnathon Majors Kang was greatCons:
-The writing was awful. It felt like the only character that got any effort put into them was Kang.-The woman in this movie got the short end of the stick as they do in most Marvel movies. Their scripts were particularly bad and Hope, you know the character who's name is also in the title, was such a non-character. And damn near everything Cassie said was cringey as hell and everything Janet said was so vague that it became annoying. I believe writing to be the primary reason for these characters lacklusterness.-There was too much going on and it didn't spend nearly enough time with any of it for me to get fully into it. There's the resistance, Kangs army, the mission, whatever Janet, Hank, and Hope were doing, and a ton of characters introduced which didn't get much introduction.-There was maybe 30 minutes of this movie that had me thinking I could get back into it. From when Kang first walks in, to when Antman is grabbing the orb with all his lookalikes. Then it got back to being a poorly written mess.-There are no stakes. Spiderman, Iron Man, Thor, Shang Chi, etc etc all felt like there was something on the line but this felt like there were no consequences to anything. Which leads me to the last point I'll make.-Johnathon Major's Kang was great, but I never felt like he was an actual threat. I felt Modok undermined the seriousness of his character, he didn't really flex his powers, and having watched it I felt that a majority of the original six avengers could take him in a 1-on-1. I understand he is just a variant and likely not the baddest most dangerous Kang. But the other Kangs banished him, it showed clips of him destroying timelines and planets so I would think that Antman wouldn't be able to basically solo him. Or felt like Hawkeye could take him with exploding arrows.Huge disappointment and this is the first time I have actually felt like all the hate is 100% warranted. If this is the direction of Marvel movies through phases 5-6 then I think they will lose a lot of fans. I'm sick of these movies primary purpose being to set up future projects while making the one they are currently on mediocre.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

They ruined Ant-Man a bit. Kang too was not as enigmatic and intense as he was in Loki, but yet he shows huge potential as a very powerful character by the end. So not all hope is lost.

The plot was predictable and repetitive, offering nothing new to the franchise. The same tired formula of Scott Lang fighting against a villain who wants to use the power of the Pym particles for their own gain was used again, with little added to the storyline.The humor and jokes fell flat, lacking the charm and wit that made the previous Ant Man films so enjoyable. The comedic tone felt forced and uninspired, making it difficult to become invested in the characters or the plot.Even the action sequences, which are usually a highlight of the Ant Man movies, felt repetitive and unengaging. The use of size-changing technology can be visually impressive, but in ""Quantamania,"" it felt like the same gimmick was used over and over again, leading to a lack of excitement and tension.Overall, ""Ant Man: Quantamania"" was a mid, boring, and repetitive film that failed to live up to the standard set by the previous Ant Man movies. While there were some entertaining moments, the predictability of the plot, lackluster humor, and repetitive action sequences left much to be desired. If you're a fan of the franchise, it might be worth a watch, but don't expect anything groundbreaking or particularly memorable.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was good. It's even borderline VERY good to me. With all the negative reactions and reviews I've been hearing, I'm wondering if I saw the same movie as everyone else.We pick up with Scott Lang, who is a character exactly like the actor who plays him (Paul Rudd), enjoying life and a certain level of fame as an Avenger who saved the universe in ""Endgame."" His daughter Cassie, played convincingly by Kathryn Newton, is a chip off the old block, so to speak. She's been working on something special, with the help of ol' Hank Pym (Michael Douglass) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and soon the whole family is sucked down into the quantum realm by you-know-who.Michelle Pfeiffer surprised me when I knew I shouldn't be. Her performance as Janet Van Dyne is a reminder to all that she still has it. Janet and you-know-who had been marooned together for quite a long time, allies at first, but I'll let you watch the movie to get the rest of the story. The film does a wonderful job of slowly and simultaneously revealing the wonders of the quantum realm and Janet's role in the antagonist's re-emergence.Speaking of which, you-know-who is none other than Kang the Conqueror, the big bad of Marvel that will make Thanos seem like a warm-up. Jonathan Majors is the perfect actor to play Kang, and I mean perfect. He even has a similar face to many of the comic depictions of the villain. More importantly, Majors has the ability to play all the different variant personalities of Kang when it comes time... and considering the next Avengers movie has Kang in the title, I'm guessing we'll see several more of them.This adventure really is Star Wars-esque in its presentation and feel. Peyton Reed is on it, man, and he even found a way to include a nutty character like M. O. D. O. K. I saw this in 2D, but the directing of Reed may lead me to try and find a 3D version before it leaves the theaters.""Quantumania"" is better than any of the Phase 4 movies not named ""Spider-Man.,"" and I'd say in the top half of all MCU films. So yes, it was a success, not just in giving Phase 5 a proper launch but in being fun on its own.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10

-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","126 out of 319 found this helpful.

Why am I saying that? Well, for starters, the story's been written and narrated like a prologue, more like an introduction to the freshest super villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe than a movie that is solely based on Ant-Man and his heroic adventures.I would go as far as to say that the entire family of Lang was treated like supporting members of the cast, that too in their own franchise, as the narrative was too invested in giving Kang all the limelight; he has got more cool scenes to act in, he's been lent stronger dialogues, and because of all that in the end he turned out to be a character with maturity and a certain level of depth with a clear goal and purpose unlike Ant-Man or any of his kith and kin.Now, is that good or bad? Actually, it's both.On one hand, Ant-Man has been treated like a trivial addition rather than lead protagonist, but on the other hand, we've got ourselves a great new villain who stands firm and could hold his own. Suffice to say, Jonathan Majors played his part with enough conviction, and I hope and I wish the writers will give his character a fitting resolution by the time he gets his closure and his chapter comes to an end.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it stuck to the same cookie-cutter format that the MCU has been relying on, post EndgameI guess that could be considered good or bad news, depending on what you like to see. But I will say this, watching MCU movies as of late is like eating pizza everyday for, like, a couple of weeks straight. Love pizza, but too much of a good thing is never a good thing. I'm still waiting for something in these new Phases of the MCU to move me like I was moved in the early years of the MCU. Sadly, AMWQ doesn't do anything for me.I still don't know why Infinity War and Endgame seemed so damned good. I guess Infinity War and, to an extent, Endgame had more humanity to it. Those movies had character growth, more emotional interaction, more substance to who the actual players were and how they tied into the plots. Those movies surely had better quality writing, and the acting, as I remember it, was also much better than what I've seen in recent MCU movies. What I've noticed is that the MCU is trading quality scriptwriting for CGI, and the narratives are now focused on female heroes, and genius children/teen, whom also tend to be MENSA level scientist and inventors. I'm not stating that those people don't exists, but it's being overdone, almost forced on us (remember the pizza analogy).Couple this with some very poor writing (the way MODOK was challenged to conversion via a flurry of ""d*ck"" references was disgusting and cheap).So, yeah, Ant-Man/Quantomania is a good enough movie. It was fun to watch, and it will make money. I guess all these MCU movies will make money until they don't...which probably means people are finally getting sick of pizza.6/10 fun, but nothing unique here.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Scott Lang was anything but the main character in the movie. I would've preferred if the Ant-Man was the main focus of the movie.

It looked cool at the first glance but as the movie progressed, it started to become more and more annoying. Just show me something real please! Additionally, the CGI and green screen weren't really that good. I could see Paul Rudd's outline in some scenes. Also, the acting of some of the cast was pretty bad especially with the very basic dialogue.Kang just stole the show. His backstory was very well written and his character had so much depth. His fight scenes with Ant-Man were so good and entertaining to watch. Jonathan Majors as Kang maybe one of the best villains in the MCU and I'm very glad he'll be sticking with us for a long while.

Antman isn't strong... isn't smart... isn't even likeable. He's a blundering buffoon that isn't funny either.And the radical inconsistencies are irritating. Previous movies ""you always have the same mass""... so it's a 200lb guy fighting stuff 1/1 trillionth his weight. The tiniest flick would obliterate.The setting was pretty cool, the creatures were unique and interesting, yet under played.... extremely human-centric.Combat was very... samey. Antman really only has two gimmicks, grow and shrink.... that's it. And good thing the pim particles... shrink... pim particles. -_-If you can get past those negatives, it's a pretty, decent movie. I'm just floored that they let Evangeline Lilly on set with that disgusting dead cat on her head.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The wife, Evaneline Lilly? Has no business playing Michelle Pfeiffers daughter, she looked the same age or just a few years younger. Who cast Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother? She looked great IMO and was just awesome. I'm truly tired of these Marvel movies, but since not much else is being made, and I thought this one would be interesting, I went to see it.

As a 100% VFX heavy movie, there's some pretty impressive visual effects and also some questionable effects as well. Unfortunately the script was mediocre with poorly written dialogues that devoid of emotion. The film was unnecessarily too long and slow pacing. Probably another victim of MCU's mandatory 2 hour runtime stipulation. I'm not against the idea, but without a solid script and a creative direction there's nothing else to do that can make a movie entertaining that long. I understand the negative reaction to this movie, even though I liked it. All I can say is that this one is miles better than the trainwreck called, Thor: Love and Thunder.I like Kathryn Newton but I agree her performance was sort of lackadaisical in this movie. In my opinion she delivered a satisfying performance. But I can't say the same about Paul Rudd, his performance was kinda sloppy most of the time. I think the age is catching up to him. Jonathan Majors gave a satisfying performance than his other cast mates. Also it turns out this is probably his first and final portrayal of Kang in an MCU film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The action and CGI were pretty good, and it was fun, but it dragged in some places until I began not to care much anymore, only to be sucked right back in.

I feared for Scott's life more than once, especially with Marvel's penchant for getting rid of earlier avengers nowadays. And Jonathan Majors is an excellent actor.In all, this was a decent watch, nothing spectacular, but it still had enough to keep me glued until it came to an end. I did find it underwhelming, but considering that I went in more than hyped for it, the fact that I can still think of it as a 7 tells me Marvel did well with this one.

The movie picked up after his arrival at around the hour mark, until it fell again during the end fight. Paul Rudd is fine, but not as charming as we expect him to be.

Funny, unique, action packed and filled with MCU call backs for real fans. I was SOOOOO disappointed with ""Multiverse of maddness"" and people loved that trash ""Thor love and thunder"" was a good movie that was forced to shoe horn in humor that derailed it and rushed the storyline. This movie (though the CG is EXTREME) was so cool and unique and a great way to kick of phase 5. If you watched and like the LOKI series you'll be very excited. Paul rudd is always amazing and Jonathan Majors kills it. Just think of this as a starwars otherworld story not grounded in our own and you can have fun, don't go in wanting to take it too seriously and it's a blast and feast for the eyes. Also the side characters are hilarious, on par with Ragnarok.Definitely didn't feel like a trilogy ending film though more like an opening to the coming ones so that was unexpected. I'd see it again 100% if you like Paul rudd, LOKI, or any of the antman franchise so far- hell even just to see Bill Murray make his MCU debut- see it on the big screen(3D not necessary but would add depth) its made for a big screen for sure.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The whole good vibe of the first two is nowhere to be seen in this one. Characters like Luiz are missing.

I'll just say that you could tell when they cut out chunks of the movie to save time, which isn't necessary and takes away from the film as a whole. I mean, if some of these MCU moves are 3-3.5 hours long, 2.5 hours isn't all that bad. I would say that it furthered the MCU and opens up new possibilities, but I've never read a Marvel comic (only DC) so I'm not the greatest source concerning what could come next. Also, Kang could have been a deeper character or at the very least we could have learned more about the variants and their history. Last, I couldn't help but get strong Tron vibes from this, which is fine and only excited me more for the upcoming Tron sequel.

Despite sharing the title Evangeline Lily gets very little to do but Michael Douglas is the scene stealer with the best humour and a lot less expositional dialogue this time around.Kang is a generically evil character here but in the hands of Jonathan Majors he is an absolute force of nature, elevating this one note character into a softly spoken menace who brings the film to life whenever he's on screen.Peyton Reed's direction is fine, it looks competent overall with a few visually impressed moments but struggles to establish real scale within the quantum realm. The CG is the same as it always with these, hit and miss throughout and alternating from impressive to awful within the same scene.The music by Christophe Beck is a bit of a letdown, none of that playfulness or sense of fun that makes the previous Ant-Man scores so memorable is here and it only really comes to life during the credits.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I hemmed and hawed about my commitment to the brand as I continued to turn up for everything they put out regardless. Now that Ant-Man 3 has released as the official kickoff to Marvel's Phase 5, I'm finally ready to cut the cord, as the lack of quality in their recent content has reached a new nadir.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a soulless product, and its value rests solely in being a set-up for what Marvel will be doing in the future. The first 10 minutes or so were actually promising, starting with the good natured fun and humor of the previous Ant-Man movies, and setting up potentially interesting (though also out of left field?) character conflict. Once our cast is thrown into the Quantum Realm however (thanks to the daddy of all Deus Ex Machinas), there is little to grasp onto to enjoy the remaining runtime.The writing is atrocious, from its structure, to dialogue, plot contrivances, and even signature Marvel humor. The potentially interesting character conflict it sets up in the beginning is thrown to the wayside to make way for endless plot and exposition, as it's made clear that the priority is setting up what Marvel has in store in the future, rather than focusing on the characters in the current movie. A couple of lines are thrown out here and there to try to round out the paper-thin attempts at theme and character development, but they amount to nothing. Ultimately, there wasn't a single thing that did not ring hollow to my ears, and even a cast as effortlessly charming and talented as Ant-Man's could do little to convince me otherwise.The other component of the one-two punch that made the film so joyless to me is the physical setting of the movie. I was amazed (not in a good way) that Marvel had the confidence to set 95% of the movie in an entirely CGI realm, without providing any sense of physical reality for us to grasp onto. This is especially intriguing given that this is an Ant-Man movie, and the characters' size-altering powers are only interesting in comparison to other physical objects that the viewer can inherently understand. I also found the Quantum Realm to be, for lack of a better word, ugly. To clarify, I don't mean the route they decided to take with creature and environment design, which some could find kind of gross. The entirety of everything just amounts to something I found aesthetically unpleasant. I would never revisit this movie as something just to look at.There are a few redeeming factors. Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang was excellent, managing to lend a sense of gravitas to the happenings of the movie in spite of my total lack of investment. I also will never be able to hate dumb action and comic book goofiness, and at least some of the jokes are fairly funny. To be clear though, those standards should be the bare minimum for a film of this nature, and that is the only bar that is cleared here.When Scorsese made his ""superhero movies are only theme park rides"" comments that set the internet ablaze years ago, I was part of the camp that thought they have so much more to offer than what he was willing to see. His analogy has never been more apt than with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, however, and it's a ride that I think I'll remember more for making me want to throw up than for wanting to go on it again.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

What disappointed me most is that the Quantum Realm in this movie is never explained, but just used as an excuse to give Ant-Man another wacky world to explore full of weird and wonderful characters.Some of the character design was good in this movie with some creativley odd looking creatures, but I was expecting to learn some real science of what we know about this mysterious sub-atomic realm, and you really get none of that.Kang was a good villain and one of the better MCU villains I've seen since Thanos. He was an intimidating presence with a good backstory and costume design, but then he has his laughably bad side villain known as MODOC. He is Darren from the first film but now he has been awkwardly transformed into some floating CGI Humpty Dumpty. The CGI on him is so bad that people have now joked that he looks like Mr Electric from the movie Sharkboy and Lavagirl from 2005, with CGI that still looked bad for a movie from back then. He was kind of funny, but overall, the design just looked embarrassing more than anything else.It does feel like the MCU is in jeopardy with the movies of as late. I still have hope that Guardians 3 will be good, but I don't know what else they are going to do after that to keep this multi billion franchise afloat for 15 years now. Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, but all the kings horses and all the kings men, couldn't put the MCU back together again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Together they must find a way to get back home but Janet has been hiding a secret that eventually leads them to the mysterious Kang the Conqueror.The Ant-Man trilogy is completed and honestly, it's a total mixed bag for me as a whole, especially the second one even though I liked it I just realized it's more of a filler and not really important as for the character goes. That's why I take my time before reviewing this plus a couple of rewatch. Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania is quite solid to start phase 5, immediately introducing us to our new big-bad saga while Thanos merely just teased in the previous movies and finally makes a real presence in the last two of Infinity Saga. But the plot of the movie itself is a bit lacking on Kang's part, his ""grand"" introduction doesn't do enough justice after hyping him up in the first half and the climax is underwhelming also the pacing is somewhat inconsistent. Unfortunately, the comedy didn't land for me on this one well, some of it which make me miss Michael Peña's Luis, I mean don't we all?Jonathan Majors's worthy performance as Kang is one of if not the best parts of this movie. The visuals and CGI actually impressed me, it's not bad as I thought it would be and the world-building is kinda terrific, I like the overall design for Kang's Empire.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But it's impossible to completely cut yourself off from those in the modern era of social media. I seldom form an opinion about a piece before watching it. However, due to the current environment of unavoidable media and data overload, a first impression is frequently formed even before viewing a film. So, when I initially saw Ant-Man 3, I thought it was a horrible trainwreck with very few redeeming qualities, especially the VFX, which is utterly atrocious and intolerably poor.And now that I have watched the film, I am disappointed, not with the film but with my first impression because I had a blast with this film. In no way is this film great, and it isn't aiming for that either. It succeeds in what it's trying to achieve. The visuals are bad in some portions and great in some, actually, it's a mixed bag of sorts but the visual design is really interesting. There are some cool trippy moments conveyed through stunning visuals and I seriously don't understand what's the fuss all about its VFX. The one-liners don't always land but when they do, they are incredible. I am not saying that people who hated it are wrong, I am just saying that it's unnecessarily vilified. I loved it because it was entertaining and that's what I want from my movies, especially from Marvel. It has a good story, great character chemistry, a terrific villain, superb fight sequences, grand scale and an ever-charming Paul Rudd.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

As great and stunning as it may look, it is not so pleasant underneath. The story, writing, directing, and dialogue is just stale and cheesy.

Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's not that Quantumania was bad, it just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. So many people disliked Phase 4 in the MCU and this beginning of Phase 5 continued the trend of disappointment.Quantumania begins quick, viewers are swept into the new universe in the opening 5 minutes. Although Quantumania is just over two hours in length, there are a good chunk of scenes that feel unnecessary or bloated (I almost fell asleep in a long drawn out scene).One of my biggest issues with this movie is that there are so many forced comedic scenes and then there are attempts to be a serious sci-fi adventure immediately following. It just doesn't quite have a good balance of either. I truly believe that MCU needs to get a grip on some of these 2nd and 3rd tier characters (GofG, more specifically Peter Quill, Ant-Man and even Thor in some aspects, although I think Thor is a top tier MCU character). The main characters all have the same formula; somewhat goofy guy cracking jokes while side-kicks and supporting characters have to be the serious tone. Somehow the team bands together and saves the universe. I think I would have enjoyed this film more if they put some of the comedy aside and did a better sci-fi adaptation of the Quantum Realm.I love Jonathan Majors as Kang, but there was some about this storyline that made him less intimidating compared to say, Thanos.Oh and finally, I really disliked the ending of Quantumania! You'll know once you watch it but I'm trying to be vague to avoid spoilers!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Quantumania is MCU's ode to Star Wars fun and it really works. The Ant-Man style of comedy is still there even though the stakes are much higher with the arrival of Kang the Conqueror who Jonathan Majors masterfully made the quintessence of intimidation and menace. Marvel made the best choice casting him as the next saga's big bad because his range, expression, and delivery are nonpareil. This guy is raw acting talent.A lot could have gone wrong with Quantumania. Like most of Phase 4, it could have gone too far and still have felt all for nothing. But it was the right amount of lunacy and imagination. The only stretch is MODOK. Yeah, everyone will no doubt agree the movie could've done without him and that he's undeniably the worst thing about the movie. Every scene he's in is so distracting and cringey. Only his last few ""brother"" and ""Avenger"" lines were tolerable - really funny actually. And while the script definitely suffered from spots of juvenile jests that I don't think even kids would find funny, all in all it still did a good job concisely giving backstories and delivering heart-felt moments between Scott and Cassie - the core characters of the story.Paul Rudd still rocks as Ant-Man. His comedic chops and timing always make him so entertaining to watch. Marvel can stop with his solo movies and throw him into every other film for buddy-com action and improve every movie. It would never get old.And I'll just say for the woke-watchers...there's no agenda of any sort in this movie. The swearing is even dialed back a lot especially compared to the last few MCU films. It's definitely more family entertainment.","19 out of 40 found this helpful.

I'll be honest, I've been checked out of the last ones as it feels like they are just introducing characters and not progressing to a major story. That is until this one. What I will say though is that I've enjoyed my time. It just hasn't inspired me to want to continue watching the MCU output. Something else is that Ant-Man and The Wasp make fun movies, especially since I like Paul Rudd.Now for this one, we are after the events of Endgame. Life has gone back to semi-normal. Scott Lang (Rudd) is happy with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). They have a makeshift family with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). Hank is working with Cassie who wants to know more about the Quantum Realm. Janet doesn't want to talk about it and is closed off there. Cassie is also getting into trouble as she is socially conscious.Cassie created a device that can search the Quantum Realm. This gets this group into trouble as they get sucked in. It is now that Janet reveals what she did when she was trapped there. She met someone else in a similar situation. She helped them, but she saw what was in their heart. Also, what their plan is if they ever get out. This character is from the future and named Kang (Jonathan Majors). He is behind the Langs, Van Dyne and Hank getting sucked into the Quantum Realm.That should recap and get you up to speed with what this movie is doing. What I'm glad about is that we finally get who our next major villain to replace Thanos, Kang the Conqueror. I don't know much about this guy. What I do know is that it makes people excited. This seems like it fits since Kang is a time traveler who is destroying other timelines in the multiverse. I'm excited to see where things will go now.Outside of introducing this villain, this was my least favorite of the Ant-Man movies. It isn't the acting. Rudd is solid along with Lilly, Douglas, Pfeiffer, Majors and Newton. If anything, Rudd doesn't bring as much humor as normal. We get back Corey Stoll in an odd role. I love that they used M. O. D. O. K. The execution on screen though wasn't great. We also got a cameo from Bill Murray which was wild. I also liked Katy M. O'Brian, William Jackson Harper and the voice of David Dastmalchian. The acting is solid, but it takes a backseat to the action and effects.I'll then finish this out with the filmmaking. What I'll give credit to here is creating this fictional and smaller world of the Quantum Realm. There is limitless things that can be done here. I'll also credit the effects. This is CGI heavy, but they do look good thanks to the Disney money. Not everything though. I do want to say that. Other than that, the action sequences are good and the soundtrack works.I'm recommending this to MCU fans who want to continue the story. I don't think this is a great film, but where it goes from here has my interest piqued finally.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Rest of the characters like the Antman, Wasp, Pym were there just to support.Well while Antman got some screen time and action scenes (very poor ones), Wasp almost got nothing. Kang's character was good and supposed to be the next big challenge for the Avengers. Although he portrayed his character well, he felt nowhere as near as Thanos.I miss the good old days when a Marvel film was named after some character, they focused on that character. At this point they all feel like different shades of the Guardian of the Galaxies. Also, is it really necessary to introduce humor into every scene? It takes away from the seriousness from an intense or emotional scene.The only positive is the visual of the Quantum world.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.","41 out of 97 found this helpful.

Sure, it somehow made me smile at the cinema, and it is making you curious about Kang, especially with the two end credit scenes, but dont have too high expectations, just try to enjoy the ride, it has a few unexpected turns, but you get what you can expect from a family oriented Ant-Man franchise.If you want the long version:I will not be mean to Marvel, they get enough criticism from everyone.Kang is in the MCU, lets see how it will play out on the long run.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania"" was a wild ride sprinkled with a lot of risk on the part of the storytellers, because i think they only had the concept of what they try to do but they had no talent to make this work.The characters were played well by the actors, i dont think any of their performances were that bad (maybe Modok and the daughter of Ant-Man felt REALLY out of place, but that was mostly because of the writing), the problem is that Marvel is unable to write a story what captures emotions. At all.When a character is well written, you know why you like it or why you dislike it, but Marvel in phase 4 failed to show the MCU fans why they should like their characters, they all feel generic, no trademarks or signature moves or character flaws/strenghts which would lift up the characters, the writing is not focusing on those things, but in the superhero genre these are the things which makes the fans go crazy for their heroes.I cant say that Marvel is not trying, but if it cant pin down EXACTLY what each character means for the MCU and for the fans then they cant move the masses.Ant-Man at least has Paul Rodd who can play the character and it is not hard to build the story around it.The reason why i am not willing to give this movie more than a 7 is because the concepts which are thrown into the mix now could have been more clear, more articulated, i cant stop thinking that the whole quantum world and quantum people thing was created half heartedly, just to have a plot device, nobody cares about them or their world and their only reason is to introduce Kang.I get it, it was easier to do it this way, but that means Marvel is taking shortcuts, and i am not a big fan of the idea.I felt Kang's presence, the actor did a good job, but even if it is the 3rd movie of the Ant-Man trilogy, i kinda feel like it did not have to be so family friendly, or that the family friendly part could have ended at the 2/3 of the movie and they could have gone for a hardcore ending, showing what Kang really is about, his resolve.The way the movie is now, it is a strong 6, i only gave it a 7 because i liked Kang, i liked Paul Rodd, but the story writing was still weak.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

He's a successful author, he has his relationship with Hope van Dyne, and his bond with his daughter couldn't be stonger. All that changes when the three of them, along with Janet Van Dyne and Hank Pym, are transported to the Quantum Realm, taking them on an adventure that has them facing off against their most dangerous opponet yet.With Quantumania, Peyton Reed is the second MCU director to take a character through a full trilogy. With Ant-Man, Reed and his team crafted a simple heist film, a construct that worked famously within the confined of the shared universe. Ant-Man and The Wasp expanded the scope of Scott's world, giving viewers a Ferris Bueller-style adventure comedy focused on rescuing Janet van Dyne from the Quantum Realm. With Quantumania, the smaller, more character focused storytelling has largely been traded in for a wide ranging, consequence-heavy epic that feels out of step with its previous outings. Gone are the good natured antics and warmth of the X-Con gang, who fail to appear in the movie, replaced instead by an underdeveloped band of freedom fighters. The tone of the Ant-Man franchise, the foolish absurdity that Paul Rudd has made his bread and butter over the decades, quickly dissipates in the film's opening act, replaced by jokes that land at an inconsistent rate and cameos that ultimately amount to nothing.Written by Rick and Morty writer Jeff Loveness, the overall issue with Quantumania lies in the story. If the purpose of the story is to introduce Kang the Conqueror as the next overarching villain of the MCU, the ball was certainly fumbled here. While Kang is undeniably a threat, he doesn't feel like an Avengers-level threat during or after the events of this film. While the post credit scenes do a little to push the narrative, the movie itself fails at establishing Kang as a worthy menace, never fully revealing his overall goal outside of escaping the Quantum Realm. The Multiverse Saga was teased and set up throughout Phase 4, doing double duty as something of a dénouement of the Infinity Saga, but after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Loki, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, audiences were poised to delve fully into the multiverse and Kang's tyrannical reign upon it. Unfortunately, no such thing happens in Quantumania, continuing to leave audiences in the dark about what's coming or anyone's role in it (except Sylvie, her role was very clearly defined). It's this lack of clear definition that may leave some lukewarm on the run up to 2025's Kang Dynasty, a movie that Loveness is also the writer of.Starring Paul Rudd, Quantumania takes the time to explore the relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter Cassie. The overall theme and strongest throughline of the trilogy has been Scott's love for his daughter and this movie continues it; Rudd and Kathryn Newton have excellent chemistry together. Typically the happy-go-lucky Avenger, Rudd is able to expand a bit thanks the more dramatic elements of the film. These scenes Rudd, an actor proven that he can be just as good dramatically as he can comedically, handles with ease.The story's decision to fixate on Scott and Cassie's relationship comes at the detriment of almost every other character on screen, save Kang. Hank Pym, once again played beautifully by the seemingly perennially cantankerous Michael Douglas, has woefully little to do in this film, relegated to the background throughout the majority of the runtime. The same can be said for Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp, hanging back and serving little purpose other than to ask the questions the audience is already thinking. While the relationship between Lang and Hope van Dyne was fractured between the first two Ant-Man movies, time has managed to heal all wounds between the two here. Rudd and Lilly are always great together, with Lilly's no-nonsense nature counterbalancing Rudd's goofiness perfectly. With Quantumania, however, audiences don't get much interaction between the characters. Lilly is fine in the role, but sadly, is given little to do outside of one major scene.Michelle Pfiffer, bascially teased in the last minutes of Ant-Man and The Wasp, comes to forefront here in Quantumania as the audience's guide through the strange world. Pfiffer carries weight in the movie as Janet van Dyne navigates the heroes through the terrain while providing the necessary back story on Kang. Her agency in the movie cannot be denied, and while she takes a step back later in the film as Kang and Lang square off, she dominates the first half.Jonathan Majors is Kang. A complete 180 turnaround from the character he played in the last episode of Loki, this iteration of the character is as ruthless as he is cunning. Physically, Majors takes up space on the screen, and while he's roughly the same height as Rudd, it's Majors' presence that makes him seem larger than he is. The first of two antagonistic roles this year, Quantumania shows that while he's up to the task, the script and story don't rise to his skillset. Majors is fascinating on the screen; Kang the Conqueror doesn't fully reach the expectations levied upon him by producer Kevin Feige.The most disappointing element of the film is M. O. D. O. K. While impressive visually, and voice acted well enough by Ant-Man returnee Corey Stoll, the arc that began for Darren Cross in the first movie sees a limp and unsatisfying conclusion here. Sprinkled throughout the film generously, a lot of the jokes designed for or surrounding him fall flat in way that can't help but be reminiscent of Thor: Love and Thunder.Peyton Reed's ambition has to be admired. With some of the best visual effects since the MCU has entered the Multiverse Saga, Quantumania is a sight to behold. From the moment the characters enter the Quantum Realm, the background of almost any scene seems to be something pulled from Reed's fever dreams. While that doesn't always work in the film's favor (the actors rarely interact with the background, at times leaving a clear visual impression of two people standing in front of a screen), the praised must be heaped on the visual effects team. The trip to the Quantum Realm, the Mos Eisley cantina-esque scene, and the bevy of creatures found inhabiting the land have many comparing the movie to Star Wars, and rightfully so. It can't go overlooked that Reed unabashedly loves the Fantastic Four and actively worked on a film treatment long ago; there's scenes and ideas throughout that nod to his love of wacky space adventures. While the film's pacing is problematic, especially in its shaky first act, once Kang is finally introduced, the storytelling settles into its pace. Once established, the second act shines as the film's highlight, giving the story the feel of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, painting parts of the Quantum Realm as a desolate wasteland completely unlike what was shown near the end of Ant-Man and The Wasp. The third act, the weakest of the trilogy, enters absurd territory as Scott fights to stop Kang from enacting his nefarious scheme.Overall, Quantumania, while still entertaining at times, lacks the magic of its predecessors. The original spirit of the characters, the charm of Paul Rudd, and the low stakes of the Ant-Man franchise are absent, leaving viewers with a bleaker tone and a lack of goofy charisma they've come to expect. While Peyton Reed is still taking ambitious swings, a number of ideas don't fully connect, leaving the audience with a story that doesn't fully lives up to its potential. Rudd continues to be delightful, Jonathan Majors is appropriately menacing, and Kathryn Newton is a great addition, making the outcome of this project all the more baffling. Worth seeing on the biggest possible screen thanks to some of the great visual effects, Quantumania may have some viewers continuing to question the overall quality of the post-Endgame world we live in.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

While the Journey was fun in a guilty pleasure kind of way, this movie just puts you to sleep. I am so glad that I skipped it in the theater. If this is the way marvel movies are heading now, I will skip any future releases as well. Thor Love an Thunder looked horrible, this does as well. The only redeeming quality was Kang, who managed to wake me up in the second half of the movie, though I've heard rumors that due to some allegations Disney and other studios might want to be disassociated with Jonathan Majors for the future. There was little chemistry between the actors, the jokes are flat, the movie looks painfully fake and the third act fight with faceless soldiers against no-name troops is anticlimactic. Why even bother with this movie? Why even bother with Marvel past Endgame? So far, none of the post-endgame movies had really justified their existence.

I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU.","91 out of 234 found this helpful.

That's what I kept on thinking throughout the movie. It was way overboard on the theatrics, I would not have been surprised if it broke out into song and dance as that is where I thought the film was headed. And I really love Antman, he's my favorite MCU hero, but the movie did fall short. It's meant to be watched falling asleep on your couch with a Disney subscription and not in the theaters at $20 bucks for standard. On the positive side, I do look forward to Jonathan Majors being in the MCU, I just hope Disney doesn't turn the MCU into the Star Wars franchise. (You know what I'm talking about.)","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action scenes of the movie, the comedy scenes will not give a chance to be boring. There were some scenes inside the movie which were actually very entertaining. The director's direction, the cameraman's work, the development of everyone's character in the movie was very good. The background music suits the movie very well. Some scenes of the movie give you goosebumps. Especially the climax scene gave a different vibe. This is another good movie of Ant Man series. The performance of all the actors in the movie was very good. Specially The hero Paul Rudd who played the role of ant Man. The performance of the villain Jonathan Majors was good. Family movie. Super hero movie. This movie can be watched easily with the family from the youngest to the elders. Once, twice, thrice the movie can be watched as many times as you want. Never boring. DC studios should learn how marvel studios make their super hero movies with good direction, story, screenplay, cameraman work, character development, background score and present the movies to the audience as masterpieces. DC studio should acknowledge that marvel studio is the king of superhero movies.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the thirty-first entry into the franchise and, like at least the last twelve before it, does nothing to renew or revitalize the cinematic behemoth's trite formula. Peyton Reed is back in the director's chair, enthusiastically kowtowing to the demands of producers and ensuring there is no detectable sense of style or personal touch.Quantumania plays like a cross between tediously scripted Saturday morning cartoon and embarrassingly generic Star Wars rip-off, evoking no sense of fun or wonder despite creative makeup, costuming, and digital landscapes. It's utterly disposable and completely forgettable, but the theater was full at 3:00 pm on a Thursday, so silver lining, it will line some cultural overlords' pockets with cash.The film follows Scott Lang and company as they're sucked into the quantum realm, a land of mind-bending vistas and infinite possibilities. As Lang discovers the secrets of the realm and tries to protect his daughter Cassie, a new threat rises. Kang the Conqueror, one of Marvel's most powerful villains, takes advantage of the newly available Pym Particles, enacting a savage plan to nebulously do something or another. The film also introduces M. O. D. O. K, immediately butchering his characterization and badassery.The MCU runs the gamut from inspired to miserably inept. Quantumania proudly slots into the center of the spectrum, not nearly as imaginative or well-crafted as Iron Man or Infinity War, but not as boring or portentous as Thor: The Dark World or Eternals. It squeezes so snugly into its predestined mediocrity that it's difficult to scrape up thoughts which haven't been said of any other MCU film from the last two years.The tone is still scatterbrained due to incessant quipping, the filmic craft is still laughably corporatized, the CGI is still creative and complex though horrendously fake-looking, the villain is still stripped of all complexity or intrigue, and the heroes are still indestructible paragons of status quo ubiquity.Specifically, Quantumania's story unfolds sluggishly before kicking into hyper-speed. There's hardly time for character introductions, let alone character growth. A few minutes' stretch sets up a story of trust, subversion, and calculation, but is quickly bolled over for an overplayed, gratingly uninspired rebellion angle. By the time our characters are situated in this strange new world, the final act has started, and quickly becomes a typically rote slog.None of the performances elevate the film, though Paul Rudd is eminently likeable and Michael Douglas plays up to the stupidity of the material, charismatically smartassing his way through the adventure. Kathryn Newton is charming enough, Michelle Pfeiffer lends legitimacy to the inanity, and Evangeline Lilly...doesn't really have much to do, honestly.Jonathan Majors is the disappointment of the cast, always just teetering on the verge of sobbing no matter the scene or context. Kang is an all-powerful force of destruction, but Majors plays him like he never left the set for The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He's a great actor, but not an intimidator - he may have added thirty extra pounds of muscle to transform into a daunting presence in Creed III, but he didn't here; all he has here is a cool-looking cloak.What else is there to extrapolate after thirty previous entries? For perspective, the Bond franchise has been running for sixty years and just recently celebrated the twenty-fifth entry into its franchise, and where Bond has reasonably shifted its values, identity, and presence throughout several decades, the MCU continuously doubles down on its commitment to assembly line productions.The true shame is that, despite the staggering volume of the genre over the last twenty years, its context and potential for alteration (fundamental or superficial) has hardly been mined. Imagine a three-hour sweeping superhero epic, a dusty superhero western, or a psychological horror of superpowered insanity, all of varying budgets, tones, moods, styles, and complexity.Take the thought further - hire legendary filmmakers like David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darron Aronofsky, the Coen Brothers, David Fincher, or (your favorite filmmaker). Sure, not everyone would go for the idea, but those who do would surely produce something of staggering ingenuity and creativity; the inexhaustible subtext of a superpowered world could be explored for decades, and these production companies have limitless resources to explore it.All a pipedream. Rather than force their audiences to grow up, Marvel and DC eagerly cater to their infantilized, developmentally arrested fanbases, slapping together content like Chinese day laborers, desperate to keep the dopamine perpetually dripping. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be here soon, The Marvels soon after that.Writing this review was tedious enough; I cower to think of recording thoughts for MCU film number thirty-eight, number thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, onward and onward for eternity, until the Canadians invade, the dollar collapses, or The Living Tribunal is caught in a human trafficking scheme. Either way, blessed release.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8.

Since the budget was only 200 million, they're not used to such a low budget (in their standards). Sadly, though, you have to watch it in order to understand upcoming MCU films.

Scott Lang is still a good character, Paul Rudd is really good playing him. Grateness of Michael Douglas is noticeable in every scene.

Well no ""Cassie"" (Kathryn Newton), not quite. You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from ""Star Wars"" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing ""M. O. D. O. K"" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) after it had had a good time with ""V. I. N. C. E. N. T"" from ""The Black Hole"" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer ""Janet"" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of ""Kang the Conqueror"" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (""Pym"") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now. This is really forgettable fayre.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also was it really necessary to have a cameo from an older comedic actor (I won't spoil who) that has been reportedly abusive on set.

Id maybe go see it again. I like that it didnt get into Star Trek territory. Maybe I just liked it because there hasnt been any good movies out lately. I loved seeing what the villain was all about. Id rather immerse myself in this CGI world than Avatar. It has some different characters, giving us something other than superheroes and tech. If youre looking for something to trip out on, something like Aquaman, its freaking awesome. The realm feels like when Dr Strange fought Dormammu, which was an wicked scene. When i compare it to the other stuff out there like on TV Carnival Row, Picard, Moon Girl...Quantumania blows them out of the microshpere.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

K, Bill Murray, I was expecting so much more, the MCU has really let itself go in recent years, its standard for what a good movie is has decreased a lot.Ant-Man is my favourite MCU character ever, and the fact that I was watching an Ant-Man movie and Ant-Man wasn't my favourite character really shows how much of a let down this movie is.Also, why did Cassie keep calling Hank and Janet grandma and grandpa, isn't her mother Judy Greer's character from the first two, she's not related to them at all. And in Endgame Scott said that five years in the quantum realm felt like five hours, so in theory if Janet was there for about thirty years, surely she was just in the quantum realm for about 30 hours.

Still, it deserves better than it got from most critics. It suffers by comparison with earlier Ant-Man films mostly because it isn't the lighthearted palate cleanser that the first two were, but it's occupying a very different position in its MCU phase this time. Tasked with launching the first big chapter of the Kang story, it may have been unfair to use an Ant-Man and Wasp film this way, when fans have come to expect something else from them. But the movie was good overall, the humor worked, the effects were visually stunning, and the cast felt like a solid ensemble. Far from my favorite entry in the MCU, it was definitely good enough for me to look forward to seeing again when I eventually do.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When compared to Thanos, Kang doesn't feel as powerful or engaging to viewers. His story so far is just not as gripping as Thanos.Story is ok but not great with a few plotholes around.

As the first entry in MCU's fifth phase, the film is like an injection of sugar directly into the eyes, but everything feels inauthentic and tired.Let's be clear - 'Ant-Man' was never a core member of the Avengers and is not a crowd favorite (no offense to Paul Rudd, who is a good actor and portrays the blaséness of Scott Lang to a T). So, it's to be expected that, now on his third solo (or duo, I guess, given his pairing with Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne/Wasp) outing, things are getting stale. Maybe it's the Star Wars-ification of the franchise given some glaring similarities within the Quantum Realm (thanks, Disney). Or perhaps it's the lack of strong villains (Corey Stoll's floating head and the now-canceled Jonathan Majors as Kang do not cut it).Either way, this movie is a quantum bust.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

A lot can be said about this film. Some performances were surprisingly awful and some were incredible. Cassie Lang played by Kathryn Newton was irritating, obnoxious, and unconvincing, adding nothing to the story. Meanwhile, being poorly written, I don't why she was chosen to replace Emma Fuhrmann from 'Avengers Endgame'. Janet Van Dyne played by Michelle Pfiffer was also underwhelming, as she showed little emotion during lines, and I failed to feel any kind of connection to the character. On a more positive note, Paul Rudd's humor was absolutely off the charts (as it was in every other performance I've seen him in). Jonathan Majors delivered, by far the greatest performance, as most of his lines are composed of philosophical ideas, and made me question who was right and who was wrong. Kang The Conquerer will become an interesting and conflicted moralist in the MCU. Obviously it was great to see Bill Murray as Lord Krylar. The overall plot was very weak, recycling over used plot points from other Marvel films. That is until the gears shift during the middle, when more of Kang's backstory is explained. If you're a Marvel fan, or at least genuinely interested in the MCU, It's definitely worth checking out. My opinion will probably change in due time, but as of right now 6/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

First off, this isn't a excellent Marvel film, but it's not a terrible one either. This is a average MCU film to kick off Phase 5 of the MCU and honestly will probably only be remembered for being the start of Phase 5. It was great to see Paul Rudd back as Ant-Man, but I feel some of the source material that was given to him wasn't always the best. Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp was great to see again, but I feel like her character was sidelined for a majority of the film including Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. Both characters have their moments throughout the film that I enjoyed though. The standout characters that carry this movie were definitely Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet Van Dyne and Jonathan Majors Kang the Conqueror. I loved every scene these two characters were in together and loved the chemistry between them as well. It left me wanting more of both of them together. I was also glad to get more of a back story of Janet's time in the quantum realm. Jonathan Majors hands down is Kang the Conqueror and gives this movie his best performance he could possibly give with the source material given to him. The only downside I had with his character, is like Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, not all of the source material given to him was always the best and was disappointing sometimes, but Kang the Conqueror was definitely my favorite character of the entire film. One character I thought that was better than I thought would be due to the other actress who played the character in Avengers: Endgame was recast in this movie was Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang. I came around and really enjoyed her take on the character. I can't wait to see more of her in the future. The last character that I loved in this movie that I was aware of going into this movie, was gonna be either a love or hate character was M. O. D. O. K. And I absolutely loved this character more than I anticipated too. He had some of the best lines in the film and even though his CGI wasn't always the best, Marvel was able to pull off his character introduction better than I thought they would. When it comes to the tone of the movie, I feel like Marvel copied Star Wars way too much when it came to the source material and it didn't always sit right with me. There are also 2 post credit scenes. The first one honestly in my opinion wasn't a fan of, but the second one has me hyped for what's to come in the future. Overall, this film isn't perfect, but the performances given by Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer, make this film worth the watch. Rating 7.5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Man, something that has happened a million times, and ok, the visuals were great, that's Marvel's strength, but besides, not so much good. Acting and story was weak, and it was too long. The flashback of the characters was showed badly, they showed it in moments that didn't just feel right to put in there, and the introduction of new characters feeled too fast and rushed. It is surprising that they was so long in one place in the movie, for a space adventure, I think people should travel across many new places.

Even if for a small cameo I think Michael Peña would be fine about it considering we don't know if he dusted of Thanos's snap effect. Double disappointment is because they recasted Cassie from Endgame. Apart from that, only the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror saved this film. Lord Krylar, Jentorra, and Quaz unfortunately they were so easily forgotten. And M. O. D. O. K was not what I imagined or expected, especially the action towards the end.

Are you getting tired of superhero movies yet? Can Ant-Man save the day? (Well, he did in his last movie.)
This new addition to the Ant-Man story is Marvel's 31st movie! The president of Marvel Studios announced that this movie will be a ""direct line"" into Phase 5, leading into Avengers: The Kang Dynasty in 2025.Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne, along with Hope's parents and Scott's daughter, are accidentally sent to the Quantum Realm. They find themselves interacting with all kinds of strange, new creatures that threaten their lives and understanding.The movie was directed by Peyton Reed. Jack Kirby wrote the story with Jeff Loveness working on the screenplay.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
People and characters in danger
Talk of infidelity and their ""needs""
Some profanity and crude languageTHINGS I LIKED:
The cast includes our faves from the last two movies, as well as a few new faces: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Bill Murray, Kathryn Newton, William Jackson Harper, David Dastmalchian, and the wonderful Jonathan Majors.Keep watching during the closing credits for another scene that leads perfectly into Season 2 of Loki.It kind of feels like this movie was developed at the same time Disney was working on Strange World.There are so many creative, new characters, some good and some bad.The world-building is inventive and interesting.It cracked me up when Dr. Hank Pym used his handy-dandy enlarger to get a large pizza when he only paid for a small one. Ha ha
If you can never get enough of the Star Wars cantina scenes, you'll get a kick out of what's offered here.Fun fact #1: The movie was filmed in Georgia (USA), London (England), and Turkey.Lots of action sequences.Kang the Conquerer is a fascinating character that we'll get to learn more about in future MCU films. Jonathan Majors does an excellent job introducing us to this powerful foe.Audiences are loving the exploration of the multiverse that Marvel is taking us into.There are some amusing running gags that kept me entertained.I used to love Baskin Robbins when I was a little girl. Ha ha The reference and Scott-employee cameo were cute.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
As much as I like Evangeline Lilly (and I do!), I didn't like her with short hair.Kathryn Newton replaced the younger Cassie Lang. She does a fine job but her self-righteous teenage attitude is annoying.Some viewers are complaining that the plot is too thin and just feels like a set-up for future Marvel films.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Despite boasting a talented cast and some visually impressive moments, the film's lackluster plot and poorly developed characters leave much to be desired. The introduction of Kang the Conqueror promised a new level of villainy, but his portrayal feels one-dimensional and fails to create any real sense of threat.The movie's attempts at humor often fall flat, relying on tired jokes and gags that have become all too familiar from the previous films. The pacing feels uneven, with slow and meandering scenes that do little to advance the narrative. While the film's visual effects are a redeeming factor, they can't compensate for the overall disappointment that is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Fans of the Marvel universe might find some fleeting moments of enjoyment, but ultimately, this installment adds little to the franchise and leaves audiences wanting more substance and depth.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now we have Wasp (Hope) and Hank & Janet (the original Ant-Man and Wasp), plus Cassie, Scott's daugther. Cassie comes across as the most annoying character, as it is a newcomer and just an excuse to introduce the plot and have more family moments inserts, or aimed to a teenage audience.The story is pretty straight forward, with the family getting sucked by accident into the Quantum realm, ans having to face Kang, who has become the king there. Won't mention why Kang is there, to avoid spoilers. I did expect a more complex plot or twists, so it was a bit disappointing.However, the action sequences, the well timed jokes and the inmense imagination of the film make up for it.I liked Kang in Loki (Im a fan of the comicbooks' Kang, and even thou he is less intellectual/philosopher, the visceral acting pays off as a more savage version of the character), and he is the best character in the film. Underused, but probably to have it in a future play bigger threats.Michael Douglas steals the show a few times, specially at the end with some ants in what feels like a homage to the original Henry Pym.Entertaining, no politics, no slap in the face to old fans, and can be watched independently. That's a win after several bad films from Marvel. Marvel back in track, hopefully. A 7/10 score.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

If you have watched the trailer of Ant-Man, it's basically the first 30 minutes of the movie, and should you expect more from that? No! The movie focused more on proving why Ant-Man deserved to be in the Avengers despite making his character comical and a caricature during the Avengers era. Due to this, Jonathan Major's character, Kang, felt like a weaker version of Thanos even though the movie heavily implied that he was powerful and dangerous because of what he wanted to do.The movie has a very rough and uneven pace. The first act felt bumpy and jagged, but the second act was able to redeem it. One good act can't redeem a film overstuffed with so much story, and many characters, that you'll hope everyone would stall their hackneyed jokes. Since this is an introduction to another adventure for the MCU, we are introduced to so many characters, that resulted in them being underwritten, and some characters from the franchise are underutilized. Evangeline Lilly's character, Hope, was overshadowed by Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and I am more invested in Janet's story than Hope's. Bill Murray as Lord Krylar also has a cameo but they wrote his character to be somewhat interesting but was left off, or maybe since this is just an introduction to his character---I don't really know. Corey Stoll as M. O. D. O. K was a fun and weird-looking character as well, but it felt like a one-off that can only be used once. However, I appreciate that they used the same character to play M. O. D. O. K. As it added relevance to the story.In all honesty, it was Paul Rudd's charm and humor that carried the comedy in this film, and this time, his character has more sense and does not feel like a caricature version of Paul Rudd. Unfortunately, lackluster writing and repetitive Marvel clichés did not allow for Rudd's effortless charm to carry the movie. My biggest problem with the film is how they did not fully utilize Kang's story, it was heavily implied in the movie that he was stronger and bigger than most villains in the MCU and it was shown in the movie the danger of what he wanted to do but failed to demonstrate it. By placing an opponent that is nearly godly level, it should feel threatening and terrifying to the point that Ant-Man can't even fight him toe-to-toe, however, the villain looked like on the same level as Thanos' Corvus Glaive.Is Ant-Man 3 worth watching to keep up with Marvel's new phase? Yes! But the movie settled on being ""just okay"" and is primarily stuck on needing to be bigger instead of being amusing, compelling, and unique. Nonetheless, as an introduction to Phase 5, there is much more to wait for and a story to tell, and the Quantumania is a good realm to start.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Special case for Marvel since it had to introduce the first appearance of Kang the villain who will accompany us throughout Phase Five. The real KANG and not the one we have already seen in Loki.The movie was more or less what I expected. Lots of cgi as we had seen from the Trailers, lots of action and quite entertaining.There were some things where you say ok Ia m here and I am watching a Pixar movie. Personally aside from She Hulk, I have had nothing but complaints about this whole Disney Marvel thing. I am not saying that the movie is bad because of some scenes that maybe were a bit invalid for Marvel and more reminiscent of a Pixar movie, they were just completely out of character for a movie that has to show a lot of seriousness since it introduces the new main villain of the universe Anyway, Honestly, the whole setting of Quantum realm reminded me of star wars. The environment the weapons the characters of this universe even the costumes of the actors were like the movie was set in one of the planets of star cities no joke.Still I think Ant man is just a good movie. Entertaining, the cast excellent as in the previous films. Kang will be a dynamic villain who I believe will show even more tough elements in future films Dynamic credit scenes.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have to, because Quantumania really was disapointing. Lately, Marvel thinks that movies are only about good CGI and high-school jokes.No good plot, no strong and complex character personalities, no follow up with any of the previous Ant-Man movies, no good storyline. Its like watching cartoons for kids with low memory score.Scott Lang looks like he cant do anything without his wife and the help of ants. What male character? They've turned Ant-Man into a complete joke with a nice crazy suit.CGI and the quantum world is pretty interesting though, and the similiarities with Star Wars are quite obvious in some character outlooks.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Starting with Paul Rudd(ANTMAN), he justified his role.. Others were also OK... But the best part of this movie is JOHNATHAN MAJORS (KANG), he totally justified his role.. Also VFX is amazing and showed Quantum realm beautifully...
But the reason this movie falls short is because of boring start, average storyline & strange ending where Kang looked weak(which he is not in comic books).. Also Kathryn Newton totally fall flat portraying Casie because of her plain expressions... MODOK totally looked like Joker in this movie... Such things break viewers and MCU fans heart....
I agree every movie can't be of Endgame level, but MCU and Kevin fiege shouldn't take such important movie casually & Directors need to make well balanced movies like during Phase 1,2 and 3...

The hardest laughs belong to MODOK, who is deliberately designed to look ridiculous. It wasn't a mistake, it's the whole point. MODOK is one of the best things about this movie, especially because you can't take him seriously. Perhaps the tonal shifts were too stark and that's what isn't sitting well with Marvel fans.

But it still feels like too much.Also, what made the first 2 ant-man movies fun is that it happened in the real world. It was funny to see him shrink or to blow up small objects (small car driving on regular road, for example...). Here everything is happening is a fake world, so ant-man's abilities are much less interesting or impressive.I went to see this one with my 10yo kid. He loved it.

Still, what he brough to the table was a more charming, goofier version of a superhero who was family friendly and more down to earth as many of the other characters. Paul Rudd made the character his own and offered an alternative to the beefed-up, super smart uebermenschen who populate the MCU these days.Well, no more, because Quantumania took the Ant-Man formula and stepped on it like a boot on a bug. The bonkers and contrived story throws Ant-Man, Wasp and the rest of the family in yet another universe of alien characters, that turns Marvel into a Star Wars rip-off (but without the wit of the first Guardians movie which more or less did the same idea many years ago).Kathryn Newton seems to be the only one who remotely cares about her character Cassie and is the best thing about this movie, although I have to say, if I see one more teen wunderkind in of these movies I'm going to jump off a cliff. The rest of the cast phones in their performances. Michael Douglas looks like he doesn't even know what movie he's in.A serious turn for the worst for the MCU.

Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is a lifeless & lacklustre entry that has the ambition but not the vision to bring its quantum universe to life with any cinematic flair and isn't just the weakest of the three Ant-Man films but is arguably the worst offering in the shared universe.Directed by Peyton Reed, the story finds Scott Lang & his family accidentally transported to the quantum realm where they discover a new threat. All the elements that made its predecessors fun, lighthearted & small-scale adventures is gone in this latest outing as it comes packed with terrible visuals, cringe writing, uninspiring action & bland storytelling. Even the world building & character designs have a juvenile quality to them.Strongly abiding by the Marvel formula and deficient in even the basic filmmaking aspects, the film never manages to create any sort of intrigue or interest despite the uncharted territory the plot takes place in. The dialogues are atrocious, its attempts at humour fall flat every time and the performances are mediocre at best. Much is said about Jonathan Majors' impressive input but his work stands out only coz the rest are much worse.Overall, Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest eyesore from the crumbling franchise that's been on a downhill journey for some time now and may have just hit its lowest point with their latest run-of-the-mill garbage. A disappointment on all fronts despite my low expectations and an embarrassing piece of blockbuster entertainment, Quantumania is an empty spectacle and an early contender for the worst film of the year. A new low for Marvel Studios.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Because then we'd have a serious movie with a light mood.But antman 3 had an appropriate amount of Jokes. The cgi at times was wonderful, the world they created was pretty cool at times. They brung in new characters that complimented the movie and didn't detract or seem agenda driven. The villain was at least as good as ultron avengers 2, if not better. Was a nice surprise they saved for viewers also, which was one of the best parts in my opinion.Really my only gripe was the character that was included to gain the young audience. That basically ruined it for me. The whole family vibe is corny as it is, but the ""young"" youthful character arc just didn't fit. Maybe the directors thought the previous antman films needed the ""young"" arc not sure. But as a 42 year old man I just wanna see some good old comic book interpretation without the Hollywood machine using its influence for commercial purposes.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Phase five, which starts with ""Quantumania"" is off to a similar start.Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and his family are pulled back into the Quantum Realm and become embroiled in a civil uprising that is taking place there. The inhabitants are rebelling against Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) a Kang variant banished and trapped in the Quantum realm by other versions of himself. Though still unable to escape, thanks to help by Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) when she was trapped also, he was able to gain some of his powers and take control. Kang attempts to negotiate a deal with Lang, to recover a part of his ship and facilitate his departure.Interestingly, or perhaps confusingly would be a better term for it, one of my principal problems with this Ant-Man movie is that it doesn't really need to be about Ant-Man. The ability to get small, or big doesn't ever really play that much of a part in the plot, nor does his abilities as a skilled thief. It could just as easily have been any hero sent to do this. Visually, this also sacrifices any of those scenes from the first film, where the characters interact with a giant version of something. This is not to say that Rudd does anything wrong. He's just as charming and funny as he ever was. Johnathan Majors is great as is the rest of the Van Dyne/Lang family. (Incidentally Cassie keeps calling the Van Dyne's Grandma and Grandpa - which implies that Scott and Hope have married?).I really liked the idea of what they do with MODOK in this film, even if it's perhaps an underutilisation of a character they could have gotten more out of. It's clever how that's worked into the wider story. It's a frankly awful visual effect though, perhaps the worst in the whole MCU, worse than a ""She-Hulk"" walking wide shot.I don't know this for a fact, and I don't post reviews with spoilers, but it's hard to argue that some of the late moments of the film don't come from reshoots and their decision to pull away from a darker, sacrificial one, is the wrong one for me.I'm not going to stop seeing these film, I can't imagine even a really bad one would make me do that, but I sure wish they'd make another one I love pretty soon.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

They've surrounded themselves in an echo chamber where they feel they can't do wrong. They need to fire screenwriters who are tone deaf to what the audience wants.

It's probably the most visually interesting of the trilogy only because it has more colors than the first two films combined. He actual visuals and cinematography aren't great though. Everything here feels very unmotivated and bland. It doesn't feel like there is a purpose to any of the shots and they are just going through a checklist of basic shots to get for the scene without feeling creative or interesting. The visuals effects range from okay to just bad. Clearly they didn't spend enough time on them and it really shows here because almost every shot has a lot of visual effects work done on them. There is no sense of size or space in these shots especially towards the end where Cassie Lang is over 10 times the size of MODOK but you really couldn't tell if you just watched the clip and not the whole scene. The story is kind of interesting? They definitely had a really solid first draft that just needed a little more work done but instead of doing that, they just took that first draft and ran with it so a lot of ideas and concepts feel underdeveloped and uninteresting. This could have been solved with a rewrite or two but clearly Feige and them don't care about actually doing that work. Most of the performances are good. Paul Rudd is still doing a great job and Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are good as well. Jonathan Majors did a great job as well but with everything that came out after this film came out, the less said the better. Shame that he screwed up his career just as he was taking off. Bill Murray was kind of awful though here but thankfully his scene is short. Kang as the villain was the best part of the film. He was fun and engaging and his plan was interesting but his final scene is awful. For an all powerful being, he goes out really poorly. The humor is all over the place. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's unbearably unfunny. There really isn't a whole lot here to like but it's mostly just boring and not bad like Thor 4 and Black Widow. You can honestly probably skip this one unless you really wanna see Kang.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first film felt more like a non superhero film with low stakes but still a lot of character building, Scott Lang recently gets out of prison but is trying hard to win back his daughter. The first and second Ant-Man film as laugh out loud funny, and especially the second film which probably is the funniest Marvel superhero movie ever (yes, funnier than Deadpool 1 and 2 which I didn't think were all that funny). The 3rd Ant-Man film was not that funny, though there were a few funny moments but I didn't really laugh out loud, the humor felt more like cartoon humor for children while the previous films were funny for both adults and children alike. Speaking of it being for children, the Ant-Man 3 film felt like it was heavily ""Disneyfied"" with much less violence and the violence seem like it has been toned down, plus there was no kiss at the end when Ant-Man and the Wasp saved the day which made it feel like there's no chemistry between the two. Hope's father, Hank, was barely in the 3rd film, while he was integral in the first two films. The 2nd Ant-Man film had way more action sequence, and the buildup was much better (especially when Hank finally reunites with Janet after like 30 years, getting into the Quantum realm to save her finally, and plus they actually kissed unlike Hope and Scott in Ant-Man 3... so the the love between the characters felt more real in the previous films). The boring thing in Ant-Man 3 is they used the same old trope of inspiring the common folk to rise up and fight back against the oppressors, very similar to many movies like Star Wars, Dune, Lord of the Rings, etc. It just felt outdated for a big movie in 2023. It seems like Disney is going to far with the campiness, just like they did in Thor 4 Love and Thunder which that film and Ant-Man 3 felt like it was a movie mostly meant for kids to watch. I guess it's a money making strategy to make it very family friendly and light hearted but it starts to become stale and people get sick of it. A lot of people diss the DC films like Man of Steel (2013) or Zack Snyder's Justice League saying it's too serious and not funny/campy enough, but looking back, I think people are now realizing that these films have more depth and an artistic feel to it.But enough of the bad stuff, the movie did do some good things. Paul Rudd has great comedic timing as always, and he is always likable no matter what. There were some funny scenes such as when Hank gets jealous of Lord Krylar (played by Bill Murray). Jonathan Majors did a great job as Kang, the acting was good.Disney and Marvel kind of ruined this film. The thing that makes Marvel so big and popular is also the thing that is ruining their movies, they are a double edged sword. They wanted everything in the MCU to connect, so they used Ant-Man 3 to introduce the big bad guy, Kang... And they want to introduce a future young hero, Cassie (Ant-Girl), and have her in a future young Avengers movie. The first two films didn't really have anything to do with the main story of the MCU, except only in the end credits scenes. And then Marvel and Disney's obsession with making campy kid friendly films, and the heavily reduced violence disliking kissing in the movies for some reason (no kiss in Ant-man 3, no kissing in the first Disney Star Wars movie). Many have said people are ""burnt out"" seeing superhero films... But I don't think that's necessarily true, I think people are tired of the same old stuff and the movies becoming far too light hearted to the point where people don't even take it seriously anymore. Hence why I mentioned earlier about the early DC movies (ones written by Christopher Nolan, like the Dark Knight trilogy and Man of Steel), these films feel more than just superhero films as they have more seriousness and depth which makes it feel like a non superheroe film. But if you're going to make a funny movie, then make it funny like the first and second Ant-Man films, maybe they should have gotten Paul Rudd involved with the writing to help the jokes land better... And they need to make a movie that adults could enjoy, not just only for kids. I give it a 6 out of 10 because I still enjoyed it somewhat but it was disappointing.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This character deserves better and it distracts from the better aspects of the movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The building of the entire world of the Quantum realm seems effortless, yet it is thrown to your face instantly. Performance wise, Majors and Pfiffer are the heavy hitters. It is a bold, risky and ambitious first step into the future of the MCU and that alone deserves some acknowledgment.CONS: Kang and MODOK both felt underused. The main plot is pretty basic, yet it's not deepened by the numerous other elements. So don't look for any philosophical counterpoints like in Civil War between the opposing sides. MODOK is supposed to look weird, but they could do a lot better than just stretching a face. The result of the final fight makes you question some already established facts about the new Saga, but it can still be reconned.Overall, it's just a fun and lighthearted movie. Not perfect, but still a lot better than the last few missteps since the conclusion of the Infinity Saga.Edit for haters: I know our time and age has made it difficult to grasp a point of view that isn't fully against or all in to something. Maybe trying it once in a while, won't hurt as much as you think.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Now the initial set-up is pretty weak, rushed and frankly unbelievable, and Cassie is quite grating throughout, and as usual we are treated to the obligatory mass CGI bun fest at the end though i would say this one was above average featuring a bit more variety than usual. All in all perfectly fine if you are an MCU fan, and I suspect the generallly negative reception this film received has more to do with general fatigue with the MCU than anything specific to this movie.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

""BOTOX in the Subatomic Ant Universe"" is the latest sci-fi blockbuster that's got everyone buzzing.The movie follows a team of scientists who discover that the subatomic particles that make up ants can be used to create a new form of BOTOX that can make you look younger and more beautiful than ever before. But of course, there are some pesky ants who are trying to get in the way of this scientific breakthrough.The lead scientist, Dr. Vanessa Van Der Ant, is played by none other than Angelina Jolie. With her stunning looks and brains to match, she's the perfect choice for the role. And the ants? Well, let's just say they're not your average garden variety insects. These ants are smarter, faster, and more ruthless than any you've ever seen.The real star of the movie, though, is the special effects. The scenes of the scientists shrinking down to microscopic size and exploring the subatomic ant universe are truly mind-blowing. It's like ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" meets ""The Matrix,"" with a dash of ""Antz"" thrown in for good measure.Of course, there are some critics out there who say that the science in the movie doesn't quite add up. But who cares about scientific accuracy when you have a movie this entertaining? It's like ""Jurassic Park"" meets ""The Fountain of Youth,"" with a side of ""Breaking Bad.""In conclusion, ""BOTOX in the Subatomic Ant Universe"" is a fun and ridiculous ride that's sure to please audiences who love their science fiction with a side of humor. So go ahead, indulge in some cinematic BOTOX and let this movie take you on a wild ride through the subatomic ant universe!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Cinemas really need to sort this out. I paid money to sit an watch a movie at 15:00 it didn't start until 15:45!!Spoiler free reviewThis does not course correct the MCU. Based on the trailers, I didn't have high expectations and I was still disappointed and underwhelmed, as I loved the first Ant-Man and liked the follow up. That said it was still OK.There are somethings I liked, Paul Rudd was his usual likeable self. Jonathan Majors was a decent enough Kang, at least for the first half of the movie. There is a good family drama underneath all the cgi nonsense, that really should have been the movies main plot point. It works when it's about the family. I thought Michelle Pfeiffer was great and I really liked Michael Douglas, too!!Did they recast the daughter??What I didn't like, was once it got down to it,in the second half, Kang was just another disposable Marvel bad guy. Bill Murray was a distraction and this will not help his career.A big problem for me was it bottled what could have been a great ending. It looked like it was leading to a something I would have liked and then it went in another direction. I also would have liked to have spent more time with Jentorra played by Katy O' Brian. She has a decent sized role, I wanted more of her.All in all, I'm it's down there with the bottom half of the MCU movies for me, but not right down there with Thor 2 and Iron Man 2There were seven other people in my screening. I have never seen such a small number for the opening day of an MCU movie.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

While the external stakes are clear & weighty, emotional drive felt slight (and levity even lighter). That said, Jonathan Majors rules.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness and more recently Avatar 2.M. O. D. O. K Was Good But Not As i Wanted, I Understand Where The Hate Come From.Michelle Pfeiffer Was Amazing Maybe the Third Time is Charm Great Dialogue And Backstory.Of Course Jonathan Major Steals The Show So Excited For What Comes next for Him The Man is A Beast.One of the things I didn't like in the movie is the misuse of The wasp Even Kathryn Newton Had a better writing in the movie pitch. As always paul Rudd delivers and Proves that he is one of marvel's best casting.One of the best aspects about the movie is the soundtrack Christophe Beck fascinates once again.At the end, I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While it occasionally delivers humorous moments, the film is plagued by a lifeless bitterness that has seeped into the franchise, leaving audiences unimpressed. Director Peyton Reed struggles to find the right balance of sentiment, humor, and superhero action, resulting in a lackluster experience that fails to captivate.The movie kicks off with a promising opening section, set in the familiar Marvel present, where Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) recounts his heroic endeavors as Ant-Man following the events of the Thanos Snap. Unfortunately, the majority of Quantumania takes place in the Quantum Realm, a microworld that feels detached from the engaging narrative established earlier. Here, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) introduces the existence of a complex society within the Quantum Realm, rife with alien tribes and constant conflict. Among them is Kang (Jonathan Majors), an enigmatic and powerful being who had been exiled to this dimension.However, the film fails to connect these intricate elements with the core characters, namely Ant-Man and the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). In a rushed sequence, our heroes, along with Janet and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), find themselves abruptly sucked into the Quantum Realm. The lack of build-up and coherence makes it feel like a haphazard dream sequence, leaving viewers bewildered.The narrative suffers from a lack of focus, meandering between Scott Lang's personal journey and the introduction of the Quantum Realm's expansive world. This fragmentation results in a disjointed storyline that fails to fully engage the audience. While the film attempts to explore the potential of the Quantum Realm, it ultimately falls short, leaving viewers craving more substance and depth.Despite a talented cast, including the charismatic Paul Rudd and the seasoned Michelle Pfeiffer, the performances are hindered by the underdeveloped script. The once-refreshing humor found in previous Marvel films is overshadowed by a bitter tone that pervades Quantumania, making it difficult to fully embrace the characters' adventures.Visually, the film offers glimpses of the Quantum Realm's intricate landscapes and alien tribes, but these moments are not enough to compensate for the overall lackluster execution. The action sequences, while present, lack the intensity and innovation that audiences have come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.In conclusion, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors. The film's disjointed narrative, lack of character development, and bitter undertones leave viewers unimpressed and disconnected. While there are occasional moments of humor and visual intrigue, they are not enough to salvage the overall mediocrity of the movie. Marvel enthusiasts may find some enjoyment, but for others, this installment falls short of expectations.Overall rating: 6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

you have to admit yourselve that like the music has its peak note and its crescendoes you have already hit the peak note in ""Avengers"". From now on taking the same heroes ""Antman"" in this case whatever villains you will try to create are seen very dull,I have seen this before, or O not again (facepalm) because the viewers are comparing it automatically to ""Thanos"". Nothing can be more interesting than ""thanos"" and his backstories. Here also story has suffered the same.Do the Paul rodd has wittiness as scott lang ? Yes he has , are the jokes landing properly ? Most of them are . But to create the superhero movie they are not enough.because of this it seems o again similar kind of marvel movie.You can see powepacked performers again binded together Major as a major villain, Douglas and for brief bill murray as well. The story is okay, However I would have loved if the antagonist development was carefully done may be 2 to 3 stories to make him ,break him and then recreate him.

You just don't ""buy"" much of the tension or plot development in this one. Side characters and plots are shallow & forgettable. I completely forgot Bill Murray had been in this movie until I remembered a couple days after I had seen it. Cassie is ""introduced"" much too quickly, and the bulk of the main plot kicks off far too abruptly to let you settle into the Marvel universe or get to know the ""new"" characters.The clunky dialogue in the script gave the actors no room to shine, and no performance stood out to me. Straight-up overdramatic Steven Segal level, ""yeah, I came back for you. So let's do this."" ""I don't have to win, we just both have to lose"" type of stuff throughout, with few actual conversations. Almost every line is a throwaway. The few serious/emotional conversations in the film felt shallow, especially since so little depth was shown in the characters or their dialogue throughout. One particular new character was overacting dramatically, and that combined with the shoddy dialogue made some of my theater groan any time she showed up.The entire movie is CGI (totally fine based on the story they're telling) but most of it looks noticeably bad compared to past films, let alone on its own. It's never been so apparent how overworked & underpaid marvel's effects department is. Feels very ""Spy Kids."" There were lots of ""cute"" CGI creatures, robots, and animals, but they felt shallow as well. They didn't seem creatively made or thought out, and the background environments got boring after a while, like it was just the same looped Windows screensaver over and over.I've been on board with Marvel since Iron Man and I admit they've pumped out a few clunkers over the past 5 years, but this one really took the wind out of my MCU sails. They've never put out something as soulless and void of heart & thought as this.I thought it was cool when Kang demonstrated his powers toward the end, even if he did randomly stop in order to accommodate the protagonists' plot armor. Jonathan Majors gives a physically & visually intimidating performance as Kang. The opening of the movie was funny. There was one new character introduced that I enjoyed for the most part. The very last fight was intense and I genuinely didn't know who was going to win.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

The way they cared for their family were heartbreaking. The hole movie was about keeping Cassie safe.The was Marvel is going is interesting.

You will know how wide Majors' acting range is so you can understand why Marvel Studios chose him to play Kang.Janet's past, which was trapped for 30 years in the Quantum Realm, was finally revealed through Quantumania, so that Janet had a larger appearance than in the previous Ant-Man film. Pfeiffer also used this opportunity as best as possible by making Janet look more prominent. Plus, Majors and Pfeiffer's collaboration looks so harmonious in scenes about their past together in the Quantum Realm.As the two main actors in the Ant-Man franchise, Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly give less than memorable performances in Quantumania. Then, Marvel Studios' decision to change the role of Cassie from Emma Fuhrmann to Kathryn Newton seems to have been a mistake. Newton's acting quality is really bad throughout the film, and Rudd and Newton's chemistry as father and son is also poorly formed.Apart from Newton's bad acting as Cassie, Michael Douglas also looks too old to play Hank Pym. It's not a matter of appearance, it's clear that Douglas doesn't have enough stamina to do many actions. As a result, Hank is only shown in moments that don't really require much action in this film.Jonathan Majors' stunning acting as Kang the Conqueror can't even help the quality of the Quantumania script which is immature and lazy writing. For a film that is touted as the pinnacle of the MCU by Kevin Feige, the underwhelming quality of Quantumania is still far from that claim. Is this a sign that Marvel Studios is starting to struggle with carrying the MCU after the huge success of Avengers: Endgame?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They weren't perfect movies, but they first film and it's sequel both succeeded as comedies, over everything else. And it made for a really nice break after phases full of more ""generic"" superhero fare. It's why he worked so well in Civil War and Endgame; Antman is the pallet cleanser of the franchise.But I didn't laugh once during this movie. In fact, I was cringing constantly; it was the opposite of comedy. It was the thing I normally got a break from during an Antman title: it was THE MOST generic superhero slop ever produced.Safely filmed on the Volume, revolutionized by The Mandalorian, this film lacks any scope, the entire film very much feeling like it was all filmed in the corner of a soundstage. Fold that in with terrible writing, phoned in performances by actors who are clearly tired of these types of movies, and an inappropriate amount of CGI action schlock, that doesn't look good at all, because VFX artist are used like cattle in this industry.The whole film is a representation of that post-pandemic thought process ""quantity over quality""; lots of nothing meant to keep you distracted for two hours, after they already have your money.The best thing that could have happened to this movie, and Disney/Marvel, is exactly what happened:The audience didn't fall for it; it's the lowest rated MCU installment, and made the least amount of money. The audience showed the studio that if you keep spoon feeding us garbage, we're gona wise up and keep our lips sealed at some point.So a 10/10 rating for the audience (I'm proud of you), but a 1/10 for a really tremendous waste of time.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

But that isn't enough to make for a good movie.It would have been nice if there had been a solid and understandable story. It may be my too simple brain, but I didn't grasp anything of the premise (the whole Lang-family being sucked into a sub-atomic ""quantum""-universe by some device that teen-daughter Cassie had concocted), or of the subsequent goings-on (thousands of creatures living in the sub-atomic world, as well as a complete city - I mean, doesn't the material that all those people and things were made of consists of atoms too? Atoms within atoms?!?). Of course everyone tried his best to make things believable by all kinds of quasi scientific (meant-to-be) explanations, but I didn't hear a thing that even made slightly sense!As said, visually it's all breathtaking, and the acting is over-all fine enough. But I missed the humor of the first movies, and Ant-Man Scott himself seemed only a supporting character among his all-heroic family-members. The whole family thing got a bit on my nerves anyway, at several times the pace of the movie stopped dead for yet another father-daughter-mother-grandparents sob-moment, making it look like a sub-atomic version of the family Robinson.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Also Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd did decently with their characters, given the circumstances.TLDR: A slightly more updated version of ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl""","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Though I feel like this certainly didn't excite me enough about what's to come in phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Marvel has always been quite corny with its humour and I feel like this film doesn't do well in separating the serious moments with the humour side of it which makes it difficult to explain and establish for me how much of a threat the villain in this film and the rest of the MCU is.I felt like narratively, the film didn't flow well. At the end I would consider how they got out of their issue to be lazy story writing. The ending was starting to look brutal and refreshing that it was different to other marvel films, but rather than make the film any longer they cut off what I thought was going to be a really interesting end, to make it the same as any other superhero film.Onto the positives? Johnathan killed it with playing Kang. Paul Rudd like always gave us a good performance but they seemed to have thrown Michael Douglas to the side a little bit in the film. He wasn't involved too much.Interesting scenes and special effects which looked fantastic.Not a bad film but certainly with a film that flowed better and didn't use the slapstick humour over the narrative it would have been better than a 6/10. But it was too similar to Thor love and Thunder and we all know how that went down...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have always been a marvel sceptic, that I have never hidden. I have always thought some MCU movies could at time be nothing more than mindless action and that´s fine, that just doesn't get high ratings from me. I have my bottom MCU films like everyone else, but this, this is the new low. This is one of the most soulless movies I have ever watched and while it didn't infuriate me as other of my lowest ranked movies did, this one just left me without a single feeling in my body. This phase of the MCU has been disappointing on so many levels and delivered the one bad to mediocre movie after another, but I have now seen the low point where the light doesn't shine, where pure numbness exist and Marvel finally became nothing more than colors and sounds from your TV and nothing more.Scott Lang, now not really doing anything with his life is confronted by his daughter who has made a device that can enter the quantum realm again. Janet tries to stop them from activating the device, but the entire Van Dyne family is dragged into the Quantum realm. They most now find a way while avoiding the evil overlord of the quantum realm, Kang.What really sets me off about this movie is the lack of care, lack of good storytelling but mostly lack of a soul. This is a movie that feel fully AI generated where anyone could have written it and it uses so many basic tropes, clichés and basic story devices it´s painfully obvious you are just watching a movie. I was never sucked in, never cared for anything or anyone and I was just watching colorful screens and hearing noises instead of watching a movie. There was nothing here for me to get me engaged and when I pretend care more for a character with a lamp for a head than any of our mains and villains, that's a bad thing. At least other Marvel movies were just poorly written or infuriatingly written where you get some emotions, here, nothing.The characters aren't really characters here. They are vessels for the storytelling and nothing more. They don't do anything, barely have arcs, and barely represent humans. They act and feel like written robots just moving from A to B and dose whatever the movie wants them to do. Once again, the soullessness shows itself. Antman feels barely like himself. His family are just there, and the title character Wasp are barely in the movie. The balancing of the 5 different main characters isn't there and we never get to connect with any of them. The new characters are also just here and when the villain MODOK has more of a character arc than any of our main characters that's a problem.You have heard about it but it really is that bad. The effects are so terrible in this movie. We are given an entirely new world to explore, but none of it has any impact because it´s just like brown and because they do the green screen trick, out of focus. I want to see what´s going on in the background, I want to see the quantum realm. But I´m given nothing but blur. The problem with that is I can only see this movie as characters standing up against a wall trying to act. The visual medium that movies are, are not utilized at all here, it´s just person one, talking to themselves against a brown wall of blur. It´s embarrassing to watch. MODOK looks like absolute garbage with nothing more than a stretchtool used and in general everything just looks so underwhelming.The quantum realm doesn't really fell like it makes any scenes at all. It actually feels like an asset flip with random characters and creatures just being here because why not. I don't understand the world and never felt in awe over how it worked because it´s just a normal town with random characters thrown into it.This movie is split into two separate storylines that are kind of just mushed together in the end because that's what´s supposed to happen. The lack of character and the terrible dialogue leaves none of the two stories interesting and compelling.I have to talk about this terrible script. It is clearly someone's first and you might think that you should cut it some slag then. Well to me, that's no excuse when your 30 something movies in to a franchise, this is where you get the big guns. The plot is clearly an executives clip notes as to what is spoused to happen in the movie and the rest is plastered together with mushy tropes, clichés and writing 101. The dialogue is not how real people talk, it´s whatever is need to be said to move the movie forward and give foreshadowing. The characters have to act like absolute morons in order to make the movie work. Why has Janet not told anyone about Kang before? Why isn't she informing her family at all? It´s infuriating that the characters don't act like humans and are forced to act badly in order to make the movie have surprises. None of the actors can really pull of the stilted robotic dialogue and the acting in general is not good here. I think Jonathan Majors dose the best job here, until the end credit scene rolled around.The humor doesn't really land for the most part for me. Every kind of humor is thrown at the wall so eventually something will land. Random equals funny, dragged out things, word play so on so forth.But this was an introduction to a big bad and to be honest, I´m not afraid. Ant man can win against him, his not a thread. His motivation is also so vague it hurts and I hope we get more of a motivation from him later. This was just a movie to tell you ""hey, this guy is a thing"" and that's all it does. The movie really has nothing going for it and the character arcs are not important and barely done at all. Everything is package in such a cookie cutter way that it hurts to watch.I know I have rambled a lot and it sounds like I have a lot of emotions, but the funny part is, I don't. I feel nothing for this movie and it´s one of the movies where I just felt like I just wasted X amount of time of my life. I wasn't moved or was asked to feel any emotions what so ever and once again it was nothing more than colors and noises from my TV.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

This film is an action/adventure/comedy that entertains the viewer while also expressing emotions for them to feel and comprehend. The plot follows Ant-Man, his family, and his workers as they become trapped in Quantumania and attempt to escape, only to run into Kang The Conquer. This film provided a massive opportunity for the characters to redeem themselves as they are today, but it failed to do so. The film was predictable and unimpressive. It was building to a peak, leading to another disappointing, predictable ending. Although there were some positive aspects, such as the VFX and editing, it was not a perfect film. In Quantum Realm, the setting is both unsettling and exciting. Paul Rudd does an excellent job as Ant-Man. He expresses his love for Cassie as he is compelled to complete a mission to restore time to spend more time with her but is misled by deception. His performance adds a lot to the film and elevates it. If you are a Marvel fan, you should see this film since it continues the storyline that began with Kang The Conquer. There are two end credits; both are important, so take advantage of them.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The CGI is horrific, sometimes comparable to the spy kids movies from the 2000s. MODOK was not only a half-hearted attempt at using a previous villain for a redemption arc (which is kinda just used as a joke in the end) but it will also give me nightmares for the next decade of my life. However, I think the message about that how we should not become complacent even after a major issue is resolved was actually well done, And the relationship between Scott and Cassie is heartwarming as always. Easily one of the best parts of this movie is Kang. Whoever this actor is needs to be in more movies. He can flawlessly go from being a timid and eccentric professor in Loki, To a malevolent and planning villain in this movie, with both parts being fantastic.

His words and the way he can just command a room was scary and also fun to watch. Ant-Man and the Wasp both did their thing in this film. I felt like the CGI could have a been a little better but it did not fail my expectations. Marvel did their thing in this one, but also could've done better. We see a new dynasty beginning to form at the end of this film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was so bad it was laughable and that wasn't the feeble attempts at comedy. The acting was wooden especially the unconvincing baddie. The story was the usual American teen flick style in a Marvel setting. It was a bad mix of Star wars Honey I shrunk the kids. A floating head that reminded me of Holly from Red Dwarf and Spaceballs.We stayed for the end credits, stupidly, and saw the first one. We wish we didn't as it looks like it's setting up a franchise for Kang the Conqueror films. Help. We couldn't take another end credit scene and left.Come on Marvel with all your money in the bank pay for some decent script writers, some actors with credibility and create a decent film. Or are we going to get a reboot of Horward the duck.","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

Nearly the entire thing was done with digital backgrounds and effects, and some looked pretty rushed and not ""convincing"" (at least for the ability of digital technology). The story line was fair, and seeing Bill Murray is always cool (though very short). Evangeline Lilly is an actress I enjoy seeing and think she's great, so that certainly helped the movie. But it just lacked the ""pizazz"" of the typical well-done Marvel action/adventure. I love to promote seeing movies AT the theaters because they should be a special experience, but the effects and digital animation may be more convincing on a big TV. It's another Marvel movie, so remember to stay until the very very end so you can see the extra stuff (one during credits and one after).On a 1-10 scale, I'd give it a 5.6. Remember that my scale is tough (unlike others who seem to think a mediocre movie is a 7, and an okay movie is an 8). Above a 5 is something I consider worth seeing (you won't wish for the two hours of your life back), and 4.9 and under is a ""regret"". So I'd give this a 5.6.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Among the actors when he came in he felt serious and he set the tone but be he felt very powerless for the likes of ""The Conquerer"".Overall, while ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" may have some entertaining moments, it falls short.

The antagonist of the movie had a very brief impact on the whole movie, given that he was supposed to be one of the strongest. Jonathan's role as Kang was the positive takeaway, with an expectation of appearing in future films as well.Although it felt very generic with nothing new to offer, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun MCU entry that gives a hope of jumping into a new saga with something interesting to offer.My Rating : 6/10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Also entering the fray is Majors' right hand man, the diminutive, floating MODOK (Corey Stoll returning from the first Antman film) & a rebel movement out to usurp Majors' rein once & for all. All of this busyness is fine & all but making this the entry to fully reveal Majors' plans which at this point w/the theory behind the multiverses still a bit murky when putting MODOK front & center as the villain w/Majors as the puppet master secretly running things from afar would've made more sense for the usual breezy tone the Antman films have engendered but by putting the weight on his decidedly light shoulders feels too much & not enough at the same time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Creators of this film tried really hard to invent something out-of-this-world as Quantum realm supposed to be. But probably the task was impossible to accomplish from the beginning.Even though computers (maybe even AI) generated unlimited variety of visual effects, the plot holes are huge and the scenes are as standard as they get. Fight scenes, the bar scene, a weird alien, a super-mighty villain who suddenly loses his power (because otherwise he would be impossible to beat), a brave worrior fighting for freedom of her people, etc. - we saw this many times already starting from the first Star Wars.Plot is very inconsistent.

And instead, despite its obvious flaws, it turned out to be a truly enjoyable and entertaining movie, pleasant to follow and never boring.But let's go in order, as I said there are some flaws: I didn't perceive Jonathan Majors' Kang as a great threat, as the film instead would like to pass off. Which isn't a good thing, considering he'll be the main villain of Phase 5. The CGI, while not deeming it as awful as many have described it, is up and down, has truly impressive moments and ""meh"" moments. Modok is perhaps the only element with truly terrible CGI. In addition, I found some of the dialogues quite senseless, and sometimes almost ridiculous.But apart from all these evident flaws, I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and in my opinion it totally achieved its goal. The main purpose of a cinecomic is to entertain the viewer, and as a viewer I felt entertained throughout. So I don't feel like complaining so much.

The one by screencrush was the best one I found. This is unfortunately a pivotal movie in the mcu, so despite everything I'm going to say you still have to watch this.The one thing I loved and think they did splendidly was the story. I think it was great and the most redeeming thing about the movie, there weren't any mind blowing twists but it kept me interested throughout, didn't feel like lazy writing.Kang delivered, character wise, but I feel like apart from the visions from the future he was underwhelming. He's supposedly a multiversal threat, killed so many avengers in different timelines, the big bad conqueror... and he's outdone by antman?(and not through wits, that'd been more believable). It took time to actually see his power because when the fighting starts he seems to be cautious and sorta aghast he's going to lose. Maybe I don't rate antman highly enough, but I feel like Kang should've easily whooped his butt and maybe even killed the entire 'ant squad'.However out of all the characters, Kang's the one that carried the whole movie; Jonathan Majors did his character justice but unfortunately the writers did not. Majors delivered on top his performance in Loki which had made excited to see him again.Dialogue wasn't great, it was pretty dull and the acting was subpar, like they were shooting a Disney channel kids show at times like Cassie's continuously smiling throughout for instance. It didn't try to push for humor as much as other marvel products but the few jokes it had didn't land.Could've paced just a little quicker to make everything feel more urgent and imminent. It was inconsistent, at times I liked it, at times I was trying not to zone out.Story was amazing but the movie was missing that wow factor to make it feel special. I think Kang was arguably it but felt like he only lost so that the Kang variants come through. For the sake of keeping the story going. Also the other Kang variants were all African, thought that was funny.Modok felt like he was written to be the butt of the joke for the movie, felt very underutilized, he was sorta hyped up as this killing machine but didn't deliver. Isn't he supposed to be to Kang what steppenwolf is to darkseid. Plus he looked so silly, I mean it's hard not to make a floating head with tiny arms look silly, but they probably could've made him a lot more ghoulish to offset that.The chemistry between the characters wasn't there, as I said at the beginning, so much has happened before this movie in the mcu, so in that time antman has lost over 10yrs of seeing his daughter growing up already, before the movie even starts. The bond between all the characters wasn't there for any of the characters and it wasn't allowed to develop.Quantum realm itself was what disappointed me the most, I knew I was expecting too much so I lowered my expectations but still somehow got disappointed. I recently watched ""Strange World"" and this was very reminiscent of that, a children's animation.It's not intolerable watch though it's just incredibly underwhelming for what it could've been. You still have to watch it as it's important for the multiverse going forward; but you could just wait until it's released for streaming instead of going to the cinemas if you're contemplating.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jonathan Majors is incredible as Kang, who, although he doesn't have all the leading role expected of him, fulfills his character very well and I hope to see him in action in the future. Kathryn Newton is a good change from the Cassie actress who has a good performance and a lot of lead alongside Jannet who plays a very important role in the film: Paul Rudd executes his character well in which he realizes that he does not spend much time with his daughter, and is forced to work with Kang to have a way out of the quantum realm. There are characters that do not have as much prominence as expected and that in themselves do not contribute much to the plot and some only serve as a fun element. There are also characters that I didn't like the way they were treated, like Modok, who looks horrible compared to the one in the comics, he's a very good character that Marvel didn't know how to deal with.It's not an Avengers Infinity War level movie, but it's fine to pass the time and start the new saga apart from a questionable CGI in some scenes in which the green screen is more than obvious, and an ending that didn't quite convince me for several reasons.In short, I give it a 6/10, it's a movie that meets, but I expected more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The laundry list of problems this movie presents is too long for this review but I will try to name a few. Scott Lang is a bumbling idiot who is superseded by his snarky, social justice, entitled daughter who is perfect in every way. The punchlines feel like they were written by 5 year olds, and Modok is the movies punching bag- jester that is never taken seriously and the CGI is awful. Kang is the only saving grace for this film and Marvel manages to mess that up as well. Unfortunately they de-power Kang towards the end completely taking away the threat level that he present earlier in the film. There are zero consequences in this movie and it wraps up like a perfect little Disney cartoon. Looks like End Game really was the end game.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The performances by the actors are strong, and there are some moments of humor that are genuinely funny.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania falls short of its potential, but it is still an enjoyable watch for Marvel fans. It's worth seeing for the introduction of new elements to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it doesn't quite live up to the high expectations set by previous Marvel movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) emulates her father's criminal activities, but also investigates the Quantum Realm. When she accidentally opens a portal, she is sucked into the Quantum Realm along with her father, his girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and her grandparents Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas).To get back home, they follow Janet's advice, after being trapped here for years. In the Quantum Realm, they encounter many different creatures, some of which are hostile. Scott meets the mysterious Kang (Jonathan Majors), who promises to help him get back home, but whether he can trust Kang remains the question.With this film, the Marvel series begins their fifth phase. Unfortunately, this leaves little room to create your own story. This film almost largely only serves as preparations for future films in the Marvel series. Many things and new characters seem to be of little importance. The story of this film can therefore seem a bit messy and is sometimes difficult to follow.It is a special task for Peyton Reed, because he can start the first film of the fifth phase. Furthermore, he will have the chance to introduce important things for this stage in the Marvel series. For this film they also made more use of LED technology. This technique is increasingly used in the film world to replace green or blue screen technologies and provide more realistic backgrounds in the front of the film. This new filmmaking technique became popular with its use in the Star Wars TV series The Mandalorian. Peyton Reed has directed two episodes of this show.He takes these techniques, atmosphere and images to his third Ant-Man film, so that the film sometimes comes across as a cheaper Star Wars film. These effects work even better on the small screen of TVs than on the big screen of cinemas. This may also be due to the qualities and talents of the director. In this film, during some scenes you can see that the background is fake. This can also be seen with some CGI characters. For the character MODOK she tried to combine CGI and motion capture, but ended up with a separate and unbelievable character. This character is so hard to take seriously and is reminiscent of older movies from the 90's where she first introduced CGI to the movie world.The acting is done well by most of the film cast, but due to the amount of different characters and the messy story, everyone doesn't get the same amount of time to make something special out of their roles. Paul Rudd knows how to provide suitable comedy moments. Fortunately, the comedy is not too strong either. Michelle Pfeiffer gets more opportunities to come forward in this Marvel film. She even has some action moments, which are reminiscent of her from Catwoman. Michael Douglas gets a little less playing time, but does have some sarcastic comedy. Besides the fact that Evangeline Lilly can finally wear a superhero costume, she unfortunately doesn't get much else to do.Kathryn Newton replaces Emma Fuhrmann in the role of Cassie Lang. Although Emma has only played the role for a short time, seeing a new face to the character can take some getting used to. Kathryn Newton fortunately plays the role well in her own and energetic way. Jonathan Majors is also returning to the Marvel series, only now playing a variant of Kang, a similar character he previously played in the Marvel TV series Loki. Here he gets the chance to portray his character in other ways that also respond more to Marvel's future film plans.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's ambivalent because it can be what a lot of people look for in a movie, but it can also be the cause of what they call ""creative fatigue"" after dozens of films under the same formula, for a genre that rarely shows anything new, just changes settings and characters.Which side am I on? Well, Quantumania entertained me, because of its action, science fiction and adventure. The villain is a good antagonist, who has a decent development compared to previous villains, has great powers, but I admit that he was defeated perhaps very easily. Are there flaws? Of course! M. O. D. O. K falls into the category of wasted villains like Task Master and the humor is pretty ineffective. Although I don't hate this type of content, I don't think it's the great wonder either. It's your average superhero movie, which you'll like more or less depending on your mood.Now, let's face the fact that this is MARVEL-level cinema. It's not a high standard, never has been. We just have another product of the great machinery headed by Feige. The purpose has always been to entertain mostly teens and young adults. If we see Quantumania through that prism, it seems to me that the film fulfills its mission. It's a warm bath in the waters of CGI, which even tries to reach older generations by incorporating clear references to legendary sagas like Star Wars, but in a much more psychedelic way like the recent Strange World or as someone said out there, in the style of Moebius, although perhaps we are exaggerating a bit with this last statement. Now, if we're going from this movie alone to say that Marvel is fatigued, I don't believe it. Let's leave that excuse to She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel.This is just the same old burger pulled from the same food chain started in 2008 with Iron Man.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I found myself laughing seconds after the MARVEL title rolled. Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang never feels like an act, as he naturally fits the role. His character is charming as ever in his 5th movie as Ant-Man.Marvel is known for extensive world-building and interconnected stories. Since 2021's ""Loki"", it has been known that Kang the Conqueror is the next Thanos-level villain in the MCU. This film gives us a deeper look at Kang, and the casting for his character (Jonathan Majors) is excellent.By leaving the regular world and diving into the world beneath (the Quantum Realm), the film relies heavily on green screens and computer-generated imagery (CGI). These graphics and effects are some of the poorest of the franchise, with a character called MODOK being the worst. There were times that the film was reminiscent of 2005's ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"".Other than the CGI, the biggest weakness in this film is the screenplay. From rushed plot points to painful dialogue, it is evident that the screenwriter had never written something of this magnitude. In the emotional and climactic moments, the script is so bad that it distracts from the story, with the audience in my theater audibly laughing.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a small piece in the larger Marvel storyline. This is felt throughout the film, as the convoluted Quantum Realm and endless timelines are explored. The first two Ant-Man movies succeeded in simplicity, but this sequel was anything but simple. In short, the character of Scott Lang is better as the friendly, neighborhood Ant-Man.Best Character: Kang
Best Scene: Scott's Book Reading

The movie has a very simple plot, with CGI that in 60% of the scenes is good (not great and especially often sucks), the music is not memorable in fact it seems flat without an identity. The real problem with this movie are the protagonists and the characters in general not deepened enough and especially that damn M. O. D. O. K. I hope never to see him again. The film starts way too fast, after not even 20 minutes they are already in the quantum realm and it's all extremely too fast. The absolute merit of this film is the big, menacing Kang the Conqueror, there is little to do with that, I already imagined him against all the Avengers and I must say that as a Villain I like him too much. Too bad for the little depth of the characters who inhabit the Quantum Realm because in my opinion it would have been interesting to at least delve into a few more details. It is not a beautiful movie but to take your mind off it and keep yourself let's say carefree it is great.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is no character development here either; Every character ends the movie with the same motivations and morality that they started with.

But Jonathan Majors was great as a villain and the battles actually got pretty intense. I also see everyone talking about how bad the effects were, like did we watch the same movie?

Its still one of the weakest movies of the MCU but after, Love and Thunder, Ms Marvel and She Hulk, its not as bad as those, there ae quite a few things to like. Mainly, the villain, Kang. He absolutely steals the show and every scene he is in, you can feel he is an Avengers level threat and the actor gives his all to make it even better. Scott and some action scenes are also on te good side of the movie, they managed to be entertaining at all time and while these are just few moments, they are enough to save this film a little bit. Buuuuuut, there is also a lot of bad stuff. The quantum world is just boring. Thats just how it is. There is nothing interesting about it, we never know anything about the people living there, we never feel anything for this world, honestly, if it was destroyed or something, I wouldnt even miss it. The side characters are horrible, they do nothing, the Wasp is done so dirty in the movie, that there are times when you forget she even exists, its just at the end when she does something and its not that much. Hank and Janet are also there just to explain scientific things and look smart but besides that, they could very well be dead. And I hated the quantum people, their designs are mostly bad and their jokes are very cringy. The more I think about them, the more I want the quantum realm to be destroyed. Cassie is just there, acting bad, existing and doing absolutely nothing else. The story is just meh, Ant man stealing some stuff for Kang and the side characters trying to find him. Its just ok, but I would have prefered a story more like the first 2 movies, those felt more like ant man movies and had their own style and comedy, things which are mostly ruined in this one. I hope Marvel recovers and goes back into the light path because if they dont and they continue like this, theyre gonna have bad times ahead.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It even masks their own advantages. It didn't have a good start in the phase five. Everything about this movie sucks. Because in She-Hulk, they told you that the scripts are written by AI. They knew that even if the movie is bad, some people would still buy tickets. Kang the Conqueror, his existence exposed a big problem with Marvel, that is, the portrayal of villains is becoming more and more stereotyped. Marvel has created a lot of fascinating villains, like Loki, Winter Soldier, Zemo and Thanos. But now, which Marvel movie has an impressive villain? Kang is so badly shaped that it is not even as good as some of the villains in the phase four. What is the motivation of him? If only to conquer, it would be too banal. I have always doubted his fighting strength. Kang said he had killed the Avengers, but in the end his empire was trampled by the Ant Man and he was besieged by a group of ants. Kang has technologies unmatched by mankind for centuries, but he could not invent the Pym particle. I want to tell Marvel, if you want to create a group of oppressive villains, then show that each of them is powerful. The existence of thousands of such powerful people can truly reflect a sense of crisis. Instead of waiting for the real powerful ones to show up in the end, I don't think fans have enough patience for this. Portray Kang in the way you used to portray Thanos. Because I always believe that in a good superhero movie, the villain is no less portrayed than the protagonist.And this film, like Doctor Strange 2, was only created to introduce the multiverse. In fact, Ant-Man is not suitable for dealing with villains like Kang, he should pick on someone his own size. The most attractive thing about Ant-Man movies is to show the world from a micro perspective. Showing fans ideas and jokes by making objects bigger or smaller. The quantum world is just another macro world for them. Its description draws lessons from Star Wars, which is no problem, but there must be innovation. The grotesque residents here seem interesting, isn't it to cover up the nature of the exhaustion of creativity? Even Rick and Morty's writer was recruited to write a screenplay, he would not be able to write a good story. Because the beginning, middle and end of Marvel movies are set in advance, this makes it impossible for writers to exert their talents.Cassie Lang, ayoung girl who can casually build a machine leading to the quantum world and doesn't worry about the danger. Does that mean she's as smart as Iron Man or Hank Pym? If she doesn't, I hope Marvel stop writing these exaggerated plots. And Newton's acting sucks.I don't understand why Janet Van Dyne refused to tell her experience. If she did, none of this would happen. And Hope Van Dyne, she didn't play any part in the story.As a villain, M. O. D. O. K was persuaded by Cassie Lang so easily. JESUS CHRIST!!! WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS? AM I WATCHING A DC MOVIE?There are already so many superhero movies, and people are very familiar with the routines of the story. If Marvel wants to survive, they must innovate themselves. Otherwise, the only way to MCU is to die.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie tries so hard to be funny, action-packed, and exciting, but it falls short in every aspect.First of all, the plot is all over the place. It's like the writers had a bunch of different ideas for the story, and they just threw them all together. It's like they were playing a game of Mad Libs, and the plot was the result. It's hard to keep up with what's going on, and you just end up feeling confused.The characters are just as confusing. There are too many of them, and they all seem to be vying for screen time. It's like a big game of ""who's the most important character."" I mean, sure, we love Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, but do we really need to see so much of him? And don't even get me started on the villains. They're like cartoon characters, and not in a good way.The action scenes are just as confusing. There's so much going on, and it's hard to tell what's happening. The special effects are cool, but they're overused. It's like the filmmakers were trying to distract us from the mess of a movie they created.In conclusion, Ant-Man Quantum Mania is a movie that tries too hard and fails miserably. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but for the rest of us, it's a waste of time.

The only thing quantum about this movie was the microscopic amount of entertainment value it provided.I mean, the comedy was as lackluster as an ant trying to lift a crumb. And the music? It was so forgettable that I think I forgot it before the opening credits ended. Did they ask an ant to compose the soundtrack?And let's not forget about the trailer promising action-packed thrills, only for the movie to be as exciting as watching an ant farm. The only thing that grew in this movie was my disappointment in not getting the serious, action-packed film that drew me into the Marvel universe.The second half tries to pick up the pace, but it's too little too late. The villain was as flat as an ant pancake, and the special effects couldn't even impress an ant colony.Overall, Antman Quantumania had its moments, but they were as few and far between as an ant in a football stadium.

While the film delivers on the expected humor and lightheartedness that made the first installment enjoyable, it struggles to find a balance between its comedic tone and the weightier elements introduced in the story.Paul Rudd once again charms as Scott Lang, bringing his trademark wit and charisma to the role. His chemistry with Evangeline Lilly, who portrays Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp, is a highlight, and their banter and teamwork provide some of the film's most enjoyable moments. The addition of new characters, such as Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, brings a refreshing dynamic to the narrative and promises exciting future developments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The action sequences in ""Quantomania"" are visually captivating and creatively executed, showcasing the innovative use of size manipulation that defines the Ant-Man franchise. From giant ants to microscopic adventures, the film offers plenty of fun and inventive set pieces that will leave fans entertained. Director Peyton Reed manages to maintain a light and playful atmosphere throughout, reminiscent of a heist film infused with superhero elements.However, the film's main drawback lies in its uneven pacing and disjointed storytelling. At times, the plot feels overstuffed with multiple subplots and character arcs vying for attention. This results in certain storylines being underdeveloped and characters receiving limited screen time, leaving the audience wanting more depth and exploration. Additionally, the film occasionally loses focus and struggles to find a cohesive narrative thread, making it feel like a collection of individual scenes rather than a seamless whole.Furthermore, while the humor is a trademark of the Ant-Man films, ""Quantomania"" leans heavily on comedic moments, sometimes at the expense of emotional resonance. The lighthearted tone undermines the weightier themes introduced, diluting their impact and leaving some moments feeling tonally inconsistent. The film could have benefited from a stronger balance between humor and the deeper emotional beats.On a positive note, the film's visual effects and production design are impressive, capturing the intricate details of the micro and macro worlds with precision. The attention to detail in creating the unique environments and the seamless integration of the CGI elements elevate the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantomania"" is a mixed bag. While it delivers the expected humor, entertaining action sequences, and charismatic performances, it falls short in terms of pacing, narrative cohesion, and emotional depth. Marvel fans will likely find enjoyment in revisiting the lovable world of Ant-Man, but those seeking a more well-rounded and impactful superhero experience may be left wanting.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was so glad the movie finally over. What's wrong with you Marvel?","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I've seen most of them, they are usually very entertaining and quite a lot of fun. But the last year have been a little hard on the two companies.What is wrong? Have the films outstayed their welcome? Is it the end of an era? Well, I don't hope so. This new Marvel film is not at all bad, it has a fantastivc cast. I think that the often use of Multiverses could be a problem. It's very much a part of this film too. It is for sure giving the writers a lot of opportunities, chances to expand the universes. But is that positive, not really, it gets a bit too much. But luckily still entertaining and fun.Ant-Man or Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is a bit bored, not a lot to do as a superhero. He has written a book about his life as a crimefighting man capable of changing his size. The same capability as his wife Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and as it shows also his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) posess.Together with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) we witness how they all end up in another world because of a breakdown in an experiment conducted by Cassie.They end up in a place, that most of all could be taken out of a Star Wars film. Cassies have made this universe inhabited by a special animal, namely ants. These ants, we find out, are our heroes only allies in the fight that follows.It should be mentioned that a Lord that Janet knew and thought could be a help, also turns out to be a little selfish. It's the great Lord Krylar (played by the ever wonderful Bill Murray). How and if the battle is won by Ant-Man and his little (or perhaps big?) group of friends you'll have to see for yourself.As usual the film is filled with fine actors, but
the surprise is really Kathryn Newton, she certainly helps the film not to flop. And the good news are that she'll be staring in at least two coming Marvel films.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""Quantumania"" is fun and places the heroes to explore a new world full of possibilities, but the generic and not ambitious visuals and action sequences frustrate the audience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9552090/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","9 January 2024","Mixing a premise as absurd as it is silly in an envelope of childish fun among conceptual strangeness, ""Quantumania"" presents a narrative of comical misadventures and universal dramas about family and friendship. The film also creates good connections between the characters, especially in Scott's relationship with Cassie, and in the way Janet's secrets impact her relationship with Hope and Hank. But speaking of Hope, Wasp is unfortunately the film's weak link, and doesn't even justify her name in the title. Unfortunately, the script doesn't leave any space for the character, who seems like a mere supporting character with half a dozen lines in a film in which she was supposed to co-star. This probably happens for two reasons: the first is because the film needs to develop Cassie Lang, as Marvel supposedly has plans for her; and the second is because the nucleus to which she is inserted throughout the film, which is that of Hank and Janet, needs to give much more prominence to Mrs Pym, after all she is the viewer's link with Kang. Added to this, we have the entire presentation of the Quantum Realm and its inhabitants, which reduces the screen time of several of the characters, especially to maintain the entire focus of the protagonist on Ant-Man.Hope (Evangeline) is not unimportant, on the contrary, but performs the same function as Michael Douglas' character. Both are constant allies who gain a specific moment in which they become vital to the success of the good guys' plans. Paul Rudd, on the other hand, remains very comfortable as the Avenger who takes himself least seriously and, perhaps, the one in which bravery sounds closest to us. Scott is not the embodiment of an Apollonian superhero ideal; he is far from being a modern incarnation of Greco-Roman deities. He is a guy whose exceptionality remains camouflaged by his attitude close to conventional. In fact, the cast is the great value of the film that inaugurates the vaunted phase five of the Marvel Universe. And in the new stage we have not only the concept of the Multiverse, but the richness of the Quantum Realm. And just one additional comment about Cassie: Marvel will have to work on the character, who proves to be unbearable, appearing on screen as an idealistic young rebel in the name of the ""injustices"" she witnesses, even if she breaks the law to do so and, most importantly, due to the fact that she is another one of those boring and uncharismatic characters who is super intelligent and a prodigy, capable of creating in the basement of her house (and in secret) a super technological telescope capable of capturing the signal from the Quantum Realm. It's hard to digest and swallow this convenient genius.Following the line of the recent sequels to ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" and ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", Jeff Loveness' script also addresses the effects after Thanos, and whether there is anything that can be extracted instantly and disguised by the childish humor with which the plot unfolds, Quantumania is a film about time, revenge and reparation, but this is far from any real weight that the text manages to achieve. This is largely because the drama is tied to a development that is not exciting for the characters, especially for Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who gains more prominence as a bridge to Kang (Jonathan Majors) and Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter. And what is most impressive here is how much Peyton Reed believes he is directing a more mature and objective film for the beginning of a new era for the MCU, since it is just another false tip of what the studio has been doing: ""the more subtle humor and more drama"", in addition to several repetitions of other films as a world composition.Even if it is not affected by major holes, Loveness' script has some problems balancing the huge range of characters and events that it sets out to follow. Focused on the relationship between Scott (Rudd) and Cassie (Newton) and the threat that Kang (Jonathan Majors) represents to the multiverse, the script throws some of its characters to the side, making the Wasp played by Evangeline Lilly become little more than a cameo in his own film. Even M. O. D. O. K., a secondary antagonist whose debut in the MCU has been highly anticipated by fans, is reduced to mere comic relief minutes after his first appearance. Reed and Loveness' failure in Hope's participation is compensated, however, in Kang's construction. Played in a menacing way by Majors, the MCU's new villain arrives leaving his mark, being the film's highlight. Not only are his background and motivations well structured, but Jonathan Majors delivers an incredible performance as the villain. His Kang, more methodical and obsessed than actually cruel, oscillates from moments of control of the situation to the most complete despair and pure anger in a fraction of seconds, and the actor has complete command of every nuance of the character. Even though he's not a two-meter-tall purple alien, he imposes fear. A primordial fear. Human. The final confrontation between the antagonist and the heroes, in fact, is one of the most impactful since the Mad Titan snapped his fingers in ""Avengers: Infinity War"".Returning to talking about world building, it becomes terribly comical when we enter the Quantum Realm and realize that there are visual and narrative nods that refer to ""Arthur and the Minimoys"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", ""Avatar "" and ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"", but there is nothing that points to an effort by the studio to be creative, or in fact, that it is seeking to have more identity. The setting to which the quintet moves is a sumptuous collection of specimens and forms that denotes creativity. Even though the film has an excess of digital layers (there are few organic textures in the scene), the artificiality does not bother or compromise. But the idea when drawing from other fantasy and science fiction films is to create the illusion that new elements are being worked on in the MCU, however, it all boils down to laziness and convenience of making a visually and narratively calculated feature, driven to the exhaustion of its formula. Therefore, there is no excitement left for a film that also deals with the field of possibilities and mirrors parts of other films instead of creating, at least, its own characteristic.Are the jokes surrounding the bizarre MODOK (Corey Stoll) a little tiresome? They are. Does the action never get as exciting as in other Marvel books? Yes, it is true. All scenes seem pasteurized and without a trace of originality, which reduces much of the production's impact. That feeling of an entire film filmed on green screen increasingly tires the viewer and leaves productions without identity. Furthermore, the film has a subtext that antagonizes centralizing fascists and community socialists. Cassie demonstrates from the beginning a social conscience linked to everyday problems - while she worries about the homeless, Scott is very attached to the extraordinary narrative of saving the world. Well then. Faced with the antagonist with genocidal intentions, filmed at one point as if he were Hitler organizing Nazi troops (definitely, this shot is similar to the records of great dictators in History), the one who calls for rebellion is precisely the girl concerned about the world at its lowest. Details. There is even a mention of the benefits of socialism spoken loudly by Dr. Hank Pym. A totally cliché message that nods to the more progressive side of Marvel, increasingly present in its productions, especially after phase 4.So far, nothing new for the most attentive viewers.""Quantumania"" builds the villain and the empire (pardon the pun) around him as the great threat that could finally take Ant-Man and the Wasp out of the ""cafe au lait"" category. The problem is that not even a mission that involves the death of entire universes is enough for production to leave its comfort zone. The obstacles presented to the heroes are accompanied by almost instantaneous solutions, as if afraid to challenge the audience. A fear that makes no sense, considering that this is the third Ant-Man film - and the 31st in the MCU. At this point, audiences know what to expect from a Marvel film, and lowering the stakes isn't exactly the way to respond. If the film falls short in its mission to validate the franchise in its universe, the film succeeds in expanding the heroic family dynamics. The relationship between the characters and the distribution of their screen time keeps the story captivating until the conclusion. With that, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" comes to an end with a mix of sensations. Far from being a catastrophe, the production is fun and places beloved heroes to explore a new world full of possibilities. Even though it wasted the chance to close the trilogy with the grandiose epic that its protagonists so long for, the production is entertaining enough to avoid being ranked among the low points of the MCU.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","It's fun... but not everything works...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8882072/?ref_=tt_urv","parksiet","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73501762/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2023","What happens when you're solely focused on your next big Endgame and try to stuff 6 hours worth of stories into a 2-hour movie? You get a Quantumania. Hours of content being shoved down our throat with absolutely no time to process any of it. But beyond it being overstuffed, all of the charm from the first two movies (specifically the first) has vanished. A lot of Ant-Man's appeal was his operation in a normal sized world, either tiny or large- but when the world he occupies is larger than life itself, the effectiveness of that charm is gone. It has no heart. It is just spectacle for the sake of spectacle.I sound angry. I'm not, I have to say I did like the movie. Quantumania is a fun sci-fi adventure filled with goofy comic book weirdness! It is far from Marvel's best, but I did have a fun time. But there are so many issues... so let me back up a bit and start over...Martin Scorsese's views on comic book movies are no secret; he claims they are more like theme park rides than true cinema. For years, I have staunchly disagreed with this stance, I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe and found so much to appreciate in their films. But after seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, y'know what?He might be right.It pains me to say this, but Quantumania is not a great film. To be clear, I enjoyed the movie. I'd even give it a thumbs up! But it is a fun movie, not a good one. It is, by all accounts, a theme park ride.And frankly, that disappoints me.I come to Marvel for the characters I love, the heart and emotion in the stories, and yes, for the fun superhero action. Infinity War and Endgame were such huge successes not because of how fun they were but because of how they captured people's imaginations and emotions. People felt tied to the characters and couldn't wait to see them all come together. I for one, was so emotionally invested in those films, and all of Marvel at the time.Why do I bring that up? Well, because I felt nothing while watching Quantumania. There is no emotional weight to it, nothing compelling me to invest myself in the story. It is all spectacle, and no substance. I felt so empty coming out of it. It felt so forgettable and I never seemed to actually get into the movie. I just couldn't buy into what it was doing. And I am so crushed to say this, because I was looking forward to this movie so much! I really wanted to love it, but alas, it is the first Marvel movie in a while that I have come very close to not liking.I love the first Ant-Man film, and its sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp has even grown on me over the years. This one felt nothing like them. An Ant-Man film it is not, lacking the spirit and everything else that made the franchise what it was. It is completely different, and delves into very odd corners of the MCU. Doing this isn't a bad thing, but I mourned the loss of the charm that the first two films had. I loved the small-scale heist plots. I loved the simple narrative of a dad trying to get more time with his daughter. I loved the unique action set-pieces; battles taking place on a toy Thomas the Tank Engine, or using a Hello Kitty PEZ dispenser as a weapon. I loved Michael Peña's character, Luis, and his awesome storytelling! It had this really heartfelt and likeable element to it, and was different from what we were used to in the rest of the MCU. Yes, the films did serve as a sort of ""palate cleanser"" after the big Avengers films, but that worked for them! I think the decision to make the third Ant-Man film an ""Avengers-level event"" movie was a mistake, because that essentially forced them to get rid of everything that made these films special. (Including Michael Peña which I will never forgive.)And I gotta blame director Peyton Reed here. He bit off more than he could chew. I can understand wanting to do one of the bigger Marvel movies as the Ant-Man ones are on the smaller side of the universe, but forcing the Ant-Man franchise to become one of the major events was a big mistake. It didn't work. Frankly, Peyton Reed was operating in his niche with the first two films, and he's just completely out of his element with this one. You can tell he is trying so hard to make it a big sci-fi spectacle, but comes up short in almost every way. He just got a little too ambitious. Tonally the film is all over the place, the pacing doesn't make sense, action scenes are cut together really oddly and the film overall seems to have no vision. It just sort of exists. Even with the action scenes, there are no memorable moments, and frankly there were barely any real action scenes in the film. I really can't help but wonder what this trilogy would have looked like had it been helmed by Edgar Wright (who was originally supposed to write/direct the first film).And like I said, it doesn't work as an Ant-Man film by any means. Sure, it has the characters, but them being in the story doesn't change anything. The only characters truly used in the film are Janet van Dyne and Kang. The rest were completely wasted. Scott (Ant-Man) doesn't even have a character arc, he is just kind of there, alongside Hope (the Wasp) and his grown-up daughter Cassie. The characters are likeable and I love seeing them on screen, but they really had nothing to do, and it just felt like what happens when characters show up for cameo appearances in other character's films. The problem is this is an Ant-Man film with no real story for Ant-Man. He feels miscast in his own story, heck, it was unnecessary for him to even be there, and the film never truly explained why he could take on Kang. I just never believed any of it. The film lacked verisimilitude, in terms of character, plot and world-building.Jeff Loveness really needed someone else here to help flesh out his script. It feels like a shell of a great movie. Dialogue isn't great, for one, but that's minor. There are lots of moments that work, but they never add up to anything. There is never any weight to what happens either, it felt like things would happen with no setup or reasoning at all, they just would happen because they had to in order to progress the plot. It's a very by-the-numbers plot that barely holds up and steals so much from other films such as Star Wars. But not great Star Wars... the one I would compare it most to is Rise of Skywalker. Why would you take so much from that? The structure of the film is a mess too, with no discernible 3-act structure - the characters end up in the Quantum Realm, stuff happens, and then all the sudden we're at the end. It just felt like there was no buildup, no real reason for this story to be told. Heck, I try to think back on this movie and it's just a jumbled blur of colours and meaningless content. It's so forgettable and lifeless. It's such a missed opportunity for a great Ant-Man story. (And at this point I wouldn't mind giving them the chance to do an Ant-Man 4 *properly*.) Frankly, there were missed opportunities throughout the entire film, and most of the issues stem from the writing. I really hope either Loveness can come up with a significantly better script for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, or that Marvel finds a new writer for it... if we're in for more of this in an Avengers movie... count me out.The worst thing is that I'm here complaining about the movie when there were still so many things I liked about it! I can genuinely see how some audiences are enjoying it more than I did, as many standalone elements I really liked and even loved! The problem is, they just never came together to make me love them all as a final product. I liked many of the creative ideas offered up, I really liked the visuals of the Quantum Realm (even if you could very much tell it was shot on green screen/the volume), I liked seeing all the new and returning characters and cast members (Paul Rudd is fantastic and charming as always (too bad he didn't have more to do here), Michelle Pfeiffer is awesome here, and I really liked Kathryn Newton as a grown up Cassie), and I LOVED Kang.Before I go into anything else let me make one thing very clear: Jonathan Majors is INCREDIBLE as Kang the Conqueror.There are some amazing actors in this movie, including Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, but Jonathan Majors puts them all to shame. He truly carries the movie; the only times I truly found myself invested were when he was on screen. He is operating leagues above everyone else! He is so menacing and truly embodies the threat of Kang. I was completely blown away by his performance, he stole the entire movie and then some! Truthfully, he was so compelling I found myself almost rooting for him! Kang was even a fantastically written character, he worked the best out of any character in the film and I am super interested to see how they handle both Kang and Majors in the future. But my god, Jonathan Majors can truly do no wrong, he is giving an emotionally acrobatic performance that this film and franchise does not deserve. For instance, much like with Gorr in Love and Thunder, we are only told of what Kang is capable of and what he has done but never shown. Film is a visual medium, it would've been nice to see some of the events we hear about occur, but luckily we have such a fantastic performance from Majors that it's hard not to see Kang as a major threat!Which brings me to an interesting thought... why didn't they just make this a Kang the Conqueror movie? Marvel has never done a villain-centered piece before and it could have been pretty interesting - and certainly would have worked a lot better than this. This film pretty much only works as Part 1 of Marvel's Phase 5 anyways, all the Ant-Man stuff could have been saved for something else, something more fitting.I love Marvel, I really do. It's why I'm being so critical of their missteps when they happen, because I don't want to have to write this again. But they need to step up their game.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can say that Ant's triquel was a success, I don't understand why critics scold him so much, now in order what I liked and what I didn't like
1)Scott and Cassie, there is a Father-daughter chemistry between them, they save the world together and that makes me happy.2) Janet and Hank, they are not the most central characters here, but they also play a role in the film, there is such a frame in the film with Hank, he is very funny. Janet, as a narrator, tells half of the film about everything and it pleases that the film has an explanation for almost everything!3) Kang, it's not for nothing that he is a CONQUEROR, Jonathan Majers, he just shines in this film, his voice, his facial expressions, his goal is to conquer something, and destroy something completely! His canonical costume is just fire! They finally managed to make a cool villain who will come back, and I think more than once.4) Modok is a cool guy, he puts himself up as a cool guy with guns up his sleeve, he has a funny face, I won't say anything more.5) Graphics, what about graphics, and there is a lot of it in this film, and I am glad that it is finished and there are no flaws in the graphics
6) Living beings, well, or residents of the Quantum realm, they also stood out very well, everyone has their own costume and they are also so cute and brave!Well, the minuses of this movie!(ALL THE MINUSES THAT ARE WRITTEN HERE, THIS IS PURELY MY OPINION!!!)
1) There are several dialogues in the film, well, they are very stupid, they are just too long and I just want to reduce them to a minimum
2) In my opinion, there was very little Kang, it seems to me that such a powerful villain should be given more time on the screen.3) Hope, what's wrong with her? She just walks the whole movie, and does nothing to promote the plot, she's just like butter on bread.I may not have written everything here, but you can watch this movie at least once! In short, the film at one time is no more.The scenes after the credits just shock you, they are so cool you need to look at them in cinemas, be sure to stay until the end of the session!My rating:

One minute it's a cool sci-fi adventure, then a drama, then sometimes a bad comedy. Jonathan majors (kang) is the saving grace, he is a real presence on screen and demands your attention, he seems to be the only actor who took the role serious but even his acting couldn't save the writing. We are told by everyone how bad kang is through a ton of exposition but we never see him do anything that warrants his reputation. Kang was overthrown and defeated with ease, he did not seem like the guy the writers wanted him to be. I could not see him going head to head with the avengers or even killing them (clearly can't even beat ant man). I hope future renditions of kang live up to the hype because the guy who is a supposed super intelligent villainous warlord was beaten by the joke of the avengers and the wasp, they literally just punched him into his energy core...also the cassie actress was pretty bad, her acting was by far the worst in the MCU. It's enjoyable but it's not good.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The last of the Ant-Man films, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is directed by Peyton Reed. It stars Kathryn Newton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Katy M. O'Brian from Black lightning and The Mandalorian, Bill Murray from Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and Tony McCarthy from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledor, Cruella, Black Widow, and The Batman.-Plot:
After a grownup Cassandra Lang's (Kathryn Newton) invention gets the team (Hank Pym, Hope Pym, Scott Lang, Cassandra Lang and Janet Van Dyne), stuck in the quantum realm. The team finds themselves having to fight strange monsters and a very powerful Kang the Conqueror, (Jonathan Majors) who has been banished from another world for destroying many different universes throughout time. Kang has a multitude of powers that are far superior to any of the creatures living in the quantum realm and soon becomes in control of the realm. Before the team can return home, they must battle Kang and his army.-Visuals:
Maltu Sarmes and Axel Bonani created some innovative visual effects (VFX). The artists and technical team did an incredible job creating all the strange creatures in the quantum realm.-Action:
There is fighting when they go to the quantum realm due to them having to defeat Kang. Even though there is action and unique visuals, there's no substance to the plot except for the team trying to return home.-Conclusion:
If you like inventive visuals and lots of fighting, you might like this film. As for me I had a hard time staying awake during the two hours. My personal favorite Ant-Man film out of the trilogy is the first one. It had humor, action, and a storyline.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nobody went to see Ant-Man for the wasp. Nobody cares about the Wasp.Batman and Robin are a good analogy of how the ""sidekick"" character is supportive and plays out.In Ant Man and ""the wasp"", the wasp gets equal (if not more) actual screen time and significance, while in the process, also neutering Ant Man's appeal, power, unique abilities, and connection to the audience. Paul Rudd is funny, lovable, down to earth as a middle aged dad turned super hero. The Wasp - Evangeline Lilly is flat in her acting, and lacks the depth of a main character, leaving the audience with no care as to her outcome or significance in the greater story.I wont even get into the subliminal messaging presented here, its all too modern Marvel/Disney and failing to even disguise itself. Man Bad. Woman Good. Man Past. Woman Future. That about sums up the messaging here. Why do we even need an Ant Man movie at this point? The Wasp, The Wasp's Mom, and Ant Man's Daughter are clearly of greater value to the MCU.That's also if we can even try to ignore the blatantly obvious, that all writing sacrifices were made in attempt to position Marvel's next ""big bad"", essentially wasting an entire movie to basically give us a few end credits with more significance than that of the plot of the entire film presented here.This felt like it was produced during the era immediately following the success of Star Wars, and while LucasFilm LTD's ILM was behind the special effects, there was certainly a lacking of Movie Magic, but no shortness of ""just like star wars did it"" scenery, creatures, and overall lack of originality.Many of us are feeling the MCU Fatigue. The writing is stale. We're tired of ignoring the fact that this whole story-telling strategy has begin to feel grossly formulaic. Quantumania fails the same way that Love and Thunder failed. 5+ years ago, heroes that didnt take themselves seriously and cracked jokes was an original idea. Now its the norm for all Super Heroes Marvel and DC.Save your money. Wait until it comes out on Disney +. This is the Marvel equivalent of a Straight to VHS. It will don the ranks of Black Widow, BP - Wakanda Forever, Love and Thunder, and The Eternals in it's unique ability to be so poorly written that entertaining anyone short of its media empire investors will be downright impossible.I wish I had one of ant man's shrinking disks, or one of Hank Pym's Ants, so that I could have witnessed the process of writing this story, and lived through how they possibly thought this could have been a good movie. Im struggling to understand and based on other moviegoers, that sentiment is not mine alone.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While it has its entertaining moments, the film ultimately falls flat due to several key issues.One of the major shortcomings is the lack of stakes and danger to the main character. There is no real sense of urgency or tension, and the story fails to make the audience invested in the outcome.Additionally, the film's villain is portrayed as powerful and threatening at first, but is easily defeated in the end. This not only makes the villain feel weak and forgettable, but also removes any sense of real danger for the heroes.However, the movie is not without its highlights. Paul Rudd's performance as Ant Man is enjoyable, and there are some visually stunning scenes that are a treat to watch.Overall, Ant Man Quantumania is a middle-of-the-road Marvel movie that doesn't quite reach the heights of the franchise's best entries. It's worth a watch if you're a fan of the superhero genre, but don't expect it to be a standout film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't watch all the series but, at least in cinema, I don't think the phase 4 was the tragedy that everyone says it was. But now it's in the past, and Quantumania is the film that opens the phase 5. And I have to agree that it was not the best of the beginnings.Quantumania should be used as an example of what not to do in the process of world-building. In the first Ant-Man movies, which explored the quantum world superficially, it looked so much more interesting, so much more expandable, so much more alive. But here, besides the terrible visual effects, there's a lack of colour. The film is dark, apathetic, lifeless, and it's possible do make a film that's at the same time dark and vivid, just look at what Jordan Cronenweth did in Blade Runner (and Roger Deakins in the sequel), what Greig Fraser did in Dune and The Batman, and et cetera. And there's a narrative resource that was so dumb that I had no choice but to laugh.And not only that. With one exception, the new characters are far from being interesting. Katy M. O'Brien's character is a copy-n-paste of Tessa Thompson from Thor: Ragnarok, Bill Murray looks extremely uncomfortable, and Kathryn Newton has nothing to do with Cassie Lang. It's not a problem that she's intelligent, but she almost rebooted her character, she makes no use of anything that Abby Ryder Fortson previously did.And why this film is called ""Ant-Man AND THE WASP: Quantumania""? Evangeline Lilly is even more secondary than she was in the first film (which was only called ""Ant-Man""), and so does Michael Douglas. In contrast, Michelle Pfeiffer grows. She is genuinely interesting and it was good to see more of her.And finally this saga has a good villain. It was not Corey Stoll, who was impossible to take seriously, as he constantly reminded me of Humpty Dumpty. It's Kang the Conqueror, made by Jonathan Majors. He's imposing, he's an excellent actor, and his character has a lot of potential for the future.I must admit that, despite having plenty of issues, I had a fun time with this film, due to my previous appreciation for these characters, especially Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), but unlike the two other films, I think I'll forget it in one week. And someone who was definitely missed was Michael Peña.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd was good, as always, and there were a few laughs, but even he seemed fed up with the whole thing. But the whole thing was a mess and the editing sucked. Was this aimed at kids?

There are however too many characters and too many character arcs being crammed in to a 2 hour movie for us to really engage with any of them properly.I've no idea why they felt the need to bring in one of the most ridiculous villains that ever disgraced the pages of a marvel comic book.. but they did and even though the character arc isn't terrible it just added more bloat to an already busy script.There are tonal imbalances too .

You ruined Star Wars, so instead of losing another billion on a new chapter, you disguised a MCU movie into an unofficial ""Episode X...Size Does Matter.""Actually, this is literally Star Wars, Star Trek for the villain and a Marvel movie all combined into one. Heck, one character was totally using the Force.I'm uncertain the reason I rated this higher than the previous two Ant-Mans (which I thought were just okay, but enjoyable) is because my expectations were INCREDIBLY low. To the point, I thought I was going to hate this. Though, yes, it definitely has its issues. Comedy, or the lack thereof, was one.For a series that thrives on comedy, mostly from Paul Rudd and definitely Michael Peña, this one had so many jokes, but only 1/3 worked. I didn't hate the jokes; they just were mostly DOA. And I have NEVER known the great Bill Murray to be this incredibly unfunny. Well, to be fair, he wasn't funny in Charlie's Angels (2000) and Ghostbusters (2016.) Here he served his purpose and couldn't be less Bill Murray.What also didn't help was the lack of Michael Peña. He had thee very best scene of the Original Ant-Man and every other character in this third movie tried to take his place annnnd failed. I mean, again, I laughed a few times. Just cringed at the lack of thought they put in most of the ""humor.""The movie doesn't waste any time getting the family that talks to ants together shot into the Quantum Realm. Trapped and separated, the group tries to reunite and go back home, only to run into a pretty good villain, Kang, hellbent on joining them to seek massive revenge.I did like this entry. Especially if you view it through Star Wars Eyes. It's just a fun romp with excellent acting and wonderful screentime from Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror. Heck, Michael Douglas was also fun to see on screen - I'll never tire of seeing him.The only ones I thought were meh, but serviceable were Ant-Man, himself, Paul Rudd who seriously didn't seem like his heart was into this, Evangeline Lilly as Plain Jane Wasp and the annoying, zero-personality daughter played by Kathryn Newton.Also, a few of the creatures were pretty fun and unique. Well, except BIG HEAD. That design was just incredibly awful. Mimicked a ""live action"" Humpty Dumpty with a human head in place of the egg. Looked disgusting, cheap and completely out of place even in this Realm of weird and exotic creatures.DEFINTIELY leave your brain at the door and don't ask too many questions. It's at the same level as Black Adam (except with WAY better FX) and Thor: Love and Thunder. If you liked those superhero movies, you'll most likely have a good time here.***Final Thoughts: I was warned I absolutely need to see the final two end-credit scenes.

While at the same time further cementing Paul Rudd's Ant-Man from being a funny laughable franchise to a dark twisted nightmare.

After seeing the film I can understand her fear as Conquering is inevitable towards the MCU's future. Kang did not come here to play as he show cases his skills to the point where it's pretty clear that he will take that top spot as the Avengers biggest threat to date.

So in all Ant Man and the Wasp Quantimania is a fun marvel superhero movie with a great cast and big ambitions that sometimes work and sometimes don't.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Going to the theatre with my dad growing up was special. The movies had Iconic characters that were build up and built apon every movie making an incredible cast of characters. Every single character was written beautifully and have conflict and character building that we no longer see much of anymore. I am also very sad of the tone of the newer marvel movies. The tone of the old movies were more serious and creative. The Avengers a group of incredible super hero's that are not perfect. Each of the avengers have a conflict or problem that makes them characters and helps the audience relate to them. Writers for the newer Marvel movies have a very primitive writing style. The tone of this movie is very whimsical, ""funny"", and oh look we are in the quantum realm with people that look weird and there's a big bad guy with an empire. This movie feels like the director watched star wars and said I want that universe to be the quantum realm. Speaking of the quantum realm, this movie makes the concept look childish. In the previous ant-man movies I thought, ""Damn, Janet was stranded in a desolate realm with nothing and nobody."" I thought the quantum realm was cool and mysterious. Now with the newer movie, the quantum realm is nothing but a weird place full of cringe people and creatures. The writer's for the script should also be fired, I felt genuinely bad for the incredible actors in this film because this movie was a complete waste of their talent.Marvel is killing this franchise slowly with every new show and movie they make. Bring back the old Marvel and hire some new writers. My little sister could write A better plot and script for this movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It keeps a good family dynamic alive while giving us one of the best villain introduction comparable to Thanos if not better seeing as we get the motivation from the start.

This one doesn't even have Michael Pena.No soul, no writing, just millions of dollars in VFX that don't even look that good.Ant-Man 3 is the Avatar (James Cameron) of the Marvel movies and the worst of all 3.

While Jonathan Majors delivered a standout performance as Kang, the film failed to impress in several key areas. One of the biggest missteps was the utilization of a tired and overused trope, the introduction of a child character who inexplicably possesses greater knowledge and skills than their parents. This cliche not only felt lazy and unoriginal but also detracted from the overall quality of the film.The movie suffered from an excessive reliance on derivative story elements and tonal mimicry of other successful films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While it's understandable for movies to pay homage to their predecessors, the result in this case felt more like an uninspired and lackluster imitation.While I appreciated the strong performances of certain cast members, the film as a whole failed to meet my expectations. I would not recommend it to those seeking a fresh and innovative addition to the Ant-Man franchise.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It feels like its too short but at the same time has scenes that could have been cut out completely for more time with Kang. The first half was sometimes down right boring but it picks up in the 2nd half.What I will give the movie, is that they have given the quantum realm a real cool atmosphere and it feels like a place that will still serve some purpose in the future. Jonathan majors delivers hard as Kang and Paul Rudd has nice chemistry with Cassie's actress.Overall, As a start for Kang's story, it delivers pretty good but it does not hold up as a stand alone story.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

The story is about how Scott and Cassie Lang, accompanied with Pym's Family, accidentally deep down into quantum dimension, and need to find the way out in reality realm. During the way to find out, they needed to face with the conqueror like Kang, who wants to have a power to manage every timeline. And also, we have seen M. O. D. O. K. In movie style for the first time.The production was set up, or directed by Peyton Reeds, and writing by Jeff Loveness. In beginning and the final part of the movie was located on San Francesco with beautiful sunshine day, which is really good location and time to share on Scott Lang's happy moments with his people around him to express on what he did once for saving the universe with Avengers. Also, there would be a lot of scenes that take on Quantum Realm where they were using on their lots of visual effects on nearly entire movies, but I would like to recommend that it will very worthy when we would like to watch with IMAX-3D with laser system.Furthermore, I would like to say that I really love the movie much, but not hype enough like Avengers: Endgame, though I had seen the big scale of the battalion of ants coming through the quantum realm. But I would consider that this scene is very hype enough to opening the fifth phase of MCU, and worth to wait to see this movie for some reasons, like how Marvel Studios shows us the way they enter the fifth phase of the universe, with fighting the ""Avengers-level threat"" like Kang the Conqueror on this solo movie. Additionally, we would see the development on their changes of four main characters like Scott Lang, who is played by Paul Rudd, on Ant-Man responsibilities and being a father to Cassie Lang, Hope Van Dyne, played by Evangeline Lilly, on The Wasp responsibilities to care the family and the one (Scott) who loves, Cassie herself, played by Kathryn Newton, for her teenage roles and responsibilities to save the world with his father, and Janet Van Dyne, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, have some secrets those didn't tell yet to the family when she was stuck in Quantum Realm.Additionally, I would add more that the director is excellent on expressing his quantum realm upon Science and his imagination on it. With all these, he came up for designing the appearances, the costumes, and many more to be like living in the quantum, the smallest place that we cannot see it. And then, he visualizes with effects to be more realistic on it. If I compare with the other movies, this one would be one of the best showing off Science movies, which is really like Christopher Nolan's. On music and soundtrack part, they invited Christopher Beck to compose the movie soundtrack, and it's literally thrills with the power of orchestra and modernized symphony, which is absolutely matched together on his way.Lastly, I would like to say that this movie quite an average good score, but not high much as Avengers did. Although, it could make our mimic that this movie is really excellent opening for Phase 5 of The Marvel Cinematic Universe. And I would like to say that it is worth to see it for this moment.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I like first Ant-Man, second movie was fine as well. I like Paul Rudd... but I kinda never liked they chose Scott Lang: as THE main Ant Man. I always thought Hank Pym, Ultimate version, was so interesting and they did nothing with it. Scott Lang is a blank slate, Paul Rudd playing Paul Rudd, Ryan Reynolds style. But it mostly worked, so fine, whatever.And then I watched this and it was boring, disappointing and main characters didn't grew a bit from the first movie. Script was subpar, boring, mostly not funny or interesting. Characters are completely whatever.It's so sad to see such an expensive movie, with so many visual artists crunching through sleepless nights so you can get a dumb, uninspired and visually incomprehensible movie at the end. Visually incomprehensible to the point of I didn't care one bit for it.Maybe the worst sin though - is to have a movie with this budget, about time travel, wacky physics, etc. And do absolutely nothing with it.Big man hits small man, small man hits big man, big or/and small man shoots lasers. Repeat, hit harder.That's about the extent this whole movie goes. This movie makes dr. Strange defeating Dormammu look like a genius level fight.Story and characters are THE KING of anything, if you don't have those, you have nothing of value.

I started reading the comics at 5 and then continued to look up what happened in the issues that I did not own. Point is that I am a person who will live and die by marvel. I genuinely that this is a positive step for Marvel. Marvel is starting to seriously branch out from the comics and is making it's own story. For past films, the stories have been loosely based on issues and series. Now the audience is thrown headfirst into a wacky yet deeply terrifying world. The performances for the movie are phenomenal, Kathrine Newton has seriously improved since her mediocre performance in Detective Pikachu. The movie is visually pleasing, and seems like it would be a fever dream to watch while inebriated. I noticed that there were many reviews commenting on the graphics, which astounded me because the set is gorgeous and so are the characters, well most of them. I can only think that the graphics related reviews are talking about MODOK. I agree that I am not a fan of the skin design and the bulbous stretched face. But I think that it was a creative design and they made jokes about it in the film, almost like he is supposed to look awful. I think that if this is what the MCU looks like, I am fully ready to support it. All that said, I do not believe that this is the best MCU film, but it is far from the worst. Please give the film a try and go into it lookin g for a good time and not expecting a bad one.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

After. Almost seeming to have mastered the formula for producing consistently good/fun action/comedy/spectacle movies with almost no clunkers, since Phase 3 ended, I'd say the MCU has produced...MAYBE one okay movie (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and quite a few mediocre to poor ones. Quantumania breaks that streak by being absolutely AWFUL. Easily the worst MCU movie since Thor 2.What went wrong? Well, first of all, what made the first two Ant-Man's fun? It was the hilarious and unexpected set pieces of things and people changing sizes unexpectedly and in ways that tickled the funny bone. In the quantum realm...everything is so alien that there aren't really meaningful opportunities to use this mechanic creatively. The movie effectively gives away it's greatest strength by it's very premise.The world-building of QM is also...bizarre and inconsistent in ways that make the plot have no stakes, the viewer can have no expectations to be met or subverted because no rules are every presented. Indeed, we are reminded over and over again that there are no rules. Every weird thing is just another weird thing. None of it has any weight or meaning.The movie does VERY rarely make head nods to hollywood-izations of quantum mechanics concepts...but not in any way that is interesting. Not in any way where you go 'oh, thats clever'.I hinted at it already, but there's also really no stakes. The way the MCU is positioning Kang is that he's his own disposable villain. Which kind of ruins him. You can kill off as many as you like, there's always more. That doesn't make him more compelling, it makes him LESS. Oh no, this one might escape? BFD, there's billions of them out there anyway. We also seem to be using a villain whose main schtick is time travel in a way that ... doesn't really involve much time travel. It's just an excuse for why he has crazy technology.The daughter plot feels forced and doesn't resonate. Hope is little more than wallpaper, as is Hank. Janet gets some play...but she's so evasively mysterious that it's hard to give a crap about her.And where was the humor? Paul Rudd is first and foremost a comedic actor. And yet...this might well be the least funny MCU movie since ... again, I have to go clear back to Thor 2 or maybe even Hulk. Why is there so little funny in this movie that should, like the Guardians series, be the comedic tentpoles of the MCU?I made it through the whole movie. So i can't rate it TOO low because I tend to quit on things that are that bad. But this wasn't good. If I were ever to rewatch the MCU (which is ALOT of content at this point), I'd skip this one for sure.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it has plenty of action, and the CGI is impeccable as always. Yeah, Modok's design is a little funky, but what else do you expect from a floating head? From the complaints I've heard, the majority of them lies on the character design of Modok, which in my opinion is a dumb thing to hate on the entire movie for. As the Antman movies progress, they start to lie more and more on his family and the people he loves, which I very much am intrigued by. So with that, if you're expecting a film about Paul Rudd, you're not going to entirely get that. This film does setup for bigger plots within the MCU, and I'd say is more of a prerequisite to watch before future films.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

you can almost heard the sound of me violently scratching my head, as it echoes throughout the empty cinema.""I don't like Marvel movies, but it's got Paul Rudd in it. It has to be good."" - famous last words.After one random Bill Murray cameo, a million unnecessary CGI effects, and a barrage of wince-inducing actors - I'm now $25 poorer, 2 hours older, with no chance of getting either of those things back.Paul Rudd - for his ill-placed comedic relief, and; Bill Murray - for his 5 seconds of screen-time purely for the sake of putting his face in the trailer, are prime examples of why I will continue to avoid Marvel like I do daytime talk shows: all the noise, none of the substance.My skilful evasion of all things Marvel since 2012 (with an exception for Black Panther ofc), is one inspired by a general distaste to gauche displays of corporate baloney. Disney's sad attempt at becoming titans of the film industry, is no exception.Creative bankruptcy at its finest.But who needs creativity and artistic vision, when you have over-exaggerated visual effects which act only to distract the audience from the cheap comedy and uninspired dialogue. How many times must it be said: FLASHY CGI GRAPHICS ARE NOT COMPENSATION FOR THESE PREDICTABLE, PEDESTRIAN PLOT LINES!!!!The entire film left me wondering how many Disney producers and Execs that Peyton Reed had to roofie to get this idea to market. Were all the screenplay writers on leave at the time? Maybe all the casting directors were at lunch?Whose ass do you have to kiss to produce another 2hr-spin cycle of recycled plot lines and gaping wide plot holes:
Why did he not just stay gigantic the whole time? Why did Kang not take off Cassie's suit? Why don't they always use Hawkeye in tennis? Did I turn the stove off? God my nails are getting long, I should really cut them-As unimaginable its existence may be, 'Quantumania' speaks to a larger, far scarier consequence for the world of cinema:
Its slow decent into a technological hell-scape of CGI and green screens.In watching the film, it quickly becomes apparent that 98% of the movie was shot on green screen, and most of the 'extras' were computer generated aliens likely made from leftover 'Episode IX' templates, leaving the entirety of the budget left to feeding the army of dusty Star Wars animators looking to get another fix.Is this the future of cinema? Will Sci-Fi ever return to its golden ages of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher? Ant-man's Jedi-like imagery doing only to ride on the coattails of another franchise that was similarly, milked to the bone.Give up Disney, the horse is dead.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was a fun movie and the visuals I thought were great.I thought the acting was great and the story moved along well. It was the first movie I've seen with Jonathan Majors and I thought he did an amazing job and I'm excited to check out some of his other acting credits.I went in to this with lower expectations because I haven't been wild about the new content from the MCU but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.I know some people were upset with how MODOK was portrayed but I thought they did a great job making him a fun addition. There is no way to make MODOK in a live action movie serious.

While Paul Rudd is an excellent actor, his performance as Ant-Man was underutilized and failed to leave a lasting impression. He seemed to be going through the motions, with none of the charisma and humor that made his previous portrayals of the character so enjoyable.One of the weakest points of the film was the character of Cassie Lang. She was an irritating and unnecessary addition to the cast, with no real purpose in the movie. Her character was a distraction, adding nothing to the overall plot or the development of the other characters.Another major issue with Ant-Man 3 was the quality of the CGI. It was lackluster and unimpressive, leaving the action scenes feeling uninspired and dull. The special effects failed to create a believable world, with characters and objects appearing stiff and artificial. It was a significant disappointment and made the film feel cheap and poorly made.Finally, the sci-fi and alien elements of the movie were entirely superfluous. They added nothing to the overall plot and were a complete waste of time. The movie would have been much better served by focusing on the more grounded and human aspects of the characters, rather than trying to shoehorn in unnecessary science fiction elements that felt out of place and uninteresting.In conclusion, Ant-Man 3 was a significant letdown and a weak addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Despite a strong performance by Paul Rudd, the movie failed to deliver in many areas. The CGI was lackluster, the sci-fi elements were unnecessary, and the character of Cassie Lang was entirely annoying. It's a shame, as this movie had the potential to be a great addition to the franchise, but instead, it felt like a cheap and poorly made film.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

However, ever since Spider Man: No Way Home, I have been pretty consistently disappointed by Marvel. It just seems to be that they can't connect the storylines, make a tone that works, and try new things that end up working on a consistent basis. Quantumania is a breath of fresh air in some ways, but in others it's just more of the same.Let's start with the good. Kang the Conquerer (the new big badguy) is VERY good. Johnathan Majors is obviously a very good actor, and he gets most of the good lines and dialogue in this film. Everytime he is on screen, the movie's tone turns serious and it gave me chills at points. I am very excited to see the future of Kang. The Quantum Realm is also a breath of fresh air from the usual Marvel scenery. The action is mostly good as well, and kept me interested. Along with some jokes that were actually pretty funny, I did laugh out loud a few times. Although, sometimes it was at the movie.Now, the bad and extremely goofy. Firstly, the poor Marvel writing consists, and there are so many corny and goofy lines in this movie. It gets to the point where it seems that they are trying to parody themselves. Cassie Lang actually says ""They're Quantum people....in the QUANTUM REALM????"" Also, it seems like some of the cast don't wanna be there, like Michael Douglas and the actress that plays Hope (she barely gets any lines anyways). The visual effects are hit or miss, ranging between beautiful and extremely distracting. Finally, like I said there is so much goofy that it is hard to take the more dramatic moments serious. Whether it's MODOK, Bill Murray, or the random corny lines at bad times. It just impacted the movie for me.Overall, I think if you like most Marvel stuff, or just love Ant-Man, you will like this film. Some people might love all the goofy, which I would understand. However, for me, it just made me more tired of Marvel in general. The silver lining is I am excited with the future of Kang and phase 5 . I think if they start to improve and innovate more, the future of Marvel could be bright.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Again, with so much money and resources, how can they continually fail.Ant-man here, doesn't seem to know whether its a comedy, action or sci-fi as it tries to be all, and badly. Some of the attempted comedy is embarrassing. The action is too CGI-ish and lacks substance, with battles looking exactly like a cheap-and-nasty CGI battles.And then there's the storyline; ho-hum. About as surprising as daylight. Here we have a bad guy whose God-like in power, and a destroyer of worlds, but susceptible to giant ants. Ant-mans helmet is easily destroyed by physical punches, yet strong enough to withstand molecular changes. And teenage daughters who are more philosophical than dads & grandpa's. Utterly ridiculous.Just another disappointment of the slowly diminishing Marvel world.

Could be the least bad Marvel MCU Stage 5 movie. Based upon what's coming up over the next couple years. However, that may not be anything redeeming. So much green screen / volume / CGI/acid trip colors. Well written and executed with practical effects would have been so much better.1) stop having the characters take their masks off anytime there's any dialogue, even the Power Rangers didn't do that
2) once again they try to make Evangeline Lilly as unattractive as possible, while also saddling her with almost no story participation considering she's supposed to be half of the Super Couple. Not sure if the requirement by Michelle Pfeiffer's contract was to make sure that Evangeline Lilly was made to look extremely rough. Otherwise the movie makers are intentionally trying to sabotage this beautiful woman in these movies.3) Believe It Or not, Another young female that is amazing, and is the ""bestest"" at everything that has ever been and ever will be. And even smarter than Hank Pym even though she's not his granddaughter.4) some of the dialogue is so bad and storyline contrivances that make you feel dirty, with editors that don't even seem to realize the glaring contradictions from scene to scene or even moments apart. It's like watching a modern sitcom with the laugh track turned off.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Save your money. Boring dialogue. What is a plot? Now I'm just going to pad out the description with meaningless words. Maybe Disney will use it for a script for their next movie. It had a preview for the Flash movie. Oh, I got a lot of Star Wars style scenes in the movie. It also has Bill Murray in it. I had chicken wings and fried pickles with Mountain Dew. It wasn't that bad. I saw it in 3D so that was a thing. Do you remember The Chris Farley show skits from SNL in the 90's? That was cool. I have more fun watching Red Letter Media reviews on YouTube.

Problems that, on their own wouldn't be all that distracting. In a better put together film, most could write them off as ""nitpicks"". But when the story and characters are not engaging enough, these little problems really add up, and the movie suffers death by 1000 cuts.The ""Quantum Realm"" is not that visually interesting. It looks like all the actors filmed their scenes separately on a green screen. The realm itself is just a series of browns and oranges like an old dusty screw. You don't get any sense of size in this movie. When Ant-Man is in the real world he will interact with objects we are familiar with. We know he is big because he is compared to a boat or an airplane. In the Quantum Realm there is no scaling. There is a scene where two characters are supposedly giant, but since they are just the same size as each other, they look like normal people.Back when Janet was in the Quantum Realm, she helped out Jonathan Majors fix his ship. But then she discovered that he was evil. How did she discover this? For some reason his spaceship is fueled by his mind...so Janet touching the ship made it so she could read his mind. Not very well explained and it doesn't make much sense. Feels like the writers were hoping to come up with an explanation later but just never did. They needed her to find out he was evil, so she just found out, end of story. A big plot point surrounds the idea that Janet doesn't want to tell any of her family about this interaction. Why? The movie tries to imply that she feels guilty or traumatized about it. But I don't buy it, it is just so drama can happen between Hope and Janet, otherwise Hope has nothing to do in this movie.MODOK is terrifying for all the wrong reasons. Every time he is on screen, I am immediately wanting him to leave. His character arc also makes no sense.Speaking of things that make no sense, Jonathan Majors' powerset fluctuates wildly depending on what the plot demands. It seems like he should win easily, but then when the third act approaches, suddenly he makes a lot of stupid decisions and is capable of killing everyone except for the main characters.Cassie is super annoying. She is a self-righteous, entitled know it all that keeps getting vindicated.I liked Jonathan Majors in the movie. And unlike other Marvel movies, I actually was fine with the comedy in this movie. It was an appropriate level of humor for this character. I enjoyed that the movie does not waste much time in getting the story going. The story begins and ends with a good pace.Overall, the rules of their world don't add up. Characters seem to change with no believable motivation. Some characters are just annoying. The visuals are unappealing. So yes, a lot of these could have been forgiven but it is all the small things the movie does wrong. Of all people, Ant-Man should know the power of small things.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

She has never fought before and suddenly she is fighting monsters.The whole movie is a mess with the bad story lines and imitations of Star Wars.

In this film, Scott Lang (Paul) teams up with his girlfriend Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline), her father Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn as an unnecessary recast) to stop a weird looking villain who wants to use the quantum realm for evil purposes.The film tries to balance comedy, action, and sci-fi elements, but fails at all of them. The jokes are stale and predictable, the action scenes are boring and repetitive, and the sci-fi concepts are confusing and illogical. The plot is full of holes and inconsistencies, and the characters are bland and unlikable. The villain is a generic megalomaniac with no clear motivation or backstory. The quantum realm is supposed to be a fascinating and mysterious place, but it looks like a cheap CGI mess.Quantum Mania is a disappointing and forgettable film that wastes the potential of its premise and its cast. It is not worth your time or money. I would give it 2/10 stars.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I went to the movie having low expectations given the rough critic reviews. I was surprised- I thought it should have been rated a bit higher than it was. I thought the acting was fantastic, the CGI was great (with the exception of MODOK). And the comedy was not too much (as it was in Thor Love and Thunder). The pacing was good for the most part, although some parts were a little slow.Personally, I think this was the best Ant Man so far, and it was my favorite Marvel movie since Spider Man No Way Home. Although there are a handful of better Marvel movies in the last five years, this was good enough to make me excited about upcoming Phase 5 movies.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

There are also frequent broad jarring jokes which take you out of the movie. The root cause of the issues is it was written by Jeff Loveness, who's biggest credits are TV shows including Jimmy Kimmel live & Rick & Morty. NOT epic action adventure movies. Really glad I didn't pay good money to see it. There's no attempt to create a cohesive narrative with some internal logic which respects the characters or the audience. The good points are the visuals which are interesting & Jonathan Majors performance as Kang which was impressive, quite a feat considering the storm of irritating, silliness surrounding him. This movie is a ridiculous, predictable mess but if you've got trash-mania you might like it.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

My impression was that actors are completely unnecessary in the movie.

"4","/10","Here's a Thought...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8878909/?ref_=tt_urv","secret_arash","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114560829/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2023","I would like to take a different point of view towards the problems surrounding the new Marvel movies. Here's the thing, I think the main issue that is causing such disappointments for fans regarding the recent movies is not technical. I don't deny the bad CGI or editing and directing problems, but, the big issue is with the overall storytelling. If you take a good look at each phase and each Saga of the MCU you can kinda look at it as a TV show for which each of the phases act as a season and each of the Saga as a whole show. Storytelling is a vital aspect of any good show. In order to create the best villain, you need appropriate and proper build up. The said build up will probably require to include many side stories which seem to be irrelevant but are portrayed in an interesting way for their own sake. Let me clarify. The first Saga of the MCU was the Infinity Saga which included three phases and Thanos was the ultimate vilain for it. If my calculations are correct, the character had his own movie after 18 others. We repeatedly saw traces of the Infinity stones in those movies and as a result they became a great mystery for us and left a mark in our minds. Therefore, when we finally got to know what exactly they were and how the great villain is going to use them and even what the point of all the chaos around them was, our excitement was beyond imagination. Besides that, we got to know our heroes very well on the ride. In the end we knew everything about them and felt everything they felt because of all the adventures we experienced with them. It was the Finale of the show, and boy what a great Finale it was.Now, it's time for the new show. I haven't read the comics but it seems like Kang is going to be the main villain of the multiverse Saga. The character is really interesting in Ant-Man 3 and I think can make a really great villain. BUT, none of the abovementioned features are present in the new Saga. The character is not only introduced in the very first movie of phase five but also is the main focus of the second half of the movie. I don't want to mention his faith in the end but let me just say it was not OK with me especially when the name of The next Avenger movie, which by the way is coming out only two years after this, is Kang Dynasty. The great villain of the new Saga fought only Ant-Man and a couple of not interesting side characters of the Avengers. How can I hope for such villain to grow into one which I respect and fear? The issue with the new Saga is that after each movie, or show, you cannot find a good answer for the question of ""what was the point of the movie?"" I mean one could question the necessity of its existence. Most of the movies and shows are just there to badly introduce new heroes to us. Dont get me wrong this must be done, as it was in the first Saga, but back then the introduction of heroes was not the main focus of each movie. They were introduced and then given a proper villain to fight. And the fights had proper conclusions. Now, for a second, think about doctor strange 2, black panther 2, Ant-Man 3, Thor 4, or any of the shows and see if you can find anything without which the overall story would be hurt. Let me summarize some of the recent projects of MCU for you: ""SPOILER ALERT""Falcon and winter soldier: Falcon is the new captain AmericaMoon knight: there's a new guy with ancient Egyptian powersMs. Marvel: we have a Muslim heroDoctor Starnge 2: America Chavez EntersThor 4: Thor has a kid psychicBlack Panther 2: Shury is the new BP and there's a fish villain in the futureThe point of all of them is telling you there is something great coming and you should feel excited for it. They don't make you feel that way, they tell you to feel that way.The issue of storytelling that Marvel is facing is very complicated and I know I was not able to convey my thoughts about it but I hope you had got the gist. Anyway, I don't think any of the upcoming movies of MCU are going to be an exception of this weakness of storytelling due to their overall relevance and this really pains me that my favorite Cinematic Universe will not make any more good movies for a long time.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It made no real sense, and was a horrible script with absurd dialog, action and more. It had too much profanity for the childishness of the script, as it is only geared toward 7 year olds. It lacked depth, sanity, reason, or logic, all for the sense of bigger and more expensive than the last one stunts and explosions. But it was a hot mess, absolutely and completely. Not even worth going into specifics, it is just very bad. Moronic in fact, with none of the heart of the first or even second one. It felt like watching a bad version of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, gone crazy. So sad, because I really liked the first one. Just a series of violent acts, pretending to tell a disjointed, ridiculous story. It lacked soul. The only good thing about it was the ants, but they waited too long to bring them out, so it lacked the charm of the first two. They forgot that their power was in the ants. It was idiotic until plot point 2, then it got better -- too late. And they should never do one without the two sidekicks!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The action was well done and I laughed at all the right moments. The humor did not really feel forced like some other recent MCU entries. The villain is actually a villain rather than a sympathetic individual whose actions are villainous but intentions noble. That is my primary concern with the last several MCU films.The performances from returning actors were just as fun as previous appearances and the new actors all did great. Especially Jonathan Majors as Kang. That guy is amazing.The use of LucasFilm's Volume set technology made a big difference in how the actors interacted with their unearthly environments and made it more believable.Most of the creatures were also very well designed. There was one CGI character that was kind of off, but their design would have been difficult to pull off regardless of budget. I still liked the overall end result despite my reservations.I think this is the best Marvel movie entry in awhile.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

For instance, the relationship between Scott (father) and Cassie (daughter) is supposed to be the emotional core of the movie, BUT it looks so 'artificial', without much 'chemistry'!

Just enjoy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8896418/?ref_=tt_urv","gcsman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66541531/?ref_=tt_urv","27 February 2023","I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

As a viewer, you have high expectations for a movie set in this universe, but this one falls short. It feels like a paint-by-numbers superhero movie instead of having the allure and mystery that made the previous installments so popular.The movie makes an effort to convey a sense of urgency and high stakes, but it fails. It's difficult to comprehend Kang's actions because of his poor motivations. Because of this, the conflict seems manufactured, and the movie's climax is unimpressive. Being relegated to a two-dimensional antagonist for a character with so much potential is frustrating.The film's visual effects unquestionably save it, but they are limited in what they can accomplish. Although the CGI is visually appealing and technically sound, it lacks the ""wow"" element that we have come to associate with Marvel films. The visual style of the movie is flat and uninteresting, and the action scenes, which are few and far between, are easy to get bored of.The plot appears incoherent and the narration is poor, with a slow pacing. It's challenging to care about the destiny of the characters because they are underdeveloped. It's difficult to help but wonder what may have happened if the filmmaking team had taken more chances and pushed the envelope.In conclusion, practically every aspect of this movie is a letdown. It's a bland installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that falls short of emulating the wonder and thrill of its forerunners. It's difficult to suggest for anyone other than ardent fans, however you might find something to like here if you are one. We can only hope that the franchise will learn from this error and resume providing the exciting and inventive storytelling that we've grown to enjoy.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

However, the end result was a messy, unfocused film that failed to live up to its potential.The film picks up where its predecessor, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp,"" left off, with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) now a fugitive after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War."" Meanwhile, his former love interest and fellow superhero, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), is still searching for her mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is lost in the quantum realm. Along with her father, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and a new character, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), they set out to explore the quantum realm and rescue Janet.At first glance, the plot seems promising. The quantum realm is a fascinating and mysterious concept that has been teased in previous Marvel films, and the addition of Kang, a major comic book villain, adds a new level of excitement. However, the execution is where the film falters.The plot is convoluted and messy, with multiple storylines and characters vying for attention. Scott is dealing with the consequences of his actions in ""Civil War,"" Hope is focused on rescuing her mother, Hank is grappling with his own guilt over Janet's disappearance, and Kang is... well, it's unclear what Kang's motivations are until the third act of the film. The result is a film that feels unfocused and lacks a clear sense of direction.The characters, too, suffer from the film's lack of focus. Scott, Hope, and Hank are all likable characters, but they are given little to do beyond spouting off exposition and reacting to the various plot developments. Janet, who was hyped up as a major character in the film's marketing, is given even less to do, relegated to a few scenes in the quantum realm where she dispenses some cryptic advice.Kang, meanwhile, is a major disappointment. Jonathan Majors gives a charismatic performance, but his character is so poorly defined that it's difficult to care about him. He's a time-traveling conqueror from the future, but beyond that, we know little about him until the third act of the film. By then, it's too late to develop him into a compelling villain.The humor, which was a highlight of the previous ""Ant-Man"" films, also falls flat. The jokes feel forced and repetitive, relying too heavily on the same gags that worked in the past. There are a few bright spots, like Luis's (Michael Peña) rapid-fire storytelling, but they are few and far between.The action scenes, too, are a letdown. The film's marketing promised a trip through the quantum realm and an exploration of its wonders, but the actual sequences feel uninspired and forgettable. There are a few creative uses of the shrinking and growing powers, but they are few and far between. The final battle, which takes place outside the quantum realm, is similarly underwhelming, lacking the tension and excitement of previous Marvel films.In the end, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a forgettable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's lack of focus, underdeveloped characters, and uninspired action make for a disappointing experience. The quantum realm, which had so much potential, is squandered on a messy plot that fails to explore its wonders. The humor, which was a.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

"3","/10","A tease for something spectacular that may happen later (for real this time, we promise)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8874555/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2023","When I praise the older MCU films, I may seem tough to please, as I expect these movies (which, of course, make up a larger, increasingly complicated tapestry) to function as their own thing while also making sense as Shared Universe components. Truth be told, it's arguable whether the older films were wholly satisfactory in that respect.When Captain: America The Winter Soldier came out, many praised it as a decent standalone sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger -- with some useful context supplied by adjacent media, but it raised that franchise-old question of where everyone else is right now. Then we got Civil War, which brought in a lot more characters -- sans a few whose absence makes canonical sense -- and so functioned better as an MCU chapter, but if your interest is squarely in the Cap trilogy, will you truly understand it if you watch it right after The Winter Soldier?Ever since Phase Four, it's been trickier than ever, not only due to the sheer number of characters and stories to account for. Almost everything is a tie-in to and/or tease for something else -- not necessarily within the same ""trilogy"" or ""series"". Some works do try to stay in their own corner of the MCU (at the expense of making it clear what unifying Endgame all of this is building toward), I guess for simplicity's sake, yet they keep introducing threats, McGuffins, and entities so awesomely powerful that it makes even less sense for the Avengers to not at least call a quarterly meeting about the sh-t that's been happening lately. Even a witch with the capacity to destroy every world in every universe is an ""adventure of the week"".Anyway, now we have Phase Five, starting off with Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania and with it new questions about the Marvel Multiverse and the rules of time travel and universe-hopping. And yes, you're gonna need to see Endgame before this one, lest some plot details come off as headscratchers if you, for some weird reason, only care about the Ant-Man films. (Disney+'s Loki might be of use too. Oh what, you didn't know there are shows too now?)Paul Rudd reminiscing about the time he spent with the Avengers isn't so bad (in a pre-MCU superhero film, a line like that could be an Easter Egg for devoted comic readers), but much is still lost if you jump straight from Ant-Man 2 to this. I know watching any particular solo series within the MCU is a fool's game at this point, but I can't stop thinking about how I'd much prefer if this was all one big TV series or something, preferably helmed by an organized creative team who are in agreement about the rules.Quantumania also retains the Phase Four tradition of hurriedly introducing a bunch of new heroes to set up the next Disney+ title, which will almost certainly be a whole-ass TV show because a serialized narrative is more likely to keep fans subscribed than just plopping a singular film on there. As usual (and as per the traditions of the source material), it's a new version of an old hero. Scott ""Ant-Man"" Lang's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, nowhere near as good as in Three Billboards) comes away from this adventure with her own size-altering suit and is effectively Scott's sidekick. The Wasp of the title (Evangeline Lilly) feels weirdly sidelined.We also get to meet Kang the Conqueror, the adversary that's supposed to tie all of these increasingly disjointed movies together. Inevitably, numerous plot/lore questions arise. (""Is this the Kang that the Variant in Loki warned of, or is there a more terrible version yet?"") All the same, Jonathan Majors steals the whole show and the menace of Kang is mostly felt (making us believe he may indeed prove to be scarier than Thanos -- though I would've preferred that Kang was first discovered by Doctor Strange or something; not someone who's always functioned as the chief ""regular bloke"" of the Avengers).His Quantum Realm empire, while ugly, is shot (and designed -- see the various microscopic lifeforms made titanic) in such a way that it actually feels both epic and minuscule at the same time; a Jules Verne-inspired lost world that's vast, yet too imperceptibly small to be explored by normal humans. I feel like Michelle Pfeiffer's character owes a better explanation for why none of this was mentioned after she escaped the Realm in the previous film, but hey, what do ya do?Quantumania is at points fun -- giving me hope that we are indeed building towards something spectacular, FOR REAL THIS TIME -- but largely, it's just ""another one""; a film that could've been truly out there, but wasn't permitted to stray too far from the Kevin Feige vision.One complaint viewers had about the MCU back in the day was that, while it was still full of snappy dialogue and drama-deflating jokes on the one hand, it often also tried too hard to seem grounded on the other hand, like they were still afraid to embrace the comic-book silliness and instead tried to find ways to make these characters seem halfway ""real"" -- often by making the costumes look less fantastical/colorful or having ""self-aware"" comments about the ridiculousness of it all. What's appealing, to some people, about everything post-Infinity War is that the movies dare introduce all kinds of comic-book madness, but most Phase Four films' version of ""being sillier"" is having characters become dopes.And the movies do still exhibit that same self-consciousness. This isn't like RRR, which is even more balls-to-the-wall insane than the Marvel films but also has characters that take their own universe seriously, resulting in a movie that's both funnier and more dramatically effective. If you wanna go see Quantumania, go see it, but the unusually low ratings thus far tell me I'm not alone in feeling a bit weary and that the proverbial Superhero Fatigue is finally here. If you want to be on the safe side, I recommend just staying at home and popping on RRR. Or the previous Puss in Boots film if you wanna see how the side-villain MODOK got his acting industry start when he portrayed Humpty-Dumpty.Funny side-note: In the movie, we see that Lang's career with the Avengers has led to a life of luxury and stardom, making it all the more strange that Falcon has to deal with financial issues and Dhar Mann-tier racist cop archetypes in his own show. Don't yell at me; I'm not saying it's bad when you contribute to a piece of world-building yet elect to change its rules in accordance with a Message™. I'm just saying ""Ah, that's our post-Endgame MCU. May you one day be as chaotic as the DC-verse!""","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed this movie, which was surprising as it seems to be getting lambasted by critics and audiences alike. And on one hand, I can understand; people are getting superhero fatigue, and Ant-Man never was the most popular character out there. On the other hand, this third entry in the ""Ant-Man"" series of films is a science-fiction adventure that I, for one, couldn't get enough of.If you're a fan of straight up sci-fi, I honestly can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this movie; virtually from beginning to end, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an exercise in engaging world building and incredible visuals - on a purely visual aspect this movie is a 10 out of 10; the movie takes viewers through a world - a universe - that is so interesting to look at that I found myself almost jaw-dropped for 90% of this film's runtime. But of course, great visuals can only take a movie so far.Luckily, ""Quantumania"" delivers on pretty much every other aspect as well. With fantastic chemistry between its main characters, the film is a sheer delight to watch in terms of characterization and character interaction. Paul Rudd is charismatic as usual, but I was even more impressed with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton; you'd think the ridiculous subject matter would lead to ridiculous performances, but they're all bringing their A-game here, which was unexpected but appreciated. Now I know what you're thinking: ""How was Jonathan Majors?"" Let's talk about it.Introducing a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania"" is apparently setting up the next biggest Marvel baddie. And while I found Kang to have a lot of potential, I wasn't particularly impressed with his villainy here, as much as I enjoyed Majors in the role. While Majors adds a cold menace to the character, I found a lot of Kang's dialogue to be trite and evil for the sake of being evil. While his initial introduction is more nuanced, the film foregoes that, and instead makes the character extremely one dimensional. That said, I did feel as if he was a worthy enough opponent in this movie, and I am interested to see the future development of this character.If you're going to see an MCU movie, you most likely care about the action; while ""Quantumania"" didn't have a ton of action in it (the movie focuses more on adventure than action), the action it did have satisfied me. While the action is extremely CGI heavy for the most part, I found it exciting in its sci-fi centricity - it really felt like I was watching a ""Star Trek"" movie, and while some people may not like that, I absolutely loved it.Overall, I had a fantastic time with this movie. Audiences seem to be turning on Ant-Man and on the MCU in general, but I found this to be a refreshing take on the genre with its emphasis on pure science-fiction adventure. You may not enjoy this as much as I did, but if you're a Marvel fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

While the first two Antman films had a great balance of action and comedy, Quantumania seemed to rely too heavily on tired jokes and gags that were predictable and uninspired. The film's attempts at humor felt forced, and I found myself cringing more than laughing.Additionally, the visual effects were lackluster, especially considering this is a Marvel movie. The CGI felt cheap and cartoonish, and it was hard to believe that the characters were actually interacting with their surroundings.Finally, the performances were lackluster. Even the usually great Paul Rudd couldn't save this movie, and the other actors seemed to be phoning in their performances as well.Overall, Antman and The Wasp: Quantumania was a huge disappointment.

Sequences in the movie seems to have been put randomly.And entire graphical experience is quite boring with only focus on colorful and flash display.Tye Avengers movies always seems to have so much punch. Character seem to be so committed. But to be the ant-man somehow has never been as thriking.Also, not sure why they show the Villian to lose out many times. I mean, multiple times you wonderful if the villian is just created to look strong but hardly can show off much. Characters seem to easy outclass him.The story line needs to be better. Wish they made a better movie hope they take out the old actors. Time for some revamp.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Marvel's recent releases haven't been fan-tastic and this is (another) missed opportunity to knock this movie out of the park. Tiring. Disney/Marvel have been trying to grow the franchise too quickly without larger storyline integration but rather a focus on actors and new characters... leaves the audience confused, story line disjointed and disconnected across media.Story and writing was awful. Jokes were childish (really, don't be a dick?). Needs to be believable and Cassie's character not. Felt like borrowed creative ideas from Star Wars (bar & fight scenes) and Shark Boy & Lavagirl (MODOK). Graphics failed miserably w recent release of Avatar Way of Water and even Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness.Really, Kang and all of his identities are frightened by Ant Man killing Kang in one realm... when they have the ability to prune and change the (one) timeline? Seems like a simple fix. Kang needs a worthy opponents in multiple realms... America Chavez, Dr Strange, Scarlet Witch, even Thanos, and could bring back Iron Man, Capt America & Black Widow. I dunno, Kang threat should be the combined result of Loki, Thanos, and other accidental/planned occurrences... across different realms. One where Thanos wins, kills Kang in that realm, and causes vengeance from other realms. Another where Tony Stark brings back banished Kang to Quantum realm after he was killed by other Kang's. Scarlett Witch tampered w realms which had larger causal effects to slang. You get the idea.Where are the innovative and creative writers at Disney/Marvel that can write an engaging, innovative and very creative plot and intertwined storyline around Marvel characters? Present your absolute BEST work, not mediocre!Sorry, movie only okay to watch on streaking service. Visuals and sound didn't warrant a theatre experience. Hugely disappointed.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The humor is genuine and not forced, Ant-Man finally shows some guts, and we finally get another Marvel villain that is as interesting and as complex as Thanos. After Endgame, Marvel truly let Bob Chapek drop the ball as the Disney CEO. Seemingly immediately after pushing him out, Marvel is back at making great movies that people want to see. I now only have high hopes for the release of Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and the next phase of Marvel. The only thing left to say is, if you want to continue seeing great movies like this, go support them, and let the studios know when you're not interested in half baked films.","19 out of 51 found this helpful.

The weapon, ships, goofy variety of aliens species all felt like they were straight out of a bad corporate Star Wars movie. You know the exact type..Kang is a big let down also, he doesn't feel like a bigger than thanos level threat. I don't think the actor is that great at the role either. Iv seen his portrayal of a different kang in Loki as well and I didn't think it was that good.Definitely not the win marvel / Disney were looking for in this one. Another forgettable movie to close phase 4. This was a movie that should have been on the same level as at least captain America civil war. This should have been a huge movie to set up kang as a character and the next phase, that's why I'm giving a 4/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Many to anticipate for that one in the future. M. O. D. O. K steals the show, check. Every time he's on screen you'll have at least a little giggle. It is very ""star wars""-like, check. It's a movie about a conqueror stuck in a quantum realm filled with quantum people, you connect the dots. Michelle Pfeifer and Katherine Newton live up the movie, check. They are refreshments and they look-like they've been hanging around in the MCU from the very start.So all of those are good things. Even on top of that, it's an every routine Ant-Man movie, where Paul Rudd is funny, heist things are cooking-up, he grows big, he turns small, full of smacking and kicking, and that just adds up the fun. There are no need to worry about anything turning bitter and hateful. Just go to the movies and throw your money at it.

I think they could have push the violence up a little more. I'm hoping they cover Kang a little more so fans that don't know him as much, can really learn who is and why he is the way he is.

Why? Above all it simply lacked the fun of the first two Ant-Man movies. But besides that, Ant-Man ( like Spider-Man) works best on a ""Street Level"" instead of the realm where you found Kang ( Jonathan Majors). As for Kang, there is nothing that stood out with him. He is not all powerful like Thanos, nor do you hate him like Dr. Doom or Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Speaking of Kang's realm, it was far too dark ( as in the photography). Now I like Black and White movies ( especially Film Noir), but not for superhero movies ( unless it is necessary like with Batman or Dr. Strange). Is there anything I liked? Yes the very opening and closing scenes with Scott Lang ( Paul Rudd). They were well done and reminded me of the earlier Ant-Man films. For those scenes I give the movie a generous grade of 2/10 stars. Overall a major disappointment. No wonder it failed at the box office.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So, if you haven't watched any of those, how could this movie make any sense to you? I don't think many of these people who gave poor reviews have any clue as to what they were watching because they haven't seen anything in the Phase 4 Disney+ marvel universe! Get a grip and start watching some of those Disney+ TV series! Then this film will make more sense. The CGI was great, the villain Kang was given more development, and the writer, who is new to the MCU by the way, did an amazing job exploring this level of the multiverse. It's going to be interesting to see how the micro and the macro multiverse's interact and intersect (I hope this is where this is going). So, watch Loki on Disney+ and allow the story to unfold. I want to point out that people need to watch the Guardians shorts before the next film releases so as to better understand what's going on.

And a lot of it does here. The creativity involved in bringing this fantasy world to life is genuinely impressive as it delivers the right amount of flashy, surreal visuals and bizarre characters. Director Peyton Reed understood that this Quantum Realm had to feel like nothing else in the MCU and his mission is somewhat accomplished.Unfortunately, this universe has the bad luck of feeling rather similar to the ""space between universes"" we saw recently in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, especially since it also involves a bunch of confused actors running on treadmills in front of green screens, which appears to be the norm now over at Marvel headquarters. They throw a bit of wind in there, to make it feel like something, but these are hollow, textureless places you never believe for one second.This third Ant-Man movie is a perfect example of everything that's charming yet also disappointing about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For all the inventive stuff you see in this film, there's just as many things that take you out of the experience entirely. The cast, for one, mostly seems lost in this wild and wacky story. Framing the film in a tongue-in-cheek way with Paul Rudd's hero flat-out claiming his life ""makes no sense"", thereby warning you about what's to come, was a good move as it assures us that the film is in on the joke. However, the tonal shifts throughout the film both underlines its comedic framing and clumsily bumps headfirst against it.Paul Rudd, when he's given a chance to let loose and troll the film a little bit, looks like he's having a great time. But as Ant-Man he is criminally bland. Rudd ends up feeling miscast as a character that badly needed to be fleshed-out since his first film but wasn't. I want to like and ""get"" Scott Lang but he is such a void that all I end up seeing is a very uncomfortable Paul Rudd who wishes he was literally anywhere else but is doing his best regardless. In fact, everyone in this film does try very hard, I'll give them credit. As Lang's daughter Cassie, Kathryn Newton has a big role and, despite the often dire lines she's given to work with, she tries to deliver each of them with the earnestness and energy needed. Same goes for Jonathan Majors.Majors clearly worked hard on trying to give this bad guy role a bit more weight and eccentricity - something to make Marvel's frankly odd investment in the character feel worthwhile. Yet even his genuine efforts can't make Kang interesting or intimidating in any way. The villain finds himself desperately clawing at every scene he's in in the hope of moving or shocking the audience in some way but he is completely overshadowed by the hilariously misguided yet captivating M. O. D. O. K. (a returning Corey Stoll) who makes his live-action debut here. Obviously, this was always going to be a tough character to make happen convincingly in a film like this but, even though his design is ugly as sin and nowhere near as creepy and repulsive as he could/should have been, he remains a lot of fun and the effect is impossible to look at without smiling.Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas seem tragically baffled in this movie as their main contribution involves a lot of exposition spouting and pretending to look around at their green screen surroundings like they're seeing something truly amazing or walking through an Alice In Wonderland-style forest. Everyone's reaction to M. O. D. O. K. Is priceless, however, so they at least nailed this part! Oh, and the less said about Bill Murray's awkward cameo the better - though, admittedly, his exit from the movie is funny.And, really, that's what saves Quantumania: it's funny. A lot of the time on purpose, a lot of the time accidentally. But, you know, sometimes funny is just... funny. And I'll take that over this movie's horrible attempts at conveying real emotions and tackling serious themes while there's a dude with a BROCCOLI HEAD just walking around saying stuff. There's that tone shift again! This is, to be completely honest, one of the most ludicrous films ever made and, for that reason, you gotta watch it. The visuals are a trip, the mess of it all is a beautiful trainwreck, yet it's also actually good sometimes: the ""drink the ooze"" sequence is worthy of a Rick & Morty episode, crossed with something Taika Waititi would come up with (which might annoy some viewers further, granted).Like I said: you gotta watch this movie. It set out to be an unapologetically wild experience and it definitely is that. Part-Star Wars spoof, part-Fantastic Voyage, there's still heist stuff in there somehow, the Baskin Robbins guy is back, characters multiply like cells... it is relentlessly ridiculous, occasionally awful/brilliant and, though some will hate it with a passion, some will no doubt appreciate its refusal to make any sense at all for the sake of pure, brainless entertainment.A really fun bit of weirdness.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The sequel had much better spectacle - it was genuinely stunning at times; it's nearly enough to let me ignore the heavy Flanderization of all of our established characters. Now we have the third movie, and somehow we've ended up with the worst of both worlds.The characters have lost all sense of individuality and urgency that they had in the first film, or what little of it they had back then. The ensemble plays off as that of a mid-day American sitcom, and not one of the ones that anybody really emjoys sitting down and watching actively. Full scenes dedicated to Scott's asides are not even the least bit funny as every joke is incredibly obvious and surface-level, oddly sandwiching the film with an incredibly cringe-worthy opening and ending that feel entirely useless. I don't think I have been so disengaged with any piece of media since I saw The Emoji Movie, though there are some sequences where this film at least creeps up to just being plain bad rather than abusively lazy. Scott has pics taken with peoples' dogs, he gets mistaken for Spider-Man, and he has a Hollywood-style panic attack that ends in an anti-climax that thinks it's much funnier than it is. These are the most memorable bits of the story due to their placement at the most crucial sections of the film, and that plays a huge role in sinking this movie's rating for me. It's like they wanted to numb viewers going into the film's first act, and then Sucker Punch them right at the end. This film is creative anaesthesia.Somehow, with so much special effects and so much money dumped into it, this film manages to be the ugliest film in all of the MCU. I'm sure the special effects actually made the film worse. They spent countless resources ruining their sub-par film to turn it into one of the worst films I've seen in years. M. O. D. O. K. Is shocking; there was a time when Marvel was churning out visually stunning films back-to-back. Even if the other elements of the films were lacking, you could at least rely on popcorn entertainment, but not here. For the first time in the MCU I'm replused by the special effects more often than not - this was trending with some underbaked effects in Black Panther and Black Widow, but I didn't expect it to get to this point so quickly. This feels more like a low-budget TV film managing to seem bigger than it should be through clever effects, but it's a huge big-budget Hollywood film that's crippled by sloppy effects and messy environments through the vast majority of the film. I can only imagine this is due to a lack of cohesive, or decent, artistic direction; the incredibly poor money management on display here is insulting. I've never seen a better example of how bloated film budgets are on the verge of destroying the film industry as a whole, and by this point I'm almost hoping for it to happen already. After the pandemic we just got out of, the last thing we need are thousands of unincredible films that think they're worth our time. At a certain point I just have to say enough is enough and file for a divorce from corporate films.Quantumania turns the infinitesimal quantum realm into a busy mess nearly as sloppy as its slapdash script.I guess the team behind Quantumania just didn't quite understand what ""less is more"" really means.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Despite having high hopes for this film, it ultimately falls flat in almost every aspect.First and foremost, the storyline feels convoluted and poorly executed. The plot jumps around without clear direction, making it difficult to fully invest in the narrative. It seems as though the writers tried to incorporate too many subplots and ideas, resulting in a messy and confusing mess. The film fails to create a coherent and engaging story that keeps the audience hooked.Furthermore, the character development in Quantumania is sorely lacking. Scott Lang (Ant-Man) and Hope van Dyne (Wasp) feel one-dimensional and lack any substantial growth. Even the addition of new characters, such as Kang the Conqueror, fails to bring any depth or complexity to the overall cast. The performances are lackluster, and the dialogue feels forced and unnatural, making it difficult to connect with the characters on an emotional level.The action sequences, which were a highlight in the previous Ant-Man films, are underwhelming and unimpressive in Quantumania. The choreography lacks creativity and fails to deliver the excitement and thrill one would expect from a superhero film. The visual effects are subpar, and the use of CGI feels excessive and artificial, further detracting from the overall experience.Additionally, the humor that was a trademark of the Ant-Man franchise falls flat in this installment. The jokes and comedic timing feel forced and stale, resulting in awkward and cringe-worthy moments that simply do not land. The attempts at levity only serve to highlight the film's overall lack of substance and quality.Lastly, the pacing of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is uneven and disjointed. The film drags on during certain scenes, making it difficult to maintain interest, while rushing through others, leaving important plot points unresolved. The lack of proper pacing further contributes to the overall disappointment of the movie.In conclusion, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania fails to live up to its potential. With a convoluted storyline, weak character development, underwhelming action sequences, unfunny humor, and uneven pacing, this sequel falls far short of its predecessor. Fans of the Ant-Man franchise and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole will likely be left disappointed and unsatisfied.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Here's another saving the world. It's so empty that I think: Isn't the time when Marvel TOP was gone? It's not just the problem of the last Ant-Man, but of the entire Multiverse saga. Doctor Strange 2 was rushed, Thor became a parody of himself, and the third Ant-Man became another world-saving figure of the dozen. Where is the difference? Hell, the first Ant-Mans were about family and self-righteousness and didn't need another intergalactic threat. And even Doctor Strange 2 and Thor 4 (although it didn't really suit me) had at least some author's imprint. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, on the other hand, is the essence of cinematic emptiness. The only really good projects from the Multiverse saga so far are Loki, WandaVision and Spider-Man: No Way home.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Certain episodes of 'Loki' show it very well and 'Dr Strange in the Multiverse' is reasonably good. However, this mix of the quantum realm, multiverse, introduction of numerous characters, continuous sci-fi/action and frequent switching from comedy to drama results in a bit of spectacle-driven mess.Thankfully actors like Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfieffer, Michael Douglas, Kathryn Newton, and Evangeline Lilly manage to elevate the script to an entertaining level with their performances.Visually it contains some great imaginative designs within the quantum realm, but I'm not sure if it compliments the best aspects of the Ant-Man and Wasp characters. Seeing them shrink and grow in real world environments like San Francisco provides endless fun, but in this setting it is not the same.The humour is hit and miss for me, done in that self aware Marvel style that attempts to develop dramatic moments only to shoot them down with various quips that make it all feel like a pointless exercise. It also badly misses some of the supporting characters seen in the previous movies like Luis, Kurt, Jimmy Woo, and Paxton.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Also, at times the special effects looked off and fake, but they did look colourful which I liked. Additionally, the comedy this time around felt flat too, I found the previous movies humorous but this one just didn't hit anything. But on the plus side, the post-credit scene was interesting and the post-post-credit scene gives Loki season 2 hopefully.

WandaVision was decent but disappointing by the end. No Way Home was pretty good. Guardians 3 was quite good. The rest have all been somewhere between okay and horrible. Most of it mediocre or just really bad. Quantumania unfortunately continues that trend. It's quite bad.Part of the problem is that it tries to do too much, but in a rushed, lazy and unearned way. That's the key word perhaps: unearned. It tries to have all these big epic moments, heartfelt moment, action spectacle, comedy, etc., but none of it feels earned. In contrast, Infinity War and Endgame were fan service, but carefully constructed, patient, creative fan service.Jonathan Majors is much better here than in Loki, which is literally my least favourite performance I've ever seen in anything. I'm not kidding. It was so over-the-top and random, so frivolous. But here, at least Kang seems more patient and menacing. If he's a conqueror who's been around for hundreds of years, or whatever, he should be very calm, confident and perhaps strange - who wouldn't go a bit weird after so long? Majors is a highlight of the movie, though still not that great - the standard is so low for the rest of the movie.Most of the characters either do nothing or are unlikable. Ant Man's daughter was so cute in the first two movies and their dynamic felt very warm, natural and funny. The kind of silly stuff we remember from early childhood. Dad just being funny and clever all the time. But now I couldn't stand her character. She just seems so bossy and sassy for no reason. She's a genius, which is now a cliche in the MCU. It wasn't earned. At least Stark took a while to develop his gear.Some of the action and visuals are okay. It's mildly entertaining. Some of the CGI is impressive, I guess, but I didn't care much. Actually, the music was pretty decent which was a surprise. But it's a bit like polishing a turd, you know?MODOK looked pretty stupid without his mask, but then I guess he would look pretty stupid in real life anyway. Maybe it's not bad CGI, but just too weird for us to accept. He did look kind of cool with his mask on and the deep voice. It felt like a wasted opportunity though.The movie tried its best to build up MODOK and Kang and some parts were a little bit exciting or cool. But not much. The plot is just too messy. Nobody communicates properly, especially Pfeiffer's character. She keeps everything a secret, because the script says so, but then is forced to reveal things later, when it's too late. It's just frustrating.Paul Rudd is likable as always, but doesn't get to do all that much. He's a side character in his own movie. And he lacks much purpose. He's largely overshadowed by the older Pyms, his daughter, his girlfriend and ants. The ants also felt underused. And I missed Rudd's old friends from the earlier movies. They were funny and likable. The ant playing drums was hilarious. This movie feels empty by comparison.Some of the quirky characters were sort of interesting but went nowhere. There are no consequences and the world makes no sense so it's hard to care. It's just anything goes without any proper world-building. Instead of 20 different species/groups, pick one or two and make them compelling. Give their world some kind of structure and purpose.Murray's cameo was alright but didn't change much. None of the movie was really outright terrible, just lame, messy and by-the-numbers. Some lines were just awful though. And some of the plot contrivances were really predictable and uninspired.I enjoyed some of the movie a bit. Kang's character has a lot of potential. But they barely make use of it. This could have been great - Ant Man being a humble and funny character, against an epic new time-traveling villain. But it's mostly a failure. With decent music and a big budget but horrible writing and unpleasant characters. Oh well.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Less so in the 2nd film and ends up looking like any futuristic CGI alien planet in the MCU in Quantumania, albeit some quirky characters and plantlife- Avatar has done that much better, and to death I feel.The last 3rd of the film totally lost my interest, I guess if I was much younger and less jaded it would be fun but I think probably not...the big bad dood was ok, faceless disposable cohorts dull, action was the usual seen before parade of technical proficiency but not much new...sorry I fell tired remembering the mediocrity of this disappointing nonsense.

Honestly? We came away with feelings as mixed as a quantum entanglement. Yes, it offered some chuckles and kept us mildly entertained, but it lacked that special something that makes a Marvel movie, well, a Marvel movie.The direction of the movie felt slightly off-kilter. While the action was present, it didn't deliver the same punch as previous Marvel films. We missed the awe-inspiring moments we've come to expect. The visual effects, unfortunately, appeared to have fallen victim to budget constraints, pulling us out of the story and diluting the otherwise fantastical elements of the quantum realm.We were also perplexed by the sudden inclusion of humans in the quantum realm. The movie offered little explanation for this development, leaving us, the audience, to grapple with the narrative incoherence.Honestly, the movie felt like it had more in common with Sharkboy and Lava Girl than your typical Marvel movie. Don't get me wrong, there's a time and place for senseless fun, but we found ourselves missing a well thought out, logical storyline.Comparatively, it's certainly more enjoyable than Thor: Love and Thunder (not a high bar to clear, in our opinion), but falls short of The Eternals' quality. It sits more comfortably alongside Black Widow in terms of overall enjoyment and narrative strength.All in all, while Quantumania did offer some light-hearted family entertainment, it failed to deliver the engaging cinematic experience we were anticipating. I wouldn't rush to recommend it, unless you've exhausted your other movie options. It's a reasonable choice for a casual watch, but don't expect to be blown away.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

However instead it was a series of incidents where very rarely did the characters react to their environment in a way that any normal human would, as this really takes you out of the film.Jeff Loveness the script writer chosen by Disney executives ( yet another jump on the bandwagon Rick & Morty TV series writer who just joined a successful TV show after it had already become successful ) clearly has no clue how to write for a big budget super hero movie.Why does the Disney executives keep picking the wrong people to direct & write scripts? ( it is like they actually want Marvel to fail ).Stan Lee & Larry Lieber wrote these characters not for children, but as real life characters that had super hero abilities thrust upon them but for some reason Disney think of these characters as ""childish"" so they hire people they think will write for ""children"". When will they realise not only do adults not want to watch movies written specifically for a child but guess what children are not dumb either & they understand a lot more than adults ( such as Disney executives ) give them credit for.Everyone ( children + adults ) want scripts that start of with intrigue, then through a series of events where people act in a logical & more importantly believable way get you to the pay off at the end of the film.The journey should be its own reward, because of what you learn.In this film you learn absolutely nothing of value, as it is pointless.The most important part of any film generally are the story arcs & also the character arcs where the characters actually learn & grow from their experiences along with the audience watching ( whether that be moral lessons or just learning more about the Marvel universe IN A BELIEVABLE WAY for future film interest, however Disney executives choose the wrong directors & even worse the wrong writers so have absolutely destroyed phase 4 as character arcs make little sense ).THIS ANT MAN 3 FILM ( A. M. A. T. W. Q. ) simply needs to be forgotten about as I feel so bad for the actor Jonathan Majors whose character is Kang the Conqueror, as this should have been his huge blockbuster hit. I think he makes a really good Kang & has potential as phase 4 needs to be written off mostly however keep the actors who deserve it. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeiffer are all huge stars ( who have proved many times they are fantastic actors ) so please Disney give them Directors & script writers they deserve who actually understand how a story should develop.The most important thing about any film is the story makes sense, then the story has to be interesting & hopefully it will also give you insight. You let the audience decide what they take from the film themselves.Each character has to act & react to each scene in a believable way or there needs to be dialogue ( or action ) that makes sense to make each scene potentially believable to maintain the audience suspension of disbelief, as they the audience will ride with you & the story telling so long as the writer & director can keep the story in the realms of truth.There was far too many scenes in this poor film where characters did not act in a way which as an audience member you would expect them to do so. This completely takes the audience out of the film & ruins the experience for them, as you can't believe in what you are watching.Kathryn Newton is a young actress with potential who's character Cassie Lang obviously has flaws thinking for example it is OK to go beyond peaceful protesting against the police ( doing their job & following the law ) by moving homeless people on from their choice of living illegally. As it is good the young character wants to live in a better world however harassing the police is not fair as they were doing their job so where is the character arc showing this character progression in this film ( it sends out the wrong message about how to protest as it is not the police's fault & they do not deserve their property vandalised ). At the end of the film Cassie Lang should have realised the police was not in the wrong ( for following the law ) & she should have apologised to the police officers after realising her initial views where far too simplistic & very young child-like ( naive ) in blaming them, as actually homelessness is a much more complex issue & the law keepers actually need better laws to uphold that would help the homeless. Thus she used her power against the wrong people so should learn from that as then we would see her character progression & becoming maturer.Cassie Lang could have made amends & learnt from her immaturity.However unfortunately the script writer was obviously too immature & thinks it is cool to blame the police ( which is not really helping anyone & in fact is putting negative messages out to the audience of this film ).Disney need to hire more intelligent, more mature & better script writers who actually have a social conscience & understand character arcs.( that was just one example where a character could have matured ).Another phase 4 Marvel I will not buy & will pretend was never made.The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the magnificent CGI ( + 1 star from base 1 star = 2 stars ) + ( another 1 star = 3 stars total for the great actors who did their best to save the film. As an awful director & dreadful screen writer ruined a big budget movie with lack of talent.MARVEL FILMS NEED TO BE WRITTEN FOR AN INTELLIGENT AUDIENCE ( as children & adults are mostly intelligent so they will search out the best films with the most intelligent scripts & after they see this Ant Man 3 film they will be put off future Disney productions ).Disney used to stand for quality storytelling, now it stands for lacklustre storytelling so it's time Disney fire the people responsible for hiring these dreadful directors & abysmal screen writers to rebuild Disney.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

There seems to be a LARGE nod to to Star Wars in this movie. And I have to agree with another reviewer who also said it appears to be written by fifth-graders.

"8","/10","Marvel hunkers down","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8899755/?ref_=tt_urv","NestorTheGreat","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54687345/?ref_=tt_urv","1 March 2023","Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Since this movie came out, I've seen two really excellent Marvel properties: Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I would've expected to absolutely hate this movie, as a result. Along with that, I've never really *loved* the Ant-Man films; they always represented the blandest, least interesting version of the MCU to me.So colour me surprised that...I didn't hate Quantumania. Let's get the bad out of the way: the effects are quite spotty, the environments very ugly, 3/5 of the main characters don't have much of a point to be in the movie, Kathryn Newton was objectively terrible in this movie, MODOK was a bit of a waste (and yes, he looked bad). The film's over-relies on CG and as a result, it FEELS like a static movie.All of that is valid. But for some reason (maybe I was in good spirits just seeing Across the Spider-Verse)...I actually enjoyed myself. There's a lot of good in this movie too: I thought the homage to 50s B-movies were really fun, the music was surprisingly excellent, the film played with some weird and interesting concepts (like the probability explosion) that led to some great set pieces. Kang (Jonathan Majors...for now, by this time everyone is aware of his legal issues) was a pretty compelling villain, although I don't think they did a particularly great job at explaining his motivations. His performance really saved the day.Paul Rudd is still pretty great as Ant-Man. Yes, he's basically playing himself, but it's fine. I don't know, this movie kept me engaged for most of it and maybe that's because I don't expect these movies to be groundbreaking time and time again. To me, it gave more interesting stuff that giant pez dispensers or Tonka trucks. I'm genuinely fine with the lack of Michael Peña and Bill Murray's weird cameo was one the best parts of the movie to me.Honestly, I think MCU fans and haters alike need to calm down. This was fine. Nothing amazing, nothing I'd run to watch again, but perfectly fine. The fact that people complain about this movie as if it's the worst thing they've ever seen, yet STILL give it a 6 or 7 is incredible to me.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The most interesting thing about it is how lazy and bad the whole thing is. I gave it a 4/10 but to be honest, even that feels a little gracious.Quantumania does one thing well, and that's its villain. Aside from Jonathan Major's strong performance as Kang the Conqueror, everything else failed to rise above mediocrity. The movie fails at what Ant-Man has always been best at, being funny. The jokes just don't work this time. I think the only time I chuckled was more from weirdness than actual good humor. I was fully expecting this to be a darker, more emotional movie than the previous two, but I felt nothing inside as I watched. There was no chemistry between the characters. None of their affection for each other was believable. At one point, Scott and Hope share an ""I love you"" moment, but it felt more awkward than sweet. And as for what Kathryn Newton brought to the character of Cassie, it made me wish they had never recast the character. I love a good father/daughter element in a movie but this one falls flat. As hard as the actors tried, Scott and Cassie come across more like strangers who are trying to care about each other.Almost everything in the movie felt forced and melodramatic. It's riddled with clichés. It's almost criminal how much they stole from other movies. The dialogue at times sounds straight up copied and pasted from other scripts. It's all so passionless and uninspired. It honestly feels like the goal was to get us well introduced to Kang and that nothing else really mattered. It seems to try to be as colorful and crazy as Guardians of the Galaxy, but it looks more like a Spy Kids movie. In other words, it's often visually cheesy. M. O. D. O. K is a prime example of this. His presence in the movie is just annoying. The ending of the film feels like a cop-out. Stuff just conveniently happens for them. I have my issues with Thor: Love and Thunder, but it at least entertained me. Quantumania is simply no fun.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ant man 3 stand out at only those parts where kang the conquerer present and some drama portions.Otherwise ant man 3 doesn't present any newness and especially its 1st half is very poor and unfunny at a time..and the main point for movie is it's continuation in MCU..If you are fan of MCU or you want to do followup then for than reason you can watch this film at once otherwise skip is the best option for this!!!

I feel like everyone was just wasted. The MCU is spending too much time on senseless humor instead of just giving us a good story with likeable characters. Though I very much like the main characters in the first two movies those same characters just didn't have that likeable vibe as in the previous two movies.The CGI reminded me way too much of Star Wars with a pinch of Avatar. Here's a question, when Thanos snapped his fingers, half of all life everywhere ceased to exist, why didn't it affect the quantum realm? Anyway, I only lasted an hour and I will be hesitant to try and finish the movie because I already know from reading other reviews that it won't get any better. Hope the MCU producers go back to what made these movies so popular.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was funny, it was very interesting, I like how they're building up the story and yet it's not going to be some huge monumental thing like Infinity War but if you just watch it for what it is it really is a great movie. The action was great I do think that it would be cool to have a little bit more of Kangs power shown but he was still awesome in the movie itself. If you get a chance definitely watch the Loki show it ties in with it a little bit. Stop putting movies on such a pedestal to be 10 at a tens just watch it for what they are and you'll enjoy them a lot more. I can't wait to see how much more kangs character evolves in the upcoming movies.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

The movie lacks its usual humorous tone, but this movie is supposed to be serious and it does that. There is no lag whatsoever and there is no unnecessary fillers. Also the post credits were unexpected. As a Marvel fan and movie goer, this was an enjoyable and a different experience from the rest of the MCU movies.

Does some seriousness hurt? I could not finish the movie, it was too boring and too dumb. Dumbed down to a maximum audience it seems. Situative humor is amazing, but not if it's the carrying string throught the whole cello sonata. Unfortunately, the urge to produce more Marvel content obviously leaves story and immersion behind.

Same for the action; although it's getting to be a bit cookie-cutter for Marvel movies, these days. No ""wow"" factor.For the not-so-good... this movie definitely seemed more aimed at kids than the vast majority of Marvel movies. Especially when compared to the classic modern Marvels, such as Captain America: Original Avenger, or the original Thor. The characters were more than a little thin. There was a certain character epiphany which came far too easily, without substance, or ability to empathize with the character (if you see the movie, you'll know which one I'm talking about). No real character development, or substance. The villain was stereotypical, with uninspired motivations. Only one ""hook"" made it interesting (but that will require other movies to explore)Let's not even get into the potential plot holes or pseudoscience.All in all, it's OK for a pastime movie to shut your brain off for a bit, and to know you've seen all the main Marvel installments.

I didn't hate this film, yet it wasn't without A LOT of problems.I originally watched this film when it first came out in theaters, and I actually liked where it was headed. Then I rewatched it at home and noticed more things that bothered me.I'll start off with the pros. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang is one of the best casting choices in Marvel in my opinion. He is funny, quick- witted and so genuine. I also loved Jonathan Majors as Kang. His subtle yet terrifying preformance is breathtaking. I feel as both gave their best shot with the script they got. There is one scene in particular with both of them that I really loved towards the ending, but I won't spoil it here. Unfortunately, that's about it.Now for the cons. The plot was simple enough to follow and the narrative that carried all through the film was obvious and lazy in my opinion. The narrative being a family with many problems and secrets that overcome them by the events they experience in the Quantum realm. I think a film like this, with characters that have huge potential not only for a solid story, but for the future of the MCU is just wasted on another attempt to make a goofy comedy film. We finally got to meet M. O. D. O. K, this menacing character from the comics. Instead, we got a big headed baby named Darren. I like Corey Stoll. I have seen him in a few different projects where he gives a solid performance. Hell, I think he was wonderful in the first Ant-Man.Cassy Lang, played by Kathryn Newton was alright. A few lines she had were kind of cringe for me, but overall she had some jokes that landed and the dynamic between her and Scott was good. For the rest of the family being Hope, Hank and Janet, I just didn't see any relevance for them to be in the Quantum Realm with Scott and Cassy.The CGI in here was pretty bad. I feel like the more the MCU evolved, the less passion was put to the technical side of making the film. The effects are just downgraded to the point where one has to question what year was this film made? Maybe it's because other films today set such a high bar that it's hard to compete against.This film to me was wasted talent and potential. Wasted of wonderful actors and interesting characters. This industry should really take a step back and prioritize their goals. Stop enforcing movies that set up a future universe and focus on telling an impelling story.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jonathan Majors was outstanding and proved himself worthy of anchoring a whole movie franchise reprising the character Kang the Conquerer. Paul Rudd pulled off an above-average performance as well.

Let's begin with the basics, a total waste of characters. There was no development, no arcs, and above all, zero stakes. The reintroduction of Kang the Conqueror, an already established character, was extremely poor.Script-wise, the choice of just telling things and entire plotlines, instead of showing them, was extremely hurtful for the overall story and for the greater understanding of the impact Kang has on the wide Marvel Cinematic Universe.The visuals of this film, from start to finish, were outdated, even from decade-old films. The overuse of the Volume was obvious, and when they switched to a green screen the blend between characters and CGI was awful.The only memorable things from the entire movie were the soundtrack and the post-credit scenes.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I haven't seen a Marvel movie in a while and really only went to go take my nephews to see it. As most have said, Kang is only positive in this but he's not nearly enough to save the film.Writing was terrible, plat was incoherent, the jokes are just way too flat and the activist daughter, Cassie, is just insufferable. Of course Disney has to insert politics and also included an insanely awkward plug for Socialism towards the end. JUST STOP. Overall I don't see myself getting sucked back into the MCU again, if anything after seeing this I'm probably not spending another penny on seeing any these again, it's just not entertaining.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

The quantum universe wasn't bad, but plenty of cgi wasn't enjoyable to watch either. Acting was ok. I think Jonathan Majors played very well. But Kang was known as the new Tanos. I don't think it's the right decision. The character should have been written better. Kathryn Newton is introduced as the new Cassie. But I don't understand why the previous Emma Fuhrmann was not filmed. Kathryn Newton was no better. I mean, her acting was bad and I didn't like the character at all.

"5","/10","Now this isn't an Avengers Level Threat...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8879261/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2023","Who would've thought that a hero called ""Ant-Man"" would succeed in a trilogy? I massively enjoyed the first one but found the second one to be quite forgettable. I loved the idea of smaller stake stories for Ant-Man films. It was a little surprising to hear that Ant-Man 3 would have bigger stakes as I didn't find this to suit the character. Is this a good entry for the little guy or quantum garbage?The greatest highlight of this film is the antagonist, Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is fearsome and menacing with a terrific performance by Jonathan that reminds me of Darth Vader. He steals the show in every scene, to the point that I was actually rooting for him. I am also glad that his performance is vastly different to the variant we saw in the Loki (2021) show. I can't wait to see more of Kang in the future! In terms of performance, I also enjoyed seeing more of Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne. She was barely in the second Ant-Man film but here she is front and centre. She shines in her performance and perfectly illustrates the guilt and fear her character is experiencing. Paul Rudd is still charming and charismatic as Scott Lang. His relationship with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is still the main core of his character. We get to see 'some' serious moments with his character which was nice to see.Another thing I liked was the overall design of the Quantum Realm. The world and the living beings in the Quantum Realm were interesting. It had a very Star Wars/Mad Max feel to it with the blend of sci-fi, deserts and alien-like creatures. The 3rd act of the movie is also quite entertaining. For the most part, it's a giant CGI battle with lots of things happening on screen but it is fun to watch. I especially loved seeing Kang in action because we get to see how much of a beast he is compared to previous villains.However, the writing is very weak. There are a lot of silly dialogues that just made me roll my eyes. It doesn't help that for some reason Marvel is still doing forced unnecessary humour. If this story is meant to be higher stakes then make it serious! The quips get overly repetitive. The first half is a little dull too with minimal interesting things happening. It doesn't take until over halfway through the movie to actually see Kang. Additionally, the ending was disappointing. It is very bland and safe which is a shame as this film could've delivered a shocking and memorable ending. This movie is also meant to build up hype for the next Avengers film but that ending fails to do even that.MODOK is also in this film and it is a pointless addition. Not only do they change the character completely from their comic counterpart, but their role in the story is also absolutely irrelevant. Could take them out of the story and nothing will change. Despite the film being called Ant-Man and the Wasp, both Scott Lang and Hope feel like side characters in their own film. They have no character development and are just kind of there for the ride. Janet is more of a main character than them. I also don't like this trend in these recent Marvel films of Marvel characters looking out for these young characters. Cassie is the next in this trend and is also an annoying character like many of them before. I think Kathryn Newton is fine in her role but her character just isn't written well to be likeable enough for me to care. This is also a very CGI-heavy film and for the most part, it is okay but there are definitely times when it looks rough. The editing, especially during action sequences, can be really bad. They tend to do too many quick cuts during action sequences and for some reason use the shaky cam in 2023!Overall, Ant-Man 3 is a bit disappointing. There was a lot of potential for this to be something great but the execution is quite poor. This isn't a great start to Phase 5 and I am getting worried about the future of the MCU. They need to do a better job at making people hyped for the next Avengers-level threat as this film isn't making me think this is a threat equal to or better than Thanos. I'm hoping future Marvel films start building up this new threat because they need to show us that this new threat is worthy of our attention.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Their attempts at emotion wasn't believable in word or action. I get more emotion in 1 minute of a Taylor Sheridan show than this whole movie. The comedy also fell flat most of the time, with only a few chuckles. I love all the actors, Rudd, Douglas, Pfeiffer, Lilly, but they all seem to be phoning in their characters. The villains were disappointing, lots of talk about how bad they were, but they failed to prove it in any real action. So overall this failure is on the writer, who didn't provide words for the actors and the director who did a great job on the first 2 Ant-man films, but was too lazy to get any emotion out of his actors.I still gave it 5 starts, because the production value was still top notch.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a result, many of the characters were constantly being reinvented in front of the viewers eyes.Actors performances were phenomenal, creating so much familiarity with the characters that if viewers were to meet the performers in real-life, they'd be surprised if the actors personalities and mannerisms bore little resemblance to their character counterparts.Character dynamics were interesting to explore as enough has happened inbetween appearances that gave writers much to toy with. You get to reexplore previous dynamics that have since monumentally shifted creating inner conflicts, emotional resolutions and funny encounters through the duration of the movie.The antagonists were well written such that the viewers could see at all points the power-scalings determining the outcome of this David and Goliath storyline. At any given scene you were reminded of who held the power in that scene, and equally, who was at the mercy of others choices.The movie kept as constant feeling of wonder and awe whilst also remaining amusing and comedic throughout. In addition to brilliant quips and jokes that were appropriately timed, the viewer's were made to feel on edge at all times as if being revealed the last card of the river at a high stakes poker game where two players have the potential for royal flushes. A constant air of suspense loomed over the movie allowing the audience to question whether this was the end multiple times.Well written and performed even better, this movie has to come in as one of the better superhero movies in past years.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

They're basically making Antman/Scott Lang look like a chump here, just to elevate his daughter Cassie to a generic, whiny girlboss. Hope doesn't have much to do in the film except in the climax, while Dr. Hank Pym looks absolutely bored. The whole film rides on two people really: Janet (Pfeiffer) and Kang (Majors). And frankly, between the two, I did not enjoy Majors' performance in this (he was fantastic in Creed III). I understand that one film isn't enough to build a supervillain, but Marvel surely knew how to do things better before. Kang seems to lack a definite purpose (other than the hunger for power) in annexing the multiverse, as opposed to Thanos who had a valid reason.The worst bits of writing go to Cassie Lang (Newton) who's only good at making her dad look bad (even when he was pivotal in overturning the Blip) in the present, and doing stupid things like sending signals to bad guys in the Quantum Realm. The CGI is a mess, and makes you wonder why the studio spent $ 200 million to create such a bizarre-looking film. Also, why explain major plot-points in a matter of seconds whereas entire scenes are wasted in the name of uninspiring humour? Interest levels in the MCU continue to wane, with this entry being one of the worst they've come up with thus far.P. S - M. O. D. O. K can go suck on a toe!P. P.

Despite a promising concept, the movie is a bad product of Marvel that falls short in many aspects.One of the major disappointments of the movie is the way it mishandles MODOK, a villain that has been known for his dangerous and powerful nature in the comics. Instead of portraying him as a formidable foe, the movie turns him into a comedic element, stripping him of any real threat or intimidation factor. This decision leaves the audience feeling underwhelmed and robbed of the potential that this character had.Another letdown of the movie is its treatment of Kang, a character that could have been the highlight of the film. Unfortunately, the movie fails to use Kang's potential to its fullest extent, and he ultimately comes across as a bland and uninteresting villain.The plot of the movie feels disjointed and underdeveloped. The themes and tone of the movie lack depth and fail to resonate with the audience, leaving them feeling detached and disengaged from the story.The acting and characters are passable, but there's nothing particularly remarkable or noteworthy about them. The direction is lackluster, with no significant visual flair or creativity. The score is unmemorable, and the cinematography, production design, special effects, editing, and pace are all average at best.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a disappointing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The mishandling of MODOK and the underutilization of Kang, combined with the lackluster plot, direction, and technical aspects, make for a forgettable movie that fails to leave any lasting impact.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

While Jonathan Majors' portrayal of the villain Kang the Conqueror is impressive, the rest of the film disappoints.The plot revolves around Kang and his pressence in the quantum realm as well as Janet Van Dynes past in the realm. However, the story feels disjointed and lacks the coherence that previous MCU films have demonstrated.Despite the presence of a talented cast, the film fails to engage the audience fully. The humor, which is a staple of the Ant-Man franchise, feels forced and falls flat at times. The action sequences are also underwhelming and lack the excitement and tension that is expected from a Marvel movie. The overuse of CGI and the bad lighting that many scenes suffers from makes the movie feel rushed in production and not espacially appealing to look at.However, the one bright spot in the movie is Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang the Conqueror. Majors brings a menacing and compelling presence to the character, making him the only truly strong aspect of the film. His performance hints at the potential of this character for future films in the MCU and I could see myself viewing him as a villain on par with Thanos.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania fails to live up to the high standards set by previous Marvel movies. While Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang is notable, the rest of the film is lackluster and fails to engage the audience. It seems to be an ongoing problem with the latest MCU movies, which rely too heavily on CGI and action sequences at the expense of a well-crafted storyline and 3-dimensional characters.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I love how Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and showed us what Kang the Conquerer could be in future. I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humour more than most Marvel movies, great action, and a wonderful story! This film is a strong start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. Paul Rudd has never been better in the role, but Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt by everybody else. I love how the story is built between Scott and Cassie and it is the heart of the movie. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Let's leave politics out of the MCU and get back to the basics. They are doing way too much with CGI and the story line. Let's keep it simple and let the acting carry the movie. You don't have to make the characters god like. The movies have gone down hill since end game. Let's go back to the basics which is what everyone loved. Just remember, CGI doesn't make a movie, the characters do.

Well, he failed miserably. Too blinded by the direction that the movie needs to point the MCU in it gets lost in itself with a messy plot and uninspired mediocre direction. The movie was Sold in the trailers as a qauntum realm hiest for scott to try and complete for his rewards to more time with his daughter. Well i'd like to see that movie because this is not it. Instead we get a tiny hiest that lasts 5 minutes and an awful tory about a rebellion full of characters no one could care less about. Kang makes for an intresting villain and is one of the stronger mcu villians but he is ultimately undermined by the story, we keep getting told 'oh he's so evil' but we rarely get to see that side of him. But oh when we do it is this movie at it's best.The script has some very nice lines and floats out some nice ideas however, the script as a whole is just awful. It's either expostion or messy one liners or just Cassie saying 'dad' in a monotone voice with no facial expression. None of the characters have an arc none of them get any real development, there are hints of Scott having a possible arc but we never see it. Instead character development is erased in service of the plot, but the plot is so messy that it doesn't help. The movie lacks a general structure it feels like so much has happened, but nothing has happened. In addition by the time the movie ended i just struggled to see the point. If marvel wanted to spend a whole moive setting up Kang as the next big bad atleast have the story be good, atleast make us as the audience invested. Kang is meant to be our next big bad but not once did i fear for our heroes.The direction as a whole is a mixed bag Reed delivers some nice shots but overall there are alot of shots that are just awful. Some moments were so badly directed I couldn't tell what I was looking at and not in a good way. I know the qauntum real is difficult to pull off in live action but the CGI was so obvious at points that the movie felt like it was being directed by VFX artists. When you look at 2022's mcu movies despite their issues they all visually had something going for them, this does not. Furthermore, the movies action is lacking i can't think of any memorable action peices in the movie they're all over before they can even begin.The cast for the most part were brilliant especially Majors and Pfieffer. Newton is the weakest link in this cast but the script and direction don't do her any favours so I can't fully judge them.I did enjoy the opening of the movie and i thought it was nice just see Scott Lang being Scott Lang and seeing his life post avengers. Then when we fully got to see Kang introduced and have his first interactions with Scott I really love but after 20 minutes it all fell apart.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

That being said there are a few marvel films that I do genuinely enjoy like the iron man trilogy and being that Ant Man 3 (don't want to waste characters on the title) was the only new cinema release this week, I decided to give it a go. The third in the Ant Man trilogy, following on from Ant Man and Ant Man and the Wasp sees Scott Lang/Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and his family pulled accidentally into the quantum realm where surprise surprise there's an angry man destroying everything (these worlds need better counsellors) and it's up to Ant Man and co to stop him. The film has a bland plot and an even blander colour palate, most of the film is really dark and then suddenly there will be bursts of light from lasers that to be honest were the only thing keeping me awake for much of the film. The cast are fine, the writing is cookie cutter and generally awful and Jonathan Majors as Kang the ANTagonist seems to be getting heavily praised for his part in this film despite not really doing all that much apart from delivering a lot of trash talk dialogue.Whilst I'm far from a huge marvel fan myself I appreciate that perhaps unfortunately these films are keeping a lot of cinemas open at the moment and so I have to respect them for that, I just wish people were more opened minded to non superhero films. This was a great example of everything I dislike about the mcu, too many of their films rely almost entirely on having recognisable actors to carry along the same old tiresome narratives and I'm over it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It prepares you for the action film that never happened. In my mind I was thinking of how the film utterly failed to deliver. I don't want to say this because I like most of the cast and parts of the first two movies but, this movie was bad and wastes an opportunity to entertain.

I have seen Doctor Strange 2 and one of the Spider Man's theatrically, so, bear with me on this one.You may be asking, why did I go to see Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania , when I have only seen two other Marvel films? I wanted to see a film, and help my Disney shares.Having not seen the events of the last two films, I can't state why Scott is Ant Man. We open in normal San Francisco, Paul Rudd wrote a book about the events of the last film. He picks up his daughter from prison, (who is also an ant daughter?) his family, along with Michael Douglas get swept into this other dimension. This point was when I kept asking myself , what the heck is going on?The whole film felt far too cartoony, like this made for children. I don't hate Marvel, but, I always feel like I'm watching a movie for kids. Bill Murray makes a fun cameo, but he's in for only 5 minutes. They have a character, a central charcter, named MODOK (?) , which is a giant head. He gets annoying quick.The only thing I found really likable was Michael Douglas, I found myself thinking of other things to often while viewing this, which is not a good sign.This movie relies on CGI too much and in my opinion, had a poor story.C.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

While the special effects were impressive, they felt overused and at times, even distracting. The story also lacked the depth and originality that I was hoping for, and the characters didn't seem to have much growth or development.Overall, the movie may be enjoyable for some viewers, I personally found it to be a lackluster addition to the franchise. The reliance on CGI and lack of originality in the story made it feel like a cookie-cutter superhero movie that didn't stand out from the rest.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd still nails as Ant-Man and Jonathan Majors was brilliant as Kang, and the performance choice for the MCU! Jonathan's performance was phenomenal and he has done a great job playing Kang the Conqueror!Evangeline Lilly did a very well job with Hope / The Wasp, and Michelle Pfeiffer was also fantastic with her part for Janet van Dyne, and Kaitlyn Newton did a good job as well, and same goes for Michael Douglas, one of the most brilliant actors in Hollywood who made his great acting career in the spot light.To me it felt like Marvel meets Star Wars for the very first time in the Multiverse, and I gotta say it felt like it has pretty good vibes, when you think about it.The director Peyton Reed did a pretty good job with his third installment and to all of his previous films like Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp. Sure the third installment had pretty different story to tell, but to me it was pretty entertaining when it comes to the MCU!Not bad Quantumania!

The majority of the movie felt like a procession of computer-generated characters on computer-generated backgrounds, acting out a very predictable story.However, there were a few things that stood out - the main antagonist, played by a talented actor, was a truly remarkable character with believable motivations. Additionally, the performance of the actress portraying the Pym wife was noteworthy.Despite these two bright spots, the movie's story was very typical of Marvel, with around 95 % of the plot following familiar cliches, making it quite dull and uninteresting. The dialogue was equally unimpressive, as it sounded like it was written by teenagers under the influence. The main female character seemed to only say ""DAAAD!"" or ""MOOOOM!"" for 95% of the film, making it cringe-worthy.This was the first Marvel movie in over a decade that I was tempted to leave before the end credits rolled (though I ultimately stayed). After this experience, I cannot justify spending any more money on Marvel movies. The film was ugly, terrible, awkward, and unintelligent, save for the main antagonist and sound, which were decent.4/10, definetely not recommending this one.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

No. I am disappointed that a movie series known for its outstanding genius can fall so low.

I can't say it was terrible but it wasn't good. I found a lot of the lines cliché and predictable. The red ""holes"" guy is beyond stupid. They definitely didn't use Bill Murray to the extent they could have. He's not in Zombieland very long but he's at least memorable in that. Here, my husband had to remind me he was even in this the day after we watched it. It was all very... forgettable. Also, while I love Katheryn (maybe spelled her name wrong) I think that was a very drastic change for her character. She looks nothing like the girl who played her before.

I enjoyed it. I think a lot of people went into it expecting a complete tonal change, when of course there wasn't going to be. It's an Ant-Man movie! Although it has some quite intense aspects, it's still a quite fun and light-hearted superhero story. And I must say, it was pretty funny. I've not heard my whole cinema room laugh so much at a MARVEL movie in... Years! I mean, No Way Home was the single greatest cinema experience of my life, with people actually cheering and applauding, but the jokes in Quantumania had the crowd laughing throughout.Now, although it was really fun and I had a pretty great time, it wasn't that amazing on a technical level. I think a lot of people that have watched and reviewed it haven't given it enough credit, though, because it has a great story, decent writing and amazing performances. The biggest problem it has from a technical point of view is the visual effects. They were just super inconsistent, with some shots looking phenomenal, and others looking really bad, with super noticeable green screen.The ending and post-credits scenes definitely take away from my rating. The last act was pretty awesome and epic, but it went downhill very quickly.I'm quite disappointed with the setup they went with for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. I get what they're going for, but it's just not as good a setup as we hoped they'd have in this, and it's gotten me very uncertain and actually kinda unconfident and somewhat uninterested in the future of the MCU. I don't think I can really say anything more without risking giving any spoilers.Overall, its a decent film that would've been a 7.5/10 if it weren't for the underwhelming and honestly crappy ending and post-credits scenes. I think if you liked the first two movies, then you'll probably enjoy this. It is very dependent on what you like in your comicbook movies, so if you were a fan of the other movies in the Ant-Man trilogy, you'll likely have a good time with this.Oh, one last thing: How did Bill Murray get a character poster and MODOK didn't? Doesn't make sense!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

That tells you how bad this movie was. As a lifetime marvel comics fan, and to understand that Ant-Man is not even sidekick worthy in comic books growing up, Ant-Man is a fringe, not very well-thought-of character historically. The MCU tried to build up this character because they didn't have licensing rights to the X-Men, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, and many other mainstream characters, so they were trying to build out the rest of the universe with characters where the rights were not sold. This is like a CW network production of ""my little pony"" and ""hello kitty"" teaming up and saving the universe. Taking Ant-Man and making it an essential element for phase 4 and beyond as a macro theme for anybody who is a true fanboy of the material is insane. Kang the Conqueror is an Apex predator Thanos-level villain. Having Janet Van Dyne Defeat him twice and relegate him to the quantum realm and beyond is ridiculous. The most frustrating part was that a teenager who just got released from jail could develop Stark-level technology by reading her grandfather's papers and playing around in the garage as the trope to get the whole gang into the quantum realm.The problem with the MCU is they need comic book writers to look at this and say, "" OK, what makes sense and comic book logic?"" There are rules in fantasy writing, and when you insult your audience from ""the get,"" you won't gross $1 billion box office. Not only is she a genius, but she is also a badass with more morality than her dad and is the driving force pushing the plot forward. Yet again, another male lead has become a sidekick in his film with a ""Sally Mae"" daughter who does everything the best. You have Michelle Pfeiffer, a +70-year-old doing all this badass action. The special effects were so terrible and cheesy that the universe they created in the quantum realm with rejects from Fraggle Rock. But by far, the worst element of this is having M. O. D. O. K. In the quantum realm(without A. I. M.) and being a henchman for Kang's terrible character usage. Ridiculous special effects for the M. O. D. O. K. Character were the worst in MCU history. The writing for his character was so bad, especially after having an excellent template from the animated series for M. O. D. O. K. On Hulu; this was a shame.M. O. D. O. K as the antagonist with premium SGI in the MCU prime reality would've been a far better direction for this film, especially with the comedic talent of Paul Rudd, that would've been a perfect sendoff.The Kang character needed to be developed far more. They made him one dimensional and whiny. I wish the writers on the picket line never return to the industry. I can go on and on scene by scene, but it's just bad plotting , bad character development, clear agendas all over the place, and you got a weenie character with a weenie crew trying to set up the subsequent phases in a grand way. Mind-boggling bad, the only thing worse then the overall acting cast, etc., was the Eternal's. That includes Wakanda Forever, which was horrid, mainly because of what they did with the NAMOR character. I'm reviewing this so late because I refuse to pay for any Disney content, so I am on a cruise ship, and I was able to see it for free that's the only way I will watch any of this content any more. It will have to wash up on the shore like Allie Fox said in the Mosquie Coast movie, for me to be able to view Disney content. I will not pay another dollar to aid in this horrendous direction the MCU & Disney Studios has headed.... Shame, Shame, Shame!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is Scott Lang's chance to finally shine on a grand without the Avengers and you know what...he does! By no means is this a perfect film but it's the first film where an Ant-man film feels like it has stakes for the broader MCU beyond a post credit scene like Ant-Man and the Wasp.Quantumania is a psychedelic journey through a miniature Star-Wars-eque universe that's inhabited by oddities ripped straight from a 10-year olds imagination. That's not a bad thing, but I suspect the rigid minds of adults will find it too trippy in some areas of the film (which I'll discuss near the end) but it's this creativity that gives the Quantum Realm its visually stunning appeal.The story itself is a simple one: Scott Lang and family are pulled into the Quantum realm and introduced to the newest big bad in the MCU...KANG!! Kang is trapped and needs Scott to help him to escape. Johnathan Majors as Kang is a beast of a man. His mood switches between vulnerable to vicious in the flick of a light switch and it is awesome to see. Kang is menacing, crafty and cunning but its Michelle Pfeiffer's range of emotions as Janet that sells Kang's villainy better than anything the film gives us. Janet Van Dyne is the embodiment of trauma in this film and Kang is the trauma she suppressed.I always have to remind myself that Ant-Man films are intended for kids so there's a reason for its tone and style. But there are times that I wish the film trusted itself enough to just lean into the world they created and allow it to engross us instead of occasionally relying on silliness that pulls us out of the moment. I long for the day when sci-fi films gives us a world that has a sort of evolutionary synergy like Avatar instead of feeling like a dump of toys from a child's toy box onto the screen. Ancillary characters should fill the world, not serve as a punchline. That's one of the weaknesses in this film.Overall, its a fun return to the MCU's ever expanding universe and sets up the future in exciting new ways.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

It works and doesn't feel out of place. Heck, I'm sure if you shrunk down to beyond the size of dust mites yourself everything would look a little alien to you too. There's a colorful cast of new characters that are the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm and they all are weird, wacky, and wonderful, (and also wondering about holes; ""just drink the goo"").This movie also introduces us to the newest overarching baddie for all of Phase 5 & 6 in these movies and Disney+ shows named Kang The Conqueror, a god-like being who can travel through time, across dimensions, realities, and universes, who has gone up against The Avengers plenty of times before in the comic books and has easily won more than a few times. Kang proves in this movie that he is an even BIGGER threat to The Avengers and the Marvel Multiverse at large than Thanos was!! Kang is a terrifying villain, played wonderfully and with some Machiavellian glee by actor Jonathan Majors!! Majors did such a great job as Kang that he steals every scene that he's in. The character is so layered, that the movie only scratches the surface of Kang's broken psyche, and I cannot wait to see more of him going forward in the MCU!Actress Kathryn Newton also did an admirable job as the now almost adult Cassie Lang, who now has a suit very much like her father's. Throughout the movie she (much to Scott's chagrin, at first) learns to use the suit properly, as it does come with a learning curve for her, while Scott tries to sometimes hilariously teach her the ropes. She also wants to be like her father and help people and not turn a blind eye, and those situations get her into some hot water more than a couple of times, but she proves she can handle herself and becomes a superhero in her own right. Newton's performance as Cassie adds some depth and maturity to the character, and I won't be surprised if we see more of her in some form going forward!I also liked the addition of Bill Murray into the mix, who has a history with Janet from her time down in the Quantum Realm before her rescue. He plays his character the way you'd expect Bill Murray to play an over-the-top and exuberant character, and it adds some humor while also building up the tension to the plot even more!Quantumania is a movie whose set pieces are weird, wonderful, and sometimes wacky, but it all blends together and works well and the film gives off some heavy Star Wars vibes at times; that's not a bad thing at all, I loved it, because director Payton Reed and Marvel head Kevin Feige know how to make something bizarre work well within the confines of the psychics and the world that Stan Lee and the comics created. The movie is funny when it needs to be, and serious when it needs to be. It's a well put together film that doesn't feel clunky or slow. The stakes in this film are as serious as you can get, (the introduction of Kang, the possibility of Multiversal annihilation, those whole nine yards), but the movie is a nice blend of usual Ant-Man movie humor and seriousness and it all works well. Of the three Ant-Man movies, THIS ONE is my favorite of the three!There were a couple of things in the movie that I felt were lacking, and that I didn't like, though not completely dislike. Firstly, The Wasp character is treated almost like a side character and a sidekick instead of an equal superhero partner to Scott. It's almost as if the screenwriters downplayed her role in this movie and put more emphasis on Scott, Cassie, and Kang. The other dislike I had with the movie (though it's only a minor one) is that we didn't get enough time with Bill Murray's character in the movie, I would've liked to have seen more of him, and also the fact that I wish we could've seen more of what Janet's time in the Quantum Realm was like, other than the few flashbacks we got. There was definitely a little more to her story and her time there that was told, but not explicitly shown.This movie was a blast, and Marvel is certainly starting to turn up the dial on all the setting up they did in Phase 4, because this first entry in Phase 5 does not disappoint, and this'll leave you wanting more.Speaking of more, there is a mid credit and a post credit scene, both of which YOU CAN'T MISS, because it sets the stage for what we can expect going forward, and there are a couple of unexpected and BIG surprises and reveals!!Quantumania is a Marvel movie that feels wacky and wonderful in all the right ways. If you thought Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness was a mind altering trip on acid, wait until you see this!","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The production is quality is fine, except the quantum world only gives off strong Star War vibes. Other than burning money to establish the colorful, cool visuals effects, I can't see any originality or creativity compared to other Marvel films. It has a different look but the exact same core. Which was dissapointing for sure.Obviously, movie doesn't have to rely on visuals, but this movie also sucked at telling the story. Without connecting to the MCU universe and looking at it as a separate film, the characterization is almost a complete disaster. Not only was the plot generic and followed the same Marvel stereotype, but to a new viewer, it failed to connect the audience and the characters. They were either static throughout the film, or round characters with straight up bad character developments (Cassie, for one).If I was a Marvel fan and knew more about MCU, I might've given a higher rating, but this film simply would not attract any new viewers to the Marvel Universe who didn't watch the prequels.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Quantumania is definitely not what I wanted it to be, I expected a lot more from the film. It has lazy writing, cheap performances and extremely weak CGI and VFX, which was really important considering that almost all of the film is shot in front of a green/blue screen! The only thing keeping the movie from being a total disappointment is Kang! Great introduction to the character, Jonathan Majors is AMAZING! Kang suits him perfectly, I can't wait to see more of him in Phase 5 and I think you will too!

With utmost pride, he unveils his awe-inspiring ignorance and flaws, surpassing all records in creating characters that are irrelevant beyond imagination for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Kang the Conqueror, the debut penned by this wordsmith, how could we not be in awe? Truly, a shining example of the triumph of mediocrity!But wait, there's more to marvel at! Loveness delights in the art of mocking fans, turning Modok into a jester of unparalleled amusement. How splendid it is to witness his arrogant belief that deriding devoted fans is the pinnacle of wit! As for his decision to discard Emma Fuhrman, who made her mark in Endgame, in favor of Kathryn Newton, it's a testament to his disregard for consistency and respect. Why bother with integrity when there are profits to be made?Ant-Man 3 serves as a beacon of the MCU's impending collapse. Its nonsensical plot and fragmented character development epitomize the delightful chaos that Loveness orchestrates. The world, it seems, has indeed turned upside down, and we eagerly anticipate his future endeavors, as he continues his mission to dismantle the very essence of the New Avengers with his audacious lunacy.In conclusion, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Jeff Loveness for gracing us with Ant-Man 3, a magnum opus of imperfection and genius. We implore him to persist in dismantling established works, for there is no greater joy than witnessing colossal failures unfold on the grandest stage. Thank you, Mr. Loveness, thank you indeed!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Why movies like Eternals failed is that there is yet another character origin story to tell. Another world to build. But that is only one problem with this movie. I liked the first two Antman films, not my favourite MCU character, but Paul Rudd definitely added decent charm into the mix. So that is another problem, lack of Paul Rudd screentime and less humour. Except for a scant witty remark here and there, this is not meant to be a fun film. Even when Bill Murray shows up for a cameo. He says his lines and tries to be provocative. But exits rather quickly and gets tossed into the pile of new characters being introduced in this movie. Which is the biggest problem with this film. Too many new characters. It is a problem with world building, here the Quantum universe, having to establish all these groups of people and their stake in things.For instance, this teenage girl was introduced and had some stake in the whole universe being destroyed or something. After the big battle at the end, they return to the girl and now the universe won't be destroyed, or something. I had literally forgotten about her. Same thing for Bill Murray, what was he all about? It goes on. There is a big group of CGI characters. The only one that stood out was a walking lava lamp who wished he had holes. Worse, the second act gets bogged down as we must have this quantum universe explained to us. ""Why didn't you mention to us that you (saw this stuff, met these people) when you were down here?"" is constantly asked of Michelle Pfeiffer's character. I think too much is made of her hiding this stuff. She didn't want to talk about it, let's move on.The last problem I had with this movie was the ugly environments that made up the Quantum universe. Like most films like this recently, things are really dark. I mean physically dark, with many things going on the big screen hidden in shadows, at night. In general, I get tired of being immersed in gloomy worlds for two hours. I thought the trend was going away from the dark themed blockbusters. I guess filmmakers prefer the dark again.So to sum up:
Too little Paul Rudd and his humour
Too many new characters
Too much world building
Too much time explaining all these things
Ugly environmentsI give it a five out of ten. I will give some stars for staying in bounds by not running over two hours, and being a mostly watchable film with no major stumbles. Oh, and I didn't care for Evangeline Lilly's new hairdo.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was a low key film with a neat script and doses of comedy that was a nice distraction and pretty much unconnected from the more po-faced world of the Avengers films. Unfortunately though something seems to have gone wrong here.Firstly we have a story that is a partial rehash of other more recent MCU storylines (baddie wants to be an all conquering god-like presence by destroying anyone who stands in his way). Secondly the actor playing that baddie just seems like a wrong bit of casting as. Jonathan Majors (as Kang) seems to lack much gravitas. I'm afraid I found Majors turn in the role a bit hammy too, being unconvincing and far too two dimensional.I also found the film was cherry picking ideas out of other MCU films like GOTG ( races of weird looking aliens) for one. The story lacks originality, reminding me of Avatar, and the script full of obvious cliches. And both these points in mind I think that, after the last Thor film, Marvel is running out of ideas and its becoming obvious.Whilst it's great having older actors like Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer in these movies, there were times they genuinely seemed embarrassed when they delivered their dialogue. Also the film badly overuses green screen and at times it started to resemble the Star Wars prequels of 20 years ago, with massive CGI battles providing the 'spectacle'.I'm sorry Marvel/Disney but you will have to do better than this sloppy mess Having a charming leas actor just isn't enough to save a film. You have to bring something original to the table too. I thought the recent Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness had it's issues but there was enough originality and novel ideas from Sam Raimi in it to keep it interesting. The same goes for Spider-Man-No Way Home, an overlong film but made watchable by a good story and enough crowd pleasing surprises and to keep it interesting. And whilst Ant-Man doesn't have that legacy, I still think the makers could have done better here.To summarise I found this to be an empty film. It has nothing new to add and feels bloated despite it being one of the shorter Marvel movies. If they had kept the story from getting overblown like this it might have stopped it resembling a dozen other movies. Marvel have had a few critical duds of recent and badly need to rethink their plan if they want to keep their loyal audience from losing interest. If I'm honest, the only film on their slate that I'm genuinely looking forward to at the moment is Deadpook 3.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Jeff Loveness and Jack Kirby, was just rubbish. It was such a far out there storyline that it was near impossible to take serious. Luckily the movie was kept afloat by the over-the-top and impressive CGI special effects.The acting performances in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" were good, and they definitely had a good and solid cast ensemble for the movie, with the likes of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, Kathryn Newton, Bill Murray and Corey Stoll.The special effects, wardrobe and props are off the charts in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", but then again, that is the case with all Marvel movies, now isn't it? And it was, at least for me, this that made the movie bearable to sit through.I found ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" to be a waste of 124 minutes, and it was a rather weak addition to the Marvel line of superhero movies, almost as weak as the ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" movie. I know that I am not returning to watch director Peyton Reed's 2023 movie ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" a second time, because the storyline just didn't latch onto me.My rating of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" lands on a bland five out of ten stars.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

"3","/10","On & on & on & on & on...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8884293/?ref_=tt_urv","W011y4m5","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71088443/?ref_=tt_urv","21 February 2023","In the same way that ""X Men: Apocalypse"" was a thoroughly underwhelming viewing experience after the events of ""Days of Future Past"" (& a signal of the 20th Century Fox Universe's impending collapse), sitting through ""Quantumania"" at the cinema feels very reminiscent of that fateful feature; a total slog, arguably akin to watching a corporate, money hungry studio thrust the lifeless corpse of a dead franchise (which died of natural causes in 2019) in front of paying audiences; held up loosely at the limbs by strings, hoping that the visible movement in the ligaments will perhaps convince viewers that this decomposing husk is arguably still alive & therefore, they should continue to attend future screenings (& grace Disney with their hard earned cash) - under the pretence the heart's seemingly beating.Dear reader, it is not.If the third ""Antman"" proves anything beyond reasonable doubt (accounting for the fact that the movie spends the majority of its run-time, endeavouring to justify its existence without providing an actual explanation), it's that the story irrevocably concluded with (the aptly titled) ""Avengers: Endgame"" & anyone still entertaining the possibility of revivication will be brutally disabused of that fantasy by the time the credits start rolling.I say this because one of the most essential things a writer can do (to ensure a high quality of work when crafting even the most basic of story) is know when to stop (before their tales out-stay their welcome) - to guarantee that our investments of time are worthwhile - & here marks the point where I truly believe the MCU crosses that unavoidable threshold & ventures perilously close to undoing all that's been done, previously - in an undignified attempt to remain relevant. Of course, the boundaries for such a parameter are subjective (& our idea of what constitutes a ""dragged-out"" denouement differs) so others are entitled to an opposing viewpoint but in my opinion, when a continuation necessitates the negation of a prior plot thread's emotional stakes to justify further installments, that's typically an indicator of when you've gone too far (because you're doing genuine damage to what came before & informing the audience that the purpose of the progression isn't to develop & grow for any discernible reason - whilst maintaining the importance of the past - but to needlessly expand for the sheer sake of it, at any cost, providing them with a reason to no longer engage) & resultantly, that's when no further sequels should be granted (as it's clearly over)... However, in order to establish ""Kang the Conqueror"" as a new credible threat, the saga subsequently falls in to that fatal trap (acting as an embarrassing statement of intent - ""I'm not going anywhere"" - really, loitering like an attendee at a house party who doesn't seem to realise it's over) & trivialises the risks posed beforehand. Consequently, Peyton Reed & his scribe Jeff Loveness (in the space of a mere 2 hours) render over a decade's worth of carefully planned, built-up world-building as meaningless - to inorganically shift the emphasis on to *this* antagonist (whose jarringly immediate introduction gives the impression as though an ""Avengers"" level threat was required quickly to maintain fan attention & having already dealt with Thanos - an iconic villain whose foreboding presence was felt for years before naturally emerging - executives alternatively approached them to desperately pitch the insertion of ""bad guy 2"" within the space of 1 blockbuster) who - at this rate - will (additionally) likely be equally inconsequential within a few years... So what's the point? The only honest response is ""profit"" & ""capitalist greed"". That's what this is; more of the same, repackaged unadventurously, yet brazen in its increasingly superficial motivations.The palpable aura of irrelevance is exacerbated further by the sci-fi concept featured; despite the consistent lack of originality in their product, Marvel's outings used to at least have relative structure / coherence & follow a linear format. Now tackling the multi-verse (with endless possibilities, variations of the same characters existing simultaneously in endless realities & universes housed within each other), since literally ANYTHING is possible (rules be damned), the insignificance of what we're watching feels more noticeable than ever considering that feeling (of futility) is ironically shared by the people we see on screen (no longer adhering to any sense of logic). Furthermore, if one universe is destroyed, an infinity of others are not... Again, Jonathan Major's ""Kang"" (who has apparently culled numerous timelines) embodies a hollow risk that's insisted to be monumental - yet we know it's ironically infinitesimal, due the brazen replaceability of everything. As mentioned, that culminates as a tired reaffirmation of the triviality of what we're witnessing (irrespective of its visual spectacle) so rather than carving out a clear, distinct direction... People will leave theatres, reminded how it doesn't have one anymore - yet stuff repeatedly happens, in spite of that - through obligation, not requirement.I haven't even mentioned the humiliatingly shoddy VFX (so soon after James Cameron's ""Avatar"", which is a masterpiece by comparison), awfully expository dialogue, juvenile humour (so many jokes about holes / bodily functions) & convoluted nature of the messy, contrived script. Plus, the half-baked, two-dimensional characterisations, unconvincing line deliveries & surprisingly uninventive cinematography (from Bill Pope, responsible for ""The Matrix"" trilogy). None of it works. None of it will end by its own volition. You'll have to prize that sore, milked udder from their dry, mummified hands. They're squeezing out every last drop & we'll be forced to endure each & every torturous moment until someone finally puts this out of its misery.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Our heroes get sucked into the Quantum realm through sheer stupidity, and there's a whole world and secrets to reveal and blah blah blah.Much of this seems designed to create a bunch of cool visuals, with unusual scenery and strange humanoids. It's all perfectly fine, but none of it makes you go ""wow, how beautiful"" or ""wow, how imaginative."" It's just a bunch of random stuff in a random world visited in a random fashion.The most random thing is probably Bill Murray, who has one irrelevant scene apparently because he had a day free and someone was like, hey, why don't we stick Bill Murray in this?The best performances are Kathryn Newton as the feisty, likeable Cassie, and Jonathan Majors as Kang. Majors is particular impressive, being one of these villains who don't see themselves as a villain and speak about their plans in a persuasive, sincere way that almost sucks you in.As good as Majors is, though, the character is underbaked. He keeps talking about not living through time linearly but it's not clear what that means, since he doesn't expect anything that happens. The best he does is, after it happens, he says, ""yeah, I knew all this"" which is as persuasive as any time some dude says, ""Yeah, I totally knew that the whole time.""There's not much comedy, what there is isn't that funny. There's a bunch of special effects action, but none of it is that impressive. There's not an original moment in the movie.Still, it's watchable.

Bit of a lengthy review this one so strap in.Since Endgame there have been 18 movies and TV shows (almost as many as there were movies between Iron Man 2008 and Endgame 2019). I've watched everything MCU related and the only MCU content I can reference that was either good or just half decent is Spider-Man: No Way Home, Shang-Chi and Moon Knight. Each of these still obviously have their own problems but these problems personally aren't big enough that it weighs down the rest of the story for me. Everything else has been soiled by completely incompetent writing and just feels like corporate, lifeless, monotonous sludge pushed out by the colossal rectum that is Walt Disney Studio's to keep content and money flowing.I have been a solid fan of Marvel Studios for over a decade now and after Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness I had mentally checked out entirely. The writing for these movies/tv shows has become so ridiculously lazy and convoluted that its impossible to follow logically. They are treating the concept of the multiverse like its this sacred thing that can't be altered and they can't interact or merge but also that you can do anything what so ever with zero consequences because there's an infinite amount of other universes so who cares. Why should we as an audience care about your universe when you very blatantly don't care about it yourself.The multiverse can be an incredible story telling device if utilised properly and with meaning behind it, but they've instead decided to go down the Rick and Morty route and make it so nothing matters. Its entertaining for a moment but also loses all meaning when the stakes you set can be nullified completely at any moment. (Dosent surprise me that my friend mentioned after watching the movie that it felt like an episode of Rick and Morty, especially with some of the comedy, themes and the fact that marvel has now hired a multitude of writers from that show to head multiple different projects, including this one.)There is so much to say about how little there is to say about everything Marvel has released the past 4 years. The formula has been abused so hard that I can do a description of virtually everything they've put out the past few years in one go:Hero and friends are all in a great position, Hero accidentally discovers something, world/universe is in danger, comedy, action, comedy, action, one or two big subverted twists that makes no sense, means nothing and pleases nobody, comedy, action, big CGI fight and then the Hero and their friends are right back where they started. Throw in a few 'woke' wins/ideologies/issues to please the woke crowd and keep them defending any criticism of your films, kick your feet up and call it a day.(For context, the comment on the inclusion of 'woke' ideologies in these films isn't a comment on whether its good or bad, whether you should agree or disagree or whether it should or shouldn't even be in the movie, everybody has their own opinions and everybody is entitled to them. This is a comment on the fact that Disney very clearly dosent actually care about these issues they portray and instead uses these as some what of a shield against valid criticism of their films online.)Of course each new movie/show they put out they have to dangle a carrot in front of you in the form of some major marvel character/actor who is going to show up, and then of course by the end of the movie/show, that character/actor will have been retconned, killed off or just straight up revealed to not be the character you thought it was because ""hey we gotcha again didn't we lol look how clever and funny we are"". They want to use all of these crazy characters and properties they now own to entice people to come see their films but either don't have the balls to commit to any of them or dont have the talent/creativity to bring them to life, so they ""subvert"" our expectations, do something nobody wants and then call it clever. It's borderline false advertising at this point. Its like variations of groundhog day, especially now that I've just watched Bill Murray walk in and out of this movie so quickly I forgot he was even in the film until writing this review.Even without all the multiverse stuff almost every movie/TV show has been made to look so important and game changing yet felt so inconsistent and inconsequential that by the end you could completely remove it and it would make virtually no difference to the overall story. I'm not saying every movie has to have some next level, world changing thing that completely switches everything up but to have everything that has been released feel this lifeless really is a killer expecially when the MCU felt truly incredible at one point. Now its this dead husk being puppeted and milked for every penny by Disney.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is no exception. The concept for what this movie was about is actually great material however it is constantly bogged down by plot holes, terrible comedy and some questionable CGI. Don't get me wrong there were a few genuinely funny moments and for the most part the visuals are fantastic and the artists who brought this world to life should be proud of themselves. Infact everybody involved in the making of this movie should be proud because you can tell pretty much everybody brought it. However this movies suffers enormously from what everything else in Phase 4 of the MCU has suffered from.Horrendously incompetent writing.The overall story and concepts for these movies aren't the problem, its the lack of respect for the characters and source material and the attention to detail that these hack writers seem to not even remotely care about. Its gotten so bad that to even enjoy some of these movies you need to switch the thinking part of your brain off completely. I feel genuinely sorry for some of the highly talented actors in this film that had to regurgitate some of the most incomprehensibly insane dialogue I've ever heard in a movie.""But hey these are just stupid superhero movies for kids you're not supposed to think too deep into it""Some of the greatest movies I've seen are very much family friendly. Implying that because children's brains aren't as fully developed as adults its ok to phone it in and make everything braindead is whats killing cinema and empowering these lazy writers to not care what they put to paper. What made these movies and this universe so herculean now is the attention to detail and the respect they had for the characters, the story and the fans who got them to this point. The overall writing and story for a film should never be sacrificed for the sake of spectacle and subversion yet the writers of these movies and shows seem to think that's now compulsory.This movie has some quality moments, the acting is overall good with some being exceptional (Jonathan Majors as Kang being the standout), some of the comedy definately got a good laugh and some of the creative elements they did with the world and the action set pieces was next level. However, all this really is the icing on the cake with the overall cake being the story you're telling and the cake was so flavourless and inconsistent its impossible to go a few minutes without questioning everything that's happening.Characters being shown in one situation then magically being in a different one next time they're on screen, the most unbelievably convenient, infinitely impossible moments just landing right in the characters laps like magic, gaping plot holes that completely break the universe and immersion, terrible comedy usually at the expense and detriment of the script/story, clunky/rushed CGI, main characters being completely forgotten about and sidelined for the whole movie (Feeling very sorry for Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp is completely underutilised and has been turned from a character into a cog to keep the other characters moving along. The fact that this movie is called ""Ant-Man and the Wasp is quite frankly a joke.), subverted, meaningless plot twists that make zero sense and of course... mcguffins.Marvel... This is really your big kick off for Phase 5?This is obviously a spoiler-free review but the tricky thing about these reviews (which I think Disney also likes to bank on) is obviously a majority of people who haven't seen the movie will be avoiding any reviews with spoilers but without going into the spoilers its impossible to describe just how meaningless this movie and so many other MCU movies have been recently.If you go to these movies to switch your brain off completely and enjoy the comedy and visuals then you'll have a great time however if thats what you're paying disney and these hack writers for then I suggest either waiting until it releases on streaming services or putting on a comedy podcast and finding a few different 4K youtube visualiser's to stare at for 2 hours instead. You might save some money and also hit Disney's pockets just enough they decide to actually start caring about the content they put out.If you're going to these movies to follow the stories and the characters you've cared about for well over a decade you will leave feeling deflated and confused, only feeling more deflated and confused the more time passes by and you chew on what you just watched.Fully done with the MCU now as are a plethora of other people, the universe is so broken and messy that Marvel might as well reboot the whole universe and start from scratch now that they've acquired all the properties that they have.If you still want to watch this movie just wait until its out on streaming, as I mentioned this movie has some redeeming qualities but nowhere near enough to make it worth your money. The writing weighs this film down like a dingy loaded with a ton of lead.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is the beginning of Phase Five, which belongs to the Multiverse Saga, which started after the Infinity Saga ended. A little confused? I don't blame you. It becomes so convoluted that many people who go to watch it in theaters don't know such information. Phase Four has ended with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever movie, and I honestly can say now that the whole Phase Four was underwhelming by Marvel standards. So you are wondering what the new Phase Five looks like? Disappointing again! MCU's glory days are over.In this movie, the new antagonist of Multiverse Saga, Kang The Conqueror, has been established. A problem with the villain is that he is not nearly as strong as everyone expected. Kang should be a real threat to the universe like Thanos was in Infinity saga, but after watching the movie, I don't see him as menacing as Thanos. Kang can barely fight against Ant-Man and the Wasp, so the final fight in the third act is dissatisfying and anti-climatic.Another problem with the movie's antagonist was the lack of motivation. We completely understood the reasons why Thanos wanted to conquer the world. Kang's motivations are simply revenge and an urge for power. That would be fine for some villain in another Marvel movie, but we are talking about the villain who will fight Avengers in the upcoming Avengers: The Kang Dynasty movie coming to theaters in 2025. One of the reasons Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame were great was thanks to the superb setup for Thanos's character in previous movies. They already failed in the introduction of the antagonist in this movie.I started talking about the villain first cause I considered it to be the main issue. Another antagonist called M. O. D. O. K. Was a fiasco too. The design for this character was awful to the point you can't keep watching him without laughing at him. Even the characters in the movie were cracking jokes about his appearance. Ant-Man movies are known for weak villains, but this is another level. It is becoming ridiculous. Even though CGI is captivating, M. O. D. O. K.'s CGI face is atrocious and unfinished.Special effects for landscapes and backgrounds left a great impression on me. Unfortunately, this looks very familiar within the MCU universe as it reminds me of Guardians of the Galaxy style. A movie needs to be more distinctive. Especially the monster's design resembles a lot of Star Wars characters. It even has the cantina scene. As long as they play it safe, creativity is in danger here.Don't get me wrong, Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror is a great actor and a welcomed addition to the cast. The problem is the poor writing of his character. Evangeline Lilly, who portrays the Wasp, has considerably less screen time comparing it to the previous movies. At least we see more of Michelle Pfeiffer's character Janet Van Dyne. Michael Peña as Luis doesn't act in this movie which is a big mistake. He is probably one of the funniest characters in the MCU. On the bright side, they added Bill Murray to the cast. He is there just for a few scenes, but it was freshening to see him in the movie.It is an action-packed story, and it feels like they cut all the scenes that felt like it slows the pace. It is a wrong formula. I had the same problem last year with Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness. There is no time to breathe. It is just one action scene after another. The only thing between various action scenes is exposition, which makes it even worse. There are a few long exposition scenes throughout the movie as a way to reveal important information about the plot to the audience. Some characters even withhold the information unnecessarily, only to have a big reveal in a second act. It is lazy writing, and I am concerned cause the writer of this movie, Jeff Loveness, will write Avengers: The Kang Dynasty.I am also anxious about the director Peyton Reed. Besides Spider-Man movies, this is the second trilogy in the MCU to have the same director for all movies. I hope there will be a change of director cause, with every subsequent film, Ant-Man movies are getting worse to the point that it is the worst MCU movie alongside Eternals.The story resembles the Rick and Morty TV show, only without humor or compelling adventures. This movie isn't funny comparing it to the previous ones. Even in that regard, writers failed.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Both the actor and the character itself were amazing in my opinion.Outside of that... I didn't enjoy it much.It's never good when I find myself looking at my watch during a movie at a theater. None of the jokes landed with me at all, I didn't laugh at a single thing throughout the film even though it was evident they tried to get some laughs.Paul Rudd was okay, but at times felt like he was phoning it in. Pfiefer's character was the most unnecessarily likable thing in the whole film too. ""I know all this bad stuff about the multiverse but I'll tell you later"" became her mantra in this film. Did they NOT have enough time for her to give a condensed version while wandering through the CGI world?I know I'm getting a little burned out on the amount of Marvel films and shows, and that might sway my opinion a little, but this film absolutely failed to reach my expectations for the true start of Kang the Conqueror.

The big issue and is the whole problem associated with this could have been negated if Janet had told everyone what happened to her in the Quantum Realm.

The movie's pacing is so sluggish, it's like the filmmakers decided to throw in a few naps for the audience. At a runtime of 118 minutes, it's about as long as an average flight to Europe, but with less excitement and worse food.MODOK, the film's villain, looks like something a toddler would come up with after eating too much candy. The character's design and animation are so unconvincing, it makes the Gummi Bear look like a realistic portrayal. He looks like a leftover from a Power Rangers episode. If the film's writers had spent as much time on VFX as they did on naming him, we might have had a more menacing and memorable villain.It feels like it's trying too hard to be funny, like a clown who's had a few too many drinks. At this point, the MCU's humor is about as fresh as bread from a gas station. Many of the jokes feel forced, and there are times when the humor feels like a crutch to keep the audience engaged. While some of the comedic moments are genuinely funny, others feel out of place.Finally, the MCU approach to representation continues to be problematic. These films continue to prioritize promoting women and side-characters while reducing the usually male legacy characters to caricatures and punchlines. The movie's approach feels like it's trying too hard to be feminist, like a guy wearing a ""This is what a feminist looks like"" t-shirt. It's like the filmmakers are saying, ""Look, we have women doing cool things, isn't that neat?""The only thing worse than watching this movie is being stuck in a time loop where you're forced to watch it over and over again.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Poorly written, and a visual mess","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8892191/?ref_=tt_urv","bxuser","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27853788/?ref_=tt_urv","25 February 2023","As the MCU moves into it's latest phase, the core universe's story revolves around very complex topics like time manipulation and multiverse travel. Two topics that have me personally, SO excited for their potential. The complexity of these topics requires more exposition, and frankly less absurdity to tell a story that's relatable and inserstandable. Quantumania, as well as Dr. Strange 2 falls very flat there... the only exception to this trend being the Loki TV series. In this review I'll compare the tone, writing, and visual language between Loki and Quantumania to give better context why the latest Ant Man qualifies as ""truly forgettable"" and ""see only because you have to"" for dedicated MCU fans.Writing:
Quantumania celebrates the ignorance, pride, and I'll informed wokeness of Ant Man's daughter. The plot was driven by character choices that were instant gut decisions that lacked information, context, or any subtlety.The biggest reason I enjoyed Thanos related plots, was the ""Lawful evil"" nature of his ""well intentioned"" actions which is addressed, confronted, and contextualized by the 'heros'. This was expertly done with the introduction of ""he who remains"" in Loki as well. In those films there is gray space for the viewer to understand that the world is complex, and careful consideration of morals and actions are what make heros, not a 'underinformed gut reaction for whoever looks oppressed'. In Loki, the time spent on character development of Loki, Sylvie, and He Who Remains give their poor choices context, and made for much more engaging drama and emotional impact.Humor: a few funny moments, most were semi crude fart jokes. Small things like fat Thor and a sassy dr. Strange cloak are enough. Weird giant face robots and endless talk of holes is just... Cheap and dumb.Ending scene: terrible and kind of confusing. Was it a Meta-retrospection on how bad the writing of the film was?Visual language:
In one word... Maximalism. This film was so visually distracting that I often was pulled away from the plot. So much CGI that it left me yearning for just a scene with two people talking in a room making sense of wtf was going on. I don't know why they tried to make an Ant Man ""Avatar"", but the mess of crap on the screen felt nonconsensual to my eyes. This film proved that more isnt better, and boy I wish I never found out.It also struck me that in several scenes you could see that the actors reactions looked like they were just standing in a green screen studio. It's got be be hard to react correctly to a scene where your prompt is: ""you're flying on the back of a manta ray while lasers are shooting at you flying over a lake in a forest with fungus trees with a burned out looking sky and a giant head is trying to kill you"". Like wtf. In Loki, the viewers were introduced to one or two new elements/paradigms at a time. In Quantumania, everything in every scene was new. Maybe they did this on purpose to distract from the awful plot.See it if you must, but otherwise it's an easy skip. Jonathan Majors was incredible as always. He was the only redeemable piece of this mess. This film needed more explanation of literally everything, more subtlety, and SO MUCH less CGI.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But this was just a very weird film- and not in a good way. The majority of the film takes place in a setting where there is so much green screen, it's impossible to get a sense of scale- which is not good when the key selling point of your main characters is that they can grow/shrink. Sadly this contains some of the clunkiest dialogue I've heard in any film (audible laughs at all the wrong places in the screening I was in) - a shame when thinking back to the zippy first outting of Ant-Man. Jonathan Majors steals the show, and for the most part appears as though he's acting in a different film to everyone else.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is poor coming from Marvel, and someone is trying to be funny like Taika Waititi but failing hard. Instead of laughing of scenes that I am sure were supposed to be funny, there were a lot of headshaking because things were just BIZARRE.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly totally lost their chemistry in this movie, the acting from almost everyone was stiff. The whole ""we are a loving family"" vibe this movie is trying to portray feels forced and I did not believe it for a second. The actors who are carrying this movie for everyone are Majors and Pfeiffer, but especially Majors. I didn't understand his character in Loki series and thought he just acted poorly but this man is actually pretty amazing, and now I understand his character in Loki so much more based on the way he acted in Ant-Man. I am looking forward to seeing him again in the next installment he's in.The plot is fine, not really surprising but fine, but the movie is slow in build up with absolutely no memorable scenes. The quantum realm looks stunning with what seems like a lot of inspiration from Star Wars, but that alone doesn't help an otherwise flat and close to boring movie.I've watched the previous Ant-Man movies several times but this does not feel like it's worth a re-watch at all, which is a shame.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But I put that aside, as I wanted so, so badly to like this movie. Paul Rudd is an amusing and likeable chap, even though the jokes and dialogue between him and his quantam-travelling family were old and heavy and stale, without a spark of spontaneity.Evangeline Lilly is stunning, even on a bad day. But then, she must have had a series of awful days, because they managed to turn the astonishing Elven captain from the Hobbit, into a frumpy librarian and then punish her by restricting her dialogue to a few meaningless responses.Michael Douglas looked thoroughly bored and if I hadn't caught dollar signs in his eyes now and again, I would have thought he'd been blackmailed into returning to this franchise.Kang was played by a wooden puppet as far as I could tell, although I couldn't see the strings, so the effects department covered those up well. Good for them. An award please!Katherine Newton who played Rudd's grown-up daughter did shine with enthusiasm as did some of the side characters. But the plot was old and full of cobwebs from other movies: The Return of the Jedi, Braveheart, Lawrence of Arabia and every other movie where a downtrodden people are prodded into revolution. I kept looking for an Ewok to appear, but sadly no, unless I missed them in the crowd of other creatures that had little, if anything, in common.It was big on effects in order to disguise that it was poor on story, so if all you are looking for is fast-moving eye-candy, then this is the one for you.Perhaps the one bright spot was the determined professionalism of Michelle Pfeiffer, who somehow managed to look and act younger and more dynamic than her 'daughter'.If it wasn't for her, I would have wandered out of this tired rehash of old plots halfway through, instead of doing that with ten minutes to go. Somehow it was more interesting to go and watch people going in and out of the various screens than continue to the end. 4/10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

If people don't go to see these movies in the cinema Disney still makes money on their channel. It is truly horrible that money is the objective here.

It's not a terrible movie, and I'm sure many viewers will be entertained and wowed by the world building inside the Quantum Realm. But I was sadly underwhelmed as I was hoping for a different type of realm: one that is truly unique, different, out-of-this-world, and even hard to grasp and understand. Instead, I felt it was a rather dimly-lit, messy place that could still exist within the constructs of our understanding of physics and the world we inhabit. In other words, this didn't feel like a different dimension. It didn't feel otherworldly. And there are missed opportunities to build and make our visit to the Quantum Realm a weird, magical, and truly trippy awe-inspiring ride.To add to its detriments, this movie feels like a copy of ""Star Wars"" meets ""Strange World"". There are some attempts at trying to create cool, new alien creatures as semi-interesting, yet minuscule supporting characters. However, these are definitely not developed enough to establish a meaningful connection, nor are they inventive enough to really inspire wonder. There are scenes throughout that are startlingly similar to several of the ""Start Wars"" films, but I won't mention specifics to keep this as spoiler-free as possible.At the end of the day, I felt distant from the story. I did not care about the characters as much as I did in the first two installments, and the plot of a rebellion and a ruthless dictator-like villain also feels rehashed and very ""Star Wars"". The attempt to build some emotional resonance with the Scott Lang and Cassie Lang characters, via the father-daughter conflict, as well as the involvement of Hope Van Dyne as the Wasp, feels underveloped and underutilized - almost like they just put their familial conflicts on the back burner as the movie progressed.The movie eventually becomes what feels like a misplaced war movie against Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan Majors as Kang is one of the saving graces of this movie because his performance is commanding, intimidating, and full of personality. The scenes that stand out the most belong to him, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer, who is strong and captivating as Janet Van Dyne.As the first entry in the 5th age of Marvel, I was not impressed and rather bored. I hope the MCU strives to find ways to make better written stories that are more inventive and memorable. And let's amp up those special effects because they're getting sloppy. Also, let's bring back Michael Pena's funny and spunky Luis character, who is sorely missed.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The big key there was good writing, action sequences and introducing Michelle Pfieffer as Janet Van Dyne a role which proved a good fit for her.Adding in Bill Murray to this installment as well as my admiration for the other two films left me very excited for part 3.However it was also somewhat concerning that they were releasing it so early in the year in February as the previous films were both summer blockbusters.Granted Hollywood has taken the traditional dump months of January and February in the last decade and released some good if not great films (Black Panther the original was a good example of this) so it wasn't a huge concern but did seem rather odd they didn't release it in July as Ant Man seems more like a summer type of movie anyways.Then the reviews came in. Critics can be wrong but I have found if the reviews are bad for a Marvel movie then they are usually spot on.Good examples of this were Eternals which was trash in my opinion and the critics were right in saying so, and the most recent Thor putting recieved mixed reviews and as a result was just very average.The good news is the movie could have been worse the bad news is it's barely any better than Eternals which was horrible.The story just doesn't have enough action and is way too slow and while Majors an slang, Newton as Cassie and Murray as Krylar give their very best in their roles, Rudd, Lilly, Pfieffer and Douglas all seem less energetic than usual and don't even look like they are having a good time and share the audiences sympathy that they are just as tired of this series as we now are.Murray's cameo was a standout but he's barely in the movie and unless he had an expanded role it's a waste of his talent.The pacing is also very sluggish which really hurts the movie even more compared to its predecessors and other Marvel entries.Hollywood needs to remember why we fell in love with these movies and stick to the formula that makes them good.Being mildly disappointed with Thor 4 and very disappointed with this and Eternals I'm concerned Marvel is running out of gas a lot and they need to have a lot fresher material if they are going to continue with more sequels.Not the worst movie but a tremendous disappointment. I not only recommend you skip seeing it in theaters but I wouldn't recommend even streaming it on Disney Plus when it comes out to streaming.Stream the first two films again and save your time and money by skipping this one.I know it's already a big hit but this is a huge step down in the good quality Marvel has offered us before.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I will say though the plot was a little rushed. It felt like they were in the Quantum realm too soon in the movie.

And the only reason I'm counting this as a good thing is because Phase 4 stood more on quantity over quality, and that's one of the main reasons why I think Phase 4 is the worst phase in the MCU right now, but I still think Marvel needs to give there developers time to actually get things done properly, and it seems like we're slowly getting there, but I still don't think it's enough as of right now. Maybe the visuals will get worse in this phase, but as of now I don't think it's too bad in this film.Well will you look at that, I've run out of positive things to say. Alright now with that out of the way let's get down to the REAL stuff;My first complaint is why the actual heck is the action in this movie so boring? Like yo until the end we get literally nothing. With a mediocre story like this, why not have some really cool action sequences to make up for it? Marvel has had some amazing action sequences throughout the years. Take Thor: Love and Thunder for example, I never really liked that movie all too well, but at least there was action to make me enjoy it. But nah, I guess Marvel thought we'd all love to see some high-tech guards get knocked out every time Kang leaves the room. Though I will admit that the action does start to improve in the third act of the movie, but I still think the story went a little too simple with the action scenes. They went so insanity cheap with the action sequences that I don't even know why this film even has 'Action' as their main genre at this point.Now for the character that almost made me want to leave the theater entirely, I introduce to you MODOK. This Mental Organism makes sense why it's Designed Only for Killing, as how this character makes me want to kill myself. Yes I'm being dramatic of course, but for real though, this character serves no purpose in this film other than being a punching bag for every living character in this film, this guys seriously a joke, and not a funny one might I mention. I'm not too familiar with MODOK in the comics, but I'm pretty sure he's supposed to be a threatening killing machine, and he's none of those things as he barely even kills in this film, in fact he's had many opportunities to kill Casie and fails to do so, and this is an issue because he's commanded to murder her at one point in the film. Take MODOK from this film entirely and nothing changes, in fact you'd be doing this film justice by him not being around.Overall, this film was made entirely to set up for Loki season 2 and The Kang Dynasty, and that's basically it. Sure, it's watchable and still an enjoyable ride, but really serves no other purpose in the MCU than to set up for future projects. This film had so much potential and I really wished it could have been better, and I just know there's a timeline out there somewhere that lived up to my expectations.TL;DR: A great film for setting up other projects, but not so well as a stand-alone movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It seems like Disney is more interested in milking the idea for all its worth than in actually crafting a well-written plot that makes sense. The result is a film filled with so many plot holes that it's hard to take anything that happens seriously.It's frustrating because I used to enjoy trying to come up with theories about the movies I watched, but now it feels like a waste of time. When the plot is so poorly constructed, it's hard to invest in the characters or care about their actions. Instead, I'm left wondering how the writers could have overlooked so many inconsistencies and gaps in logic.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is a fantastic addition to the Ant-Man franchise, as it delivers a perfect blend of action, comedy, drama, and sci-fi that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film.The exploration of the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible, was truly remarkable.The introduction of Khang's character, who is an Avengers-level threat and a time-traveling conqueror with multiple variants, was also impressive. He added a new layer of complexity and challenge to Ant-Man's story. The acting performances by Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonathan Majors were outstanding. They brought their characters to life with charisma, humor, emotion, and chemistry.Overall, I believe this is the best Ant-Man movie to date, and I am confident that anyone who watches it will thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Otherwise there is nothing proper that seems to have build up in this movie. First of all JONATHAN MAJORS as KANG is PURE GOOSEBUMPS. What a performance by him literally Stoles the show from everybody. The way he portrays the role of kang is simply superb. Story and plot is very weak as compare to previous antman movies. J don't why so rush director has to introduce kang if you don't have a proper story and you all just rely on Kang's Shoulders. I'm shocked to see that Wasp doesn't even have a proper dialogue in the whole film I mean literally she is one of the main characters and you didn't even give her the proper role she deserves. Very poor writing, Screenplay is fast very fast paced doesn't even build the main characters properly and rush to conclusion. CGI is good but 90% characters are CG so sometimes it is hard to connect with the new ones. Paul Rudd as antman is promising but he should deserves better. Janet in her role is amazing and good to watch. Storywise movie is very average but the performance of KANG save the film and the mid-credit & post-credit is the highlight of the film do not miss that....(5/10)","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd is still great as the main character. Unfortunately, as soon as it goes to ""the quantum realm"" (about 20 minutes in) it stays there for the rest of the movie.I didn't particularly like the quantum realm stuff in pre-endgame movies, I thought it was too silly: populated with giant versions of single-cell organisms. But now it's waaaaaaay sillier, like a bunch of primary school kids got to design a character each. The realm is now populated with all kinds of creatures, even human, although they all look completely different. There is no explanation of what they are, where they come from, it's just a bunch of made-up nonsense. I love sci-fi and fantasy, but the makers of this film have somehow managed to take a blank canvas of a concept and just doodle all over it without absolutely nothing of interest to look at or think about. And the plot cannot save it. If you are following the MCU, you can skip this whole movie and it won't make any difference to anything.I absolutely loved most of the MCU up until endgame, enjoyed most superhero movies most of my life, but the last couple of MCU I've seen at the cinema (this and Wakanda Forever) I actually thought about leaving the theatre after the first 45 minutes. I didn't, because I believe in giving a movie a chance in the first viewing at least. However, to assume people would want to watch this nonsense for 3 hours is very optimistic.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The most clever one liners were spoiled in the trailers already.-A particularly absurd and annoying character that was wholly unnecessary to the plot development, but was necessary for the movie as it would otherwise be another unmemorable multiverse adventure.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It doesn't really spoil anything, but it does discuss some non-important parts and hints to others.)I honestly loved it! It had heart, action, and of course comedy. I loved the father-daughter connection between Casey and Scott the entire movie. This movie also has some great new characters. I will say one word; hole. If you know who I'm talking about, they were a great addition to the strange and unknown Quantum Realm, and I just thought they added nice comic relief in serious parts. I believe if Luis, Dave, and Kurt went into the Quantum Realm, it would have been the funniest movie of the year!I also can't wait to see Casey's character in the MCU again. If you're considering watching this movie, I believe you will like it. Some people say it's too weird, and I will say, it is. But, it is the Quantum Realm, so it kind of has to be based on how the comics are, and what the Quantum Realm looked like in the first and second Ant-Man movie. Also, I love how we see Scott's day-to-day life after the snap, and how he basically saved everyone (with the van).Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy/enjoyed the movie!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie felt overstuffed, trying to cram too many plotlines and characters into its runtime without allowing the audience to fully process what was happening.While the humor was still enjoyable, it often felt like a distraction from the convoluted plot. Paul Rudd's performance as Ant-Man was as endearing as ever, but it wasn't enough to salvage the film's lack of heart.One of the movie's highlights was Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang. His performance injected much-needed energy and personality into the film, leaving audiences excited for what's to come in the future of the MCU.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had its moments, but it failed to capture the magic of the earlier Ant-Man films. Its lack of focus and emotional depth left you feeling unfulfilled, despite the impressive visuals and performances from the cast.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

All the acting was good no complaints, I thought Jonathon Majors stood out as the best .What I didn't likeA story has to have a begining a middle and an end. They don't have to be presented in that order, but they do all have to connect.This film connected them very very badly.Almost as if somebody said ""I loved Starwars and all the desert people and the jawas, can we do that?""
""Yes sure"", they answered ""we can just say they have been zipped to a multi-underverse, through an inter galatic wormhole by a falangee, the audience will love it""So there were long scenes that were clearly inspired (to be nice) or more accurately a 'rip off' of star wars - That was the first 'Jar' assuming we swallowed the glib convenient way our heroes arrive in 'star wars desert scene'. Hundreds of 'ant men' reminded me of the Matrix and the agents - another 'borrowed' idea?Bill Murray appears as Lord something or other - that had not the slightest relevance to anything. The scene could be deleted and you wouldn't noticeThereafter it's just a mish mash of scenes. There is no real story for the audience to invest in.That I think is the problem. This is not a story, it's just a slide show of 'cool scenes' which individually don't tell a story, or tell it badly and boringly.I literrally was watching the film and waiting for it to end. 5/10Would I watch it again ? Absolutely not.This film should be despatched, back to the multi-underverse of low quality mediocrity from whence it came, as quickly as possible.Not worth the price of a cinema ticket.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"4","/10","The First MCU Film I Have Ever Disliked","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8878679/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2023","I am a massive fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (also known as the MCU), which is why writing this review is about to sting. Going back to the beginning of the franchise over a decade ago with Iron Man, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, and their culmination in The Avengers, it all felt special. Yes, after that there were a few stumbles with Thor: The Dark World (which I still mildly enjoy) and Iron Man 2 (which I think gets a worse rap than it deserves), but I've always at the very least thought their projects were anywhere from fine to fantastic. Well, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has now hit theatres and after 41 projects, this is the first one I have straight-up disliked. This film is troublesome for the franchise, and here's why.The story picks up after the events of Avengers: Endgame. Scott Lang's daughter Cassie has been studying science and the Quantum Realm when Scott was trapped for five years. Her curiosities send the two of them, Hope Van Dyne, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne back into the Quantum Realm together, which leads them to discover that there are entire civilizations living down there. Meeting many new faces and learning that Janet knows of a man named Kang that cannot be released, leads to his big introduction as the new big Marvel villain.This film is basically an introduction to make you buy into this new character of Kang (who was also briefly introduced in the Loki series on Disney+) and I absolutely did. I think Jonathan Majors is absolutely amazing in this role and I can't wait to see all of his future appearances. So why did I dislike it then? Let's dive in.The scenes involving Kang are great, some of the good humour from the past Ant-Man films is also present, and the cast all work very well together as always. With all of that said though, this film is a series of spectacle moments and CGI action sequences, mostly involving characters that the film did not even take the time to make me care about. Everything about the events of this film (excluding Kang) seems inconsequential to the MCU as a whole, or even to the Ant-Man films. It doesn't really feel like an Ant-Man movie, but rather a long side mission that felt plucked out of an Avengers movie. To me, it just did not work.On top of everything, you can visually see that Marvel has been struggling with quantity over quality because there are many moments where I felt like I was watching something budgeted for television. If I first saw this film on Disney+ it would've made much more sense. I hate bagging on movies, especially in a franchise I love so much, but when a film is meant to set up the next huge villain and you want people to flock out and witness that, it just does not seem like enough time or care was put into this story, or even visually (but I also understand the circumstances of Visual Effects artists currently being overworked in the industry too). For something that is supposed to be the start of something much bigger, it is quite a mess in my opinion.In the end, the biggest issue going forward is that people who watch the next Avengers movie may not be able to fully grasp who Kang is and what he can do if they do not watch some of the other films he has appeared in. This has never been an issue with the MCU before. Thanos was teased but never a core character in anything before Avengers: Infinity War. I love this franchise (I will say that a million more times too) and I cannot wait for the next film to be released, but I really hope this studio can figure out a way of making the next event movie accessible to average moviegoers, otherwise, I think they are about to start losing a lot of their audience. Again, this is only the first film I have even remotely disliked after about 41 projects, so obviously, I am still completely on board with everything, but for such a pivotal moment in this franchise, colour me a little worried. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now playing in theatres.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Whilst I enjoyed the previous films with Antman et al, Marvel's new obsession with the quantumverse & metaverse makes these latest movie issues much less relatable to. If apparently anything is possible then who knows (or cares) what happens next?

After the build up from Loki, I was really excited to see how this would go. But then the reviews came out and kept coming so I decided to wait. Smart decision because wow this isn't good.How does the MCU keep screwing up? This was seriously a lay-up from having an established franchise that's not half bad in Ant Man and then Loki building up Kang. This was literally bad from the beginning as soon as he picks up his (yet another progressive woke complainer) daughter. And now there's basically an entire Star Wars world that is the Quantum Realm now which also has the original Ant Man villan as M. O. D. O. K, hence my subject line.And then maybe this is just me being stupid but in End Game when Scott Lang is explaining the Quantum Realm and they thought it must have been a hard 5 years and he said that's the thing, it was more like 5 hours. Doing the math, Janet was down there for 30 years but in that world it was 30 hours right?And it's a bummer because in addition to the Ant Man franchise being decent and the build up in Loki, I actually really like Majors in general and think he's a good actor!I don't know how much longer the MCU has got because the good ones still left can't keep bailing out all the bad ones out lately.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought it would simply be a fun little adventure with solid comedy and enough action to please a 2 hour watch time. And yet I was somehow drastically disappointed.First of all I didn't completely hate this movie evident from me giving it a 5/10. So to get all of the good out of the way:And unfortunately that's about it. I would go into detail but I don't want to spoil much people can still enjoy this movie. So now that the good is out of the way let's get into everything else.To start with anything I'll just quickly mention that the script was so uninspired and dull. It was honestly hard to tell if the script was bad or the acting cause so much of the dialogue just sounded unrealistic.Another point is the comedy. Some of it was quite funny and made me chuckle but nowhere near the quality of the first movie and even the second. Alot of this fell flat also just because of the bad script.I honestly disliked most of the characters which is not saying much since there are only like 7 who actually do anything. Hank felt like a massive missed opportunity especially due to the lack of screen time or focus on his character. Cassie had a decent start but they provided us with little reason to relate and become attached to her. The secondary villain (who I won't state the name since they did not show up in much advertisement) became a full on joke outside of their introduction which was actually really cool. But what's worse is Hope. I don't have a massive issue with her character but that's because she barely did anything in a movie that's literally named after her??? I think she had even less dialogue than Hank. It just felt like a massive waste since i actually liked her in the previous movies.I'm sorry but this should not have been an Ant Man movie. The previous films were much more grounded and that was respected and made sense. But this movie just felt too massive for Ant Man to be playing a significant role in. It's great that we got to see what was going on in the quantum realm but I just wish they used other characters for a plot like this.The action was a mixed bag cause whilst I would say that the final act had some interesting and cool fight scenes, the rest of the movie falls flat and provided few fight scenes which were actually impressive or engaging. Even in the third act many of the fights were awkwardly split up in order to fit everything else going on. It felt as if they spent more time making cool cgi scenery rather than choreographing or developing well thought out and simply ""cool"" fights. They just felt underwhelming.A small nitpick but the music was so boring and cliche compared to the other entries. The main Ant Man theme is amazing and has become an iconic piece of music for that specific character yet it barely shows up in this movie and when it does it just randomly stops to play some inconsistent pieces of music.And that's about it. It consisted of a few impressive scenes and fights aswell as impressively introducing the main big bad for the upcoming MCU movies. However, it drastically reduced its rating with an underwhelming first and second act, sub par comedy and characters who were either wasted or treated as a joke. 5/10 but honestly close to a 4/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

For the most part it just felt like going through the motions of a Superhero movie. They also set up a torch-pass for Kathryn Newton to take over as some form of Ant person. The weird ""activism"" theme they put into the movie was so half-hearted and lame, it gave me douche-chills.MODOK was wasted because the writers don't have respect for the material. The reason he works in the comics is because he's (mostly) written seriously even though he's a ridiculous character. The writers just threw him in there as a joke, and not a good one.Jonathan Majors portrayal of Kang doesn't feel like someone who's familiar with the character, he came off very ""villain of the week"". Really they shouldn't even be showing Kang's face yet, the way he's written would be an obvious setup for something called a ""reveal"", but only good filmmakers know what that is. And REALLY Kang shouldn't come before the Fantastic Four are introduced, but that's just logic at play.Looked like Billy Murray's agent pulled some strings, tried to get him the ""Jeff Goldblum treatment"", and it was just pointless. He was there for 3 minutes, there was nothing funny, and then he was gone. The whole cameo boiled down to ""hey look there's Bill Murray"".Paul Rudd is good, but he looks like he's getting sick of being Ant-Man, which is why they set up the torch pass. Wouldn't be surprised if they give him and Evangeline Lilly a heroic death as an exit, she was almost total set dressing in this movie.Pfeiffer seems to enjoy being in these movies, Michael Douglas just seems happy to be relevant. They're a couple of professionals doing their job.Newton was fine. She needs to get a little more comfortable with green-screen acting, but she'll get there.The digital sweatshop must have worked overtime because it was a CGI spectacle. Pretty much all of the praise I have for this movie goes to the effects department, because it looked great. I like that sort of dirty, fleshy, pinkish coloration. For some reason it worked.4/10. See it if you want, but Kang is being done generic enough that you're not going to be confused the next time he shows up.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Scott after saving the world seems to be getting back to his life with Thanos. Wrote a book, was treated like a hero by the public and still trying to make up lost time with his Daughter. The whole family are shown Cassie and Hank have been working on a project involving the Quantum realm and receive signal, but after a mishap, they all get sucked into the realm and have to now find a way home while also dealing with an interdimensional tyrant Kang the Conqueror. Quantumania in many ways is more the typical Marvel Formula with poor visual effects and unwarranted humor. Overall It's more of a film that's only purpose is to set up further events as opposed to having a fun self-contained story. In the long run, it serves no purpose outside of introducing moviegoers to Kang. The first 35 minutes of the film are almost pointless showing Scott, hope, and all of them and showing that Scott has a separation between himself and Cassie, but it doesn't set up much in terms of development. As soon as they hit the Quantum Realm that is thrown away in favor of just showing off the realm. Honestly, it is not all that interesting. As opposed to Doctor Strange's. This is CGI Splattered all over the Screen that is devoid of much in terms of life. You have no idea how this world works. You micro people living here some that look human others that look like blobs and all amounts strange designs. There's a rebel group, not a single thing you will know about them. Yet you suppose to care about them being free from Kang. The World's forgettable as for the main cast most of them are boring and outraged. A huge issue with Ant-Man and The Wasp was that Scott was reduced to an idiot while the focus was primarily going to hope. Here He kinda takes a backstage again, this time by Michelle Pfeiffer who is a talent and actress, even though it is poorly written why she doesn't tell anyone about Kang. Hope does very little in the majority of the film and Michael Douglas is just there. His big moment comes near the end and it's really stupid the explanation. As for the villains, The Highlight is Jonathan Majors as Kang When he's introduced, it's almost like you entered a different movie, and while it shows potential for this character. He also has its weak points, because given the stern serious tone he goes with it just stands out that this wasn't the right film for him to debut with all this marvel humor and just undermines him in the end. He also does suffer from the fact that they explain just the basic of who he is without going into depth. Modok is just stupid and yes he's look is a little stupid in the comics with the huge head and baby legs, but still has an opposing monster look to him. Here it's just silly and everything he does is just silly it's not even Modok they just recycle the previous villain's yellowjacket. Overall it forgettable movie with no real stakes.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

there isn't a movie or show Ive missed from marvel.. but wow.This movie made me rethink my choices.This was a Wannabe star wars cringe fest.I'll start off with the obvious good part - CGI was good. That's about it. But that isn't really saying much either with the amount of cash Disney spend on their films.The plot was obvious and overdone a million times. Script was weak and super cliche (not in a good way) , the humor didn't live up to the last two films at all, fighting scenes felt childish, and the acting was bad.I'm giving this 3 stars even though it probably deserves less, just because it still leads up to an important story in the MCU and I'm a longtime Paul Rudd fan as well as a marvel geek.

The humour was fine but a bit tiring since the movie didn't know if it wanted to take itself seriously or not. There were so many scenes that got ruined because of out of place jokes that shouldn't be there, there were some boting and uninteresting side characters and side plots and it felt like they realised how bad the movie was when it was too late...

However, after watching the film, I can't help but feel disappointed. Despite the hype and anticipation surrounding this movie, it falls short of delivering a truly captivating and memorable experience. As much as I wanted to love it, I have to say that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a mediocre addition to the MCU.First and foremost, the storyline of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is convoluted and lacks originality. The film follows Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd) as he teams up with Hope van Dyne (played by Evangeline Lilly) to rescue Janet van Dyne (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) from the quantum realm. While this premise had the potential for an engaging and unique adventure, the execution falls flat. The plot feels disjointed and overly complex, with multiple subplots and time travel elements that are confusing and hard to follow. It fails to deliver a cohesive and compelling narrative that keeps the audience fully engaged.Moreover, the character development in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is lackluster. Scott Lang, who was previously portrayed as a witty and charismatic hero, feels watered down in this film. He lacks the depth and complexity that made him endearing in the previous Ant-Man movies. Hope van Dyne, as the Wasp, also falls short in terms of character development. She is relegated to a supporting role and lacks the agency and screen time to fully shine as a strong female character. The film introduces new characters, such as Kang the Conqueror (played by Jonathan Majors), but fails to provide them with enough depth and backstory to make them truly memorable.The humor, which was a highlight of the previous Ant-Man movies, feels forced and repetitive in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The jokes often fall flat, and the comedic timing feels off, resulting in awkward moments that do not land as intended. The film tries too hard to replicate the humor of the previous films, but it lacks the freshness and originality that made the first Ant-Man movie so enjoyable.Another disappointing aspect of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the action sequences. While the film features a decent amount of action, the choreography and visual effects are underwhelming. The fight scenes lack the creativity and innovation that we have come to expect from the MCU, and the special effects feel subpar compared to other recent Marvel films. The action sequences feel repetitive and uninspired, and they do not leave a lasting impression.Despite these flaws, there are some positives in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The performances of the cast are solid, with Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly giving their best despite the weak material. The film also touches on themes of family, sacrifice, and second chances, which add emotional depth to the story. The chemistry between the characters, especially the father-daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie Lang (played by Abby Ryder Fortson), is heartwarming and provides some heartfelt moments.In terms of visuals, the film does have some visually stunning moments, particularly when it comes to the quantum realm sequences. The colorful and psychedelic visuals are a treat for the eyes and add a unique aesthetic to the film. However, these visually stunning moments are not enough to compensate for the film's other shortcomings.In conclusion, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a mediocre Marvel movie that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But that means it's nowhere near Marvel's own set standard. It has some serious structural and writing issues. The big positive side is the villain, which kinda saves the movie to totally crash.That is owed to the performance of Jonathan Majors, who's since Loki up there with the MCU's finest and most fascinating antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. He owns the screen in an almost shakespearean way and - if handled well for Loki S2, Avengers 5&6 and Co. - could very well end up becoming a historic villain for cinema like Thanos and Joker. Putting him against Ant-Man is a genius paring. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang beautifully.The rest of the performances are all okayish to good. Paul Rudd is born to play Scott Lang, bringing in his natural witt and charm as loveable as ever.Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between her and Rudd leaves space for improvement. Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job, doing the best she can overcoming the underwhelming writing of her character. Michael Douglas is always a delight to watch, we all should be thankful to have such a legend playing the role of Dr. Hank Pym. I was positively surprised about the size of his role, he gets way more to do than in the last film. He also is the star in the coolest scene of the whole movie. (Ant-Charge!)Where this film really lets down is the second act. There's an aesthetic emptiness to everything that felt almost soul-crushing to me who so deeply connects to the MCU and it's lifelike world.The writing of Janet was really annoying. She hummed and hawed around with everything she was doing and hesitated to inform her family about Kang for nearly 1 and a 1/2 hour straight until she suddenly broke out with the whole backstory of the two. Jeff Loveness has a big issue with dramaturgically natural script / character / dialogue development.The third act, with Kang moving into the spotlight, gladly comes with a shift in quality and tone. It also suddenly boasts some really enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy. The makeup, masks and costumes were really creative and I digged the Star Wars theme behind it all. The end fight with Kang and Scott was some brutal stuff and almost gave me a feeling of fear for Scott which the rest of the movie never managed to create.All in all I see lots of potential for the rest of the multiverse saga, especially with Kang and his variants moving into the spotlight as we come closer to the big Avengers finale. But with Quantumania I have the clear feeling that the script was rushed to get the film out and give the audience a taste of Kang. They focused mostly on that and ultimately let down the actual stars of the movie Ant-Man and especially Wasp itself. They got sidelined in their own movie and haven't really undergone any character development. The credits in the end read: KANG WILL RETURN. I think that speaks a lot of what we take from this film.I loved the two post credit scenes, the future looks definitely exciting. But I can only hope Kevin Feige don't looses sight of what made the MCU so loved and successful since the very beginning: good writing.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's sad that her part in this film is so miniscule, which doesn't help it's case.Not entirely sure if this is a better sequel than ""the Wasp"", as the strange pacing at the beginning and a lack of action and cool set-pieces not only hurts repeatability, but even the first watch. The story is also very linear and simplistic, with plenty of dull and flat moments, while exuding ""wanting to be more"" but doesn't get there. There are no layers or payoffs, and I wish we could do without many of the tropes it uses (as they feel tiring by now). ""No risks, no thrills"" as they say.The CGI is okay in some parts, not so much in others, but has some good designs and concepts! Most of the cast is enjoyable as always!But then, there is the matter of the villain.. Considering it is an Ant-Man standalone movie with the expected structure (and Peyton would wouldn't have the stones to do otherwise), there's only one way things end!We also get, story-wise, a ""weak"" version of Kang. Which isn't a good look to what is going to be the threat moving forward.And on the back of my head, I kept thinking : When the entire multiverse spits out whole branching universes when someone decides to do something (see Loki's series), actions start to seem pointless. And the appeal of our versions of the Avengers (now that the ""good ones"" are gone) starts to diminish.. Could I be watching an Ant-Man movie from a more interesting time-line instead?Wouldn't go out of my way to watch this on theaters!

He feels like a DC villain: cheesy and played like a cartoon villain from the morning shows I grew up with. I'm not sure how much of that is Jonathan Majors or a directorial choice, but I didn't like it.There are parts that had potential, but we don't get enough of them. Even the comedy (the little there is) falls flat. The Kang plot line is going to be around at least until the end of phase 5 in 2026.. if anyone is still watching by then.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Quantumania is REALLY bad. The writing, the directing, the visuals, and the performances all range from mediocre to straight up awful.The entire quantum realm (or world, whatever) reminds us of the Star Wars franchise in some ways, but is ugly. It is sanitized and modified to be consistent with the MCU aesthetic for space and multiverses (Doctor Strange, Loki, and Guardians etc). It feels like we are supposed to be wowed by everything, but it is just worse, corporate-made, soulless, AI-generated versions of what we all saw before. From the creatures to landscape to overall colors and visual aura. Is it too much to ask for some new, different visual takes on MCU? Comparing this to The Way of Water which came out just 2 months ago, you can really feel that less care and precision is taken care into each MCU movie.The 2nd half of the movie, while didn't fix every single problem I had, was entertaining to watch. The stakes are there unlike the first half, more interesting stuff to grab your attention, and the final battle is mix between Star Wars prequels and Aquaman with the Ant-Man characters. Even though I did have *some* fun with this, I cannot help but think why can't we have movies that are fun from beginning to end. CBMs like The Suicide Squad or The Batman. Doctor Strange 2 had way more interesting directing choices than this. Why can't the biggest film franchise in the world have more soul and artistry? Movies like Eternals and MoM were criticized a lot but I'd rather have those movies over something like this.I'm really struggling to give this one a rating. It is a mixed bag, there are so many aspects that bother me giving a positive rating, but then I remember having fun. Maybe some time passes, those momentary fun will evaporate from my brain and just a bad movie will remain in my memory. The comedy didn't really land, none of the performances were outstanding besides Jonathan Majors, this really is another MCU product. But a worse one than usual. Hell, I forgot to mention how this is basically another 'setup' movie. No significant character arc or consequences and the ending is just another return to the status quo. I've been a casual MCU fan that watches their movies when they come out and have some fun, but lately the decline in quality & my investment and enthusiasm is Very noticeable. I really feel like James Gunn's DCU will surpass MCU in 2020s if this trend continues.Maybe I'm being too harsh, again, since I did have some fun, but this is my review.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

While still leagues better than the abhorrent eternals, and aboit on par with the terribly underwhelming love and thunder, ant man 3 doesn't do much to break out if the consistent mediocrity of the MCU in the last few years. The film tries so hard to do so much that the world building isn't even memorable for future films. The casting decision of Jonathan Majors as Kang is about the worst I've seen for the franchise. This guy has no place being a classic marvel villain and doesn't come close to being even serviceable. Easily the worst aspect of the mediocre film. The MCU is officially in MAJOR(S) trouble.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Aside from the odd casting of Cassie (plus the dialogue between her and Scott is silly), the cast was excellent. Michael Douglas comes full circle. Scott's and Hope's story is solid, and the crazy cast of characters in the Quantum Realm are terrific. Great set up for the Kang era of Marvel. The end credits are very well done, especially the final one.

Too bad there was no script for a movie. The story told straight would be a 20-minute movie, tops.Dumb people make dumb movies for dumb people. Marvel fits that bill nicely.

It was probably the second one after Avengers: Endgame that got me really interested in and that I was excited for, before it started.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania really is the first Marvel movie in a long time that got its balance right: It got some weird but fun ideas, sympathetic main characters and just the right amount and kind of humor between the needed seriousness.Additionally, it gave a deeper insight into the next ""Big Bad"" of the MCU (even though it was still rather superficial). This was underlined by an other greate thing I missed in a lot of recent Marvel movies: post credit secenes, that give a meaningful hint on the future without telling too much. Just the right amount to get hyped and speculate further.If Phase 5 continues like this, the MCU could get greate again.I would give it 8,5/10, so I generously rounded up a bit. :)","10 out of 32 found this helpful.

There were no highs nor lows, and I felt like I was driving Ms. Daisy around. What was the point?To set up the terror Kang, the Conqueror will reign in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Okay, then show that or leave it for a Disney plus special, but as a Marvel fan, I expected more for the big stage.Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantummainia doesn't find its tone or establish any conquered aspects that allow it to stand out. The movie felt less about ant man. There wasn't much comical appeal compared to the first one; they tired with Modok's huge face and some jokes about sexual creature experience, there's no love aspect, just set up, and I'm not convinced nor intrigued by what's presented.The possibility of Kang is promising, although why watch a movie for a promising for the future? For such a dynamic antagonist, it could've done more. The power on display was one of my favorite parts, but there wasn't enough action. Ant-man attempts to introduce us to a new world in the quantum verse, but it doesn't stick; it's so outrageous that it isn't relatable and somewhat illogical.Verdict: Ultimately this movie disappoints and gives us the same quality of marvel films we've been accustomed to since the new phase. Marvel needs a blockbuster quick; it needs to establish its tone bc these lackluster films don't meet standards.I rate it 5/10.Grade : D +

It's boring and predictable. Majors does an overall okay job as Kang, but after seeing the Creed III trailer it seems that this type of character is ""his thing"", so nothing special here to see.The biggest problem Quantumania has is that it only exists to introduce Kang for the next Avengers movie and it does this in the mid credit scene, which makes this whole movie unnecessary. They did the same with Thor 4 (Odin) and Wakanda 2 was also only used to set up the conflict of Wakanda 3.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Only certain specific speeds are authorized and all others are prohibited. In this very disappointing Marvel, we only see continuity. All movements are done exactly as in real life and this is a terrible fault. In addition, we should no longer speak of locality because the concepts of positions are non-existent at that level. So, for example, we should see Kang appear suddenly and see people move like Son Gohan when he had reached his full potential during the fight against Cell.As soon as I saw that Marvel started talking about time travel and especially quantum reality, I started to worry that they were going down paths that were way too complex for them. My fears have been confirmed since the Thanos saga, but it is with this film that we hit rock bottom.Superhero movies take a lot more talent than Hollywood gentlemen think. Especially those dealing with very advanced science or super powerful heroes (that's why all Superman movies are disappointments). For superhero movies, the director and writers would actually have to be geniuses.

GOOD: VFX, antagonist, funny moments
BAD: VFX, weak story, cringe momentsAnt-man movies were always different, an unexpected surprise, a good one. But this third installment was not good, despite some epic moments. Similar to previous MCU entries, the basic premise for the story wasn't compelling enough, and plain childish. Since there is a connection, Loki season 1 did a much better job at presenting/confirming the direction MCU is apparently going to.VFX was sometimes superb but also confusing or even poor quality (granted the nature of the Quantum Realm can be quite bizarre and confusing, but I'm talking about technical aspects).It had many funny and goofy moments, but the most cringe one was with MODOK, several times. It was unnecessary what the writers did with it. On the contrary, Kang was a very interesting antagonist.It's known these movies are part of something larger, but please writers: improve the writing so we can enjoy the next 2 Avengers movies.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Additionally, it's an Antman movie; I came to watch Antman, and all the different characters felt contrived and forced. It's repetitive, the same old Marvel recipe for the same old movie with the same old humor but with different characters and plots.

There are 6 consecutive scenes where characters ask other characters the question who and asked ones don't reply. Actors did a good job, visual effects were good. I watched it with Dbox experience and it definitely add to the enjoyment. I'd suggest everyone to go watch this movie in a movie theatre with 3D or at least Dbox otherwise can get a bit boring. I was expecting Kang to be a bit more intimidating since they claimed Kang is the new Thanos. But nope, still nothing beats Thanos :)","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie is very slow until Kang the Conqueror shows up halfway through the movie. Jonathan Majors plays the part well. The only thing is we've seen a tyrant try to take over the universe and his name is Thanos. Thanos was supposed to be the most powerful being in the universe because he had the Infinity Stones but now Kang seems to be even more powerful for absolutely no reason at all. I'm getting tired of the same repetitive stories in Marvel movies and now there will be more with Kang being the next Thanos. Oh well.

Where can you go after the multiverse, the quantum realm of course. I have to give it to Marvel cuz they stay finding great creative new dimensions. I also love that a lot of these are real scientific theories. I felt like this is what all the prior Ant-mans were building up to, and it delivered.The acting was great Paul Rudd is always solid but but Jonathan Majors (Kang), Michael Douglas, and Michelle Phifer stole the show for me. When I see this list a superhero movie is not what I'd expect to see them in together.The plot was pretty basic but you can tell it was an introduction to the Quantum Realm and Kang. It's implied both will be returning in future movie. I really enjoyed the humor throughout. I heard they hired one of the Rick and Morty writes and it payed off if you like that type of humor.The visual effects were stunning and seemless. I really enjoyed seeing it in 3D which added great clen depth in the important parts. Definitely a lot of eye candy and beautifully trippy scenery.The only thing that I would improve on would be some of the lazy camera work and or CGI. The background was out of focus a lot, I always like it when they then change focus to the back sometimes to switch it up. And lacked any noticeable artsy cinematography. It did feel a little rushed and lacked the finishing to make it a masterpiece. The 3D was lazy during non action scenes. I feel like if Marvel spaced out their movies just a little further they would have time to add the small extra bit of refinement this film needed.All and all it was an amazing beautiful, funny, fun movie and very entertaining. It's a great introduction to the Quantum Realm and Kang and can't wait to see where it goes! I'm giving it a 10 because I think it's being underrated as a whole. I get it won't be everybody's cup of tea but in a perfect world this movies deserves a 7.2 rating.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

On the contrary, this movie is the least enjoyable out of the trilogy, even with an outstanding performance from Rudd and Jonathan Majors. The writing is lazy. VFX are fantastic and really almost save the film. Cassie is extremely one dimensional and has the bulk of my troubles with the writing. Definitely one of the weakest Marvel movies to date, just edging out Eternals, Thor: The Dark World, and Black Widow. MODOK's story is actually enjoyable until the back half of the movie.

It's disappointing how this ant-man turned out considering how good the previous ones were. It had intriguing ideas but pacing was odd and logic fell through often. Like many Marvel phase 5 movies and the Star Wars Trilogy, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' has been plagued by Disney's newer approach to movie making: a checklist of ""things that need to happen"", million dollar VFX, a star studded cast and excessive humour. Forget the good story telling that grew such franchises, now it's all about the next bigger movie, the merchandise, and synthetically creating moments with the intent that they will ""trend"". Like Thor: Love & Thunder, this suffers from the ""the stakes are high and this is serious but we're cracking jokes so often this might as well be a slapstick comedy"".","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They had strong characters, with unique personalities that developed over time. They were flawed, funny, human, but somehow had certain qualities that enabled to overcome incredible odds.The best of the films were the origin stories, but many sequels, especially the 3 Spiderman films took entertainment to a whole new level. They were well scripted, directed and acted. Most importantly, they gave enough room to the characters to breathe and for the audience to connect with.Some of the Avengers films started to put spectacle above character and suffered by cramming too much in. This has increased in recent films. 10 rings was boring, the later Dr Strange film and everything to do with the multiverse that doesn't have Loki or Spiderman in it just doesn't work.This is no exception. It's boring. I don't care. I was hoping for some of the invention from the TV series like Loki, Moonknight or Wandavision. But by the numbers, bit set pieces, explosions, computer graphics, a baddie you don't care about of that seems menacing.Quantum starts well, with the walk down the street to camera 4th wall esq opening and ending. This links in with a character that appears later on which could have given the film a heart, but it doesn't. It slips back into something that seems like Disney have made a film by asking the audience to fill out of survey for what they think a superhero film is rather than a visionary piece of storytelling.I just don't care about Marvel any more. Disney are squeezing all life out of it, which is a shame. I just want it all to end.Please, no more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

How Marvel introduces their next main villain who struggles beat the ants is what the movie is all about.Ant-Man films are the kind of escapist cinema within the MCU that simply delivers on harmless fun. They try harder to be more but with all the science jargons, it always remains a simple story. The third film is also no different bur this time the screenplay simply lacks the charm.

There are also a number of impressive scenes that are highly imaginative and indeed, good fun eg the probability field. However, vast chunks are just plain silly and / or over the top with a story line full of holes eg why didn't Pfeiffer tell them about Kang, if Kang has full access to time lines, why doesn't he know what's going to happen and just pop the kettle on. The cast are fine if a bit dull and tired looking, leaving only Michael Douglas to have any fun, albeit Jonathan Majors is a fine scenery chewing nasty. With this in mind, the film lacks the humour of the first two and I got rather fed up with Ant Man and his daughter going all all goo goo at each other in just about every other scene.So overall whilst there is genuinely plenty to enjoy and indeed marvel at, it is still frequently plain daft and rather OTT.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They have saturated the market too much by being super successful and becoming lazy, thinking that even the stories that are not original or at least have original flavours would still be consumed and appreciated.This film suffers from bigger issues what is happening in superhero films recently. We have a brilliant base concept, like a Quantum world. Rather than bringing people who understand it and connect it to deeper feelings and storylines focus is on lasers and glittering lights. Rest is more like a storyline that will link some other film that will create another film.This model only works if people weaving the storylines does not have their personal and ideological agendas in forefront. They let the characters and stories knit the world itself.I do not think that Marvel will learn it in an easy way because we are talking about ideological mirage, confusion on what Art means to people in decision making places, lastly huge numbers of people and large nature of projects.Unfortunately, all of this would completely crash like X-MEN franchise. If some good people take a parachute out of this falling spaceship, we have a hope that these beautiful complex multilayer storylines can be re awaken.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One character hiding facts from others when infact that's the first thing they should do to clear the air. Fighting sequences weren't good either, nothing much to see. Cassie daughter of antman was the most irritating character in this movie, only there to scream dad..dad..and mess up. Acting of the main villain was too forced with those facial expressions. They should have done better with Kang. The only thing worthy enough were the costume concept of some and the wiggly run of red blob.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's hard to invest in a plot that's not interesting and lacks character development. Despite the nice visuals, the movie is paper-thin with weak characters and distracting acting.

My official score would be about an 8.8 out of 10 stars or maybe a 9.2 out of 10 stars, just because twice in the beginning of the film a character keeps something a secret for no real reason. But after that it is smooth sailing! Kang is a freaking beast! The special effects are great, the action doesn't disappoint, you get everything! A slugfest, shoot outs, battlefield action. They really did this well. The humor this there but doesn't take away from the movie's grand scope. This is the kind of movie you will be mad at yourself for if you do not watch it on a big screen! Characters are well developed. You do not have to worry about any kind of forced political or social messages, so yes it is safe for kids to watch.Who are these reviewers ranking it so low and why??? What movie did they watch? Trust me, this is an outstanding Marvel movie. It makes up for Thor 4 being trash. I liked the first Ant-Man movie, I honestly hardly even remember the second Ant-Man movie; but for Ant-Man 3 I can tell you this feels more like an Avengers movie because of how epic it feels and I am not complaining! Totally worth the price of admission! I can not watch to watch this again. I might even rewatch Loki season 1 before I watch this when it drops on Disney plus.

It's your classic good guy versus bad guy superhero trope. It is filled also with all kinds of Hollywood cliches such as the family drama about a secret past, the child who surpasses the parent's expectations, and so on. The idea of a Horton Hears a Who style of super tiny creatures living right underneath us in a micro world is cool but certainly not that unique. Furthermore, the civilizations displayed although interesting in terms of look and feel is one-dimensional and not dragged out like I would have wanted it to.The movie is funny sometimes but not frequently enough to be described as a fully entertaining watch. The action sequences are mostly hard to follow, there is simply too much happening on screen. The viewer is overwhelmed by laser guns and other similar over-the-top combat. If you despise movies that overuse hard sci-fi words without actually explaining the relevance of the science behind them, this is not the movie for you. Its quantum this and atomic that. I like the idea of multiple dimensions and that aspect of the movie is cool and I am waiting to see what happens in future MCU explorations of that idea. However, the multiverse aspect is done much more smoothly in the spiderman movies and animations. What carries this movie is the CGI, it is a visually striking piece. Particularly, in the beginning when they enter the quantum realm, it looks like an Alice in Wonderland kind of trip. Just go in with these things in mind and you might still get some enjoyment out of it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first two films are still my favorite films but this third film really amazed me. It is nothing like what we have seen in 2015 and 2018. The whole Marvel production worked really hard on making this film. When I saw the trailer, the setting sort of gave me a vibe from Guardians of the Galaxy or the Star Wars franchise. Paul and Evangeline still have great chemistry in the MCU. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer also have chemistry together. Kathryn Newton is fresh to the MCU and her character of Cassie Lang is awesome. I did see Kathryn in Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Jonathan Majors is a really great actor and he is the perfect man to play Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan's character is more intimidating than Tom Hiddleston and Josh Brolin. Jonathan really stole the entire movie. I've waited to see Kang the Conqueror and all the Marvel fans cheered for his arrival. I'm looking forward to see Jonathan in the upcoming MCU films in the future. I really want to see Jonathan win an award whether it is from the Oscars, People's Choice Awards, Teen Choice Awards or Kids' Choice Awards. Kang is my most favorite Marvel villain.There are a lot of great special effects and the film's humor is good. My dad, brother and I laughed at humorous parts. The action is what we wanted to see and we were amazed at our seats. Of course there were intense moments that almost made my heart beat fast and I was at the edge of my seat thinking that something was about to happen. That is how Marvel does it when we watch every film. Overall, this film is great to see the action, special effects and intense or emotional moments.","9 out of 30 found this helpful.

We were all pleased with this movie-going event and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.Michael Douglas' character was probably the best in my opinion though I did really like the element of him with Michelle Pfeiffer the way they played off each other was perfectly executed.","8 out of 26 found this helpful.

They totally ruined ant man like seriously guys he is an Avenger give some respect to him he is the one who woke the hopes of the Avengers. Even Jonathan's acting is superb but as a Marvel villain he is fail I just can't beleive guys, he is a Kang man 'Kang the conqueror' a movie has lots of potential but they totally waste it and also they forget to explain quantum realm or they just ignored intentionally I don't know but still this movie is enjoyable if you ignores the flaws.

Because (I think to cut costs) Marvel decides every single thing they make now has to revolve around Rick and Morty writers.Every single time they even attempt to make a joke it always ALWAYS lands flat. Maybe some slight bits quirky are sometimes cute but for almost everything I watched with a dead face.However...The only reason why I can say this has any value is M-effing Kang The Conqueror. THIS is a Marvel villain. Literally almost every scene he is apart of is even remotely Good. He's so much a threatening character to be a really good replacement to Thanos and Jonathan Majors makes this performance his own. His acting is almost TOO good for Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania.But unfortunately, there is a Yang to this Yin. And you pretty much know what it is - It's MODOK.I have never seen something butcher a really good villain so bad it becomes laughably awful even when he's not telling a joke, but here we are. And that Terrible CGI head isn't doing any favors either.Did they took inspiration from the Patton Oswald MODOK show? Because I swear MCU MODOK and stop motion MODOK are practically the same thing.However, despite MODOK's head the visual facts are really good especially for a Marvel movie.My Advice is for you to wait till it's on Disney+ if you just want to educate yourself before the next two avengers movies.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Instead of tackling a smaller scaled premise, it is meant to set up the next Thanos level villain for the entire MCU movie forward and it buckled under this pressure. Jonathan Majors as Kang is the best part of the movie, he is menacing and actually feels like a threat, partially because he doesn't have the typical MCU humour that the rest of the characters in this movie have. This humour makes large chunks of this movie feel more like a SNL sketch. For it being titled Antman and the wasp, the wasp is barely in it and Antman doesn't really have any character development through the movie.If you can switch your brain off it is a fun enough time but don't expect anything revolutionary.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, while ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" offers moments of brilliance, it fails to escape the criticisms that accompany it. One of the film's strengths is certainly the construction of the creative world of the quantum realm, a place full of strange creatures and surreal scenarios that captivate the viewer's imagination. Jonathan Majors shines in the role of the villain Kang the Conqueror, adding depth and menace to the story. However, despite these positive elements, the film fails to maintain a consistent pace. One of the main criticisms of the film lies in the possible fatigue of the superhero genre, reflected in a lack of enthusiasm in the main characters. Evangeline Lilly and Kathryn Newton fail to shine in their roles, while Peyton Reed's direction seems to lack the same enthusiasm as the previous chapters of the series. Furthermore, the film's plot becomes predictable in its second half, losing coherence in the characters and Kang's characterization. The lack of originality and excessive reliance on digital effects and expanded universe may disappoint some viewers looking for a more solid and engaging story. Despite these criticisms, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" still offers moments of entertainment and visual spectacle, keeping alive curiosity for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, a change of direction may be necessary to reinvigorate the creative spirit of the series and maintain high audience interest. In conclusion, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" presents itself as an ambitious film that, despite some strengths, fails to escape the criticisms that accompany it. It offers a journey through fantastic worlds and iconic characters, but it may not be enough to fully satisfy the expectations of Marvel Cinematic Universe fans.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Because we love the MCU we will watch any of them on repeat, including Multiverse of Madness and I will gladly watch this one again, probably multiple times.I feel that the CGI was wonderful except for one small (pretty big actually) new-ish character. I won't spoil it, but it was definitely interesting. Also, how many of us have actually lived through the quantum experience and come back to tell the tale? Exactly. They can make it what they want.I was extremely entertained by the usual quality I have come to expect from Marvel, not let down in any way.

Do you like the cgi because it's interesting to look at or dislike it because it's technically average cgi. Can you make sense out of all the plot holes and contrivances? Did you like both halves of the movie or prefer one? Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania has odds stacked against it because the way it is designed to go for the extremes of the type of experience it wants you to have.The extremes in question is technical aspects of the filmmaking (cgi, fight scenes, script) but also the tone. The ideas feel much larger than the movie lends itself to be. The fight scenes go from can go from well shot to disorientating. Script is seemingly full of plot holes, but also feels as if fans could have answers to everything. The movie seems to casually move about without trying to answer many questions I had regarding plot holes/contrivances. It wants you to just accept how it gets from point A to Z.I enjoyed the cgi. It wasn't ""great"" cgi, but I liked the way it looked for the world that it's set in. I also had some laughs, enjoyed many of the action scenes, and enjoyed Bill Murray a lot. Unfortunately, most everything I liked was in the first half of the movie. After the introduction of the villain, I slowly lost interest. 100 minutes in, the movie felt like it outstayed it's welcome. What happened was Ant Man decided to go larger and thus failed to feel darker. I much preferred the more simple story that was being set up before the real story came in to play.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is just a film.So, It is not... bad, but a disappointment.Three Wasps against Kang in Quantumania, ft. Two Ant-Mans/Ant-Men. It is basically a plot revolving around three wasps Janette, Hope with Cassie, and Scott and Hank doing their best. The first fifteen minutes or so, we watch every character mocking and sh.tting on Scott about... everything he does and he has done.One important question I had while watching: In the first film, they established that the smaller they get the more indestructible they get as well. So, in the quantum realms, they must me invincible, right? Even though they get huge for quantum realm? So why do they bleed and stuff?!As for Bill Murray cameo, I was really happy that it was not Jeff Goldblum. For a second there, I thought ""please, don't let Goldblum do a cameo in this film!"". That would have been annoying.The whole film is just green box filled with CGI, but how else were they going to pull it off, right?I do not want to spoil the ending even though there is nothing to spoil, so I will not give any details. The ending is the same as the endings of The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and The Rise of Palpatine. Come on Disney, write a different ending for once.

Visuals were great, story was good , action scenes were enjoyable everyone delivered a great performance especially Majors as KANG THE CONQUEOR, Paul Rudd was also great as ant man like previous mcu apperances.. It had some pacing issues but an epic 3rd act makes up for everything.. Final battle was really amazing and was on a big scale it also had some tense moments.. There is also a little bit of comedy, some good jokes.. Overall film is great which concludes this trilogy in a small big way meanwhile setting up stages for mega event movies AVENGERS THE KANG DYNASTY and AVENGERS SECRET WARS.. This film also acts as an introduction of Kang who is the main big bad of phase 5.... In last I want to say you can enjoy this film in cinema as an fun superhero action adventure movie featuring our favorite Marvel heroes and villains you won't be dissapointed especially young kids will enjoy this film very much...

This plot must have been done before. This movie must have been made before.For the most part, my thoughts were correct. No, I had never actually watched the movie before, nor has I watched any of Marvel's ""phase 5"" movies at the time. And yet, it sure felt like I had.The plot was so simple and predictable that it feels like an AI could have written it, and the Quantum Realm that most of the movie took place in felt like eerily like some sort of low-budget Star Wars ripoff saved only by the excessively high amount of CGI. I don't understand what the target audience for this movie was; most of the jokes were so childish as to belong in a Peppa Pig episode, but I suppose those viewers would be displeased with the entire cringe-worthy scene I had to sit through whose main joke was the simple line ""Don't be a dick.""
The villain was very obviously holding back due to the all-powerful plot armor that just about every ""good guy"" in the film had, and it seems that the only thing this movie did for the overarching story (although I must admit I'm not an expert on the MCU) was introduce the big bad Kang. The first and last scene were just about the same, following the tried-and-true hero's journey formula, except the juxtaposition seemed only to show that Ant-Man himself hadn't received a shred of character development throughout the 2 hours and 5 minutes that you should so definitely not watch.There were several fight scenes that I suppose would have been intriguing had they not been so easily predictable, but it's easy for any high-budget film these days to flash a couple of gunshots and fists into the frame and add a few minutes to the movie.The acting was fine for the most part, every character was believable except for the times I could not help but laugh at the obvious overacting of Kang's ""menacing"" moments.If you've got time to kill, I guess you can waste your time watching this on Disney+, but otherwise not even the most dedicated of MCU followers needs to see this generic garbage can of a movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Where this movie lacks for me, its plot and pacing, also the ending, but this is a spoiler free review. The plot isn't that interesting, so it fails to grab the viewers undivided attention. The pacing is jumbled and some of it felt forced, movie had no business being 2 hours long. In all honesty it felt unfinished, but yet this movie is incredibly important to the future of the MCU, so therefore it is a must see. As a standalone Ant-man, it's the best one. As a MCU movie following movies such as Spider-man No Way Home and Doctor Strange's Multiverse of Madness, this movie falls incredibly short.

The stuff is unreal. It's Comic Accurate. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, like the name it was all about quantum realm and Kang the conqueror was as cruel as in comics. Some people are complaining about Luis, he wasn't necessary in the movie or in the quantum realm. I Admire the movie a lot. And especially Katheryn Newton's (Cassie Lang) acting & hard work. She was great Cassie Lang at all. So go to theaters, & watch the movie while u can.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

If you saw Loki then you know who Kang is and this movie will give you very little new information on that character. I do not feel like this film really add anything new to the story with the exception of the end credit scenes. There was no really moral of the story or underlying message. The jokes seemed to fall flat and were poorly timed at moments that felt like there were supposed to be more serious than funny. I look to Marvel to be incredible story tellers and world building. This movie did not meet my expectations for that.

It all gets to be a mish-mash with loss of any real direction. It does somehow remain entertaining, despite its mediocrity.

But making a good movie with them would have been ideal. Douglas, Pfiefer, Rudd, Majors, and the additional actors should have been able to make a good product. But none of them could stand out with how disjointed and all-over-the-place this story was. Many of the jokes are, ehh, mediocre. The editing was poor at times. It really felt like a clunky star wars feature. To that point it didn't 'feel' like the other antman movies. Worst of all, Paul Rudds normal comedic routine with this character is swapped for a dramatic version. Which didn't work as well.So you have Antman, with less humor, the new scary/mysterious villain, a daughter added with little chemistry, cool visuals, and some fun action sequences. It was fine to see once, but they really fell short of expectations for their trilogy's final chapter.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That it more resembles a Star Wars than another Ant-Man. I'm not going to argue those, merely state that I think it's being blown out of proportion. The movie is different, yes. Bad? No.I really appreciate that the theme of family is continued, and deepened. The drive to protect those near and dear to you was a major aspect of the first two. This time, we also have the aspect that some of them hide things from each other, to keep them safe and out of a fear of losing their love. It calls out the complacency that can come with success in doing good. This also gets into communication and media, and their role in societal change. Violence as the only solution to a dictatorship.I recommend this to any fan of the MCU. While it does try to be welcoming to newcomers, It is definitely catering to those of us who want an ongoing storyline. 8/10.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

First of all it gives a glimplse into Scotts and Hopes life without doing too much heavy lifting as some of the Disney Series did (Falcon & Winter Soldier, Hawkeye) - makes sense, since they have a lot more time to do so.Second it´s an Ant-Man movie, so it is quite fun - I had to LOL a few times in the theater.Third and most important, there is a strong story centered around Ant-Man, Hope, Cassie and most importantly - Kang.Kang is the big bad here and it is shown from different angles why he is such a good Thanos-Level-Villain.Simply put, he can control time and erase timelines - what Thanos tried to do with a single (616) universe, Kang did with countless universes, which he erased (aka. Destroyed) to achieve his goals. And he knows how powerful he is and how he can use his power to get what he wants.And here are the problems: We never get a proper explanation for WHY he does it, since when, when it all started. Sure, he thinks his variants are doing a bad job and are like chaotic little children in his eyes, but when did he start? Why did he start? What is what he lost? What´s his big motivation?I think the biggest problem of the movie can be summarized as: it is too compact to properly show the story!However, does this make a bad movie?Hardly, no, because this is Marvel. It´s just the first Phase 5 movie and there will be many to fill in the gaps, most important Loki season 2.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The visuals in the Quantum Realm were truly breathtaking, and made it worth the price to see it IMO. The script is what you'd expect for Ant-Man, but Khang's storyline is an nice plot twist that certainly kicks things up a notch. The cut-scenes in the end tie-it into the universe, which is what makes Marvel Studios so good as what they do: they create continuity in movies as well as they do in comics.

Quantumania isn't a 10/10 for me, but it still delivered an enjoyable couple of hours and I look forward to seeing where things go from here. The mid-credits and post-credits scenes really sealed the story as well.I disagree with critics on this one! This definitely is way higher than a 43% it has on rotten tomatoes.Edit: One reviewer said this movie had no heart. I don't know what they are talking about. This was an MCU movie in which a family (The Ant-Man Family) loved each other, supported each other, displayed forgiveness and affection towards each other. That was one of the things I liked most about it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It treats the genre seriously and with respect. Ant Man Quantum Mania does too. Despite the lightheartedness of the first two movies (which I loved), it delivers as a story carrying a foreboding message that something bad is coming. It gives us a glimpse at the evil destined to infect our corner of the multiverse soon. A lot of very qualified actors flop badly trying to play comic book heroes/villains. In fact the more accomplished actors seem to do the worst. But the cast of this movie is first rate! All of them, from villain to hero and everyone in between. When I saw Bill Murray I figured ""of lord, here comes Love and Thunder"" again! But Bill was great-a little under used but right on target. Michelle Pfeiffer gave the movie some heart, and unbelievably at her age, some sex appeal. And whoever crafted the scene to restore what had been destroyed, created a work of pure genius in special effects and script writing.

Doesn't matter. It's a spectacular first appearance for Kang. Huge presence, absolutely terrifying, sets the MCU tone for the next few years.Much better than dr strange, better than Loki as a Kang intro because of the brutal battle scenes. Really glad I saw it in the theater.People are complimenting the Cassie actress, and yes she was fine, but primarily her presence is youth, which contrasts starkly with Pym and wife. Even Ant man looks like an old man compared to her. Seemed to be setting the stage for her to be Ant man next with her battle chops and scientific training.","7 out of 25 found this helpful.

Scott Lange and other major characters find themselves battling a supervillain in the Quantum Realm. While there, they face new challenges, such as houses that look like Fred Flintstone's home mated with the Pillsbury Dough Boy, and gelatinous bugs and other critters. Despite some amusing jokes, the world mostly looks like a Marvel screen-saver, with effects companies pre-visualizing much of the running time. The new villain, Kang, is a fearsome and all-powerful character, but poorly written, and the filmmakers struggle to make him seem terrifying. The cast does their best to work with the material, and Michelle Pfeiffer shines, pushing the plot forward and papering over cracks in the storytelling. The movie mainly revolves around Scott and Cassie, who is now a teenager with her suit, but Hope (The Wasp) is present and involved, but doesn't make much of an impression. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" or ""Temple of Doom,"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy.","8 out of 30 found this helpful.

The most loving part in this movie was the Cenimatic Experience and the Quantum Realm just comes to life. It looked so real and the CGI was perfect in all part. Kang was the best in his character, love the way Jonathan Majors played Multi Player Roles expecially the way he delivers Kang is astonishing and outstanding badass villain ever played. I bet this is the most challenging role in whole Marvel Cenimatic Universe because of the diversity and different philosophy then most of the characters. All together I loved the movie, all the characters played justice to their roles but Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are the show stealers. Wow want a experience.

Kang part was completely new so although the story was loose sometimes but in order to know what the kang will do, how he will behave and how he will become superior than thanos, i was completely submerged in the movie and i am just curious for new movies.

Obviously the stakes have gotten higher than the previous installments but it did a great balance of comedy, drama, and action further establishing Kang as a worthy MCU Phase 4-6 villain.

Not many people understand the concept of space-time continuum or quantum physics. But Marvel surely integrated those concepts with this Ant Man movie.For those haters out there, you must understand first the basics of those 2 concepts. It has been theorized by Einstein that everything at subatomic level consist purely of probability. There's no certain way to determine whether an object is at one place or at multiple place at the same time. Also at subatomic level, time does not exist in a linear fashion as we human perceive it. Hence everything related to space and time at subatomic level can be purely fantasy or purely science fiction.That is exactly what Marvel did with Quantumania. They created a purely fantasy universe where everything can just be anything and at any place all at once. It's the reason why you can see people or objects can replicate themselves. It's the reason why you can see a ""Star Wars"" atmosphere in this movie. It's the reason why all of geek's imagination come to live in this universe. So it's actually a perfect realization of the ""quantum universe"" here.As for the story line, it make perfect sense. There's no exageration. Every character behave the way they should be and the story progress as how it should be. You don't have to care of what it shows in the comic books, because if it's entirely the same as the comic books, then it is useless to see the movie. So don't complain about the different expectation here.In short, this Ant Man movie is a grand spectacle for everyone, especially for ""Star Wars"" fans.","7 out of 26 found this helpful.

Not only does director Peyton Reed's movie take place almost exclusively in the Quantum Realm (exploring it much more extensively than ever before), but it also puts Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and company up against the next major Marvel menace: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a power-mad tyrant who can move through all of space and time. He threatens not just ""our"" reality, but every other one out there. Most of the film takes place at a far remove from the Marvel Universe we know, down in the subatomic Quantum Realm that characters from previous films have visited (Ant-Man), gotten stuck in for decades (Ant-Man and the Wasp) or used as a series of temporal highway bypasses on their way to saving the universe (Avengers: Endgame). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has just enough entertaining moments and a heartfelt family story, plus knockout performances in Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne and Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror, to make up for its more underdeveloped aspects. The exploration of its central themes, new characters, and the Quantum Realm itself only goes skin deep, leaving it feeling high on spectacle but low on substance. Even so, Quantumania works as a culmination of the Ant-Man series, a way to start things in motion for Phase 5, and a promising roadmap of where the Multiverse Saga is going. Of course, many MCU fans may wait and see what audience scores are like. Generally speaking, audience scores trend higher than critics for most superhero offerings, and I would probably expect that to be the case here. But I would be surprised if this was a huge disparity as this always seemed like a pretty risky film. I also think it may be worth noting that so many new Marvel films keep popping up in the bottom ten here, like the even higher profile Thor: Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. The MCU does feel like it's has its magic in phase 4 here. Serenely untroubled by pressures to break box office records or win Oscars, the Ant-Man films seem content to be clever entertainments with heart, but not so much that they become cloying. From the size jokes to the running gags to the casting of Rudd, who has spent his career behaving as if he's a random regular guy who stumbled into stardom and finds it all quite silly, the series manages to be light but not inconsequential, whether a given scene is sentimental (anything involving Scott and Cassie) or cheerfully deranged (the climatic fight at the end of the first movie atop a Thomas the Tank Engine train set). Ant-Man is officially a member of the MCU's starting lineup, the Avengers, but feels like a replacement player who gets a text when Thor calls in sick. This new movie validates Scott's not-quite-insecurity (he's not deep enough to be existentially tormented) by having him get mistaken for other superheroes. He takes it in stride. Two films ago, he got fired from Baskin-Robbins, and before that, he was in jail. Happiness, like size, is a matter of perspective.","10 out of 44 found this helpful.

I am not sure why the Critics opinions for this movie are so low, but from the many critics opinions I have read, it seems they're trying to compare this Antman/Wasp movie to two previous instead of judging it on its own; since this iteration is so unlike the two movies that came before it.Acting was on point for all involved!Jonathan Majors had a great debut and was on point as Kang. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily have perfectly evolved into their characters as Scott and Hope.

The movie kicks it into high gear fast and speeds up. Fresh ideas and environment for the 3rd installment in the Antman trilogy! The effects look amazing you can really be amazed with the 360 screen they shot in. I always enjoyed the humor in all three films but this one feels a little more adult then the other 2. All the actors in this movie did a great job but jonathon majors really sticks out as a great performance and breathes new life into what seemed like a dying franchise. Make sure to stay for the 2 post credit scenes.","6 out of 24 found this helpful.

Gosh I really loved this movie. Laughs, sadness, goosebumps, wonder, bewilderment. It's got it all! People don't know how to just enjoy a dang movie these days, there's no reason for all the bad reviews besides people having nothing better to do than tear others down. Sit back, relax, enjoy the amazing movie that is Ant Man. Allow yourself to get caught up in this world. They could make another movie without any bad guys and just explore the quantum realm and I'd be happy with that too! I just can't get enough of it.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

It has two great end credit scenes. Offers a lot to the franchise going forward.

Those still enthusiastic about the future of the MCU, and who enjoyed LOKI season 1 on Disney plus should enjoy.Shame it didn't do better at the box office. Michelle Pfeiffer was great.Since End Game and the infinity saga storyline wrapped up the general consensus is the MCU has lost it's steam. I feel like if you look at each film in isolation and judge them on their own merits they have not been so bad. I am high on this film and look forward to watching again.

All sort of creatures, sentient jelly blobs, heads composed of laser cannons, a veritable Star Wars mix, plus humans of a sort as well.

I will admit the CGI was questionable at times and some of the humour didn't land very well, but I left the theater feeling pretty damn good. The action sequences were cool and exciting, and Kang is a formidable villain, and I'm excited to see more of him.

I am so glad I stopped working and I'm even happier that this movie gave me a reason to. Just the visuals alone are so cool and setting up Kang's story (played by the enormous talent that is Jonathan Majors) brought the level of depth interest and talent for a Superhero movie to a whole new level. And that's says a lot when you're watching Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer on screen who -though they didn't - can just phone it in and it's still fun to watch. I loved the whole aesthetic of the film from the Quantum realm to Evangeline Lilly looking gorgeous as a beautiful woman sans a ridiculous amount of Botox and playing a SuperBadAss along w Michelle Pfeiffer.Of course Paul Rudd in any movie is always entertaining and funny. But the most favorite is that it's not a dull -get the facts and foundation out and who cares about the rest - movie. I think it'll be a whole other fantastic ride to see where Kang & The Gang (forgive but I was in the moment;)) are going to take us. It's the first in this set of Marvel movies that I was excited to see the end bc it ended on such a good high of anticipation for what's to come.Idc what any laptop junkie says, you know, those who know every detail of every nuance of every scene by the weekend box office receipts come in, about this installment of AntMan- It's fun and interesting and leaves a LOT to get excited about. It's a REALLY GOOD Marvel movie. It's different and I loved it. Finally!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It cuts out the fluff... (of ""hey, how is that sword able to kill gods?"" and ""why did that bad guy kidnap those children anyway, didn't he loose a child?"" Oh! And isn't the hulk baby mama from a different universe? And why is this first we're hearing of his son?!"") ...and gets straight to the scray reality of why kang is sooo much worse than Thanos.I would almost recommend that if you have only watched loki AND NOTHING ELSE after that!! (From the MCU)
This is where the story picks up. ONLY what this movie!Worth the watch? Yes.Worth the wait? Barely.What Marvel has done lately, can only be compared to going to an amazing wedding, eating the best food at the reception and the last things you're waiting for is for the cake to be cut, but you're then forced to endure speeches from the wait staff who constantly go on about their personal beliefs in weddings and while this one is nice weddings are pointless.The only saving grace is that the wedding cake is a tripple baked, tripple chocolate cheesecake, with a shortbread crust that melts in your mouth, and while amazing, BARELY excuses the drivel you had to endure to get to this point. But it's so good that while you leave the wedding slightly traumatised but so satisfied you forget what you were going to complain about on customer experience form.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

Not entirely - but that is why I go with puns. Hopefully to give a bit of joy and entertainment, while also having a deeper cut. Not too deep mind you - most of the time. And that is how you should experience this too. On an Imax screen if possible, but with an open mind (even more important).The movie works - not because it without flaws. Not because it makes sense (probably not even all the inner logic is ... tight) ... but because it is fun. And all that without Michael Pena! I won't say who is in this - you either know or you will find out. The movie begins with Ant Man reintroducing himself to us. If you have forgotten who he is - or if you haven't seen any other movie yet. It makes sense to be up to date ... but it is not necessary. And it is what makes this even more fun.The movie also channels a lot of Science Fiction ... well movie history before. It's not that Star Wars did not steal .. sorry, homaged other Science Fiction stuff, so if you see Star Wars here ... if you see Pixars lamp here (I'm quite sure I am not the only one who does), if you think of Lord of the Rings when you hear the tower line ... heck even the ""get to the chopper"" line can be spotted ... well tweaked and all that. But still if you look hard enough ... there is a lot to enjoy.And the movie has quite a few things to entertain the adults too. Not just the hints to the past of Michelle Pfeifers character (she had needs too), but also the use of curse words. Even with a ""holy"" in front of it, it did surprise me to hear the s word twice in the movie. I was not offended and I would hope no one else was.And I have not even gotten into the story - into the plot of the movie. It works as I already wrote without any prior knowledge ... it does link to other things though ... and the post credit scene especially is a foreshadowing of the best kind ... some even call it one of the best post credit scenes Marvel has done yet. You decide ... one thing is for sure, if you suspend your disbelief and just go with the flow ... the cast is fun enough to make you forgive its missteps ... be it almost botched character arcs ... jokes that may or may not work with you ... and the overall tone of the movie.A tone that switches - the same way Jonathan Majors seems to be able to switch. What a great find for the MCU - charismatic, yet able to draw you in. Maybe he is not that bad after all? But isn't the devil the most charming of them all? Or at least that is what they say ... while Christian Bale gathered a lot of praise for his Thor villain ... Kang is here to stay - I had to do at least one more pun and you know it.Ant Mans daughter who is recast for the movie - she seems to have a bright future ahead of her. There is a lot of rumor going around about the MCU and their planning for the future ... and the future is for the young ones ... isn't it? So sit back, relax and enjoy this movie that (re)intoduces us to Kang ... and if you are not Comic Book savvy ... don't worry, you won't be left behind ... no pun intended to close it all up.","6 out of 26 found this helpful.

They cast Casey perfectly since she look and act a lot like her screen father. She was actually a very good surprise, since she acted the part of a teenager but without much complications. All of them acted like a team and the end was good enough to introduce you the real power behind the next Marvel big Villain. And what about those 🐜?

Seeing a remake of A New Hope repackaged as The Force Awakens doesn't interest me - even if the special effects are much better.Let's break Quantumania down without spoiling.Story: There is a story. Is it mind-boggling with amazing twists and ground-breaking plot development? No, but it has a story that justifies a big screen action hero flick.CGI: Honestly don't know what some people are complaining about. Bright like Ragnarok. As diversified as Ready Player One. Worlds on the scale of Star Wars. Creatures to challenge the out-of-the-box multiverse through which Rick and Morty have their adventures... Well done!The Villain: For me, the Kang aspect reminded me of Rick and Morty (The Citadel). The character of Kang in itself was a worthy opponent and the actor did a good job giving him some depth. Look forward to seeing him in the Marvel universe again.As moviegoers, we have become spoilt. You can't keep raising the bar and complain when films don't meet almost impossible expectations. Don't get me wrong, this isn't one of the top Marvel outings like the first Guardians of the Galaxy.

His story and introduction is very intriguing. I actually enjoyed MODOK and what they did with his character. People are bashing him about his looks but he's supposed to be weird and funny looking. I thought the cgi was pretty good compared to other recent mcu entires. This movie is very fun to watch, lots of people were laughing in the theater with me, but that didn't take away from its emotional tones. This move had some serious steaks and had restored my faith in Marvel again. I got some Star Wars vibes, specifically episode 9 but executed very well. Paul Rudd was brilliant as always and Ant-Man's suit in this movie was particularly cool, just looks wise, it's my favorite. And post credit scenes have got me curious on what the mcu has in store next. Highlights: Paul Rudd's hilarious as always but with some serious and good action scenes, Kang is just awesome, the quantum realm has never felt cooler than this, so much to see. Don't listen to critics and ratings, watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. My local theater gave out free posters that i immediately hung in my room, and the back had the poster for Guardians 3 which I can flip over to when that comes out. With his good this movie was (in my opinion) I'm excited for May 5th.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

I've never felt as emotional about a movie since maybe Daredevil (2003) and Oz (2013). I think what truly made this film so breathtakingly amazing and wholeheartedly inspiring is the mix of draw-jopping action with a sort of an oaky afterbirth of a beautifully written plot. M. O. D. O. K. Is without a doubt the greatest superhero character I've ever had the pleasure to view in cinemas, he is simply too hot to not arrive for.

I really don't understand the hate this movie is getting The movie was one of the best way to introduce to phase 5 of MCU
Imo its best movie after Spiderman No Way Home
Man the VFX is simply awesome The plot Jonathan Majors what an actor he suits the role KANG so well and MODOK was also good
I would watch it again the cast was simply amazing And btw you should watch Loki before watching movie so heads up for the plotsThe movie had me on the edge of the seat for multiple times and the after cred scenes man i ruined my throat screaming for what I saw
If there was one word to describe this movie it would be KANGFUL
Please don't trust the critics they don't understand the multiverse for sure.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

Unlike those two, this is more of a sci-fi epic, in line with stories which take place ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"" :). I think superhero fatigue has set in for me, so when Quantumania decided to go all in on the sci-fi spectacle I was all aboard.Michelle Pfeiffer has always been a favorite of mine and she pretty much leads this film, Obi-Wan style. Paul Rudd is his usual likeable self, and even his daughter Cassie is likeable and unpretentious (unlike a few of the other adolescent heroines Marvel has been churning out).Although the VFX for one returning character are a bit underwhelming, I though the rest of it was fantastic. The developers literally created an entirely new universe, with innumerable alien races. Also, Christophe Beck's music was suitably rousing.For comic geeks:
As a long-time fan of the Fantastic Four in the comics, this film gave me hope that Marvel could actually do justice to an FF film adaptation. Quantumania had exactly the right elements which would fit in an FF film, and in fact reminded me alot of some of those '80s John Byrne issues where the team would go into the Negative Zone. In fact, the Quantum Realm is basically a stand-in for both the Microverse and the Negative Zone. Sharp eyes may note that Kang's robot soldiers are basically styled after Psychoman.Anyways, go in with an open mind and ignore the critics. This was a solid hit for me.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

No, is not, but maybe doesn't need to be.Special effects were great, they created an whole new world, making easier having a storyline and events happening without having other Marvel characters to show up.I think that Marvel shoot themselves on the foot opening the multiverse, so now will be hard to make stand alone movies.The movie was enjoyable, I don't think it deserves all those bad comments.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

If I look back at what I had loved about the first two movies it was most likely the comedy aspect.This movie makes the comic nerd in me happy and I died laughing throughout. Modok wasn't spot on with the comics, but they made him just as ridiculous. There's honestly not much more I could ask for. It's an adventure and if you hate on this, you don't like fun.Easily a 10/10 for me for good reason. I was laughing my ass off and absolutely thrilled by the storyline.

Kang, direction, answers and more were all teased. The trailers did nothing to reduce my anticipation.Then, the critics came out and announced their first reactions which were mixed but mostly positive. Then, their reviews came out and I was incredibly nervous. Watching the RT % drop each day was worrying. Then the audiences seemed to come and out and speak. At the time of writing it's at 84% and I was relieved.This is easily the best Ant-Man in terms of scale. If you're a fan of the small, contained palette cleansing Ant-Man films then you probably won't enjoy it as much.The cast are phenomenal with shout outs to Majors, Pfeiffer and Newton.The major grumbles that I have towards this film is the thing that stops it being one of the all-time MCU films:
1. The comedy. It intrudes too much and sets a weird balance of tone. We could have had a really dark storyline. The humour in places is great but often misplaced.2. Quantity. This is already the 8th film in less than 2 years not to mention the quantity of Disney+ shows. This is being rectified by Feige and co.Overall, if you want an enjoyable two hours that goes by insanely quick, this is for you. Trust the audience and not the critics.Also - stay for the mid and post credit scenes.In Feige and Kang we trust!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I liked him.Yes, it's not a masterpiece, but it entertained me as the third part (I liked the second one much less).The film does not let you get bored for a second.Also, Kang is just mega-cool. The actor has a good action, he really appears impressive and dangerous.But I must say that for me, as in the previous parts, Henk was still the best. Michael Douglas is a great actor! I admire that, unlike some (ahem, Harrison Ford), he gives his best in a superheroic film!)
In the film, a lot of attention is paid to Scott Lang's daughter, and very little to Wasp (although this does not interfere with the film too much).From the bad - the plot is very predictable and there are a lot of clichés in it (although some of them, like with MODOK, for example, are even ridiculed).","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

He is ably supported by the regulars and Katheryn Newton does well taking over the reins as Cassie from Abby Ryder Fortson.On top of this the movie adds Kang the Conqueror as the antagonist. Superb performance by Jonathon Majors, who I first came across in ""Lovecraft Country"". Very good actor indeed.The cast is littered with other very notable performances but I'm going to pick out just one and that's Corey Stoll as M. O. D. O. K, or as Scott calls him M. O. D. O. F. K. Bringing Darren Cross in this twist from the comic cannon is well done. It's an excellent performance, especially given the intriguing way the character must have been filmed and produced.I guessed the main plot elements (see second paragraph above) but his didn't spoil the movie one little bit for me. It's constructed well enough.IMHO this is an excellent addition to the MCU, the humour is good and the plot and action lively.I'd happily recommend this movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ant-Man is often seen as a lesser/less interesting character compared to some of the bigger superheroes in the Marvel domain, but Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast and the crew have certainly elevated his standing in my opinion. I wish I made the time to see it in the cinema.I enjoyed this film far more than 'Thor: Love and Thunder' (excuse the pun, but lighting didn't strike twice) and 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (great, but it seemed that Chadwick's death had more to do with its popularity than the execution of the film - there, I said it). It is just as good as 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3'.This film was always up against it: post 'Avengers: End Game, a significant vehicle for establishing the main villain of the next phase of the MCU, a precursor for the next Avengers films, and no inclusion of/crossovers with other well known main Marvel characters during the feature film (must watch the post credits scene).It's visually spectacular, it's engaging, and it has a great ensemble cast. I wouldn't pay attention to the negative reviews.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The photography and the visual effects were very, very excellent.. The presentation of the character of Al-Ghazi was awesome, especially the first scene after the ending song.

Was far far better than Love and Thunder and I enjoyed it more than Wakanda Forever. I'm quite surprised at the low scores, this was as good as the 2nd ant man, if you liked that and liked the first then you will enjoy this one as I did. The plot was sound, the GGI was fine but nothing compared to something like Shang-Chi. The characters are basically the same as in the other ant man movies, however Kang was an absolute standout here. One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Highly recommend.","4 out of 20 found this helpful.

It's definitely the best Ant-Man movie in the trilogy. And they owe the success all to Jonathan Majors aka Kang the Conqueror.Kang is the scariest Marvel villain I've seen. He's definitely scarier than the purple grape Thanos. It was all thanks to Major's commitment to the impenetrable character. His tortured to menacing facial expressions, bellowing voice and naturally imposing physique convinced me this was a super villain. No CGI needed.I literally saw the movie because of Majors, and I'm glad I did.For the rest of the cast, they did a stellar job too. The surprise MVP was Cassie. She had gumption, daring and humor like her dear dad. (And a gorgeous face, like a little Julianne Moore. That Lang/Van Dyne family is really ridiculously good-looking.) Michael Douglas was also surprisingly funny. Overall it was great to see the superhero family communicating and defending together.Ant-Man Quantumania will take you on a fantasy, philosophical journey, where you can both escape your life and contemplate it.I do look forward to seeing Kang disrupt other Avengers in coming sequels, and the classic Ant-Man franchise humor.P. S. The end credit scene kicks ass!P. S. S. Thank you R&CPMK for the advanced screening in ScreenX.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

As always with Marvel, the abundance of digital effects makes the film a visually stunning journey with settings, creatures, and characters reminiscent of the world of Star Wars or the wacky misadventures of Futurama. The group consisting of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton are a huge star for the film. The introduction of Kang after the Loki series is already a glimpse of what is to come in this phase 5 of the MCU, which is a very good start to start this next phase. Modok is quite a bizarre and cartoonish character, but he has a certain air of the original Modok. One detail that can be noted is that unlike the previous Ant-Man movies, there is a little less humor here and more seriousness. Even so, Scott Lang's humor continues to hold. This movie is a very good start to phase 5 and an amazing viewing experience that is endlessly entertaining. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I see alot of complaints about CGI & green screens & some complained its not creative & that its predictable n done before?? Lmao done before? Some harsh critics here.Some ppl yeesh.. its like they got a personal vendetta against the Top of the line CGI/Green screens lol. Make no mistake this not some cheap CGI you see in B-lister movies, the quality rivals Avatar #1 & Dr Strange #2 & even newer Star Wars films. Theirs a rich new world with highly creative life forms, plants, structures, as well as stunning futuristic looking settings that yes is CGI n green screen but how else would u make such a futuristic looking background? Would you prefer extras wear rubber suits to play the creatures seen in this film instead of CGI to make them look amazing like some comic book stuff?For the ones seriously whining & complaining this film doesnt connect to MCU in anyway n that its a standalone movie.. theirs tons of Marvel films that tell their own story but then has parts here & there to connect to the overall MCU, even the story of the villain lays the groundworks for future MCU movies. Its ridiculous that some people dont realize it connects lol. I mean how clear of a picture do you gotta draw for ppl to make them see it?The new Avengers movie coming out is called
""The Avengers : Kangs Dynasty"", oh wait the villain in this Antman film is also Kang woww! Mindblowing stuff lol. It even explains & hints how his future role will be in the MCU, you gotta be very low intelligence to not put 2 & 2 together.Now the story could have been better but I felt they did an alright job to try & connect things to the marvel universe & set things up for the future to come. While yes alot of the movie might seem like its a standalone movie but what many clearly dont comprehend is this film has just opened the doors to a brand new universe filled with brand new life forms & tons of new settings in the Quantum Realms n can litterally spawn spinoffs just about the Quantum Realm ppl cuz of how richly diverse n new it is.Not to mention after the Loki Tv series, this is practically the next stage in story telling about Kang the Conqueror who is announced as the villain of the next avengers film... this whole Marvel Phase is about Kang ppl. So everything you see & learn about him in this film is extremely insightful going forward.I really hate when people rate movies by comparing them to others. Some rate it lowly cuz they compared to other marvel or sci fi movies, when you should be just judging the film with fresh eyes and not comparing it to any others or else u are just giving an unfair n bias rating.Lastly for the ppl who tried to say this movie isnt creative.. that its been done before.. I challenge u to find everyone another movie that talks about a Quantum Realm & showing the life forms that exist in it thats ruled by an Evil Multiversal travelling Conqueror lmao.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

I am so delighted they make films like that which are so imaginative and fun! Michelle Pfeiffer is such a beautiful woman at her age and it was nice to watch her play a major role in this film.The film is underrated. It has a few scenes which are similar to scenes from Star Wars which is also a good thing, as who doesn't like Star Wars?You do have to be a fan of fantasy to enjoy watching this kind of films though. And of course it is more suitable for those who are young at heart regardless of their age.In summary I appreciate marvel studios for presenting decent films to the viewers.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jonathan Majors plays a phenomenal Kang- despite whatever legal troubles he's enmeshed in, and whether he's innocent or guilty - the rage and betrayal and hurt and menace that he puts into this character, it's difficult to picture any other known actor doing such a job. I've known folks to complain about the story and the CGI here. But they need to stop comparing every new MCU product to Endgame and Infinity War. This is an overall excellent entry into the Kang story arc for anyone willing to give it an honest shake.Can't wait to see how the rest of the arc plays out.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

While switching between humor and seriousness, it managed to never get boring and had me chuckling at random interactions the whole way through. It feels like a mix between the first Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok in both humor and a diversity(in personalities and groups) with a strong Star Wars influence.Do all of the characters get their time to shine? No, but I'm sure we will see many of them again which is good enough for me. The world is great, the characters are great, and the villain is a mysterious and interesting as Thanos. Luckily I'm sure we'll see his other personas before the character is completely removed from the cinematic time line. Honestly it could almost be a stand alone Sci Fi if it wanted to be.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Paul Rudd was able to show his dynamic range here playing it funny initially but taking serious to the max when threatened by Kang.. Majors did an Outstanding job with Kang""s character,
whether it was the subtle facial mannerisms or the downright stone cold shift in tone from friendly to someone who would crush the universe and think nothing of it..The guy Made this movie..His performances stood out and elevated the storyline into a seriously awesome one...I only hope future appearances of the Kang character are as intense and terrifying and well acted as he was in this movie...The scenery was incredible to watch and extremely creative in design ...This is a very good scfi adventure,if you like a little humor very lightly mixed into an eye popping ride that is dark,intense and thrilling at times...This is Not another gooey mess like the recent Thor movie...

This movie was a part of opening up the multiverse saga and brings in story lines from the comics surrounding Kang the Conqueror, and shows how much of a threat the avengers will be facing soon. If one Kang is that powerful, imagine fighting hundreds or thousands of Kangs just as powerful. This movie was a stepping stone for the greater MCU future and the haters are giving bad reviews based on their own inability to understand the intricacies of the multiverse and how the quantum realm connects to it.This film was great, classic ant-man humour but with higher stakes than the two previous instalments, and offers insight to this sagas main villain.For those haters that dislike the focus on female superheroes that the MCU is taking, so what? It's time to wake up and put away your biases. Superheroes are superheroes male or female, gender of characters should not affect your enjoyment of the film. These characters exist within the comics and have for years, Marvel is simply drawing from the source material. And while yes the MCU is introducing many more female superheroes from the comics this saga than they did in the infinity saga, they are still introducing more male heroes and heroes from different cultures, creating a much more diverse team of avengers, as well they should be.","2 out of 18 found this helpful.

It was so badly cut that it was a mess to follow. Second one was really good with an amazing villain. This was my main initial issue with this movie at first. Marvel had maybe their best female villain ever in Ant-Man 2. She was spectacular all the way and delivered a spotless performance. How often do we get a truly great female villain? The bad guy in this one was quite transparent as it's a film for kids so right away I knew who the bad guy was and was let down. They went away from what made Ant-Man 2 so great. She carried the movie on her shoulders. And this one is a more typical and predictable storyline.But this one is actually not bad at all. They of course are now exploring multiuniverses as the main Earth is too overprotected with way too many strong heroes. So most new Marvel movies are set in some alternative universe and often this fails horribly as we don't get to follow known characters in their own world. But I actually like what they did here as all the jokes land and we get to explore a new Star Wars like world. I was very, very surpriced about how well the humor worked. Thor 4 showed how awful these Marvel movies can turn out if they overdo the humor and think they are funny. It was horrible. Unfunny and didn't take itself seriously so I didn't either. Ant-Man 3 has natural jokes that are not overdone and all land as they are subdued. Often just small quirps not gigantic CGI gags. The CGI meanwhile is used for serious action.I do feel like the movie is a bit too frantic. We meet too many new characters and the universe is never fully explored. Many side characters only get a few scenes. And as the daughter is now also a superhero as seen on the poster we get way too many superpowers. This is why Michael Douglas was so nice here. Just the normal smart guy in a crazy world. The daughter should have had this role. Just make her a normal young girl kicking butt when needed by being brave instead of making her part of the crew. It would make this universe more magical as we could see it through the eyes or a regular girl from a regular world. Instead the movie becomes too busy. But frankly it's never dull and so many things make so much sense. All plot elements and characters are perfectly put together in a coherent mess. And once the bad guy is defeated it finally dawns on me how this all works out. The movie is so clever if you just think about the smaller elements and how the time travel works. Frankly Marvel is not dead at all. I know they have made a ton of horrible stuff after Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but there are still decent Marvel movies being made if you just look for them. The Spider-Man series for example is still going fairly strong. It's not the old Marvel with top quality everywhere. But there is still some fun to be found in this franchise. In 2021 and 2022 we got 7 Marvel movies. 4 were absolutely ghastly. But now in 2023 we start out very strong so hopefully the last 2 years can be washed away.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I mean this movie explores the quantum universe like anything I've ever seen. It really puts things into perspective on the amazement of worlds that seem to be infinitely smaller than our own. The Cgi is spectacular, the creatures amazing, the vehicles look awe inspiring as well. I kept seeing the previews to this movie and not even the trailers were disappointing unlike so many I've seen before for countless other movies. I find the sequels to each Marvel character seem to get better. Thor's are a bit of a roller coaster and I'm not really sure about the Hulk's. Like i said, wonderful cgi exploration, great character development.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

That kind of works if the quantum world is faster than our world, but not otherwise.I did miss Luis, but he wouldn't have fitted in to this one. The mirroring of Scott's narration was a really nice touch beginning and end.The thing Marvel will have to take care with in Kang is that keeping his narrative coherent for the lay-audience will be very tricky indeed. ""Didn't they kill him, why are there two of them?"" I can imagine future films having characters asking dumb questions just so they can be explained to....Nice to see Kamala in the titles :)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But for Marvel comic fans, this is a good movie for Kang.Not many cringe jokes like love & thunder have been added, Action & Storyline is quite good. Because the storyline of this is not completely finished, it will continue for another movie... If you don't have a good knowledge about the comic background, you won't be able to imagine who lost in the end.Visuals & Cinematography: Superb & Beautiful (Vfx artists should be seriously appreciated for the effort they put into this. Some scenes reminded me of the first movie Doctor Strange) It doesn't matter if you haven't watched this in 3D.Cgi: Good (Wakanda Forever has normal level. Talking about the characters, all the characters have been treated very well. Except MODOK.MODOK's origin and first appearance are badass. Even though it's pretty badass with the Face Shield/Armor, it's confusing when you show your face. But as said before, there is almost no movie that has successfully shown a giant floating head. So the look doesn't matter.But the character who has given some cringe dialogues from the middle is a mess.Kang is given an origin quite different from the comics and suitable for the MCU. Jonathan Majors was killing it. As I have been saying since the day Jonathan was cast, there is hardly anyone better than Jonathan as Kang. This Kang is an emotionally driven character. Seeing the expressions on Jonathan's face that he is a kang variant who is patient enough and can't bear it, the way he fights is professional.FeelIt is noticeable that he is like a boxer. Perhaps Jonathan may have used the experience he gained from Creed 3 for this one as well. The best thing about the movie is Jonathan Majors.And this is only one variant. We still haven't seen a dangerous Kang. Because like I said before, this is forwardA story that has to be continued... If you haven't seen the two Credits Scenes, you won't be able to imagine anything. If you don't understand, I'll watch all the videos about kang.) Credit damn Accurate to that scenefrom comicsChassy is fine. Because the character has been built beautifully as a person who is still learning to be a hero and is not amused by stories like I'm better than previous hulk/thor.Hank Pym My gosh, finally we saw him as he wasshould be. Although it was quite disappointing that Hank was not the age of iron man like Hank in the comics, but an old man, we get to see the badass Hank Pym like in the comics. And Janet & other characters are also okay.This story, which gives a good start to Secret Wars and Kang Dynasty, does not end here. So it can be said that the story has been done beautifully. Ratings don't matter. The movie is a perfect start to the Multiverse saga. Btw, don't make fun of the movie by commenting and spoiling it in the comments...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now I start to understand why he is the new ""big baddy"" for Marvel. He plays an interesting and powerful villian, he is not fully developed but since he seems to be more present in the future I guess they have a plan for that.

If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy this movie just because of the new BAD. I think Jonathan Majors did great and I am very excited to see him in future Marvel Movies. Don't let bad reviews or on the fence reviews make you not see this movie. In my opinion it's a must watch if you would like to understand the direction of Marvel.

Ok so this was a pretty good entry into the MCU. I know the critics on RT hit it hard and I'm sure some fans will feel the same. But considering how Phase 4 landed I actually found this movie to be a breath of fresh air. It's very much like a Sci-fi movie and very different than many MCU movies but I didn't mind that at all. It does feel like a combination of other sci-fi films like Star Wars, again not a problem for me personally.It was a little goofy at times but that's the comedy you usually see in a Marvel Film. I enjoyed that it didn't push a lot of politics into it and Jonathan Majors was an awesome villain. There were some scenes not big scenes that they could of left out. A character or two didn't seem needed in my opinion but all major characters were very cool. To be honest it felt more like a Kang movie but that was awesome because I enjoy the villains.There are two end credit scenes both are cool, a lot of people made a big fuss about them but it wasn't anything I didn't expect to see. There is a lot going on in this movie but if you watched all the Marvel movies it's not that hard to keep up. We watched it in 3-D and that's the way to go in my opinion. On a scale on 1-10 I think a 7.5-8 is a fair score. But overall I really enjoyed the crap out of this film. And I know people are going to say I'm a Marvel fanboy but I still haven't watched Thor Love & Thunder a second time. This was easily the best Ant-Man film. This movie will get multiple watches from me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They have the best cast for this especially the main. He's perfect for this role. Lots of humor as always, this one doesn't have Michael Peña, but that is because he never made it into the quantum realm yet, so he was missed. Especially his way of explaining stuff. CGI is top notch and all the different creative imaginative creatures are just stunning. Someone went to a LOT of detail here. Some are just plain weird. Bill Murray in it is a great addition too. Plot is awesome and quite possibly this new villain is far more dangerous than Thanos ever was!!! He's quite a viscous villain more so than Thanos. So they've set the universe up to deal with this new multiverse threat which is great. Fits with all the marvel stuff so far perfectly, enjoy with whole family, nothing questionable in it at all , a few cuss words and a lot of great fights that's about all there. Enjoy!!! I will watch this again. Soon. 😊","0 out of 17 found this helpful.

It was the first Marvel movie I saw in theaters and was satisfied with it when it was over. I like the typical Ant-Man humor in it. For me, it's supposed to be an Ant-Man movie, so it's supposed to have jokes and not always make sense. I find the humor in the Ant-Man movies good, and it's definitely better than the humor in Thor Love and Thunder. I like how this movie covers the Quantum Realm in detail. It was just a mysterious place that is smaller than atoms in the first two Ant-Man movies, and was a plot device for time travel in Endgame, but in this movie, we finally get to actually see it in detail.I find the CGI alright, of which my opinion is better than other people. I find MODOK is done right. I find it where MODOK is not possible to do in live action without looking somewhere on the uncanny spectrum. He's either creepy or weird and can't really be anything else while remaining comic accurate. People like comic accurate but MODOK is a character people might hate on either way (not comic accurate, complain about being not comic accurate. Comic accurate, complain about looking weird or creepy).I also find it does an alright job setting up the Multiverse. It has Kang the Conqueror, of whom in known to be the Multiversal threat throughout the Marvel multiverse. It is definitely a film that would help build up to the whole multiverse in the MCU'S future (even if it bombed, it helps show what to try to stay away from).Overall, it's by third favorite comic book film of 2023.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The actors give convincing performances and there is a glint in their eyes knowing this is a throwback to old fashioned sci-fi action movies and tv shows such as Sinbad, Lost in Space, Land of the Giants, Captain Nemo and Jules Verne type genres done with a modern cgi feel. I felt, previously, that the 2nd Ant-Man movie had a disappointing low budget vibe but this was bigger in scale, literally. It set up a menacing villain played by the infamous Jonathan Majors. Even with his real life anti-social issues, it would not be difficult to recast him as he has multiple images throughout the movie and Marvel Universe. I don't think much for Kang's chances, though, against the Avengers if he can be thwarted by the diminutive Ant-Man team.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Frankly speaking, expectations were a little too high and those who watch the film will understand what is at stake. However, I am ready to give 100 out of 10 to Jonathan Majors for his game! His tears in his eyes throughout the scenes amazed me. This is really a very, very good villain for Marvel. And I'm sure that despite all the action in this film, in the future, this character will have a much more reverent and intriguing motivation than Thanos. I personally liked Kathryn Newton, the motivation is written quite well for a teenager, and in general, I hope the potential of the character will be well revealed in future projects. Not 10 out of 10 for sure. But the beginning of Phase 5 looks quite impressive!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Very interesting concept, getting trapped in the Quantum world.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9310943/?ref_=tt_urv","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2023","These Ant-Man movies started in 2015 with Paul Rudd starring as Ant-Man. The concept was a scientist (Michael Douglas) had developed a technique to shrink the size between atoms some 25 years earlier but shelved it, and in fact denied it, because his protégé has evil intentions for it, making the world a more dangerous place.Then that was followed up with the 2018 ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" where together Ant-Man and Wasp must protect the secrets of the shrinking technology.Now we have this one, 2023 ""Quantumania"" and, as the title suggests the whole family, including Ant-Man's daughter, get sucked into the Quantum Realm when an experiment goes awry. Once they are there they first have to figure out how to survive, how to fight the evil man who can bring all parallel universes together for evil purposes, then get back to their own reality.Being a Scientist myself this type of fictional story is naturally appealing to me. I enjoyed it as not-too-serious, good fun. My wife started with me but only was able to last half-way, probably from playing golf in the hot weather earlier. Our high today was 103.At home, on DVD from our public library.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It isn't a contra point. I liked the latest Dr. Strange for this reason. And I think for Marvel it's just the fantasy of former stories we liked. So it's in the line of Marvel. It's the comic book fantasy we found in history in books or comics of Marvel. Don't we? Don't make any borders for fantasy. But stay in touch with the characters!!! For this part, I do not like every figure especially the wasp in person Evangeline Lilly. I think as the partner of antman there should be more emotions. I'am looking forward. And I hope the best.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","manages to provide some enjoyment even if it's not great","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8879198/?ref_=tt_urv","Special-K88","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1596208/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2023","Under-the-radar Avenger Scott Lang is making the most of his life with Hope van Dyne and his teenaged, scientifically-inclined daughter Cassie who's budding interest has led her to study the Quantum Realm. Unfortunately Cassie's curiosity leads to a big snafu that pulls her, Scott, Hope, along with Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym into the strange, dark Quantum depths faced with an adversary they can't possibly hope to defeat. It doesn't take very long to figure out that this third Ant-Man film is looking to raise the stakes and spectacle with big, broad action scenes and incandescent visual effects, but to put it bluntly it's easy to see that much of the inspiration came from the Star Wars franchise. The jokes don't always land, the callbacks are expected, and it piles on too much sentiment in its latter stages, but there's a good collection of characters that are actually worth caring about, the villain is a formidable one, and it's able to create some anticipation for Phase Five. Is it in the upper echelon or the be-all end-all MCU film? No, but it provides quite a bit of fun in its own way. ***","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although it may not be on the same level as blockbuster hits like Avengers: Endgame, the film is still worth watching for Marvel fans who want to keep up with the ongoing storylines and events within the MCU.The film provides an entertaining and fun-filled experience for viewers with its unique mix of action, humor, and science fiction. The chemistry between the lead actors, Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, is one of the highlights of the film, and the addition of new characters like Kang the Conqueror adds to the excitement.However, while the film is enjoyable and provides some thrilling moments, it may not be the best of the Marvel films. The plotline can be predictable, and some of the action sequences may feel repetitive for viewers who have already seen the previous films in the series.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good film, but it may not be the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a one-time watch that provides an entertaining experience and serves as an introduction to the next phase of the Marvel Universe.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Absolute decline of a universe that is far from being what it was","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9850316/?ref_=tt_urv","leonardooliva-16135","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur177954632/?ref_=tt_urv","16 June 2024","In direct line with the decline of Marvel since End Game.To think that the first Ant Man movie had been a pleasant surprise and, although the second had been average to a fault, this third part exceeds expectations (for the worse).We can approach from many places because he is terrible.From performances, implausible script, the presentation of a bad guy like Kang who instead of being scary ends up being defeated because that's how it was written.We are introduced to a Cassie Lang who has no charisma, a Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer who are just collecting a check and nothing more. Even Paul Rudd who is always good fails in his performance. Cameo by Bill Murray is forgettable and I could continue describing for parts.At the special effects level it is also a disaster. The problems that Marvel has presented in these years at that level are well known, but here they were overcome, once again, for the worse. Look at what MODOK is, see what the quantum realm looks like, the facial rejuvenation and an endless number of failures that put this movie in the top 3 or top 5 of worst MCU projects in 15 years.As with The Marvels, She Hulk, Echo or Secret Invasion, Marvel has to change, if it doesn't it is destined for a failure of biblical proportions...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is a fine movie, and before phases 1 through 3 upped our standard for super hero movies this would have been quite an entertaining thing to see, and I definitely still like it. The problem for me is this film gave up the zany and unique high-jinks adventures of the two previous entries for a far more serious mood and a far more traditional superhero theme. Possibly they were trying to make up for the lack of captain america or iron man to hit those notes for this phase but ant-man works better as comic relief. I would also have liked to see more of the quantum realm, a mini-series would be nice, there is potential there and I know the comics have done stuff there. I hope the next ant-man picks returns to the style and quality of the first two films. Still very watchable though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
