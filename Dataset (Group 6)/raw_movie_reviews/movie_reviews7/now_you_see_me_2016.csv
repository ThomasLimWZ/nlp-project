"7","/10","The soundtrack by Brian Tyler, folks! The soundtrack!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4266529/?ref_=tt_urv","Fred_Mopkopf","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23364211/?ref_=tt_urv","3 August 2018","I could have written this review for 'Now You See Me I', as my appreciation for Tyler's work started there, but I thought I'd skip it, as he outdid himself in the second part. Yes, the NYSM films are arguably one of the most plot hole ridden franchises in Hollywood (not speaking about the non-decision if magic now is actually an existing thing or not), but strangely I found that after watching the first one and simply accepting the aforementioned fact I was able to really enjoy the second one. And I will re-view the first one as well with this attitude. Those are simply enjoyable films with good actors, nice scenery and lighthearted stories. But I want to direct your focus on something else I rarely read about here: The music by Brian Tyler. You may say about him what you want, but he really created an exception here. In our times, real pop-rock drums (I am not talking programmed drums and loops) as addition to orchestral music have fallen out of grace - Tyler was one of the first to bring them back. And boy, he knows how. In my world, the NYSM score is one of the most inventive soundtracks of our time. Not only does Tyler create a really powerful combination of orchestral and pop/rock music, he also manages to deliver a theme (or leitmotif) one is able to whistle after leaving the theater - also something that is not standard anymore, as soundtracks have become more like acoustic wallpaper these days. The music is really versatile in the most profound way. Just listen to 'The Setup' as a prime example. He morphs through all kinds of style from pop, rock, soul, swing and jazz in one single piece. And his real drums lend a power to the music that is unprecedented. Others have also started to incorporate this style of drumming in their music, but never as virtuosic as Tyler does here. If you like popcorn flicks, give the NYSMs try, and if you're into movie scores, keep your ears open. An oh, by the way: Listen to 'Can you dig it', his end title version of 'Iron Man 3' - it's right up there on the same level.","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Like with the first film, very entertaining. But unlike the first film, this is poor!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3496731/?ref_=tt_urv","ellscashncarry","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3982309/?ref_=tt_urv","30 June 2016","As a film this really is poor. On practically every level it falls down Now You See Me 2 picks up directly where the first film left off and the film follows a similar pattern – The 4 (or 5?) horsemen, performing larger-than-life magic with the aim of providing for those less fortunate or exposing those who do wrong. However, unlike the first, their motivations behind each of these stunts are a little less clear and certainly less meaningful. In fact inconsistent or unlikely character motivations and actions are a problem throughout the film (with supporting characters as well as the leads).Then there's the fact that this plot is so unrealistic and beyond the realms of possibility that it makes the first script look practically normal. The script in itself is a problem it's messy, incongruent and forced – ""well we need to have a shootout/car chase, otherwise it won't be cool enough"".Then there's the fact that Isla Fisher's character has left the gang and although briefly explained at the beginning of the film, is never mentioned again. Yet her replacement (played by Lizzy Caplan) is not only treated as if she's been there since the beginning, but also held responsible for all the actions she wasn't around for in the first film. I get the feeling it might have been easier for her just to play Isla Fisher's character (Katie Holmes-Maggie Gyllenhaal in Batman style) rather than trying to shoehorn in a different character. And talking of characters – Daniel Radcliffe's character is atrocious. I don't want to give anything away but he is such a stereotypical, spoilt, British man it's untrue. Moreover his acting in this was reminiscent of all his appalling, wooden performances from the early Harry Potter films And just I was starting to believe that maybe he could act!And then there are issues around plot holes, speech which is purely for the viewers' benefit, seemingly irrelevant sub-plots and a ridiculously backwards ending which doesn't appear to make much sense.So how the hell, given all these problems, does it give it get a 6 I hear you cry? Well, as with the first, it is still thoroughly entertaining. It's light-hearted fun, which isn't really tackling any of the world's serious topics and as a spectacle is still great. Sure I found myself thinking of several occasions 'my god this is garbage', but it didn't annoy me. It's the kind of film where you can laugh off the issues and appreciate the fun parts.In summary, if you liked the first one, I certainly wouldn't discourage you from seeing NYSM2. I'd just go in with limited expectations and an acceptance that many aspects of it aren't going to be very good. If you have those two things you'll probably enjoy it thoroughly, despite all its flaws.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Miss the ""magic"" of the first, but still entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3487702/?ref_=tt_urv","bankofmarquis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2016","I really enjoyed the first NOW YOU SEE ME film. I thought that film's premise ""magicians robbing a bank"" was original and the execution of the unique script by Ed Solomon and Boaz Yakin by director Louis Leterrier was strong. Add to that the casting - Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco as ""The Four Horseman"", Melanie Laurent, Common and (especially) Mark Ruffalo as the cops who were chasing them and sprinkle in good ol' Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman into a plot that kept you guessing to the end and you had a fun ride.My only question was, could the sequel capture the...wait for it...MAGIC (yes I went there) of the original?And my answer is...sort of.Kind of like seeing a magic show for the 2nd time, the spark of originality and wonderment was mostly missing this time around, consequently NOW YOU SEE ME 2 turned into a fairly standard crime/action caper - but with magic instead of guns, cars or fights. All that said, I was still entertained by this film, but that enjoyment was filled with an undercurrent of disappointment as I wanted to by ""wowed"" like I was with the first film.The script - written by Ed Solomon, one of the writers of the original, struck me as a ""job script"", that is, a script written for money from the studio vs. a ""passion script"" where the author has an idea they are passionate about and that passion is shown on the screen. Add to that the fact that Jon M.Chu - director of GI JOE: RETALIATION (not exactly CITIZEN KANE) - helmed this film and you have a movie that feels professional, competent and workman-like.What saves this movie is the performances. Three of the horsemen are back (Isla Fisher had to bow out due to a pregnancy) and the bi- play and the interaction between Eisenberg, Harrelson and Franco fits like an old glove. They get to interact with Ruffalo more in this film and that's a plus. Freeman and Caine return and are as dependable as ever and newcomers Daniel Radcliffe, Tsai Chin and (especially) Jay Chou were fun. Only Lizzy Caplan's Lula didn't really work for me - I thought she was trying to hard to fill in for Fisher.Interestingly enough, I could shake the feeling, as I was watching this film, that I was watching the 2nd chapter in a trilogy, even though this one did NOT end in a cliffhanger. Sure enough, upon further review, NOW YOU SEE ME 3 is currently filming.All in all, I enjoyed this film, I just wish I could have been surprised more, like I was in the first film.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)","27 out of 47 found this helpful.

It's interesting to see just how they do it, because we keep forgetting it's all fake and not real. This movie is magic mixed with a robbery heist all combined into one.All the actors return, excluding Isla Fisher. This time we have a lady by the name of Lula (Played by Lizzy Caplan) who, to an extent replaces Isla Fisher. She's actually really funny and charming, to say the least. All the characters are exactly as the same as they were in the first one. We have a new villain by the name of Walter Mabry (played by Daniel Radcliffe.) He wants the Horsemen to capture a certain device so he can have access to everyone's details. Daniel Radcliffe surprisingly makes a good villain.We rate this 3/5 stars (7/10.) The movie is entertaining, action packed and nonstop guessing and thrills all the way through. Why didn't we rate it higher? We thought it didn't deserve any higher. It's an enjoyable flick, just like the first one. Nothing more, nothing less. Go and check it out. It's worth seeing. -Autistic Reviewers.","44 out of 87 found this helpful.

I think the age warning of above 13 for this movie is actually right. My advice is that if you're above 40, it may not entertain you because this film doesn't include much logic among some events that follow one another. Another thing is that this is also a movie about a struggle of saving the world from the bad guys. There many movies like that but this movie saves itself from being boring with the humor & sarcasm of the characters. Magics which we cannot come across in real life help a lot to take the movie to a higher position in the audience's point of view.Best parts of the film: 1. The voyage of the horsemen after they jump through the tunnel. 2. When four of the horsemen are together in a room where they are being searched for a possible theft.3. The magical performances of the horsemen in a city center at a special day of the year.4. The audience may not guess how the film will end, will the horsemen succeed or not?5. There may be a 3rd film of this series.","40 out of 80 found this helpful.

It accomplished the same ends as the first one, and even exceeded it in some ways. Just like the first, it started with a simple plot, added in some humor and dazzling magic tricks, and then brought in a twist at the end. Very fun movie, with complex characters. Sure, it's not a FANTASTIC movie. But I don't think it was meant to be an award- winner or anything. It celebrates the mystery and magic of illusion, and reminds viewers that even today, audiences can still be fooled, if the magician has just enough intuition (and money) to pull it off.I would've given 10 stars, but the romance was poorly executed, and some of the plot elements bothered me. Loved it though. Don't believe the negative reviews. Watch it for yourself and see what you think.","78 out of 149 found this helpful.

With considerably less action and more talk, the first half of the film manages to bore the audience. As well, this film gives off the feeling of trying too hard to be like the first one that it just falls short.The acting is fine enough for the Horsemen, as they all reprise their roles. I did like Isla Fisher and her character, but unfortunately she got replaced by Lizzy Caplan, who isn't so bad either. I had a problem with Radcliffe's character. He was too weird, and his background was not very comprehensive. I also found out how short he actually is in this film. In addition, the film introduces Merritt's twin brother, Chase, played by Woody Harrelson. That was another no-no. Though the editing was done well enough between the two characters, the hair on 'Chase' was very obviously a wig which was unnerving. Needless to say, I found that the new characters were not a great addition.As for the narrative, it kind of continues the story from the first film, but not in as much detail. As well, there are more elements involved in this film that detracts attention away from the main plot. This is what made it messy; with too many things going on the audience doesn't know which to focus on. And with no focus, the narrative just becomes jumbled up. The effects are cool as usual. I especially liked the scene where they're tossing a card to each other. Visuals and coordination are nicely done there, and managed to engage the audience. The ending felt a little too deja vu from the first one. As mentioned, it tries too hard to be like its predecessor that it just destroys itself. I'm not saying the film is not enjoyable, but while it isn't totally horrible, there is too much dialogue and not enough action. I'd liked to have seen more tricks, and less new characters who hardly had any foundation.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The first film was a surprise with decent twists and performances. It was a success, apparently to the point where the studio thought the audience needed more. We didn't and this film doesn't really offer anything new and it expects us to really be invested in these characters and their story. Yet neither of these things are really compelling enough for a second go-around. As a result, this sequel just manages to be serviceable.The Horsemen are in hiding and the FBI are on the hunt for them. It's been over a year and now the stage is set for their triumphant return. Just when they reappear in the limelight, the trick seems to be on them. Their entire stage was hijacked and they find themselves at the mercy of Walter, a mad genius who needs their skills to steal a microchip. In this battle of wits, which magician has the upper hand?I begged my wife to see The Conjuring 2, but she was terrified of the original and absolutely did not want to see the sequel in theatres. Double that for the fantasy adventure film Warcraft, so we were stuck seeing the magic heist flick Now You See Me 2...why this wasn't called Now You Don't, me and millions of others apparently will never know. Most of the cast has returned with the exception of Isla Fisher and Mélanie Laurent, with the former disappearance explained away with a few bits of dialogue. In her place we have Lizzy Caplan, who seems a lot more at ease with the cast and the material. One of the welcomed additions to this sequel. While the original was somewhat refreshing, this one treads the same waters. I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns the original offered us, here everything is telegraphed and predicted a few scenes beforehand. Thus the magic is gone, to a degree. The spectacle is still there is some sequences, yet the revelation is timid. I had to stop thinking about logic a lot of times in order to enjoy the spectacle. One sequence involving the team throwing a card between each other to keep it hidden from people inspecting them, was really well done. But why do they need to throw it to each other? Why not just have one of them keep it and continuously hide it? I don't know. Double goes for a plot hole that I simply do not understand involving a fake chip and the real one. NYSM2 doesn't bother to explain much that makes sense and instead tries to explain what we already know. As I said before, Caplan is the one good addition the film does. Most of the cast seems to sleepwalk through their roles, especially Eisenberg. The second new addition is Daniel Radcliffe, who despite playing a ""magician"" does his best to shed that Harry Potter persona. Between his role in Horns, here and the upcoming Swiss Army Man, I hope he manages to do it. NYSM2 is again, a pointless sequel that manages to entertain enough to warrant a view if you're a fan of the original.","20 out of 40 found this helpful.

While not producing a perfect movie in the first installment, the opposite ends up happening here.On the other hand, much like the first one, Now You See Me 2 has the mind-bending entertainment taken care of. It holds the same charm that was present in its predecessor-- perhaps even more. However, there are just a few things that are problematic.For one, the audience constantly feels like they're missing something--like they're always behind in what's going on. And not because of natural occurrences in the narrative, but because the filmmakers simply want us to be. Which is odd, seeing that this time we're actually in on most of the tricks. In Now You See Me, we're given the story through the FBI agent's point of view--always on the other side of the magic. In the sequel, we're mostly given the point of view of the four magicians, so we're deeply involved behind the scenes. The former situation was a major complaint of the first film, but now that I'm seeing the alternative, I think I would rather things be back to normal. And even though it's worth it in the end, the whole time prior you just sit there, frustrated, not wanting to be in on the trick, trying to mentally disassemble all the rigmarole in the meantime.Two years following the events of the first film, the Four Horsemen (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Lizzy Caplan) must remain in hiding for fear of the FBI. But they're growing impatient waiting for further instructions. Caplan replaces Isla Fisher as the female in the group. She's very unfunny--even when she so desperately tries to be--making us wish Fisher was back. The clan ends up in China where they are forced into working for a rich businessman (Daniel Radcliffe) who faked his own death and is supposed to be dead to the rest of the world. Radcliffe's brilliantly evil persona is far from the paladin, Harry Potter, as this may be his most mainstream role since.Morgan Freeman also returns with his character still in prison, because, for some reason, he can't seem to prove his innocence yet. Freeman is a key cog because he's what connects Ruffalo's character to his father's death as a child. Also differing from the first film, the first two acts are the weakest part. Waiting for things to get better towards the end, we sit through a magic trick-less setup that's more confusing than interesting. We do, however, get ""treated"" to an unnecessary card-flinging scene that just ends up being silly and five minutes too long.Does a good ending make up for a meandering 90 minutes? I guess it might if those 90 minutes are pertinent to the climax. And in this case, they are. But things may be a little too intricate to be cherished in the long run (something untrue for the first film). Maybe it deserves another watch. Maybe then will things be more clear. Because even after it's all explained to us, things wind up being overly complicated, but I guess you just have to trust that it all makes sense. If you're okay living like that.Twizard Rating: 73","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The series has a very similar feel to the 'Ocean's Eleven' trilogy, and we all know how the second installment of that series turned - not well. They made the mistake of making things too complicated for the average movie-goer to understand and just sit back and enjoy. 'Now You See Me 2' does a great job of keeping things intricate and twisted, while always keeping the audience in on the joke (and trick). There's the return of all the main stars (minus Isla Fisher who couldn't return due to her pregnancy) and the inclusion of some new ones who fit in seamlessly. In fact, I thought Lizzy Caplan was even more suited to the role of a magician than Fisher was, she did an excellent job as the newest Horseman. Daniel Radcliffe (yes the same one who found fame in another certain magic themed series) also joins the cast. His acting always comes across quite clunky to me, and I felt his performance worked more due to his star-power than actual acting chops.All the fun from the original is there. Everything you think you know, you should reconsider. There are twists and turns around every corner and the 129 minute run time flies by. Is there enough here for a third installment? I see no reason why not. The world of magic leads to infinite possibilities, and this cast is strong enough to carry a story and keep things fresh and fun. Personally I hope they do return again based on this fine effort.","27 out of 53 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Too Many Twists, Not Enough Magic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3499340/?ref_=tt_urv","PyroSikTh","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5261700/?ref_=tt_urv","5 July 2016","As far as the story goes, there is actually a lot of potential in Now You See Me 2. It's not long before Rhodes has to give up his role in the FBI and focus entirely on being a Horseman, there's a handful of new players in addition to Lulu, and almost everyone from the first movie returns (although the Interpol agent isn't even mentioned). There's plenty of twists at play in this movie. Too many in my opinion. Rather than build-up mystery and intrigue, it just throws twist after twist at you. Some of them are great, some of them are awful (great being the identity of the new villain's father, awful being the figurehead of The Eye; the mysterious organisation of magicians).Similarly some of the new characters are great, while others are awful. I was sad to hear that Isla Fisher wasn't returning as Henley. There's a reasonably plausible explanation as to why she's not around, but I'd rather have still had her around, even if it was in a reduced capacity or cameo. That said, Lizzy Caplan's Lulu is a worthy replacement. She adds a lot of much needed energy and quirkiness to the group that, without her, would have seemed incredibly dull and uninteresting. I'd probably go so far as to say she's the best character of the whole movie. With all the antagonists of the first movie out the way, Now You See Me 2 needed a new one, and Daniel Radcliffe's Walter Mabry is brilliant. Just like Caplan, he brings a surprising amount of energy to the movie, and his borderline sociopathic villain makes for a brilliant foil.Then there's Chase McKinney, Merritt's twin brother, also played by Woody Harrelson, who is a dreadful and pointless addition. He's Harrelson at his most goofy and annoying, and that awful wig certainly doesn't help. Not only that, but he serves no purpose in the movie, no purpose that couldn't have been served by someone else at least. The best comparison I can think of to a similar character is Alfrid in The Battle of Five Armies, who's only purpose was to bring cringeworthy and completely humourless comedy to an otherwise fairly serious movie, cheapening the whole experience.The returning cast are all back to what they do best, and honestly I'm surprised that even if they did all phone it in for the paycheck, it's not immediately obvious. Mark Ruffalo probably gets the most opportunity to add depth to his character of Dylan Rhodes, particularly after his status quo completely shifts early on. Morgan Freeman chews up the scenery as usual as a personal antagonist to Rhodes, and they share some great scenes together. Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, and Woody Harrelson all do great as the rest of the horsemen, but they sorely lacked any character development at all, resulting in each of their characters becoming little more than empty shells trundled around at behest of the plot.The real draw for me, and I'm sure many others too, was the magic tricks. These imaginative and fluid tricks made the first movie so enjoyable, even when they flirted with the plainly unbelievable, giving it that edge of pure fantasy that I really dug. Now You See Me 2 is a bit of a disappointment in that regard, as there isn't really a whole lot of magic. Their first show back is thwarted before they really get to do much (although I admit the build-up was entertaining). Beyond little easter eggs and teases here and there, that's it until the third act. Okay, we get an entertaining exchange of cards in a high security lab between them, but it goes on entirely too long (seriously, how many times can you search one body over and over), and is ultimately pointless, because they seem to just keep passing the card to the person next being searched, when really the first guy should've kept hold of it after cleverly keeping it out of sight. When we do get a promise of some magic, they almost always get interrupted. What was great last time was seeing these tricks play out to their end and the Horsemen getting away with it. This time they never get to finish anything as Mabry's men or the police always seem to barge in, and any getaways they have are similarly thwarted with ease. When they all coalesced onto motorcycles I sat up in my seat ready for a nailbiting car chase through the streets of London, but they don't even get out of the car park. The imaginative and well-prepared Horsemen seem to get outsmarted constantly this time, and that was just frustrating.I enjoyed Now You See Me 2 for the most part, and I am eager to see the third instalment if it gets made, but I can't deny that this second movie was a bit of a mess. It had far too many twists and turns, returning characters became dull and indistinguishable (somehow), and the fun of grand magic was completely absent. The action benefited a lot from John M Chu and his history of highly choreographed movies, but he was near useless at handling anything else the script threw at him I give Now You See Me 2 a slightly disappointing 6/10.P.S. I still can't believe they didn't call it ""Now You See Me Too"" or ""Now You Don't"". Even the original title of ""Now You See Me: The Second Act"" would have been a bit more imaginative.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Its sequel starts out with the same unpretentious and fun vibe of the first only to slowly escalate up to what becomes one of the most lifeless and visually painful experiences of the year.As I said the movie started out really fine, in the sense that it was doing what I wanted it to do. Nobody should or would walk into this film expecting the new ""Heat"", I just wanted to have some dumb fun, with a self referential film that doesn't take anything seriously and up to the fist two set-pieces of the film that's what I was getting. The cast was working the best they could and the action felt fluent and visually pleasing, there was a rhythm to it and a reason for it in particular.Yet, as soon as we start getting into this film's second act things fall apart to a mind numbing degree and I mean that literally, my mind went blank with the level of stupidity and inconsequentially of what was going on, I watched this film in a state of trance where I couldn't tell if I was dozing off or simply bored to death.""Now You See Me 2"" takes the levels of suspense of disbelief to a whole new world where not even laughing at the film proves to be of any kind of satisfaction, everything going on is just visual noise and other than being filmed in the most uninteresting and unstylish way possible, it has no momentum, no character, it's just there for the sake of extravaganza and it keeps going on for unbelievable amounts of time and it never proves to be any kind of pleasant.And we haven't even taken into consideration the logistical implications of what happens. It is just crazy. There is no grit of grounding of actions, stuff just keeps happening on top of other stuff and without any kind of character or story implications the film becomes more of a showcase of dull visual tricks. Not to mention the story twists it spices in which are preposterous to even think about and sprinkled with silly clichés and dialogue that not even Ruffalo or Freeman, two of the greatest actors, manage to make even passable.I got a head ache from this movie, it was a terrible experience, I don't recommend it and the shortness of my review is reflective of how lost with words I am about it.","280 out of 409 found this helpful.

It was possibly one of the finest examples of how, if you were willing to suspend your disbelief to epic levels, you really could have a great time watching it. It was Hollywood glitz and popcorn-munching fun all the way through. The - A-list - cast was perfect and played off each other brilliantly, depicting a quartet of modern day Robin Hood-style magicians who stole from the rich and corrupted through the use of their dazzling illusions and, in turn, gave back to the poor. I suppose its success basically guaranteed a sequel would be greenlit. And, where I do give the film credit for doing its best to follow-on closely from the events in the first outing, this time round it's just too unbelievable to be convincing - no matter how hard you try to suspend your disbelief.I really wanted to like this film - and I guess I did. There were plenty of neat moments here and there, it's just I wanted to like it a LOT. And I didn't. The story picks up a little while after the events of the first one and the most noticeable difference for me was the fact that Isla Fisher hasn't returned this time round. She's therefore instantly replaced by another female magician who slots into the team a little too well. Then we get to the meat of the story where the twists and turns start to overtake general common sense and credibility.The rest of the cast return, but the main newcomer is Daniel Radcliffe who entraps the magicians in an attempt to use their collective skills to steal something for him. And, as I mentioned, the 'magic' set-pieces are indeed well-filmed and cool to watch. However, the story just doesn't add up. One of the main complaints from the first one was the 'twist' which left some viewers feeling a little short-changed. Here, the film tries to 'out-twist' the original by taking the story in all sorts of directions which leave you truly confused as to who is on who's side and who is trying to double-cross who.I know that part of the fun with watching magicians perform is trying to guess how the trick is done. With the first film you could just about believe that the feats they carry out could just about be actually real if all the circumstances were just right. In the sequel, everything feels a little cheap as you naturally try to predict how they accomplish these feats, only to find out that the ways they do them are tantamount impossible.Overall, it's an enjoyable enough film, but it does try to be a little too clever for its own good and therefore ends up being too unbelievable to be credible.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well three of them are, Henley Reeves has been replaced by new girl Lula May. They plan to use their skills to expose a plot to steal personal data from anybody buying a new piece of software... things don't go to plan and the four must flee. Things take a surprising turn as they slide down a chute from a New York rooftop and land in a restaurant in Macau! Here Merritt McKinney is bet by his brother, and enemy, Chase, who takes them to Walter Mabry, a former employee of Chase who wants them to steal a chip that will give him access to any computer. Meanwhile their associate, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes is on their tail along with Thaddeus Bradley, the man they left to rot in jail. What follows is a succession of magic tricks that culminate in a final reveal in London on New Year's Eve as they face an old adversary.If the plot sounds a bit convoluted that is because it is at times. In a way that doesn't matter as it is there to provide and excuse for magic tricks and misdirection. Unfortunately this is often a problem as many of the tricks require the viewer to accept that a person can unwittingly be hypnotised in an instant or believe in tricks that clearly rely on CGI or other special effects. Also some of the tricks go on too long; notably how they pass the stolen chip between each other as they are searched. On the plus side, if you can suspend your disbelief, there are plenty of fun moments... I particularly liked Lula's simple bit rather disturbing tricks. The cast is solid and clearly having fun; that fun is infectious at least while watching the film. Once it was over I felt it had passed the two hours well enough but imagine most of it will soon be forgotten. Overall hardly a must see but fun enough.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Mark Ruffalo was alright in this one, and in my opinion he wasn't as good here as in the first one. OK, I enjoyed Woody Harrelson and his character, but his evil twin brother was just a big mistake and I really think the character would've been better off by being played by a different actor, I also thought the twin brother was just really annoying and purposefully weird and I thought his character was just crap. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine have really strong presences in this movie and they really give great performances. Daniel Radcliffe is alright, not quite as good as I thought he would be, but still not terrible or bad. And last but not least, there is Dave Franco, the sexy smoldering Dave Franco...... He is great here, he is one of my favorite things about this film. The action is good, not as great or often as in the original movie, but what's here is still sufficient.

But laying low for a year doesn't sit well with headstrong Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), who ignores leader Dylan Rhodes' (Mark Ruffalo) assertions to remain patient. Instead, he secretly contacts the Eye, the mythical organization that cryptically controls the band of thieves.Shortly thereafter, Rhodes gathers the Horsemen together for their next assignment and to introduce them to new recruit Lula May (Lizzy Kaplan). When their plot to expose unethical communications company Octa goes awry, resulting in the Horsemen's identities being revealed to the world, they become ensnared in a trap devised by ruthless tech genius Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe). Forced to steal a computer chip from Mabry's longtime rival, Atlas, May, Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) must outwit both hunter and prey, all while staying one step ahead of the FBI agent (Sanaa Lathan) hot on their trail and the scheming magic-debunker, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), hellbent on revenge.Revisiting the perilous underworld of magicians sounds like an antonymous event - and it most certainly is. Still teetering on the ludicrous brink of a 007 adventure filled with the sarcastic jokers of ""Ocean's Eleven,"" this crew of heisters more closely resembles special forces soldiers or secretive government agents than amateur stage magicians, even if they call themselves ""Elite Magic Society"" members. With a plot of ""Mission: Impossible""-styled infiltration and theft, there's really no room for magicians at all. And, once again, it seems that all aspiring illusionists want to be like Robin Hood. What ever happened to doing magic tricks for the sake of entertainment? A vengeful, villainous discreditor takes the place of a James Bond supervillain, while the FBI - and any other form of law enforcement - is so meaningless that it's easy to forget their purpose every quarter-hour when they briefly rear their heads. At the same time, there isn't enough written into the story to require one-to-two Horsemen, let alone the four-to-five that actually frequent the picture, or the bevy of whiny evildoers who attempt to manipulate the protagonists like puppets. And this doesn't even take into account the actual culprit behind the figurehead villain, or the ringleader prestidigitator behind all the human pawns ushered about on a global chessboard - or Woody Harrelson's dual role as a twin, which has to be one of the most unnecessary gimmicks ever employed.Once again, the biggest problem with this film is the depiction of magic. Every trick is not simple sleight-of-hand or misdirection, but rather outrageously over-complicated feats of absurdity - so extreme that only computer-generated imagery can be used to represent them. Since movie-making itself is something of a deception, this dependence on utterly unbelievable cheats of matter and energy - which could have been possible through editing techniques alone - only dulls the sense of wonderment. None of the illusions performed are even remotely engaging, especially considering that after each one is demonstrated, a flashback has to rudely interrupt the action to explain how it was orchestrated. Certainly, none of it is inspirational. Like ""The Game"" (1997), a constant dubiousness presides over every endeavor, introducing perpetual doubt as to the truthfulness of the storytelling. By the end, viewers will wish it was all just a big dream sequence.If it weren't bad enough that all of the phantasms were designed specifically to make the audience feel stupid, the characters appear to be scripted to be deliberately annoying, as if to provoke further agitation. Everyone is overly confident - or they sit in the background, silently being smarter than everyone else. Repartee and flirtation hope to distract the audience from the unoriginality of the various missions, each involving time, training, and resources that couldn't possibly be available.And, most distressing of all, are the plot holes (or elements of laziness), which are so large and numerous that the entirety of the Thames could be poured into them. Language barriers and deadly weapons never present problems; the Horsemen are acknowledged and welcomed in every country as if universal celebrities, despite the fact that they're wanted criminals who have been in hiding for a year (even in specialized product launch events they're applauded as if superheroes crashing a party); geographical inconsistencies and the passing of time are completely ignored; the planning and coordination of various ruses are conducted mostly off-screen, as if in an alternate universe where nothing can interfere with them; hypnotization is conjured up continuously with total effectiveness, as if Jedi Masters were commanding the weak-minded; and characters survive daring ordeals that would normally require diving equipment or Olympic training or animal wranglers or, at the very least, plenty of implanted assistants ready to feign shock or surprise (at one point, a random street-crowd onlooker has a pigeon fly out of his pants). For a movie all about precise plotting and skillful swindles, it sure is sloppy.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Two of the three screenwriters of the 2013 first film reunited to write this sequel, which brings the same heroes to the screen, or, I should say, almost the same hero, because the female lead actress has been changed. The director of the first series was also no longer available, or perhaps did not want to continue, and the producers hired the services of Jon M. Chu, a talented director by the way, whose next two films would be even more interesting, but who was not too convincing here, in my opinion. Benefiting from an excellent cast, they brought back to the screen the story of the four show magicians who use their talents not only for entertainment but also for anti-corporate actions and sometimes, when forced, for seemingly impossible heists. 'Now You See Me' number one managed to be a quality action comedy with likable characters and quite original and clearly exposed action. 'Now You See Me 2' tries the same but everything seems to be lower on the scale of success. The story is more complicated, not all the scenes of theft and action are clear, the jokes touch more seldom, and the heroes also seem a little more tired, even if the cast gets reinforcements. The main problem in my opinion - the script.In the opening scene of the film, we learn that Dylan Rhodes (FBI agent and handler of the Four Horsemen) has personal reasons to fear the demystifier of the illusionists, Thaddeus, even though he is now in prison. An attempt to uncover the corporate machinations of a large tech firm fails, and the four knights find themselves magically transported from London to Macau. Those who have control over the persons and actions of the four are asking them to pull off one more of those hits that only they are capable of. The stake is a kind of digital key that would allow access to any computer in this world. The heist scene is central, as in any heist movie, but the adventures only get more complicated from here.Most of the main characters from the first series also return in 'Now You See Me 2'. Woody Harrelson's character even finds a twin brother and the actor gets to play a double role. Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo and Dave Franco reprise their roles and Lizzy Caplan is an excellent stand-in for the female quartet. Daniel Radcliffe is a suitable 'bad guy' in the role. Seeing Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman separately or together (in their sixth out of seven screen collaborations so far) is always a pleasure, even if their roles are not very generous this time. It is visible that the producers have invested in taking us to exotic places or to the metropolis of London. Why does 'Now You See Me 2' still not seem to work as well as the original 'Now You See Me'? One of the differences is in the way illusionis numbers are explained. Or rather in the way they are not explained, because the key scene of the film is based on ... the magic of CGI effects rather than the supposed talents of the protagonists. The 'magic revealed' effect is lost, and viewers get nothing new in return. The result is that everything is OK, the production is technically at least as good as in the first film, but the effect on the audience is diminished. At least in my case. There are rumors that 'Now You See Me 3' is in the works. If the scriptwriters of the third series don't have new tricks up their sleeves, then maybe they should think again. A show that just repeats old tricks has less chance of success. This is both true in magician shows and in movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Magic & Comedy Trying to Mask That It's Just Another Sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3491216/?ref_=tt_urv","sfgebel315","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37637778/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2016","Much like any sequel, it's not as good, but it gives us another crack at the world we liked enough for there to be a sequel in the first place. Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg), Jack (Dave Franco), and Merritt (Woody Harrelson) are still in hiding from their ultimate trick. Henley (Isla Fisher) has left, stated to have been fed up with their year and counting of hiding. Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) has brought in a new female, Lula (Lizzy Caplan) so the Four Horsemen can resurface and pull off another ultimate magic show. However, a new player on the board usurps them and Dylan's cover with the FBI is blown. This disaster of a comeback was orchestrated by Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Merritt's ""evil twin"" Chase. Mabry wants the Horsemen to steal a computer chip thingamajig, but as we all know, that is only the surface of the plot. Not going to lie, I actually like Caplan's Lula better than Fisher's Henley. There I said it. If a third film is made--as the ending suggests--I hope she stays with the rest of the cast. That being said, ""evil twin"", really? But I digress...Aside from Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Hunger Games: Catching Fire I'm not entirely sure how often a sequel equals or surpasses it's predecessor. Usually it doesn't, simply because it can't. Therefore, I'd ignore the criticism that is solely based on this being number two and focus more on the criticism about the film itself.For the fact that I was having a bad day and needed a simplistic film with a good laugh, this was just the fix. However, I was surprised at how simplistic it was. The first film was well ""WOW"" is really the only word to describe it. We delved back into the world of magicians and trickery, and that mixed with the Leverage element of righting wrongs, made it a very entertaining film. Yet it was more thriller with the FBI agent trying to catch the ""criminals"". The magic was secondary. The sequel places the magic first and foremost, which became too much. Too many tricks that we can't keep up with and can't believe. Part of the magic of magic is believability, but when the tricks are happening at lightening-speed and so frequently the audience has no choice but to sit back and just nod. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun to watch. But there are four magicians all playing tricks, mixed with the other plot twists, and really the film is just magic tricks in sequential order that without the film would fall apart. What was even worse is that I figured out the ending right away. Not the very very end, but the ending with the ""antagonists"". It was like a Las Vegas welcome sign that was impossible to miss. I'm still trying to decide if that was intentional. If you see the film you'll see that they once again have three tricks leading to the finale, and with each trick the magician stresses how it's important for the audience to pay attention. So I did, which is why I figured it out so quickly. But like I said, perhaps that was intentional...though if it wasn't then the film loose significant points in my book. I will say that once again we had plenty of comedy between the four horsemen. That was entertaining in and of itself.Overall I would say the film is good. Good enough that I don't regret seeing it, good enough that I would likely see a third if it is made, but still just another sequel all the same.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I used to think that the characters in the first movie were good and well tough out - they were good as a team and fun to be watched.

Can a card slide through your body that easily?To summarise, the movie is bad in everything (story line, acting, dialogue) Don't even bother to watch it.","147 out of 225 found this helpful.

I saw it in cinemas yesterday and it was one of the best movies I have seen in a while, and the two people I went with agreed. I also thought that visually, humour-wise and acting-wise, this movie was better than its predecessor. The visuals are, as usual, incredible. The effects are fantastic and I love the way they show all of the tricks. It's exciting, intense and a bit over dramatic, but hey, that's what you get from the Now You See Me franchise, and I love it. Not only this, but it has a fantastic soundtrack and what can only be described as 'cool' sound effects. They are well placed and frankly, awesome! People are accusing this movie of being overly-CGI, having a bloated plot and being worse than the original, which in my opinion is ridiculous! Obviously it's going to be loaded with CGI - it's a movie about magicians and illusionists! It's far cheaper to use CGI than to actually do the tricks. Not only this, but I failed to find a problem with the CGI. It was done well, not too excessively and definitely used to the movie's advantage. The plot was most certainly not bloated, it had a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining plot arc and the characters were each well developed ( well, as developed as they could have been in this rather fast moving movie). I liked it better than the original. I loved the addition of Lizzy Caplan replacing Isla Fischer (which was done smoothly), and the new objective of the Four Horsemen (which again I won't go into, but was exciting, hilarious and at times even emotional). The acting was great, there weren't any phenomenal performances however, again, this is simply not the type of movie that you go to if you want to watch some great classic or moving story, you go to it to have a good time and to have fun. One standout performance for me was Mark Ruffalo's, but I won't say why because it will breach guidelines and become a spoiler, most likely. Dave Franco's performance as always was charming, Jesse Eisenberg's was funny, Daniel Radcliffe was also great, and of course Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were fantastic. My one reservation was that it was rather predictable. I won't say any specific plot points just in case of spoilers, but I did figure out the basic plot arc before the halfway mark. Then again, this is Now You See Me, and something I loved about these movies was how they can take a basic plot and turn it into something spectacular. If you liked the previous Now You See Me then I'm sure you'll love this. If I were to describe it I'd describe it as Inception, but with less of a tragic backstory and more of a funny, exciting and dramatic plot line and characters. I loved it and cannot wait for Now You See Me 3!","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

Despite my bitterness toward this, I was looking forward to the return of the Four Horsemen this past May. And while this is not a well- made film, there is still a lot of fun to be had.Led by illusionists Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), infamous magicians known as the Four Horsemen are back to entertain and thieve using their skills in deception and sleight of hand. Daniel Radcliffe also joins the cast as tech genius Walter Mabry, who forces the Horsemen to steal a chip that will give him control of all of the world's computers.What made ""Now You See Me"" so entertaining was the chemistry between the Four Horsemen and the energy they brought to each of their shows. A nice subplot about a lone detective hunting down the magicians in between their shows also kept the viewers' interest as they awaited the Horsemen's next spectacle.This sequel offers an abundance of plot and new characters, but not enough spectacle. While Rhodes' subplot is somewhat interesting, the resolution of it undermines the impact of the first film's plot twist. The replacement of Isla Fisher's Henley Reeves with Lizzy Caplan's Lula as the female Horseman was also an unwelcome change.However, in the little time they do have in the spotlight, the Horsemen are once again electric. Their charisma and charm give the film just enough magic to overshadow its flawed storytelling and direction.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Overall less believable with no controlled polished magic and the two strands of 'the eye' and Michael Caine's vindictive baddie stretch credulity to breaking point. Missed Isla Fisher, her replacement character (Lizzy Caplan) jarred with her exaggerated persona - part antagonistic and part 'need to please'.The ending wrapping up with cosy feel-good reconciliation is a disappointing choice; especially so after the final set of trickery which was impressive. There is NYSM 3 in the works, it will be interesting to see whence the threat/tension cometh as all the antagonists are spent. Hopefully it will bounce back to the levels of the first movie and perhaps the lovely Ms Fisher will return from maternity.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong here, the acting was decent, and I'll let you know where the movie failed for me. So, let's get into it.Synopsis: One year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public's adulation with their Robin Hood-style magic spectacles, The Four Horsemen resurface for a comeback performance in hopes of exposing the unethical practices of a tech magnate. The man behind their vanishing act is none other than Walter Mabry, a tech prodigy who threatens the Horsemen into pulling off their most impossible heist yet. Their only hope is to perform one last unprecedented stunt to clear their names and reveal the mastermind behind it all. Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzie Caplan, Mark Ruffalo, Daniel Radcliffe Director: Jon M. ChuThe Ugly: The worst part about this movie is the same as the first movie. It's the story, plain and simple. How could people not put two and two together in the first movie when it came to Ruffalo's character? The same happens here. Here we find out who the leader of the eye is, and what the motivations are, but it is pointless because it nulls the first movie. Such a major let down on story telling here.The Bad: Yes, the acting was good to me, except for one person. Radcliffe is a good actor, but here he seemed lost in the shuffle. Too much was going on throughout the movie. He just couldn't reveal his acting chops.The Good: It's not the acting that made this movie a decent one for me, it was the illusions. From the stories out there, the actors did most of the tricks themselves. Granted, there were a few parts that relied more on CGI than on actual old school tricks, but it was still a fun ride watching them. The tricks are what made this movie.Final Thoughts: Wait for it to come out on TV or something. Don't go out and buy it or Red Box. There is no wait here.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks.

It's just a really light, breezy, nonstop fun movie, and it knows it. And the trailer for this movie looked like it would be more of the same, which I was completely fine with. Unfortunately, the trailer is infinitely better than the actual film.Honestly, this movie was embarrassing to watch. From the childishly annoying character that Lizzy Caplan plays, to the horrendously unfunny identical twin that Woody Harrelson plays, I was cringing in my seat and praying for deliverance. Now, one could argue that Lizzy Caplan's character was intentionally annoying, and that Woody Harrelson's twin character was intentionally unfunny, and while I would agree with that, it still didn't make for an enjoyable viewing experience, especially when these two characters had a significant amount of screen time.I can't deny that ""Now You See Me 2"" did have some very entertaining sequences, with one particular scene involving an elaborate card trick being the definite highlight of the film. However, these few scenes couldn't save this forgettable mess of a film. I mean honestly, I'm having a hard time writing this review because I can't even remember what I disliked about this movie. It's just a completely forgettable film in every way that will leave your mind as soon as the credits start.Huh, come to think of it, maybe this film did do something right after all: it disappears completely, just like a real magician would.","53 out of 83 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first one a lot! Really! But not being able to remember what's up with the FBI guy and that the other magician was supposed to be dead, was a pleasure kill in the beginning of the movie. Other than that, it was nicely made. The tricks were really cool, once more, although a bit far-fetched at times (but that's why you watch movies like that in the first place). Brilliant cast, and nicely acted by all performers involved! I think it was the second time after the batman movie that Caine and Freeman were in the same movie, which is a guarantee on its own! I enjoyed watching it, even if it seemed to drag out a bit longer than it should. Really looking forward to seeing a third movie. I think that this one was not as good as the first one, but it's nice when there's room for improvement! It seems like it was an intermediate step just to get to the third one. I guess that we'll have to wait and see. Nonetheless, I really liked the funny parts in some phases of the movie.

This year's sequel sees us eighteen months since the events of the first film and the Four Horsemen are tasked with performing a heist for Daniel Radcliffe.First off, you have to acknowledge the all-star cast here; I really enjoyed them in the first one so it was great to see the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Morgan Freeman and more back on board. They all do an excellent job of course and get straight back into these characters who's lives I was fully invested in. After the twist at the end of the original I was wondering how Ruffalo's character would change but I really enjoyed the majority of his arc in this and it builds on what we knew of his back-story already which was cool. We did have some new characters introduced to us and they were just OK; Isla Fisher did not return as the female Horseman so they bring in Lizzy Caplan as this new magician and despite a bit of a rushed introduction she was surprisingly tolerable; her character may be a little irritating to some as she is used as the comic relief a lot which was unnecessary and I do think Fisher's character was more interesting but as far as replacements go, she wasn't bad. Daniel Radcliffe also joins this cast as our antagonistic billionaire who wants something only the Horseman can get; so yeah it's a plot-point we've seen a lot of times in film but hey, it is a heist movie so I'll let it slide. He was absolutely fine in his character, not quite as threatening as sometimes I think he was meant to be but once you get used to this what this type of movie is, he's more than adequate.Just touching on the plot; it's a basic heist movie with the Now You See Me glitter all over it so plenty of illusions and visually interesting effects. I enjoyed it quite a lot, plenty of action, plenty of tricks, the locations were interesting as well, quite international which I enjoyed. There were a few twists here and there but some you could see coming and others I wasn't particularly keen on. I know they tried to top the big reveal of the last movie but it didn't really work here; it seemed to struggle explaining what it was they were surprising us with. But as a whole the main story worked for me.Something, or rather someone, I did not enjoy much was a particular character they introduced as a relative to one of the horseman; his purpose was a little unnecessary and what they made him into just brought the quality of this movie down. He was more suited for some sort of comedy which unfortunately this film tried to much of. The first film had funny moments and Harrelson was our comic relief but now they've introduced two more ""funny"" characters and it cheapened it at times.My last critique is that unless you enjoy the first film and have watched it recently I don't think you'll enjoy Now You See Me 2 as much. It requires you to remember a lot which was OK for me as I have seen the original a few times but for a casual viewer you are left asking a few questions. So in the end, if you didn't like the first one, you won't like this. For me it wasn't quite as neat and shiny as the Now You See Me but entertaining enough.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Like its predecessor, the movie follows the same behaviour pattern by showing the same amount of crazy, unexplainable magic tricks, so that we, the moviegoers, can feel impressed and amazed. Even though the movie tries to explain some of its many insane magic tricks, some tricks are still left unexplained which leaves me as viewer with an increased skepticism of the lack of realness showed in the movie. I know the movie is supposed to be fun, exciting and nothing more, but it would still have been nice to see some kind of explanation to some of the bigger tricks, that did not involve cards. For the acting part: Lizzy Caplan did a good job as the replacer for Isla Fisher, being both credible and funny. I loved that her humour felt real and not forced, and when I say ""forced"" I mean in a way where scriptwriters make her say one too many funny one-liners, but instead she would say what came to her mind and it worked great. Mark Ruffalo was great and had by far the most emotional story in the movie, which made him more interesting to follow than any of the other Four Horsemen. Daniel Radcliff as the main antagonist also worked great, and I really believed his portrayal of a crazy, sociopathic billionaire. The one performance in the movie that annoyed me was by someone who played a twin-brother to one of the horsemen, and this characters behaviour just got on my nerves throughout the movie. In the end, the movie is a good time with popcorn and soda, and instead of asking yourself, ""how the f**k did they pull that trick of?"" you should just try by going with the flow of the movie and it will give you 2 hours of fun and excitement.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Don't be fooled by the great cast. This one is straight to VOD and everything in this film says ""cash in on the mild success of the first."" What makes fun is the ""how did they do that?"" question. But in this one, they tell you. It's only possible in a movie like this where you get the help of CGI and ask you to believe that the dumb things you see and know couldn't happen just happen. They will definitely not make a third.The first movie in this series was something of a failure because it decided to foolishly allow it's ""heroes"" to pull of feats of wonder that were simply impossible without help from CGI. Hollywood seems to think that pushing the limits beyond is a good thing, forgetting that most of us with a brain get bumped right out of movie land magic once a movie shows reminds us of how false of a premise it is. The suspension of disbelief is gone and you're left just with disbelief.So this film has a problem that is evident early. How can we top the preposterous nature of the first film with something even more improbable and ridiculous? Ten minutes into the film they use CGI twice in one scene that is so absurd that you can't help but feel insulted. No!!! It really IS magic! THIS is what you should expect from this movie. And if you can buy this lazy effort and pretend as if the totally super cool amazingly impossible is somehow possible -perhaps you'll like this film. It's the kind of magic that only superheroes can pull off. And that only works because it's never meant to be real like this is. I hated it. I only stayed with it because of company. Save your money. And even if it's free, save your time. And if you're really curious, just wait for that scene 10 minutes into the movie to decide whether you really want to be dumb enough to waste another hour plus. The script is bad enough and the acting lazy so that you can make that decision easily. At least I've helped you gauge whether you want to watch this film or plan on having an alternative plan to escape from this movie.... like magic.","97 out of 182 found this helpful.

It was fun enough, though, so I'd give it a 7 out of 10.Much of my enjoyment was hampered here by the use of an overly convenient plot device that was also utterly ridiculous — one of the ""Four Horsemen"" protagonists can simply employ hypnosis to persuade anybody to do anything. It seems like a godlike power, and it feels like a pretty big cheat on the part of the screenwriter. (I think anyone familiar with hypnosis knows it absolutely doesn't work as depicted here, anyway.)If even one of the protagonists has this ability, why do they need to employ legerdemain to commit or stop crimes in the first place? Instead of disguises or sleight-of-hand, couldn't they just program unwilling confederates to do everything for them, at minimal risk to themselves? And why steal anything in a conventional sense, if they can just brainwash a target into ""giving"" it to them?Like the first film, though, ""Now You See Me 2"" is entertaining, if you take it as an escapist fantasy. It's still a pretty creative premise, and it's still nice and funny. (The exception is a bunch of jokes connected with a twin brother for Woody Harrelson's character. The character, also played by Harrelson, was annoying and creepy enough to make me cringe.)One nice addition to this film was Lizzy Caplan as the new female ""horseman"" after the departure of actress Isla Fisher. Caplan is charismatic and fun to watch, and she has good comic timing.I'd recommend seeing this, if you enjoyed the first movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The plot is very similar to its predecessor but in my opinion there is no need to change something for the sake of change, it works and it works well. The majority of the cast return (minus Isla Fisher but is replaced by Lizzy Caplan who was a great addition) and whilst most of them are doing their job fine, some are more captivating (I'm looking at you Ruffalo and Radcliffe). The majority of twists and turns are predictable but that does not deter from what is an enjoyable flick. The magic is great and some of the scenes are so outlandishly ridiculous that you just go along with it (especially one scene involving a card and a search team...seriously genius). It does take a while for the film to get going but once in full motion, this 129 minute ride will fly by. Overall, a decent sequel that may have lost the mystery that its predecessor played with but the magic is still there for what I would consider an enjoyable flick.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) remain after the Eye releases member Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). Lula May (Lizzy Caplan) is eager to join the Horsemen. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) gives them the job of taking down tech businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb). The group gets exposed, and kidnapped by Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Merritt's twin Chase McKinney to Macau, China. Walter is Owen's former partner and has faked his death to go off grid. He blackmails the Horsemen to steal a chip that can decrypt anything from Owen. That's before the return of Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine).I like Isla Fisher but substituting for Lizzy Caplan is a great move. She is loads of fun and the main reason I like this more than the original. I like this movie up to Radcliffe's reveal of their kidnapping. I don't think the Harrelson twin adds anything great. It's a functional caper movie until the twists pile up. Like the original, the movie deteriorates in the second half and I stop caring. It's a mixed review but I love some great Lizzy.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This time Dylan Shrike, still posing as an FBI agent, asks them to expose a company who has a computer card that can get into any computer and manipulate the data.Again, they come up against their nemesis, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) whom they robbed a year ago, and his son (Daniel Radcliffe), who want not only the card but to bring down the Horsemen.The whole thing culminates in a huge New Year's Eve show in London.I thought this was fun and entertaining, not to mention outrageous, but that's part of the fun too.

Not so Much On Story","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3486527/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2016","Robbie K back again, and this time with the third review of the week. This installment focuses on yet another sequel to grace the silver screen and one I never expected, or wanted, to come. My review is on Now You See Me 2, as you can guess from my posting, an attempt to follow up on the successful thriller from 2013. But can this film follow a truly great act? Or is this merely another money making scheme whose name overshadows the quality. Let's get to the review to find out. If you remember the first movie, it was a crime/thriller with an underlying mystery that came to a well-concluded end. Natural, come up with an even more intriguing mystery and throw in a little vengeance on top of that. Now You See Me 2 takes place merely a year after the last installment and focuses on uncovering the mystery of the Eye, the organization that recruited our ""heroes"" in the first installment, who may have set them up for failure. The plot is certainly intriguing, and the team manages to throw those famous curve balls we saw in the first film. While the mystery isn't quite as good as the first one, and the thrills are a bit stale, it makes for an intriguing story nonetheless. My mind was constantly trying to decipher how deep the rabbit hole went and just who was in cahoots when it came to dismantling the team. In addition, they added some of the character development that the last installment lacked, some of which was good and some of which was cornier than a corn maze at a harvest festival. Outside of the mystery, the vengeance part is so-so in terms of quality. Multiple people have a vendetta against our crew and they go through extraordinary lengths to get it done. However, one of the new characters Walter (Daniel Radcliffe) was not the villain to do so and was more annoying than menacing. Regardless the plot against them wasn't as suspenseful and a mediocre attempt to try and keep you on your seats as if there were harm to your characters. I applaud them at the good attempt, and appreciate the somewhat emotional twist at the end (which made some of the events in the first movie irrelevant), the vengeance plot was merely a scaffolding for impressive stunts. But it's the stunts and magic that really draw the eye in this film. Like the last installment, number 2 has plenty of convoluted plans that show some serious imagination and cleverness. Fans will be pulled into the confusion of how the gang ended up where they were, only to be wowed by the thorough explanation of how the trick was pulled off. When you pull in the fantastic use of CGI, the stunts only get more impressive as our magicians disappear in ways you only dream about. But again the realistic factor sometimes gets drowned out when a convenient opening appears for our group to take (e.g. a box magically collapsing, a trap door in the middle of a crowded street, or a mirror suddenly appearing). These moments are again cool, but a bit eye rolling when they wrap it up with one sentence, which boils down to ""we wanted something cool, but we could only do it sloppily."" Overall though, these stunts prove imagination is not dead, and that originality can come in the simplest forms. In terms of the casting this is another major strength of the movie. Eisenberg reprises his role as Atlas who still has the chip on his shoulder and ego issues. The snarky comments are fun and funny, but for once I felt it was a bit diluted compared to some of his other roles. Woody Harrelson as the hypnotist was a grand addition and provided some of the funniest moments on the screen with his banter and dialogue. The jokes get a bit tired, but all in all his role in this film has greatly improved. Dave Franco took a bigger role in this one, bringing humor, looks, and a charming story that I really enjoyed. And Mark Ruffalo, well a little sappier and less humor, but it works on a different level than his original character. As for newcomer Lula (Lizzy Caplan) at first she was annoying and too over acted (an attempt at using the shallow comedy for laughs), but then she grew on me and started becoming a much more integral cog into the mix. As for Radcliffe, the actor is still solid in his abilities, but the direction of his character was more whiny brat than anything else and somewhat of a waste of his talents (think Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 movie). Despite the flaws though, the cast really supports one another and makes for an entertaining team. Overall Now You See Me 2 is a fun, entertaining sequel that I enjoyed. The stunts are exciting, the plans convoluted, and the acting is top notch on most grounds. While the story isn't quite as thrilling, and there are components that didn't work for me, it still outshines most of the stuff that hits the theaters these days. I recommend a theater visit for this one as well, but you'll probably get the most out of your money if you rent in about three months. Regardless, enjoy the show and may it be as entertaining to you as it was for me. My scores: Action/Comedy/Thriller: 8 Movie Overall: 7","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This film is the sequel to Now You See Me, we have the Four Horsemen back except one of them: Isla Fisher, who's been replaced by Lizzy Caplan. The pleasure of NYSM2 is that the Horsemen perform magic with human powers. They are superheroes of the mind. Three years ago NYSM was a grand illusion thriller, drawing on elements from Nolan's The Prestige and Soderbergh's Ocean series. Mark Ruffalo is the core character of this film, his sincerity makes it work. In my opinion he carries the entire film. He has a heartfelt story in the film and his character has been given the most logical reasons to be there and exist. All of the other characters seem to be contractually obliged to be there. Whereas Ruffalo has motivation. As far as characters go, the rest don't really have much going on. Bigger isn't always better, in the case of sequel, especially in a movie about magicians and out-tricking people. Less is better. The key is accuracy. Though, the director keeps things moving at a smooth pace. The first movie had me questioned some of the things that happened, but for the most part you go gracefully along and have fun! In some ways this sequel is quite the same but it lacks of substance. There's tons of flashy big sequences but none of them really had up to anything. Furthermore, there were an absurd amount of continuity errors in this film. usually I don't look for that sort of things, and filmmakers don't expect their audience to. However, when you examines film and you really look for errors like that, it starts to become noticeable. Finally, this movie is edited with impressive rapid-fire precision. We keep thinking: when is the climax going to arrive? Overall, in NYSM2 there is always more than meets the eye.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Surely they would have enough magic to make a great sequel. However it was not the case, the film was respectable on its own but a poor follow up to the first film. After the triumph of the first film they didn't need to and shouldn't have made another film. The first film ended off perfectly. It would be nice if for once Hollywood wasn't so concerned with making money and cared about the integrity of a film and any legacy it might have. You don't see Christopher Nolan making Inception 2?This film lacked the magic that occurred in the first film. It was predictable which is the worst thing that can occur for a film about magic and mystery. Lizzie Caplan was a terrible addition to the horseman and it just didn't work.

Now You See Me 2 (2016) is no exception. I really liked Now You See Me (2013) because the genres of ""magic"" and ""heist"" merge so easily together. Now three years later, and I certainly looked forward to this sequel, despite not knowing how the plot could advance any further than it had at the end of the first film.While the sequel did not disappoint, with numerous illusions, plenty of action, and loads of comedy, it felt like it was the same old gimmick as the original. Sure, there was a little more exploration into ""the Eye"", but most of the plot of the second film centered on the consequences of the robberies from the first film (almost weighing it down, in my opinion). The addition of Daniel Radcliffe as a winking nod to his Harry Potter character was fun as a reveal, but didn't offer much in terms of plot development. In fact, I almost liked Woody Harrelson playing twin brothers more, but that's likely due to the comedic value.Unfortunately, because Now You See Me 2 focused almost entirely on the background of Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), I felt it was held back to its full potential. None of the other characters really grew that much, but they were rewarded for working together (after running into a few snags), much like they did in their first appearance on screen. Don't get me wrong, the formula works for me and I was entertained, but maybe this franchise would have been better served as a TV series instead of a potential film trilogy.Still enjoyable with the same bag of tricks, I give Now You See Me 2 3.5 stars out of 5.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sure the ""slight of hand"" antics are still present, but having so much explanation associated with most tricks is downright time consuming and boring. While Lizzy Caplan (""Master of Sex"" - TV) steps in as the fourth Horsemen, her contributions are left to be the bubbling fourth wheel performing amateur magic diversions, ""never stop smiling"" Dave Franco's (original NYSM) trickery (stand behind the cards and toss playing cards) is boring at best, and Woody Harrelson's ""two-part"" performance is beyond positive explanation. Daniel Radcliffe steps in as the spoiled rich kid felon, yet somehow his character just doesn't matter, and could it be that I'm just tried of watching/hearing Jesse Eisenberg's always the same delivery?

It is still s bit of a fun ride watching them pull things off though. You might enjoy watching it of you enjoyed watching the first movie.

The Louis Leterrier redemption movie was exhilarating three years ago. The pressure is on. Can the directory of the Justin Bieber documentaries follow up to the expectations the Four Horsemen set in the first picture? As I sat there watching the late comers take their seats, I thought to myself, I will never understand folks coming in to a movie of this nature late!Undeniably the strongest narrative voices of our time, the opening Freeman monologue locks you in, everything else is now background noise. The returning cast with the exception of Isla Fisher and the inclusion of Lizzy Caplan makes the new four horsemen. NOW YOU SEE ME 2 picks up a year following the exit of the horsemen. They resurface in a performance to clear their names by exposing the tech goliath Octa. Octa seems to be the least of the problems as the FBI closes in.Jessie Eisenbergs' eccentricity, Dave Francos' prattle, Woody Harrelsons' comic- relief, Mark Ruffalos poise and Lizzy Caplans charm are all on point. Director Jon M. Chu recognizes that the screenplay is weak (just as in ""1""), the characters have no depth and the audience yearning for gimmicks. He delivers. Just like any Bond movie, MI movie, or Fast & Furious movie, its about being flashier than its predecessors. In that category I think ""2"" isn't all that bad.Danielle Radcliffe to me always will be Harry Potter (his fame came at a price). He certainly has the range as an actor but the 24-year-old to millions will always be the wizard. Radcliffes' character of Walter Mabry is surprisingly the most versatile. Given more screen time I would chose Radcliffe over Eisenbergs as the most interesting performance. Freeman and Caine need to not even speak, their presence on its own add value.Did we really need ""2""? Well its too late for that question now since ""3"" is already rumored. Arguably a parody of the first script? To an extent yes, I prefer to consider it a continuation. Exhilarating? Entertaining? Engaging? Yes. Yes. Yes. Do you need to have watched the first movie? Yes. One of the most thrilling pictures this summer? Absolutely. A must watch? Why not.TITLE: NOW YOU SEE ME 2 DIRECTED BY: JON M.

The bold, brassy, in your face gal, Lula played by Lizzy Caplan, her replacement, not only did nothing for the film but she kept the whole feeling of the 'team' from forming. They never came together as a group with her in there. The addition of Daniel Radcliffe was a brilliant stroke. He was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. Another wonderful character added was Bu Bu played by Tsai Chin, as the little oriental shop owner. And please, could they not find a razor to fit Mark Ruffalo's face? I love him, but he looked so tired and scruffy – mainly because of that face full of whiskers, that I was put off. In other words, this film had all the makings of another great picture like the first Now You See Me, but because of a few flaws, mostly Lizzy Caplan, it just never got there. What a shame. Was so looking forward to it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Firstly Before going into this film I was very disappointed that Isla Fisher is no longer coming back but I was interested in seeing how they would handle that. I was pleasantly surprised with Lizzy Caplan's Lula who may strike annoying at times but seems to handle it just right so it isn't too over the top at times.There were several odd things in this film including Woody Harrelson playing two roles. It was unnecessary and just made it all seem very strange. The film seems to lose some of the fun elements that the original had and is replaced with fast talking and a very sloppy plot. I found it quite predictable at times which makes their efforts of making big reveals seem amazing and unbelievable pretty stupid. However the final act I feel was great and I feel was really what they should have stuck with instead of this dull series of talking, outsmarting and little tricks. The large scale and the tricks I feel is what made me like the first film so much and should have been a larger part of this film. I would expect at least 2 or 3 large scale performances from the horseman.Another more personal problem of the film would center around a minor character played by Jay Chou. Since I am a Taiwanese I payed close attention to Jay Chou's involvement with the production of Now you see me 2. I was disappointed that he was after all apparently just a sales gimmick to sell more tickets to the Asian market. It was ridiculous that His character got around 5 minutes of screen time and around 10 lines and he was still front and center of some of the posters of Now you see me 2 that I've seen. He was more of a cameo really, this sort of false advertising made me leave the theater quite disappointed after all. I understand that the language barrier would likely result in him not be able to deliver well in terms of acting and dialogue but in that case studios shouldn't throw him on every poster selling him as some sort of major character.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But are they able to succeed the brilliantly over-complicated Now You See Me or would their second act disappoint, Join Film an TV Nerd to find out.2013's Now You See Me was entertaining nonsense, and the sequel is pretty much the same deal.So the short version of this review is that if you liked the first film then this one will probably work just as well for you. On the other hand it's unlikely to convert and newcomers - but maybe that's not a problem given the box office return the first time around.There's a lot of razzle and dazzle in the film, courtesy of new director Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D, GI Joe 2), which makes perfect sense for a story about magicians who steal things during spectacular stunts.The set pieces are enjoyable enough, with some over the top card skills a particular highlight. Some vehicular action is a little dull but otherwise this is a handsome production which amps up the silliness to keep things moving at a brisk pace.Script wise it's not bad, but pretty much this is oceans eleven with added magic tricks. Whilst trying to have continuity in the form of agent Rhodes childhood and even an odd appearance by an ""Evil Twin"" Brother, this continues the story on 18 months after the events of the first film whilst adding a bit of a back story at the same time.In terms of new additions, Lizzy Caplan definitely makes an impression but her motor mouthing mostly annoyed me. She like a yapping puppy who doesn't know when to stop, seeking all the attention even though she doesn't really add that much besides some diversity to the group. Then there's Daniel Radcliffe who is mostly entertaining as villain but looks oddly ill throughout the film.Jesse Eisenberg , Mark Ruffalo , Woody Harrelson , Dave Franco , Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all return to reprise their respected roles and do a decent job of it.Of course there are various twists through out, but this time around your not really left with that sense of wonder of how did they pull it all off. Saying that this is still a fun film that continues the tale of the modern day robin hoods as they become part of the fabled ""eye"".The action takes place mainly away from the sates where the horsemen are all wanted by the FBI, as we visit the far east and the landmarks of London. The sets are over-elaborate and well polished as well they should be for this style of film, its just a shame that fight scenes fall victim the shaky cam is shaky curse making it even harder to see the tricks taking place.But overall few fun tricks, some famous faces and a fittingly over the top finale make Now You See Me 2 a very familiar two hours at the cinema. It's a little long and a bit basic but entertaining enough while it lasts So out of a possible five stars Now you see me 2 earns: ✪✪✪ It seems very realistic to What did you think of this film?

This installment has the magic team being forced to pull off their most challenging heist yet, for a greedy tech genius. Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine all reprise their roles (from the original movie); while Lizzy Caplan, Daniel Radcliffe and Sanaa Lathan join the cast (Isla Fisher is noticeably absent, due to her recent pregnancy). Jon M. Chu directed the flick (he's previously helmed films like 'G.I. JOE: RETALIATION', two Justin Bieber documentaries, and two 'STEP UP' sequels), and it was written by Ed Solomon (who also co-wrote the original movie) and Peter Chiarelli. The film is definitely a lot of fun, and consistently entertaining throughout (just like the original).The remaining three members of the famous illusionist team, known as the Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Harrelson and Franco), have been hiding out for a year. The FBI is still on their trail, and FBI mole, Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), is still protecting them. Then Rhodes helps them setup another elaborate magic show heist, that goes horribly wrong. The team wakes up in China, and finds themselves being blackmailed into another caper; by a tech genius named Walter Mabry (Radcliffe). A witty magician named Lula May (Caplan) joins the crew, on this new mission. I'd say if you're a fan of the original flick, you'll probably like this sequel just as much (or close to it). It's filled with all the same cool magic tricks, detailed (and impressively involving) heists, and witty banter. The cast is all great again (I'm a huge fan of Eisenberg's) and Caplan is an awesome addition to the cast (she's definitely an improvement over Fisher). I can't really see any major faults in it; and at over two hours, it impressively flies by!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

At one point, I was never going to watch the first movie, but that all changed when a friend of mine had recommended it to me.So one day, I actually sat down and watched Now You See Me after hearing a lot of mixed reviews about it. I had a lot of fun with the first movie, I thought it was creative, it was beautifully shot, the music was great, all the actors were charismatic, and the movie moved at a fast paced.Now You See Me 2 is just more of the same, but this movies execution is much slower. Also, the circumstances in this movie are quite unbelievable. The first movie had some ridiculous, almost ludicrous, and quite unbelievable feats involved, but the second movie takes it to a whole other level.The opening in Now You See Me 2 is a bit slow, it takes a while to get things going; However, once everybody's in place, the movie does start to pick up steam. The first job that the Horsemen execute in the movie is entertaining and fun, but then after that, the movie slows down again, and by the mid point I fell asleep. I woke up after the Horsemen had executed their second job, so I missed it, but the story wasn't hard to follow. I did fall asleep during quite a few sequences because the movie was so boring, slow, and predictable, however, even though I missed some things, I was never lost or confused when I woke up.The fight sequences in this movie are bad, they're poorly shot, and I could barely tell what was happening. The establishing shots were good, the music also added some form of excitement to them.The actors were still pretty likable, even Daniel Radcliffe was good, but I thought he was completely underutilized, and he barely did anything.The ""magic tricks"" in this movie are completely illogical, the first movie had this problem as well, but the sequel turns every magician into a superhero, it tries to make logical sense, but I feel that the screenwriters just wanted to show the audience something cool, and so they just said, ""To hell with logic!""Overall, Now You See Me 2 is not as fun as the first movie in my opinion. This movie has one or two fun moments, but as a whole it's a complete snooze fest. This movie is 100% predictable (even if you fall asleep), it's boring, it's slow, and it's just a lazy cash grab. I dare say that I love the first movie, but the sequel sucks.Final Grade: F","34 out of 67 found this helpful.

While they are explaining what is happening the tables are turned and all of the secrets the Horseman have been trying to hide are exposed and a trick is played on them. Now, they are at the will of a man they thought dead with two options. Steal an impossible item or be killed. I have to admit that I loved the first movie and was really looking forward to watching this one. They both have the slick Ocean's Eleven type feel and constantly stays one step ahead of you. Just when I thought I could predict what was going to happen it threw a loop and I was wrong. I really enjoy when that happens since most movies are so predictable. The style and the pacing are just perfect and while this is not as good as the first one it is still very good and very much worth seeing. I was entertained the entire time. Overall, while not as good as the 1st one it was not a huge drop off like many sequels are and is a great addition to the franchise. I highly recommend this movie as well. I give this an A-.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

This of course is 2013's Now You See Me. This concept was used to all it could be in the first film, and what has now followed is just sequelism.Now You See Me 2 is the sequel to a Now You See Me following the acts of the Four Horsemen; a group of magicians following a secret order to bring justice to society and take down corrupt figures. This time the Horsemen are challenged by opposing forces and enemies attempting to destroy them.With only two actors missing from the first film, all major characters return to do almost the exact same thing as they did last time. Along with two new main characters: Lizzy Caplan, and Daniel Radcliffe (who actually are quite good characters) Now You See Me 2 launches this franchise to a new expanded universe full of much more nonsense and more very unbelievable magic tricks than in the first film.So the definition of 'enjoyable rubbish' means a fun time at the cinema but the film is not necessarily good, but you can still just enjoy what it is, even if it is absolutely rubbish.I personally really enjoy the first film, as its really fun and not annoying. However the film does try to act like a clever film but it isn't, as like in the first film, it tries to justify its wit and cleverness with berserk twists and turns which try to be sophisticated but just aren't.I will also say that the film is very close to being defined as a science fiction film, as there are so many unbelievable tricks, sequences, and extremely advanced technology you have to call it fantasy.However, the film does have its pros. One key thing is character development which is excelled much more in this film with more depth and darkness. Not all characters are developed very well, but still reveals more about these Horsemen. Like the first one it is visually entertaining to watch, along with some pretty cool (very unbelievable) sequences.Overall the film is enjoyable but just tries to act clever but isn't, is quite complicated for the film that it is, very crowded in narrative, and just pure nonsense. I've heard there are plans for a third which is very unwise, but not an upcoming apocalypse (I hope). But just enjoyable rubbish/. 6.5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Radcliffe is Harry Potter and shouldn't be let close to anything that relates to magic, you just spend the whole film thinking ""OMG Harry has turned pretty nasty, hmm he does look better with contact lenses though, I wonder when is he going to pull his wand out and cast a pointless spell?""","26 out of 50 found this helpful.

Once again, Morgan Freeman is a magic debunker, hypnosis can make anyone do anything, and a mysterious organization has seemingly unlimited resources with no explanation.But everything that was fun about the first movie is back as well. There are a bunch of magic tricks, which might or might not be possible in real life, Woody Harrelson is quite entertaining in two different roles, and there are some beautiful set pieces, like a brilliant though overlong scene involving a computer chip attached to a playing card. Sadly, Isla Fischer is not in this one. The story is she was pregnant, although I'm always suspicious when the pretty girl is swapped out, since Hollywood tends to see pretty girls as replaceable. She is replaced by the always entertaining Lizzy Caplan. Harry Potter also shows up (well, Daniel Radcliffe, anyway). The movie feels slightly more unfocused than the first one, which itself was all over the map, and way to much of the end is given over to exposition, but as with the original, I had fun in spite of all its flaws.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But, having watched the first film, you already know the formula and they stick to it quite well: things start of bad, get worse, brief rally, go badly again, but ultimately the good guys succeed. Yet, compared to the first film, the characters chemistry doesn't seem to flow as well - Lizzy Caplan seems like a teenager compared to Isla Fisher, and two Woody Harrelsons are not as good as one - resulted in my not caring so much about them working as a team. Part of the surprise of the first film was the twist at the end. This time, it didn't feel so surprising. The set pieces are well shot, with all the showmanship elements that the Horse Man seem to require to attract their audience. And while it seemed things were wrapped up at the end of the first film, at times it felt like they've used this sequel to flesh out the original, rather than add a new chapter to the Horse Man, with an expectation that there will be a big reveal in the third film.One annoyance, as a Londoner, is how obvious they make it that much of the action takes place in Greenwich, London, while acting like it's not. The opening scene says tunnel to Manhatten, but it's really a tunnel under the Thames, fine. I get all films use locations and make them up how they wish, but if you're going to use obvious landmarks - like the Cutty Sark or Greenwich Market (as opposed to the aerial shots of Covent Garden they use) - having a character ask ""where's your entry? South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich..."", while they're obviously stood in the world famous Greenwich University, seems like a redundant line to me. Likewise the bad guys using a map on the other side of the river? Given what their main target is, this just seems sloppy.If you liked the first film, then you'll see this one to progress the story line. But like any magician, they need to do bigger and better on their next trick, and this doesn't feel like they did.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie has some good action scenes to keep your interest alive, some puzzling and unconvincing magic tricks, some car chases and chatterbox characters with some seasoning of emotions.Acting is good to average and it seems that Jesse Eisenberg is on auto-mode of talkative canny and still in the hangover of Mark Zukerberg the character he played in 'The Social Network', Mark Ruffalo was the most impressive and effective of them all, Woody Harrelson is great in his twin character, Dave Franco looks good, Daniel Radcliffe was decent and Lizzy Caplan irritates in few of the scenes and seriously I missed Isla Fisher. Morgan Freeman never disappoints and same is in this movie. Michael Caine is again not been utilized up to his potential just like the previous movie.Screenplay of the movie is not tightly grated but is very fast paced and probably this saves the movie from sinking, the screenplay is so fast as it feels that you are doing rafting, you doesn't know in which direction the boat is going but you are visually happy. There are some unconvincing plot twists but as you are going with a flow it will hardly matters. The movie had used excessive use of CGI, there are few good in fact smart action scenes which should be appreciated. Climax of the movie is again unconvincing but might entertain few as the movie gives an happy ending.Overall this movie might not be as great as it's previous part but the fast paced and some decent action scenes will make the movie watchable.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now they decide to add one of the worst actors ever in the history of acting, Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel needs to understand he was just the right face for Harry Potter and that is it, he wasn't there for his acting abilities. In this movie and anything he's tried after Harry Potter, it proves this fact. To put him as a nerdy geek is one thing, kinda plays to his terrible acting, however to play him as a global criminal mastermind, that's just idiotic, for this I blame the writers and directors, shame on you idiots. Jesse Eisenberg acting roles has always bemused me, he wasn't the only one who destroy Superman vs Batman, there was a whole load of crap in that movie. But his one dimension ""acting"" as he believes it to be destroys the mood of any movie. I understand he writes, produces and directs, perhaps stick to that?? Lizzy Caplan's addition to the quirky loudmouth lady sidekick is just odd, can't tell if it is her acting or just terrible symmetry for the role. But no....just no. It saddens me to see Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson and Michael Caine agreeing to play in these dog gone godawful movies, I can a only assume they need a paycheck.

I don't get it. The first one was madness. This one is a bit weaker, but it is still very entertaining two hours. Furthermore, I'm not even sure if it really is inferior or it is simply because it's a sequel. The first one was something new, original and unexpected, while sequels provide extensions of the familiar stories and therefore lack the element of surprise. There are some new tricks, but it is still just a sequel and it cannot surprise and amaze you as something completely new. I was thinking, if we switch places of these two movies I would not be surprised if NYSM 2 gets better or at least the same rating than NYSM 1. Anyway, I am not disappointed at all.7,5/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And on top of that, its not knowing that one character will escape a reinforced steel safe submerged in water, but its wanting to know 'how' that keeps you so engaged in the film. Yes, the phrase 'style over substance' occasionally comes to mind, but this is an example of a film where that is not too much of a problem if you can accept it early on. You cannot waste your time running round in circles, thinking about the ins and outs of this film, as you will end up feeling redundant to the film, I just urge you to go into this film expecting nothing but fun and games - the trick here is all in your expectations.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/tKd9Ao","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The film picks up a year later, with the Four Horsemen lying low, having formally joined secret magician society The Eye under Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), an FBI mole and man behind the curtain to the events of the first movie. They're growing restless waiting for their next big assignment, while Rhodes plays dummy to distract the FBI. However, after they're joined by new horsewoman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) and given a mission to expose a tech magnate whose cell phones will phish private user info to buyers, things go awry. Soon, the Horsemen are separated from their mentor, plagued by enemies old and new around the world, and Rhodes has to team up with an old foe to sort out the mess.Although can be seen as both, though one of the biggest thing the sequel has over the first film is it tells an actual story instead of an incoherent setup to one. There's a big difference between mystery and confusion, and the first movie fell way on the confusion side, using twists to hide a muddled narrative. Here, we get to the actual concept: stage magicians using their talents to expose powerful crooks, liars, and thieves like a Vegas-bound Impossible Missions Force. Although this film may not be as suspenseful and mysterious as the original, where the final twist felt for organic and surprising, Now You See Me 2 isn't nearly as bad as some critics and reviews are claiming. There isn't much of a dropout in quality from the films.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Better than the first, this is an enjoyable film without much substance; it has a weak plot and even weaker villain, but there are some good scenes and better characters.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3503915/?ref_=tt_urv","Pjtaylor-96-138044","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2016","'Now You See Me 2 (2016)' is the sequel to a 2013 film about a group of magicians who rob banks during their live stage shows and it should definitely have been called 'Now You Don't'. I don't think the first film is all that good, but it isn't terrible either. This film is set two years after the events of the original, and this time involves the 'Horsemen' being brought out of hiding to pull off a new heist. I definitely enjoyed this movie more than its predecessor, but that by no means implies it's great. It still has its fair share of problems and is largely uninspired. However, it's still a pretty solid, if shallow, action-thriller.The plot of the film is one of its weakest aspects. It feels very long, even though each individual scene moves along at a brisk pace, and ultimately doesn't amount to much. This time, the story has been scaled down somewhat and streamlined to be more focused than its predecessor, spending a lot more time with the 'Horsemen'. An issue I have with the first is that the perspective shifts from the magicians to the FBI, making it hard to root for and fully understand the motivations of the 'Horsemen.' Thankfully, this is fixed this time by sidelining the FBI and paying more attention to the main characters; they don't spend as much time on stage and we follow them all the way through the picture. It makes their motivations and character arcs noticeable, allowing us to relate to them and their situation much easier. The flick also doesn't feel like it's trying to be too clever for its own good, like the first does. There are a few twists and turns but they are all predictable and don't feel like the crux of the narrative. They are largely uninspired, don't amount to much and probably could have been omitted, but at least the filmmakers seem to know this. It doesn't feel like they think that they've pulled one over on us, which is a vibe I get from the first film. The final reveal is also superfluous, and doesn't really make sense as it ripples across both movies and tries to retcon some motivations. It is unneeded, a twist for a twist's sake, and has no impact. The faux-intelligence isn't as apparent as in the first one though, and thus doesn't feel as pretentious.The other problem with the plot is that there really isn't all that much magic. The movie doesn't feel like one about magicians, instead making them appear like pseudo-spies, and the whole film feels more similar to a traditional heist picture. One of the best scenes is an extended sequence in which the 'Horsemen' must hide an important playing card on themselves whilst being searched; they employ all sorts of distraction, misdirection and sleight of hand. This sequence is enjoyable and well put together, with the individual character personalities feeding into the action. There is some suspense here, and the scene mixes both action and slapstick together quite well. Most of the magic in the film feels a lot more tangible than in the first, even though there are some impossible vanishes and a sequence involving Jessie Eisenberg manipulating the rain that's ludicrous. There are some sleight of hand sequences which are mostly possible, using several recognisable techniques and real misdirection tactics, but the reliance on CGI is a little much at times (including some digital card doubles). While I found the magic to be more realistic this time around, the tricks performed aren't all that spectacular and the final 'trick' is very weak, with almost no actual 'magic' on display. I found the direction to be better this time, as there isn't any nauseating camera motion and there a few longer takes. It doesn't cut nearly as much, and the edits aren't jarring. There were a few continuity errors, though, and places where characters snap to different positions between shots. There is also a fight scene that is very hard to read visually, due to the heavy amounts of shaky-cam and quick cutting. The action is confusing at times, and the fight as a whole is pretty underwhelming.The characters this time around are given more to do, and more motivation to do it. The only real arc belongs to Mark Ruffalo's character though, as he changes throughout the course of the film. He also gives the best performance and is the most interesting screen presence. Jessie Eisenberg has the beginnings of an arc, though it's all but forgotten at the mid-point, and a couple of reveals serve to give new light to some character motivations. There are two major new additions to the cast, that of Lizzy Caplan's fourth 'horseman' (as Isla Fisher was pregnant at the time of filming) and Daniel Radcliffe's villain. Caplan is given more screen-time than Fisher has in the original, and her character actually has some impact on the plot. She also has a more rounded and unique personality, though she is mainly relegated to being the comic relief, and does a good job making her character believable. I didn't find her funny, though. Instead, she comes off as awkward in a talking-too-much kind of way. Still, the character isn't necessarily annoying, despite arguably having too much dialogue at times. Radcliffe provides a very weak villain, coming across as neither threatening nor powerful. His performance is good enough, but it's the material he's given that's lacking. His character is very one dimensional, isn't given all that much screen-time and doesn't have all that much impact on the plot.Overall, this film to be more enjoyable than its predecessor. It has a weak villain, bland plot and poor magic, but is ultimately entertaining and has a couple of stand-out scenes: 6/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"4","/10","NYSM2 is a literal and fatal misdirection with little in the way of fresh excitement.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3488184/?ref_=tt_urv","LloydBayer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20871749/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2016","Anyone who has seen Christopher Nolan's cerebral masterwork in The Prestige will recall that a magic trick consists of three acts. Typically, this involves the 'setup' where the nature of the trick is explained, the 'performance' where the magician applies misdirection to fool the audience, and finally the 'effect' of the illusion on said audience. At no point will a magician reveal the secret behind the effect. So despite its critical consensus of style over substance, 2013's Now You See Me turned out to be a popular hit precisely due to the performance and misdirection applied. It was cheesy fun and at times nail bitingly good but we wanted to be fooled and we were.Picking up roughly a year after the events of the first film, Now You See me 2 seeks to bring back the pizazz of its predecessor with more twists, turns, noise and nonsense. That's not necessarily a bad thing and while it's fairly traditional to harvest the merit of an original, NYSM2 as a sequel suffers in continuity owing to a poorly conceived setup. A result of which has the returning A-list cast embroiled in a save-the-world technology heist, ala international espionage styled thriller. With the inclusion of Lizzy Caplan (replacing Isla Fisher), the Horsemen are now required to pull off a high security job reserved for the likes of Ethan Hunt. And as absurd as that sounds, the idea of a hi-tech heist using street magic is quickly overrun by expository plot points in the form of flashbacks. No surprise then that however baffling a trick might seem, Morgan Freeman's celestial voice talent is always ready to narrate the secret. It doesn't help either that most of the other actors struggle with characters that lack any semblance to the previous film; Jesse Eisenberg included. Also lacking, albeit severely, is the on-stage showmanship of the Horsemen that made them famous in the first place. Instead, new director Jon M. Chu's outlandish approach is in laying the foundation for a trilogy – much like the Oceans 11, 12, 13 franchise but with smoke, shadow, mirrors and identical twins. In part, this plays out by pitting head Horsemen Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) against Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley, a magic debunker with ulterior motives. While this incubates a backstory of tragedy and vengeance, it also detracts from the central theme of magic and those show stopping illusions that we actually came to see. To its merit, the inclusion of Daniel Radcliffe adds a whimsy twist to this sequel. Radcliffe is no stranger to magic but we get to see him play a creepy Bond-like villain in a bizarre father-son relationship with main villain Tressler (Michael Caine). Other developments include Woody Harrelson in a double role with equally bizarre if not intended comic interjections. And poof! Everything else goes out the window, rabbit and hat in tow. With legendary illusionist David Copperfield serving as production consultant, NYSM2 should have turned out better than the first film. But on its own there is little in the way of fresh excitement, let alone not more than two main illusions. And undermining the entire concept of films about magic, at no point are we fooled into believing what we see either. Ultimately it all comes down to the arduous task of direction, or in this case, a literal and fatal misdirection but without the intended effect. Fans of the first film might find themselves in a giddy bag of tricks. For the rest, it's like watching a street magician perform with Parkinson's disease.","21 out of 44 found this helpful.

I think what made the first film work so well is that they got a group of people who seem to be having fun with one another and had some really good chemistry, so the chemistry returns as it's basically the exact same chemistry with a few new addictions.One of the biggest new attractions was Daniel Radcliffe, but to be honest I did not think he was all that worth spending your money on. He really did not bring anything cool to the mix, unlike Lizzy Caplin who replaced Isla Fisher and was able to fit right into the cast while equally being it's break out star. If you like the first movie because it was about magic, Now You See Me 2 was more about magicians trying to be like superheroes, but considering much of the cast appeared in some pretty big superhero movies, it's not surprising. It's a pretty straight forward sequel that is pretty fun to watch, but will vanish from your memory as soon as it's done.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now You See Me-2 is a silly, goofy and fun sequel to a silly, goofy and fun thriller which resolves around the world of magic and illusions. It's that kind of movie where every time your mind is trying to find the secret within the quick-moving story line. The casts, director and screenwriters have tried something weird and funky. One special thing about this movie is that Woody Harrelson gets to play his original character, Merritt McKinney, who is a renowned magician and hypnotist and uses his tricks and powers to pull off some brilliant crimes. Things make sense until the halfway point of the movie before all the trilling but illogical sequence of scene starts unfolding. Anyone watching this movie without having seen the first movie of the series(Now You See Me) would probably be lost more than once. The universe created in this movie is more than comically cartoonish and surreal. Coming to the plot, the person making things difficult for the Horsemen in the movie this time is Walter Mabry(Daniel Radcliffe), a wealthy businessman who once partnered with the target of horsemen in the previous movie. Due to this, the money that horsemen stole sort of belonged to him, and now he is seeking reparations. Mabry's role is of a man with double, triple... dose of devilish ego. Also, one amongst the new cast who are a part of this movie is Lizzy Caplan, who replaces original star Isla Fisher. If you do have have a good memory, then anything which you might remember from the movie after some weeks of watching it is it's benchmark-Gimmick, a cleverly staged ""sleight of hand"" trick that involves stealing a microchip hidden in a playing card. But still, this movie offers as much entertainment as it is expected to.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But with the silliness in tone and in the added suspension of disbelief, the sequel is about as frustratingly stupid as it is visually impressive.It's hard to deny the acting talent that is aboard this franchise. There are 17 Academy Award nominations between this cast, but for the most part, the Now You See Me films seem to be paycheck films for those respected actors. That's not to say they don't have tons of fun, Woody Harrelson is easily the best thing in the film (although they try to do way too much with his 'twin'). But even if I'm being honest, I don't go see these movies for the incredible acting, I go to see some awesome magic.Unsurprisingly, the film decides to jump ship on any logic at all when it comes to the magic from The Four Horseman. Along with Harrelson is returning cast members Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, and Dave Franco; with newest horseman being Lizzy Caplan. Remember in the first film when all of these guys did magic tricks that you somewhat believed could be true if you really tried? Yeah, that's all thrown out the window. Granted there are attempts to explain the outrageous supernatural-level acts, but even the explanations don't add up.Sure, this film does have its impressive moments, however. Any easily pleased action fan will have a good time watching the various ridiculous acts of the horseman. Even I really enjoyed one particular card-trick scene between the 4 main horseman. But I think I would have liked a bigger effort being put to a Prestige type story and not a mindless action film with more twists than it can handle. Or perhaps the series should just take the Fast & Furious route and stay ridiculous. If the third one does go the route of the ladder, I would hope it doesn't try to outsmart itself, because this film sure does.+Card trick scene+Visuals and Horseman acts can be fun-Throws out all logic-More twists and turns than it can handle5.2/10","17 out of 35 found this helpful.

Most of the magic was explained, leaving just enough *not* to please the viewer and enhance the sense of mystery and wonder that all fans of stage magic and street magic will appreciate. This film is a typical sequel that tried to best the previous film and failed dismally.I will not give anything away if you want to see many of the characters again. However, if you are expecting a fascinating plot that makes any sense when you review it later, you will be disappointed. The beloved characters from the first film are sorely abused in this trite follow-up. Instead of following along and learning more as you go, with surprises along the way, this plot is so contrived as to defy belief in a great many places. The reveals are often trifling and superficial, the connections are implausible at best, and the motives and personal growth from the first film are abandoned completely in favor of ""shock"" and ""wow"" visuals, which still fail to impress. A few humorous moments in the film are drowned by the meandering story line, and I was left feeling both annoyed and betrayed in the end. I am always surprised when sequels turn out well, as some do, but this was a waste of film, and I urge you to skip it if you are reading this review beforehand. Enjoy the first and let your imagination run wild, instead.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Not As Enjoyable Or Magical As The Original...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5114696/?ref_=tt_urv","P3n-E-W1s3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68532916/?ref_=tt_urv","11 September 2019","What made the first film so good hinders this sequel. Trying to rival the original story's complexity, ingenuity, and content the writers, Ed Solomon and Peter Chiarelli, decided to go down the ancient secret organisation route. This makes it similar to John Wick's universe, though it's not handled so well. Whereas it's assassins in Wick, it's magicians and tricksters who are the secret hero watchmen.You can just about believe a group of five people trying to make the world a better place. But make this into a shadow agency... of magicians and you're asking a lot of your audience. Also making it a continuation of the original instead of a new stand-alone story wasn't the best of ideas. Especially when you start to change the morality of the characters.The director, Jon M Chu, does a fantastic job with the mess the writers gave him. In particular the electronic skeleton key theft. On paper, and in your mind, this entire routine is ridiculous in its absurdity. However, in Chu's hands, it comes off respectfully and almost believable. In truth, it's Chu who is the glue to this film. Without his, or similar directors, deft touch this movie would have been dire indeed.The acting is passable, though only Eisenberg and Harrelson go the extra distance. Eisenberg is spot-on as the assertive, confident, and powerful showman. Harrelson adds an extra dimension by also playing Merritt's twin brother and ex-partner Chase. He pulls the two personalities perfectly. The way they play off each other is great. It's Freeman, Caine, and Radcliffe that are the weaker actors. This could be down to the writing of the characters or how the director saw them. Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley isn't as well constructed in the sequel. I think this is down to the fact that he's now a minor background character. Caine does his Caine thing, though it would have been nice to see a softer side when he's with his son. Radcliffe doesn't do bad guy. In fact, with the beard he sports, I'm amazed the horsemen weren't rolling on the floor with laughter. If you have that amount of money wouldn't you have a well-styled and trimmed set of whiskers?I would only recommend that you watch this film if you've watched and enjoyed the original. If you haven't seen the first yet, get it watched - it's a good movie - then, only if you're at a loose end with nothing to watch, you can give this a try. It's not as good, though on a cold wet afternoon it isn't a bad alternative to a soaking bicycle ride.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Magicians get bedazzled and conned by the magic.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3508342/?ref_=tt_urv","guchrisc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39929622/?ref_=tt_urv","20 July 2016","In 2013 a film came out called 'Now You See Me'. this was an exciting and funny film about magic. Four street magicians came together as 'The Four Horsemen' and used their magic to rob a bank. Mark Ruffalo played the role of an FBI Agent hunting them down. Michael Caine played a wealthy man robbed by the magicians, and Morgan Freeman, played a magic-debunker, blamed for the death of a magician, who ended up framed and imprisoned by the magicians. A final reveal showed that the FBI Agent was also really a magician, and the final scene was a sweetly romantic one set on a Paris bridge.As this reviewer has only recently returned from Paris, after walking across the said bridge several times, the arrival of the sequel to this magic film was highly anticipated. Sadly, it must be reported that this sequel makes the romantic scene now totally redundant. We cling to the romantic hope that there was at least a brief encounter, but sadly, in this film there is not even that.Jesse Eisenberg must have really enjoyed acting in the original fun film because he went on to star with Kristen Stewart in 'American Ultra' (2015), a silly Bourne-like spy-spoof comedy. Jesse Eisenberg as a magician, is joined once again by fellow magicians Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson.This film is set a year after the events of the first film. The Four Horsemen are in hiding, and Mark Ruffalo is still in the FBI pretending to track them down. In reality they are preparing for their next coup. There are some nice early scenes that introduce Lizzy Caplan to the story, as well as a flashback scene of the magician Lionel Shrike dying in front of his son. Richard Laing and William Henderson played their small parts well. It should be said that although the UK rating of the film is 12A, the subject of this film is magic in all of it's forms, thus bloody illusions are performed, and death is always a possibility.Some of the early scenes are frankly boring, and there is little tension as the coup unfolds. The original movie was cleverly filmed so that action scenes were clearly seen, and were also funny and exciting at the same time. There was not a need for too much of a suspension of belief. Sadly, the sequel, directed this time by Jon M. Chu, lacks that same fine touch most of the time. The action takes are so fast that we cannot see what is happening, and they are neither exciting or funny either. Of course, what this film is about, is a major twist, in which the magicians are undone in their coup, and are themselves played by a Mr Big. Director Chu does however reveal the Mr Big in a very impressive scene with an accompanying classic rock track.There is some impressive acting, especially by Woody Harrelson. Mark Ruffalo once again shows a fine touch, fans should check out the 2013 musical drama 'Begin Again'. In a smaller role, Sanaa Lathan makes a very convincing FBI Agent, and Jay Chou and Tsai Chin entertain us in their small roles too.The film opens with our magicians about to perform their coup, but as Mr Big ensnares them, it looks like they will need some magic of their own to escape his clutches.The Prestige, (there is a 2006 film of that name starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman), is the final reveal, where the magic trick is revealed in all of it's glory. Those who enjoyed 'Now You See Me' (2013), will enjoy this sequel, which, whilst it certainly does not surpass the original, does contain it's own magical flourishes as rabbits are pulled out of the hat. 8/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The sequel didn't have the same clever elements of the first, and there was a subplot about a twin of one of the characters that added nothing to the film - if they had left that out in favor of a different conflict they might have had room for something else - perhaps an ending more like the first, with a lot more flash and spectacle. Oh, and Woody Harrelson in a wig, playing a fey version of himself - not a good idea.

The star of the film was still Jesse Eisenberg (who was still brilliant as Atlas) but we got to see more of the other two Horsemen (both Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson were great to watch). The new girl Horseman, Lula, was good. Sometimes she was on the verge of being annoying, but on the whole, she was likable and definitely had a solid character whereas Henley (Isla Fisher from the first film) didn't leave much of an impression on me. Even so, I don't think the Horsemen had the same kind of camaraderie as in the first film. Daniel Radcliffe was interesting to watch. His scenes were always fun, he has a particular knack for doing the simplest things and making them funny. Sometimes though, I got the feeling he wasn't even acting, that he had wandered onto the set and was just being himself. The film seemed to have a fairly simple plot but it tended to wander off. It was definitely sometimes tricky to understand what exactly was happening. I think there's two things that contributed to that - 1) the pace; sometimes several things were revealed to the audience too quickly for them to process fully, and 2) the dialogue. Again, this had to do with the pace, it was just too quick sometimes. My last point, the magic. It was great. It was so exciting and exhilarating to watch them do impossible things (even if they're not real). Not all of their tricks are explained in the film but I think I prefer it that way.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The development of Mark Ruffalo's character is good but makes little sense that it is only now being introduced rather than already being established earlier. In general it seems to be a kind of duplicate to the first but very slightly worse.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even the cast is livelier and more fun. The plot absolutely blew me away and my enthusiasm for this film knew no bounds. Congratulations to the screenwriters Ed Solomon, who did a brilliant job. The twists and turns that finally led to the dramatic finale was absolutely dazzling and unexpected. I think that it's astounding the director's ability to trick us and misdirect us, so you're never entirely sure what has happened until everything is explained. The special effects were absolutely stunning and the use of real life magic sequences fit perfectly. The use of contemporary music mix with popular songs on the film's soundtrack was also well thought out and it took the film to the next level. No wonder the crew received a standing ovation from the audience at the end of the film, even though we were at the cinema.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sequels almost never as good as the original and this is the case with this movie. Oddly enough the problem here is that the script tries too hard to outdo the original, especially in its forced dialogue of being cute and the special effects being too obvious this time. Whether the climax helped to redeem a lot of the weaknesses of the sequel is up to the viewer. The plot and twists were perhaps too unnecessarily convoluted. Lizzy Caplan's character was so much over the top, a risky move by the screenwriters. The tone of the movie becomes a little off-balanced, dramatically dark in a few places. Overall, the movie has mostly good moments and entertaining. But it can't outdo the original.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

She is no longer this cool, outspoken and loud character I wanted to be like - she is just loud now. And for all the future script writers, one way too make a female characters be ""like all the other girls"" is to make her state that she is not, in fact, ""like all the other girls"".

I remember thinking it was ""too much"" but still, I managed to find some things to appreciate. So after hesitating a little, I decided to try this one, because I wanted to watch the kind of movie where you can disconnect your brain and enjoy. Even though my expectations were very low.. it was awful.I watched the movie with a friend... we laughed a lot. But only once or twice because of the dialogues and numerous jokes... the rest was us mocking... well everything. The plot, the ""twists"", the ""jokes""... Mainly, the problem is the scenario... nothing is coherent, and the worse is that the film wants to give the impression that it's really smart. Directing is chaotic and messy in order to make you feel lost and to make you think it's so intelligent that you can't follow everything. But the truth is everything is stupid and lacks credibility. Some movies are doing too much on purpose and it's okay as long as they are not taking themselves too seriously. But here it's the opposite, and I feel like the director is insulting my intelligence.I could also comment one some scenes but I don't want to ""spoil"", especially one that last 10 minutes and brings nothing. It just highlights how stupid is the script. The scene is supposed to be impressive with special effects but makes no sense. It's just an excuse to put as much special effects and ""magic"" as possible.I'm stopping now because criticizing this movie can take hours. The three stars left? I think it's for Morgan Freeman (you have to love him even in dumb movies), the musics and the laugh I had mocking it.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

Good magic tricks, good dialogues and we were kept in the dark for most of the time not knowing who was behind everything. This was disappointing and tedious, as we knew who was doing what to whom, too much talking and many of the dialogues lasted too long, not enough magic and nothing was funny. The fighting/stunt scenes could have (should have) used the Jackie Chan choreographers as the fights/stunts were a blur.Were there too many players in here? When you have a gaggle of actors all vying for screen time much is lost on the audience to a point we don't care about any of them. Hence we didn't care. The scenes seemed rushed as were the dialogues. They were trying to fit a round peg into a square hole and we all know that only works in dreams. We all know Morgan Freeman is a great actor, but he needs to cut down on his commercials because there were times in here I expected him to sell us something. Having Woody Harrelson also play the role of his twin was okay, but it did prevent another actor from getting a job. What was the point? Huh? The FBI was also after the Four Horsemen for robbing a bank in another country from the last movie. They were a a non-factor and why they were even in here was a mystery onto itself. These scenes just helped drag the movie longer. To be fair the movie did better at the 3/4 mark when the Four Horsemen went to London and were thrown out of a plane. (Whaaaat?) Still after that there were too many explanations that we could barely hear and understand and again, we just did not care. Let's hope there will be no Now You See Me 3. (3/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One S-word was heard near the end.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

But I never thought I'd refer to it as ""the first movie"". For me, that movie was it. It was a pretty decent movie and I really enjoyed it. I even re-watched it before watching this one. And that only made me realize how this ""sequel"" was REALLY UNNECESSARY!No, this movie is NOT bad.But it's pointless! We didn't need a sequel. I really hate that people these days are not just milking the franchises anymore; they are making up franchises out of gosh-darn thin air.The material for the first one didn't require a sequel. It was supposed to be a stand-alone movie. A one-time two hour entertainment, unless you count the re-watches.But no, since the director or the producer or the whoever wants more money, they go ahead and make ""more of the same"".I mean for whatever reason, Isla Fisher was not in this movie. The initial ""Horsemen"" rejected doing this movie, or weren't cast by the producers out of their own will. Still, they went ahead and made this movie with Lizzy Caplan instead. Now, don't get me wrong, I really liked Lizzy. I think she was even better than Isla in some ways. But if you don't even have the initial cast for your ""sequel"", you probably should get a clue and NOT GO AHEAD WITH IT. Or at least hold off till you can assemble the initial cast.Nevertheless, the movie is a fair watch. As far as ""sequels"" go, it's not ALL bad, but it's not a good ""definitely a worth watch"" movie either, unlike it's predecessor.6/10Watch it to see a few funny scenes here and there, and a few decent magic tricks (less decent than the ones in the previous one, or some re-hashed ones).

The actors and actresses involved work really well together to create charming chemistry and characters. Unfortunately, there are so many actors involved that some are ultimately wasted/short changed. Michael Caine and Jay Chou are among the first few billed for the film, yet they have little development and do not add much to the story.One aspect of the film I cannot criticize is the action. It is well paced and choreographed, boding together ""magic"" and realistic brawls. Furthermore, the magic/stunts in the film are exceptional and entertaining to watch, despite how ridiculous they really are.The main problem with the film is the actual story and how everything comes together. The story darts around from arc to arc whilst clumsily trying to continue the events of the first film and carry a new story all-together. This results in a disappointing third act as well as out-of-place scenes peppered throughout the movie. Now You See Me 2 is missing the magic of the first film to make it a really good film, however utilizes the majority of the cast and set pieces well to aid a struggling story.6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first film was fun and entertaining, but you can't say the same for this sequel.To start on a positive note, this isn't a bad movie as some reviews have made it out to be. It is quite decent and it's somewhat entertaining. I felt there were several scenes in this movie that was very fun to watch, and at the same time, captivating. The new Horsemen is a great character, and I really liked this person! The acting was good, as expected from the cast just like the first movie.My main issue with Now You See Me 2 was that it contained extra ""fluff"" that wasn't needed. There is a certain character they introduced in this film that did nothing for the movie. If you were to completely remove this person, the movie wouldn't even change. Additionally, this character was just plain annoying and his role took up time and space in this film. Several times in the film they would explain or show you how the tricks were made, and often times, you do not need to hear or see it to know how they did it. Aside from SOME great tricks and illusions, the majority of the magic show this movie presented were insignificant and easily forgotten.Overall, okay movie - great cast, except for the one unnecessary character. The movie is decent to watch and had scenes and moments where it shined, but there were far more things that could have been removed, and in place, they could have added better and more entertaining tricks and illusions as the first movie did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For instance, there's (the actor of) Harry Potter that doesn't believe in magic and believes in science instead.The issue is though that in my opinion, FIRSTLY it should've tried even harder to make things go overboard, with all the effects and stuff. I mean the CGI is exactly the point to the parody -- but people also mistook it for a serious film because the film doesn't go crazy enough with it. SECONDLY, it's should've parodied all the characters heavier. The characters clearly are meant for parody as well but they don't strike you like that hard enough leaving the experience a little blunt.Don't skip the film just because unintelligent kids here couldn't figure out it's a parody.Overall, it's decent entertainment if you understand you are watching a comedy (parody), not a serious mystery film which it clearly doesn't claim to be.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They wrap up all these factors together into an irresistible pot.Now You see Me 2 doesn't disappoint, certainly not on a cursory viewing. But if, alas, like me, you like to try to work out how the tricks are done, and how the cons are set up and played, you may still have a few questions at the end which don't seem to be fully resolved. Of course, I may have blinked but surely 95% of your attention over a two-hour period ought to be enough to keep up with the plot.There's always the worry that a sequel will not be as good as the first. The problem with 2 is that it tries to be too tricksy. The cons and switches are multifarious and for the viewer trying to pull everything together into a coherent whole, it's not easy, at least not on a first viewing. I tend to think the writers are trying just a bit too hard.Having said that, the movie is a switchback ride with excellent performances and superb direction from John M Chu. Some of the set pieces are just a touch laboured but nonetheless fun and inventive for that.Several reviews mark it down but, reading between the lines, its seems that this is simply not their type of movie. Fair enough and no objection there. But if you like cons and capers, it's difficult to think you won't love this.The switches and twists will keep you guessing. If you saw the first, this is a must-see, too. And if you didn't see the first - go watch it and then see this.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Chu takes the helm from Louis Leterrier (Transporter 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk) and actually does a fine job of keeping the same style and magic of the first, better known for dance movies and music films like Step Up 2, LXD and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. There's a sleight change of casting but the core is still very much there with the addition of Lizzy Caplan as cheeky, confident and a little crazy Lula, which is a good one with a very quick brush off for Isla Fisher and absolute no mention of Mélanie Laurent this time round. She was my favourite character from the first Cloverfield, so I'm glad to see her again. Jesse Eisenberg and Dave Franco slip straight into their routine but we get a double helping of Woody Harrelson who pretty much, ridicules himself throughout the movie. Harry Potter goes rogue and does some bad wizardry proving Daniel Radcliffe actually makes a decent bad guy. It's Michael Caine who seems to be the weak link for this film, I wasn't sure if he wanted to be there. Freeman, like Ruffalo is here, there and everywhere. They all shuffle well together with the same funny, clever banter but some parts of the story and script are flawed. Brian Tyler reprises his score which was so suiting for both films, being the type of music you would hear at a magic show. It's recognisable, majestic and illuminating. Nothing really is what it seems, and you might spend most of the film guessing what's going to happen next. Everything all becomes very elaborate, so much so you actually forget what the whole point of the film is, who's who and where's it going and though mostly unpredictable and entertainingly so, the end might be anticlimactic for some. There's a lot of needless dramatic action, and yes, it's all about the showmanship but it needs to be good showmanship at that and some of the action feels cheap and maybe too much, even for the horsemen. It's slick in places and nicely put together but it then starts to lose the magic and mystery towards the end even with some clever, massive reveals it just doesn't hit home. Reminded me of Sneakers at one stage. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it like the first one, so fans should like it but I can see some people picking it to pieces. Now I've Seen It 2. Tada.

Director Jon M. Chu has successfully retained the magic of the original movie. The magic tricks performed in this film, are mind-bending & look fantastic. They surpass the illusions in the first movie. There are quite a few twists & turns in the film, to keep you guessing as to what is going to happen next. This is in keeping with the suspense element of the first film. The action element, is a welcome addition to the sequel. The magic trick involving the stick, is the highlight of the movie. Jesse Eisenberg is great as J. Daniel Atlas. Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as Dylan Rhodes. Woody Harrelson is awesome as Merritt McKinney. Dave Franco is impressive as Jack Wilder. Daniel Radcliffe is amazing as Walter Mabry. Lizzy Caplan is hilarious as Lula. Jay Chou is good as Li. Michael Caine is fantastic as Arthur Tressler. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Thaddeus Bradley.

Now it seems this will going to be an unstoppable franchise, we could expect more, the next one was official, especially after considering how this film fared at the box office. All the main cast returned with the new ones. I think Daniel Radcliffe was good, first time I had impression like that on him after Harry Potter series. So good to see the two legends, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The rest of the cast was good, but nothing to praise like they have pulled off the impossible. Overall, this is a good follow-up, but not best I was looking for. Though, the writing and direction were decent with some nice Chinese locations.The story follows after some time where the first one ended. After the biggest heist, now they are back with the new public shows. A new member was included, a female to balance with the existing ones. While performing a show, they had to abort it in the middle when the cops raid them. This time they are tricked by some unknown people and land in a foreign territory. In order to escape from there, they had to play what was instructed to them and so they comply with it. When their boss comes to their rescue, the things around them begin to change. So how it all ends was another twist.The film was two hours long, but not bad to hook for that long when pace and the story looked better. I'm not fully satisfied, particularly about the China. I know Hollywood found its second home, but that does not mean they have to add China flavour all the time to just make money in China. They might succeed from it, particularly from earning Yuan, but I'm the not happy, the world is not happy about that. You can make full length China subject film, but this kind of altering script is becoming sick. Because all the major films trying to do the same thing. I disliked this from that perspective. So sorry Hollywood, better luck next time.5.5/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

By definition, it is however nothing new. It uses the same formula for success as its predecessor, of an all-star cast, twist heavy plot, and (CGI-assisted) breathtaking magic stunts.All of these things are well developed, just as in the original. The characters especially are given much more intentional treatment, and their development is much more effectively intertwined into the story. One bad thing about this film, (Its reason for my giving it an 8, and not a perfect 10) is that it suffers from what is popularly known as ""sequel-itis"". It capitalizes upon what made the first film great, but unfortunately gets a bit caught up in the spectacle of showing people something they have never seen before.In the end though, what determines the merit of a movie, is the level of enjoyment it offers. Now You See Me Two, offers plenty of enjoyment, not to mention great action, organic humor, and thoughtful plot twists; all of which make for an all around thrilling movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is not a movie for oscar nominations nor will it be memorable but is entertaining all the same, a typical 'pop corn movie'. Nothing bad about it.
Some of the plot could have been simplified a bit, it looks like the writer needed to add some spice but it got a bit overdone.

This sequel jumped way too off base from its foundation for a franchise that hasn't gained that kind of leeway yet. Also, Lizzy Caplan is awful. I understand the new thing is to have ugly girls hook up with handsome men as this is Hollywood's low-IQ attempt to get back at all the movies before where ugly men always hooked up with beautiful women. However, at least in those old movies the ugly guy had a redeeming quality that made him appealing. Lizzy Caplan is boring, ugly, forced and useless. Her character does not matter to the story which means she is supposed to be a comic relief but she is more like a foot. Her and that shoe lady from Sex and The City could be twins. They both look like feet. James Franco's brother obviously just read the scene right before he shot it, as he sounds like he is reading from a teleprompter. Jesse Eisenberg is still wondering if he's cool. Woody Harrellson doesn't know where he is. Daniel Radcliffe looks coked out but mad about it and makes a joke that he dabbled with magic in school...cause the filmmakers want to remind you he was Harry Potter as you definitely forgot. Michael Caine is snobby and British, just in case you forgot that this is the only character he plays. Mark Ruffalo is confused. They should make a movie with Ruffalo and Mark Wahlberg and call it The Marks. In the movie they will both just say ""huh?"" and look confused. They shall win golden bodies.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

This film however was not as enjoyable. What made Now You See Me so enjoyable was the allure of mystery. Like magic we did not know how everything was done and the truth was revealed only after everybody was fooled. In NYSM 2 each tricks are revealed so fast that it doesn't feel like magic. It's like a magician telling you the secret as he is performing it. That's not fun at all. The first film also had the two side that the audience followed, the cops and the magicians. With that the audience could essentially choose a protagonist and follow their mystery, but in this movie everything has been laid out for you and the mystery that was in the first film disappears in the second one.What took me out of the film the most were the small details. For example one character (Jack) teaches the new girl (Lula) a back palm. As a magician myself this is frustrating to see as Lula is shown doing multiple amazing and imaginative magic throughout the movie and yet does not know how to do one of the most fundamental sleights in magic. There are other minute details that makes this movie feel so much like a movie than a real life. Everybody except the cops and the antagonists love the horsemen. There is a really sappy scene in the end where everybody is gathered and they are saying very clichéd dialogues. As well the characters felt bland.Speaking of characters, most of them were very one dimensional. All of the conflicts and the character relationships felt like it could have been developed more and since they were not fully developed I did not care as much. There were some enjoyable moments in the movie, and some tricks were fun to watch. The first magic and the card heist being my favourite but even with that it felt very empty when I left the theatre.","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

I believe that is the most important question before watching these kind of movies. It obviously will not take you and challenge your brain to understand what is happening. The plot is much simpler in a comparison with the prequel. When the plot is much simpler, that also means this movie will not appeal to the group of people it supposed to appeal. You know what that means? Drumroll please... It means you will lose $30.000.000. I mean, what were they trying to do? Were they trying to make people laugh? If that was it, why did not they just put Jesses Eisenberg in a room with that poor interviewer girl again. That way, they would not spend $90.000.000 for a dead project. Come on people. Hollywood may have done this just to keep the tradition of butchering decent movies by making terrible sequels. That would explain it.

Trying hard to figure out practical explanations for his crew of illusionists' CGI tricks, panting writer Ed Solomon tinkers with various form of comedy, from a Rube Goldberg self- decapitation to slapstick to witty banter, the rest of the writing team being in charge of ""character development"", or rather the illusion thereof.Back are our Five Horsemen, even though the only female character has changed. Details. Please have a round of applause for Mr Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo, playing Mark Ruffalo), Mr Wilder (James Franco, very good at smiling charmingly), Mr McKinney (Woody ""Ham"" Harrelson), Miss Lula, who doesn't have a name since she's a woman (Lizzy Caplan, as perky and quirky as Isla Fisher was, well, neither the one nor the other), and Mr Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg, easily the best of the lot as he manages to infuse some measure of vicious cipher into his performance). And of course our super duper magical team of sociopaths would not come back without their pet peeves: Mr Bradley (Morgan Freeman, in charge of the 'An eye for an eye"" voice-over because he has a soothing voice), Mr Tressler (Sir Michael Caine, cashing his check), and some new flesh: Mr Li, who doesn't have a first name since he's Chinese (Jay Chou, who might have the best line of dialogue translating what grandmother said in Cantonese), and Mr Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe, good at cult lines like ""Tadam!"" or ""Splash!"").What does it say about a movie when the name of nine actors are above the title, among them two Oscar winners and three nominees? One thing: cash machine. In the first movie, the Four Horsemen, under the shady guidance of the fifth, were actually performing some grand illusions which Mr Bradley debunked, in order to rob heartless insurance magnate Mr. Tressler. In this one, they debunk their own tricks in order to perform a heist. If you have kept your childhood fascination for prestidigitation, disappearing bunnies and appearing doves, avoid this film at all cost: it must be the most depressing backstage visit you will ever have.So, what happens this time, are you asking? Mr Mabry has invented the movie's McGuffin, a program which is alluded to sometimes as a chip, sometimes as a card and as a stick the rest of the time. He proudly shows a PowerPoint presentation about it in Macau, where the Horsemen are teleported by way of a swirling pizza box and a debris chute. You don't wanna know. He's a genius, see, and therefore is insufferable and childish, the only way Hollywood knows to write geniuses to pander to the short attention span of its audience. Also, he looks and sounds high.Said stick is the reason why an endlessly protracted scene involving an ace of spades will test your patience, not to mention the disbelief you had to check at the door. It is also responsible for Mr McKinney to have a twin brother, resulting in Woody Harrelson trying to out-ham himself. Those scenes are a pain to watch. It also brings together father and son Mr. Tessler and Mr Mabry and frankly, the very concept of Sir Michael Caine fathering Daniel Radcliffe is terrifying, if a good example of poetic justice. Damn stick.Unable to give any character any motivation that is not rooted in family bonds, unable to stage any violence out of the proverbial ""nobody gets hurts"" box, unable not to picture Asians full of wisdom and – AWESOME! – able to speak English, unable to even film Macau or London, you can't expect NYSM2 to know anything about pattern recognition or magic, even though it tries to bullshit you it does. If by the first hour you have not guessed who will be revealed as head of The Eye in the next movie, you deserve to see it next year. If you do, one guesses you will muse which one is best, pulling a head out of an eye or a hat out of a rabbit.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Also, it's a rather poor effort. I get that the director really wanted to focus on action scenes that feature slight of hand. Fine. But you can string these scenes together with something, surely. The motivations for all of the action is pretty weak.

I liked seeing more of the characters and some depth develop to them, and unlikely as it might be, I'd certainly be up for watching a third outing. I say this as someone who doesn't necessarily enjoy magic on TV, and the difference here was probably the engaging cast. Dave Franco was a very pleasant surprise - endearing but not too cocky - and Mark Ruffalo manages to take centre stage and be self-effacing all at the same time.

Therefore, I think if you did not enjoy the first now you see me, you shouldn't even bother watching this as it'll be a waste of your time.

After their comeback show is sabotaged the Horsemen are hired against their will to perform their most daring heist for a tech genius. Released in 2016 Now You See Me 2 was directed by Jon M. Chu and starred Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Radcliffe. With a change in directors and the loss of Isla Fisher how well does Now You See Me 2 stack up as a sequel?Well, after not being the biggest fan of the first film, Now You See Me 2 found a way to let me down even more than the first. Much of that is due to the story, which is much goofier this time around as it takes our characters halfway across the world for a majority of the runtime as they get wrapped in a plot that I really had no interest in. Despite the silliness of the main plot I enjoyed the film spending more time with the Horsemen themselves (even if the characters aren't all that interesting), as I found in the first, not enough time was spent on the group and would have liked to see have seen more of the characters preparing for their shows and their thoughts on the ongoing F. B. I. Investigation. I also appreciated the film exploring more of Ruffalo's character as it did answer some questions I had in the first, and although his motivations are still flimsy at least there is one and it is shown. For the most part, there isn't a ton of magic being done in the film, it is very heavy on dialogue and action, and although the magic in the first film was very flashy and had moments that didn't feel realistic, here it was cranked to the max with magic that just doesn't feel based in the reality. The grand finale to the film was something that (similar to the first) left me with more questions than answers as to how that was classified as a trick and why the general public would be so interested in it. I did appreciate this film continuing the story and not being a retread from the last, and I did like how the concept was used, as it was initially what I thought of when thinking about magicians involved in a heist. However, I would be remised not to mention that I did sort of miss the scenes where the magicians put on a live show, as I found Now You See Me 2 to be quite dialogue-heavy for this sort of summertime blockbuster film. Many times it felt like the story would stall for 15-20 minutes and I would be lying if I said that I wasn't bored at moments throughout. With a runtime of over two hours, not much happens in the story that couldn't have been told in half that time and it's not like the filmmakers explored the story to the best of their ability, as a film commanding that much time, they had an ample amount of opportunities to go deeper.With spending more with the Horsemen the audience is treated to more of their dynamic and that is mostly fine, the film picks up with three of the four feelings burnt out from having to be in hiding and not getting the chance to perform. New addition Lizzy Caplan, who replaces Isla Fisher, is starry-eyed when joining the group and although no explanation is given as to why she joined the Horsemen outside of them ""needing a woman in the group"", I found her character quite annoying. I usually enjoy Lizzy Caplan in films, however, the character of Lula just comes across like the quirky side character who cracks jokes in serious situations and tries hard to be liked. Over the course of two hours, I found that to be quite tiresome, and with the involvement of Chase McKinney, Woody Harrelson's characters twin brother, who comes off like a wannabe character in The Big Lebowski, almost all of the new characters didn't bring much to the story outside of being irritating and that sadly includes Daniel Radcliffe too.There are not many positives I can say about Now You See Me 2, there are one or two sequences that I thought were fun, like when the group is trying to sneak a computer chip through a metal detector; and even though the film is more bright and cartoony to fit the goofy story, it was still ugly to looks at with no shots that stood out. I at least expected Now You See Me 2 to be halfway decent/more of the same, but with questionable decision making and a story that is just as convoluted as the previous film's finale, there is not much I can say about Now You See Me 2 outside of that I do not recommend it. It's not even dumb fun, the film moves at such a slow pace and wants the audience to care about the ridiculous and confusing story, that it left me bored to tears throughout. That's not to mention the film's smugness when unveiling its plot twist, even though the first entry had that aura too, at least it felt like it was sort of earned. I do not recommend this film, even if you were a fan of the first and for that reason, I am giving Now You See Me 2 a 1.5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie just piles impossible and dull acts of ''magic'' on top of each other resulting into no suspense, since you know for a fact the ''Horsemen'' will escape 100% of the time and nothing bad is going to happen to them, because either them or their higher ups have plotted everything out perfectly.I was not a fan of the first movie as it had the same vibe, but this was way worse, i sincerely do not understand why do they have to implement all these crazy plot twists that are not even clever. It appears as if the creators of this just think it is cool to change the way the movie is heading every 5 minutes to give us cheap shock value and wow the audience. It does quite to opposite sadly, since most of the viewers will easily get annoyed with seeing the same stupid cheap tricks and their impossible escapes over and over again. This movie proves that even though you have an incredible cast of actors at your disposal, they can not save you, when the plot is this blatantly dumb.This movie might be very interesting for kids or young teenagers, since it packs the action and cool visual tricks, that kids would definitely enjoy, not the greatest flick for mature audiences though. I hope this is the last past of this franchise, unless they change something drastically. 4/10 for some good acting and decent visuals.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I honestly did not think it could be as good as the original but I was pleasantly surprised...over and over! In true magician's fashion, you never see it coming!! My daughters absolutely could not get enough of this sequel. Woody Harrelson does an amazing job with his character and Lizzy Caplan fit right in with the Four Horsemen. I highly recommend you make a day of excitement, starting with this!! You won't be disappointed!! The acting is superb. The writing, excellent. The energy, never ending!!

Let's start at the beginning. You've probably seen the first one. Intrigue, misguidance and not necessarily what you've expected.Well strap in because this one is somewhat close to it's predecessor. I know a lot of people already think of this as ""the evil step brother"" of the first one.Let me tell you: It is not! Is this one as exciting as the first one? No it is not. Why, you ask? Well, because it's not the first one! You already know the way this movie is going to work. This is not the kind of cinema that will reinvent the wheel. But it will do it's best to get as close to it as possible? Absolutely!You will see the same kind of surprises (plot wise) that you got in the first one and a good bit more that you DID NOT expect. This is what this movie is about. It, by definition as a sequel, can't be as surprising as the first one (look at the Ocean's series). But it damn sure gets pretty damn close, so let's make that clear from the get go. However, will you be entertained? Heck yes you will! From the beginning of the movie, I tried to anticipate every move the crew makes. Did I do well? Nope. Did I enjoy myself? You better be sure I did!If you go into a sequel, expecting the genre to be redefined, I'm sorry, but it's your own fault. If you go into it, trying to enjoy yourself, you definitely will be entertained!I hope you have a great viewing experience!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I wanted to like it because I like so many of the actors in it. But, as we well know, that isn't enough to save any movie. I'm going to say the most compelling character is Lizzie Caplan, and although she hasn't done a lot worth mentioning yet, I do see a bright future for her. Mark Ruffalo is as boring as ever, and although that's actually an attribute for him in films like Spotlight, it's not so great in an action-er. The most boring Hulk in years is now the most boring spy. Jesse Eisenberg is good in many things, with his odd energy and quirkiness, but he's got to play kind of an a$$ in this role, and he's just not fun. If you want to see him in something fun, you have to go all the way back to Adventureland.I would say the best thing about this movie is the scene with the card, where the characters have to pass it to one another, unfortunately what blows the scene, for me, is that there's just too much OBVIOUS CGI and takes you out of the ""realism"" - doesn't allow you to adequately suspend disbelief. Do I feel like I wasted a couple of hours watching this? Yes, pretty much. Mainly, I felt somewhat annoyed or slightly angry at the fact that I wanted to stop watching due to the flaws, but wanted to keep watching because I was hoping the actors would be compelling. I mean, come on! Eisenberg, Harrelson, Radcliffe, Freeman, Caine, even Sanaa Lathan and Dave Franko - who are decent actors - and they couldn't pull this thing off correctly?? I blame the Director, screenwriter, and editor. Yes, the editor. They have been known to ruin films too, and I think the editor had a hand if messing up this one. if you watch, you'll see what I mean. It's all over the place. Should you watch it? How the heck should I know.

With 'Now you see me 2' I think they just tried too hard.The film picks up where the original left off - although now a year later. All the same characters are back, except Henley (Isla Fisher). I think this was their first mistake. They should have created an entirely new story around the Four Horseman, instead of treading on the past. The first film was mysterious and exciting. Now, they attempt to make it more complicated, and concentrate more on The Eye - quite frankly which added more confusion than answers.There's also far too many comedy elements, hence I didn't take it very seriously. The film is also laden with 'magic tricks' that's simply too unbelievable. The more they tried to explain them, the more ridiculous they were. (Especially the card trick scene when they stole the chip, and the plane scene...!!!). The plot also doesn't really offer anything new. It's pretty much a same old, same old premise - only with magic tricks here and there.The finale wasn't all that bad, although the reveal is not believable at all. I generally enjoy Daniel Radcliffe's post Harry Potter work, but he wasn't convincing in the role of one of the film's antagonists, Walter. With Michael Caine back as Tressler, and Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, the film gave me a sense of deja vu. There was little excitement and the film wasn't as fast-paced. Quite frankly, the magic is gone.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Now You See Me was one of those refreshing works that always left you wanting for more. It has to be said that the sequel to the 2013 amazing movie was far from impressive. If the makers had the idea that dazzling the viewers with a lot of hyperbolic cinematography was the way to go, they were sadly mistaken. The many small and episodic routines that were to culminate in to some sort of a grand Finale which were supposed to wow the viewers fell short of achieving that. All things considered, the worst part of the movie has to be Lizzy Caplan's way below average acting and presence in the movie. The movie could have been a little better without her lackluster performance and over the top hollow effort to outshine Isla Fischer (which made her look even more miserable), and hopefully she is given the sack if the makers of the franchise ever plan to redeem themselves with another movie after the second not so indulging effort.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The main cast was the same as the original, except Isla Fisher, who was replaced by Lizzy Caplan, the script was probably written over a lunch meeting, and the sets were bright and noisy, probably to avoid how little acting was going on. I remember Michael Caine when collecting one of his many awards years ago, saying that he had starred in over 100 terrible movies simply for the money, obviously he is still doing it. Avoid, unless completely bored.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It stirred movie goers due to it's amazing perspective on magic.The sequel keeps it going. It expands the whole universe and the magic too.The story unfolds when the payback comes from the other side. The victims of the prequel are now going against the four horsemen.The new expansive universe of the film franchise and magic is striking, mind bending and visually stunning.An amazing personal film experience.Highly recommended.

It had charm and a pseudo smartness which fell away when inspected too closely, but that movie disguised it PRETTY well with misdirection and actually followed its own advice, the closer you look, the more you will miss out on. But unfortunately, this sequel is rather by the numbers and has none of the cleverness and charm which the audience were expecting. Just like the previous movie, the four horse men are just patsies in someone else's plan and the whole movie is spent trying to figure out who and why. From the stale opening to the lame first act, this movie drags along. Halfway through, there were more yawns than cheers from the audience. The ending twist / surprise (or the Prestige as Michael Caine himself said in the Nolan movie) Is weak, inconsistent with the previous movie and lacks any kind of punch.Lizzy Caplan replaces the beautiful Isla Fisher and the movie is all the more awkward for it. The twin role by Woody Harrelson is at times funny, but ultimately it has no pay off and seems like a useless subplot. Michael Caine reprises his role from the sequel and he seems to be tired and not enjoying himself at all. Daniel Radcliff is severely miscast in his role and he comes across as Harry Potter acting like he was megalomaniac. This role need a serious creep factor which Elijah wood brought in for sin City, unfortunately Radcliff fails miserably. This movie is obviously partly produced by china as it involves a lot of its action taking place in Macau and the inclusion of the Chinese actors is a bit jarring. But this seems to be the new trend in Hollywood, co-financed by China. Karate kid, Transformers 4, Iron man 3 all went this route and this film really suffers for it The plot of such a movie should be so fast paced that the audience has no chance to think and they will just enjoy trick after trick. But this movie miserable fails in that too. It's boring, its clichéd and not enjoyable! I wish this was an amazing sequel, but it sadly falls way below the mark.Rating: 5/10. No really good reason to see this. Instead see the original again, it was much better! Note to Marketing Team: Next time your film has a great twist about the villain, DON'T reveal it on your marketing POSTER.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I love a good fun movie and I love being bluffed by clever magic, hence why I enjoy The Prestige to this day, but Louis Leterrier's financially successful and well-liked film was a dumb, daft and overblown experience that was neither as smart, sassy or suave as it thought it was, and I found myself thoroughly disappointed with the box office hit.Fast forward to 2016 and Australia's Isla Fisher has jumped the magic ship along with Leterrier, who has passed the directional baton to Jem and the Holograms and Step Up 3D mastermind Jon M. Chu, who has enlisted the comedic workings of Lizzy Caplin to fill in for Fisher and added a double dosing of Woody Harrelson and the world's most famous wizard Daniel Radcliffe to help enliven proceedings with this unwanted sequel, but while there's just as many flashing lights, colourful characters and ADHD storytelling as the first film, Now You See Me 2 is not surprisingly an even poorer attempt at movie magic than its throwaway forefather.To talk much about Now You See Me 2's plot would be giving too much credit to an event that pays near on zero attention to detail in trying to even make a miniscule attempt at making logical sense, and while it's fine for a film to look to entertain rather than adhere to logical rules of our existence in this universe, Chu's film doesn't even entertain throughout its overdrawn runtime.From incredible feats of card manoeuvring, manipulation of the weather or conference interrupting shenanigans, Now You See Me 2 certainly tries to be cool and its able cast that all look incredibly bored with their lot in sequellife (#showmethemoney) are pretty ""hip"", this experience feels tired and devoid of life, not something you want when what you've signed up for is supposedly a magical joy ride that will shock us with its reveals and make us gasp at its twists.The addition of Radcliffe adds a sprinkling of life to this rather dead-on-arrival and much too self-confident follow up, but this series that started out sounding promising, only to deliver a forgettable first entry and now this even more lacklustre sequel, is a one that needs to be laid to rest in the magicians coffin quickly, which sadly will be put on hold as the unappealing third entry to the franchise is brought to life over the coming years.1 ½ bouncing playing cards out of 5","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It wasn't a ""guilty pleasure"" or a ""cheesy movie."" That's something pretentious people say to excuse themselves for enjoying a film we all know ain't gonna win any Oscars. But NYSM was a good movie.Remember how immediately Jesse Eisenberg looked you right in the eye, dared you to ""look closer,"" then performed a simple, real-life illustration that if it worked (and it worked on me) was enough to earn your suspicious surprise and childish delight for the next hour and a half? That twinkle, that sparkle of harmless deception designed to bring joy—what Melanie Laurent's character championed for the entire first film— that's what's missing from NYSM 2.I had hoped NYSM was a stand-alone film. I didn't want a second one to come along and upset the motivations of the first, but that's exactly what happened. Regardless, in this review I'll avoid my frustrations with the plot and focus on the other elements I felt detracted from the movie's potential. First off, the magic.The big question of NYSM remains unanswered. NYSM 2 still hasn't decided for itself, whether or not it believes in magic. This makes it impossible for the viewer to choose if what they're seeing is supposed to be a cunning illusion or something mystical, otherworldly or paranormal. The quick-changes, inexplicable transformations and thin- air disappearances don't even attempt to poke at realism. I liked NYSM because it wasn't always blatantly obvious which ""tricks"" were possible to recreate live (regardless of how complicated or expensive) and which were clearly intended to work only on a film level. Early in NYSM 2, I began thinking, ""that's not possible"" but without any of the thrill or allure of a person who knows their senses are being made to work against them.People whine about how much ""suspension of belief"" NYSM asks of them as if all movies don't require at least the slightest measure of the same thing. This franchise didn't invent magicians, hypnotists or illusionists. But, at some point it stopped caring about whether or not it stayed true to the possibilities and limitations of the art form (without supernatural intervention). This should have been impossible to do with David frickin' Copperfield advising, but apparently not. I didn't believe my eyes. Not for a second.As far as visuals go, my only problem was that, at times, it felt like the action existed to support the special effects and not the other way around. There's a scene where the magicians must keep discreetly passing an item between themselves. It looked awesome, but went on for entirely too long. Shall I over-explain it in cumbersome, wordy detail? Don't worry, I won't.The heaviest expositions in NYSM existed to move the story forward or to deliver the full impact of a sequence of events. It didn't feel intrusive. Somehow, both the dialogue and the exposition (of not only tricks but of motives, intentions, plot) became distracting and exhaustive. Maybe it worked in NYSM because we were learning trade secrets as part of an investigation. This time around it felt like, ""Did you get it? Did you get it? Did you get it?"" Yes. I got it.Rounding out my frustrations were some poor character choices.In NYSM, Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) was such a strong female lead. Assistant- turned-Magician, she more than held her own in the all-male Horsemen line up. When I saw that she wasn't returning I was disappointed, but for only as long as it took me to read the name Lizzy Caplan. I adore Lizzy Caplan. Mean Girls, Cloverfield. She sealed her ownership of my heart in Party Down. I assumed Caplan was coming on to pick up Henley's reins and ride. Not so. Lulu, the newest addition to the team, is a fine magician but she's fidgety, rambles aimlessly and is immediately too preoccupied with Jack Wilder for her own good. I didn't hate Lulu. I was just bummed that she was so flat. The movie had, like 3 female characters. It just felt like a missed opportunity. Also, I wouldn't hold high hopes for Lulu's crush on Jack. Remember Alma Drey, the Interpol agent who won Rhodes' heart by the end of NYSM? I almost didn't. I mean, gimme a throwaway line, ""She's in South America."" I don't know, something.There were actually a fair amount of character development points that irked me. Things even the brilliance of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Mark Ruffalo couldn't barrel over. I won't even touch the Shrike / Bradley story arch. But NYSM 2 finally takes things too far by casting Woody Harrelson as his own identical twin brother, Chase McKinney ... HOW did things GO SO WRONG for this film!!?? Do I love Woody Harrelson? You're GD right I do! Did I ever want to see him act alongside himself as his own bizarre, quasi-effeminate twin brother? No. No, I did not. It's bad enough that this film couldn't get away from familial power struggles if it locked itself in a safe and sank to the bottom of the Thames. But this twin business, unforgivable.So, there it is, another 5 of 10-star review from a die-hard fan of the first installment. Hollow magic, drawn out special effects sequences, cringe-worthy dialogue and exposition, almost none of the dazzling stage time the Horsemen established in round one and finally, poor character choices ending with the McKinney twins.I wanted so badly to love NYSM 2, but as I feared some really poignant things got wrecked and left behind in the path it cleared for a third movie. Oh, well.I assume they'll just call it NYSM 3.But if the original was truly ""Now You See Me,"" sadly, the sequel is ""Now You Don't.""","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

NOW YOU SEE ME was an entertaining movie, but sadly Ed Solomon and Peter Chiarelli (with characters by Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) let the original concept become simply tiresome, not only in story but in silly diversions that add little except excessive length to this remake/extension now called NOW YOU SEE ME 2. John M. Chu can't seem to keep it together enough to make it fascinating the way the original played.As the plot goes, 'one year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public's adulation with their Robin Hood-style magic spectacles, The Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan) resurface for a comeback performance in hopes of exposing the unethical practices of a tech magnate. The man behind their vanishing act is none other than Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe), a tech prodigy who threatens the Horsemen into pulling off their most impossible heist yet. Their only hope is to perform one last unprecedented stunt to clear their names and reveal the mastermind behind it all. Mark Ruffalo is the FBI/Four Horsemen accomplice, Morgan Freeman is now out of Prison and stirring up details, unfortunately Woody Harrelson is now morphed into a twin (silly repulsive makeup and wig and eccentric mannerisms as a bad guy), Michael Caine is still on board, and a host of Chinese and American actors who range from noticeable to invisible. Some of the visual effects are well done, some of the magic ticks are cute if overplayed, but in the long run this film has little comparison to the first version. Too long, too loosely assimilated. And sadly, there is another sequel on the way.........","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The characters are less interesting, the dialogue isn't clever or funny, Woody Harrelson's second role is annoying and the most important aspect of any film about magicians or ""magic"", the explanation of their performance a.k.a. the twist, is lazy and makes no sense. I liked the first movie of the franchise. I didn't think it was fantastic, but definitely entertaining. The second movie made me furious at times because they seemed to think that trying to outdo every twist of the first movie would guarantee the second movie to be good. It didn't. They bombard you with these twists that don't make sense, leaving you thinking ""so at this point anything is possible because anything can be a twist"". You get a sensation of not fearing for the main characters because everything happening on the screen will be negated at some point of the movie. You expect every bad twist, you only wonder what illogical explanation they're going to offer this time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Really?
Remember,if you can understand magic, then there is nothing like magic.
This is what this movie is about.BTW there is explanations for twists in this movie but who needs explanation for magic.If they tell you how they were performing those tricks,there will nothing remain like magic.
For Example,in action movies like Fast and Furious Series,there is not explanations for those impossible stunts like how a car can fly?Moreover Now you see me seires is all about magic.They are saying that they are showing magic.If people can easily umderstand their tricks,the purpose of movie would collapse.
So these points in these reviews are baseless.
Its like to watch harry potter and ask how they were performing magic.
Its against the definition of magic that you can understand it.
Come to the acting,almost all the cast is experienced and i found no issue with that.But i should say that the speed of the events occuring in the movie is bit high.Pace could be bit slow.Also i found some comments which were saying that this movie was looking all about tricks.
No it was not looking all about tricks it was really all about tricks.
It was a movie based on magical tricks.The difference was they give you story and yeah there is story which is also mgical.
In the end it was entertaining movie!
Note:Before watching this movie,you should make it clear in your mind that you're going to watch magic and after watching agian you shoud recall that you've watched magic!
Then there will be no questions in your mind like how those tricks were performed and you will find this movie entertaining!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After enjoying the first movie, it was good to see the Four Horsemen back in action, with there new recruit, Lula (Lizzy Caplan) but there was a lot of random scenes which spoilt the flow of the film. After stealing money from some important people in the first movie, J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) are forced into hiding, with the help of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) but there past soon catches up with them, and they are forced to steal a priceless chip, which can hack into every computer, and uncover important information. Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) is also in hiding, and he lost money when the Four Horsemen performed the heist in the first movie, so he knows that they are the best candidates to retrieve the chip, even though he is still upset with them about the money he lost. Whilst retrieving the chip, Dylan asks for help from another person who lost money from the original heist, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), who points him in the right direction to find his friends, who have gone underground to plan the heist. Walter also recruits Merritt's brother, to make sure that the Four Horsemen do everything above board but once Walter's true plan comes to light, the whole plan turns pretty dark. Right from the beginning of the film, it's quite fast paced and there is something new happening in every scene but the director chose to show how they done a lot of there tricks, so it lacked the WOW! factor, which was what made the first movie so unique. There is loads of fast hand action which was quite impressive but apart from that, it's more of an Mission Impossible, type of movie, without the action. The cast was great and each character brought something different to the project but the plot was a bit weak and unbelievable. The main problem was that everyone was supposed to be in hiding but they seemed to be walking around without a care about getting caught. Also, some of them was supposed to be dead so that element didn't really make sense. Anyway, it's worth a watch but the original was better. Watchable!Round-Up: With both Now You See Me movies making around the same amount of money at the box office, audiences around the world obviously enjoy watching movies about magic, which is why I was surprised that there wasn't that much magic in this movie. The director Jon M. Church, 37, chose to stick with the heist element, and with the many different characters involved in the film, it seemed a bit of a mess in parts. His previous projects include Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3D, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never & Believe, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Jem and the Holograms, so he has covered different genres in his career. There is a third movie in the pipeline, which isn't surprising because the cast seemed to have fun whilst making the movie but the director needs to add some more magical moments. Budget: $90million Worldwide Gross: $335millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedies, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan, Daniel Radcliffe, Jay Chou, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, David Warshofsky and Sanaa Lathan. 5/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie is definitely not bigger or better than the first act. At the end of the first movie, a charming, and surprise sleeper hit big reveal when Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent Dylan Rhodes who spent the entire movie chasing the flashy thieves/magicians but never quite caught them because they were always ahead of him. So he decided to reveal his biggest secret that he is a magician himself, even that movie had a really convoluted plot but it was actually fun to watch.This film still explores the same characters as the first one along with some new ones; Jesse Eisenberg's Atlas seems to be in an endless squabble with the other characters. Well there is no Henley (Isla Fisher) anymore she is then replaced with fast talking and witty Lula (Lizzy Caplan) and finally joined with Dylan Rhodes who seems to be blaming his father's watery demise on Morgan Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley and that conversation seems to be decades old at this point. As far as this movie keeps brooding on at it's messed up points there are some fun bits well if you can call them fun, Walter Maubry's (Radcliffe) entrance is really cool and you can tell that he is going to be a pretty insane villain (that moment soon dies off) but after he stays on the screen for a long time then his character turns into just another stupid and pointless addition, in a stupid and pointless movie. The more this movie goes on with its ""second act"" business and by the time it gets there it really suggests that they should have stuck with the first act because it was better. The first movie directed by Louis Letterier was fun and flashy. This one, directed by John M.Chu is tepid, even managing to make a lengthy detour in the colourful city of Macau dull. Louis Letterier is nobody's idea of master of magic but next to Chu, he's Penn & Teller or even Harry Houdini. The movie is so strangled by an incredibly convoluted plot, including a spectacularly silly retcon, that the easy repartee of the Horsemen from the original is never recaptured. One can only dream of a much better and hopefully much dynamic film than it really is. Even the Card throwing Jack (Dave Franco) tries to pull them out of endearing situations and tries to pull off another charm that didn't even work in the first movie, let alone in this one. There are moments when the energy surges, such as a sequence where the Horsemen have to work together to conceal a playing card-shaped MacGuffin from the world's worst security guards. By and large though this movie suffers the same fate as another sequelitis, and a sense that nobody's heart is really in it. Take, for example Woody Harrelson's dual role. In what seems like a desperate attempt to give him something interesting to do, he also appears as Merritt's evil twin brother with a crazy and endearing plan, but as he babbles on unwittingly you want to wish that he and his fake mustache should come to an untimely demise. No such fate happens. As this appears to be bigger than the first and believe it or not the final act is actually the best part of the film but unfortunately until that time you have to go through nerve shattering squabbling and once it's finally got, to the final act the whole lead up is worthless. It then turns into whodunit murder case but they already know who did it and if they said that they knew then this movie would have been a lot shorter, unfortunately it wasn't it was just a worthless popcorn movie but with those they are guilty pleasures this was just stupid.Verdict: It's an impressively starry cast, but sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and yes, magic of the original. You'll like it, not a lot or no at all. 4/10 appalling.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first movie a lot more because it was very entertaining, whereas this movie has a lot of conversation and action than magic.

It was a complete waste of money. I do not usually write reviews but writing a negative review for this movie actually makes me feel better after what the movie did to me. I watched the first movie only hours before this one and that was much better/smarter/funnier than this one. The jokes in this movie are ridiculous and the plot does not make any sense. So many things that you look at do not make any sense for a normal human being to digest. There are many scenes that it looks like they were trying too hard to be entertaining or funny. On top of the the acting is TERRIBLE. The script is TERRIBLE. There are many point when actors even look directly at the camera, loss of continuity in scenes. It was as if the director was too lazy to record extra takes for badly shot scenes. I was bored for the first 3/4 of the movie. The ending is slightly more energetic but can do nothing to save this movie from being an utter disaster.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am a big con and heist movie fan, and NYSM and its sequel are obviously inspired by the likes of the Ocean's trilogy, Inside man and The Prestige. The first grabbed my interest with various tricks and twists which left questions that I was expecting to be answered in the movie's final act. The first movie contained nothing of the sort, but what was left was a decent amount of visual effects and good acting to make a fun experience, even if it did leave a bitter after taste.So it feels ironic that Now You See Me 2 fails because it tried to explain itself.Without spoiling the movie, I will sum up the story like this: The squad from the first movie (with a subbed in girl member played by Lizzy Caplan) is outsmarted by a ""shadow organization"" that is out to get them. Two men that stand out from that organization are the snobby millionaire played by Daniel Radcliffe and Woody Harrelson's character's twin brother played by Woody himself. Radcliffe does a good job playing his part, and Harrelson does what I suppose is the best he could do with his added role, seeing as it is probably one the worst written characters this year. I say ""one of the worst"" because it definitely isn't as bad as the new girl member of the team. ""Lula"" is supposed to be an illusionist worthy of the world's most secret magician society, yet she acts like an edgy 16 year old, desperately crushing on Dave Franco's character. This, together with the movie's plot, make the first two acts play out like a cartoon, with no logic or decent motivation behind any of the characters.The magic, I should note, looks great, the visual effects and direction are not ground breaking, but are certainly well done. Yet, as in the previous movie, it is literal MAGIC. Most of the big illusions in this movie are left unexplained, and those that aren't, should have been. Why? Well, perhaps because the writers of this movie seem to think that walking up to someone on the street and snapping your fingers at them is a legitimate way to hypnotize people, or that flashing a person with a UV lit text that says SLEEP will knock them out indefinitely. When an explanation serves its purpose only within the twisted reality of it's movie, it is safe to say that it isn't really a smart explanation, and that this really is not a smart movie, even if it acts otherwise.My friends and I left the theater laughing, dazed by the silliness of this movie. Would not recommend.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I called Marvel and asked if they had any more superheroes. They said they had one that transformed into an ant, but I thought that sounded a bit weak and decided to start from scratch. Having only seen the interiors of Hollywood mansions for the past 20 years I thought it was time to reconnect to humanity and I took my jet to Las Vegas and watched a Magic show for 10 minutes. Bingo! I had an idea. I called the studio and told them and they asked if there was going to be real Star Wars super magic, but I said no, regular card stuff. They told me I needed more CGI to appeal to the common man, I said sure, - how about an animated card flying around for 20 mins? That will also compensate for the lack of a real story. We brainstormed for 15 more minutes and came up with many brilliant ideas and here you are, my latest masterpiece. Now I can finally afford that bigger boat. And thank you, common man, for your 7 point review and all your money. You give me hope of a better tomorrow. now on to the 3-qual to explore those depths and fill in the gaps left out of this one.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The sequel takes these tricks to a new extreme and it gives the whole thing a real gimmicky feel. So, suffice to say, it doesn't feel near as intense or invigorating as the original. It's unfair to base a review solely compared to the first movie but it's hard to not see a decrease in quality and how the tricks are displayed.Now to focus on the movie rather than how it compares to the original: The first act of the film is very well done. It captures exactly what you'd expect from watching something like this. It establishes the characters and for some reason they are all a little too happy. Like seriously, they are just peachy after being cooped up for over a year... it's strange and doesn't really fit with all the whining they express. I went off on a tangent but the first act is still very solid. The first ""display of magic"" is very well done and the buildup to the trick was probably the best part of the movie. It then takes the awesome stealthiness of the first act, slaughters it with a cool idea that becomes totally unnecessary, and stretches it on for way too long.The plot is a little strange with a lot of double crossing that doesn't really carry any kind of impact and is a little hard to keep track of without the knowledge of the first movie. Also, for some reason, absolutely everyone shown in the film just loves magic.Overall, it's not a garbage film. It has some good ideas but stretches them for way too long and it kind of ruins the whole flow of the movie at times.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not sure about the director choice with Jon M Chu, who directed Justin Bebier's believe, which I obviously have never watched but not sure how he landed this gig. Eisenberg, Ruffalo and Harrelson all were OK but weren't really given a story or script worth their talents. There was no wow factor here that we got in the first film under director Louis Leterrier.

This film is just one more, and it followed one of the best, to reveal itself as one of the worst.The story is simple: after the events of the first film, the Horsemen separate and wait for instructions from the Eye. However, if some get tired and give up, others insist. Finally, they are summoned to expose the secrets of a new technological application but everything goes wrong: exposed to the world, they flee and end up in Macau, where they will have to find out who is the person who betrayed them.What can I say about this film? That many of the most interesting and entertaining features of the first film have simply disappeared. Director Jon M. Chu was able to reveal himself to be a nullity by making a hasty film, full of unrealistic and imaginative situations, as well as clichés like the evil twin or the illegitimate son who wants to please his father. Even as a piece of entertainment, this film is quite weak and unable to honor its predecessor.The cast is inherited from the previous film, with few modifications, but they are at a distance from giving us a good job because they weren't entitled to some decent material. So, we have again Jesse Eisenberg, more arrogant than in the first film, James Franco and Woody Harrelson, who will also give life to his character's presumptuous twin brother (a stupid script option, at the very least). Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also returned to their characters, and I would say that they are the best actors here. The problem is that they could not do anything to improve the film given that they did not have much visibility (Freeman and Ruffalo, who appear only when necessary, are really underused sometimes). The exit of Isla Fisher (quite intelligent given that she saved herself from a film that would not add anything good to her career) was filled by the entrance of Lizzy Caplan, as a fun character that makes you smile, adding moments of spontaneity and irreverence to a film that, without it, would be more boring. The villain was incarnated by Daniel Radcliffe, but he looks like a cynical caricature, and I was never able to take him seriously.Technically, it's a fairly regular film: on the positive side, I would highlight cinematography, with a good work of light and color, enhanced by the authentic color of the streets of Macau, a former Portuguese colony in China where much of the film takes place. The sets and costumes are good enough and there is some realism and verisimilitude in CGI and in visual and sound effects. The soundtrack, it seemed to me, is inherited from the previous film with few modifications.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The characters are very one dimensional and are totally unconvincing as magicians. There are some good actors in here that could not save what was a poor story with even worse direction. It would have been good if they had a better plot and illusions rather than both being completely silly and not in any way clever or impressive. Maybe they should have watched some Penn and Teller, David Blaine or Dynamo to get some good ideas for dramatic illusions that could actually work. Will I watch the third one?

What the film does still offer is some visually terrific sequences, even when it can get convuluted, it is always fuj to see these magicians use their skills and it's a soecial thing this series has to offer that no other film series has. The plot is very flat, I really enjoyed the first Now You See Me and was looking forward to seeing how they continued this story, but they really did not try to break any boundaries or try to excel beyond any success they had with their predecessor, it was simoly by the numbers. The cast look like they are having fun, and that certainly makes it more watchable, but their is little to no scope added to their characters, we do not learn anything new or benefit in seeing them grow by watching this film, it offers little pay off. An uninteresting sequel. Lightly plotted and thinly developed, I would advise giving Now You See Me 2 a miss.

The more convincing, the better. Unfortunately the action in this film, magic tricks, sleight of hand, hypnotizing people, is simply unbelievable - in a bad way. This is not an alternate universe with different rules of physics. This is not a group of super heroes using their powers, this is not a tale of magic becoming reality, this is simply unrealistic garbage.As for the actors, most notably we have Mark Zuckerberg (played by Lex Luthor) trying to take away the leadership of the ""Horsemen"" from ""Jack"" (played by someone without any screen presence whatsoever). Then we have a new person in the crew, an obnoxious girl, replacing someone from the prequel who I can't remember, because they were just as forgettable as the whole drivel that makes up both stories. We have Woody, Morgan Freeman, Caine, and Harry (Potter). In other words no one likable, unless you like them. Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) also shows his unlikable side.I tried to keep this on to help me sleep, but during the action scenes they cranked up the volume (as is customary in movies for some reason) so I ended up switching it off.The extra star I gave is for production value.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was only the 2 in the title that gave away this was a sequel to me and didn't know anything at all about the movie beforehand.It turns out that it's a movie about a group of magicians called the Horsemen who perform spectacular magic acts to expose rich people exploiting people. Think that pretty much covers the plot. The film is at it's best when there are scenes of the magicians trying to outdo each other. The first scene which introduces the new horseman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) is an example of this. Overall it's a pretty incoherent script though which may be partly explained by the fact that I hadn't seen the first film. Maybe a second viewing would make things a little clearer although on balance I can't be bothered. If you like magic and enjoyed the original film then sure you'll enjoy this.

At first you're presented with a confusing introduction, followed by an even more confusing continuation and further confusing plot twists that make absolutely no sense to anyone.That and the fact that they spend more time showing how magic tricks are done than showing them in action or concentrating on character development or romance. In fact at the end something happens between two of the horsemen and everyone in the room watching the movie looked at one another in confusion... What just happened? Why? To top it all off, the musical score sounds like it's straight out of TV shows like Castle or Nash Bridges with a playful, repetitive, ""free stock music"" sounding instrumental piece that starts out as annoying and by mid movie, winds up being all out irritating.Their only saving grace that gets them 4/10 is the fact that they used a cast of pretty decent actors but one is left to wonder: How the hell did they talk Morgan Freeman into actually playing in a movie this bad? Maybe he hadn't read the script or maybe they threw a bag of money at him. In either case this is the perfect example of a movie sequel quickly scratched together to achieve only one thing: Profit.Cheaply made, cheaply scripted, cheap special effects, cheap everything but the entry price.

Despite boasting an ensemble of A and B-list actors, the film fails to harness their talents effectively, leading to a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.One of the most glaring issues with ""Now You See Me 2"" is its inability to strike the right chords with its intended humor and suspense. Scenes that are meant to be funny fall flat, lacking the wit and timing that comedy demands. The attempts at humor feel forced and out of place, failing to evoke the laughter they aim for.Similarly, the suspenseful moments, which should be the backbone of a film centered around magic and heists, are equally lackluster. The movie consistently builds up to what should be thrilling climaxes, only to fizzle out into a series of anticlimaxes. This pattern of buildup and letdown leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied and disengaged.The storyline is another aspect where ""Now You See Me 2"" misses the mark. Instead of a clever and captivating plot, the audience is presented with a narrative that feels contrived and cringe-worthy. The twists and turns, which are intended to be shocking and ingenious, come across as predictable and uninspired.Furthermore, the film's use of music, while in itself is of good quality and could suit a genuinely suspenseful movie, only serves to highlight the film's deficiencies. The dramatic score, rather than enhancing the scenes, underscores the gap between the film's aspirations and its actual execution. It's like dressing a mediocre play in Broadway-level production - the disparity is jarring.In conclusion, ""Now You See Me 2"" is a sequel that fails to live up to its potential. With a cast that promised so much more, the film is a disappointment, characterized by forced humor, weak suspense, a clichéd storyline, and a misused musical score. For fans of the original movie, this sequel might not be the magical experience they were hoping for.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is even more convoluted, even more complicated than its predecessor, and in almost all respects, a failure. Now You See Me 2 lacks the (fairly) witty script of the previous film, instead relying on sagely nebulous claptrap which in reality meant nothing at all. A great chunk of the dialogue felt like a toddler wrote it in alphabeti spaghetti- the script masquerades in being smarter than it really is. The twisting, needlessly complicated storyline is also simply awful. The story felt like it was tacked together with duct tape, disposing of logical inconsistencies in smug grand reveals which in reality only evinces the poor quality of writing. The unexpected twists and surprises of this story are not intellectually satisfying or revelatory- they are merely there to cover up the increasingly deep hole the writers have dug themselves in, burying along any form of coherence or structure in it. The character motivations also felt confused, and the contrived drama typical of aggressively average films are also of course seen here. The only saving grace for this film is in its entertainment value within some scenes, notably a data chip heist scene. The performance of Lizzy Kaplan is also excellent, her character breathing a ray of optimistic sunshine into the dreary, droll male members of the horseman. Overall, Now You See Me 2 is substandard, overly ambitious, and quite a slog. It is a daft daft film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was as if it had caved under the weight of its predecessor. The plot continuously loses grip. One is left questioning ""what? I don't get it"". Trust me the tricks seem more realistic than the plot. Too many so called twists in the tale. Well its not needed. The movie doesn't remain true to its genre. And characterization. Whoa! Talent seems wasted. Jesse Eisenberg deserved more screen space. Instead Daniel Radcliffe - great actor he may be- cant save a sinking plot. And Woody Harrelson in two roles. Not good. Lizzy Chaplan tries to impress us with her humor.Well it just didn't click. Morgan Freeman excellent as ever. But again not enough screen space. Reserving the best for the last, Mark Ruffalo. He seemed well and truly into the character. He sells his role to us. But the plot collapses. None of the greats in the movie could save it and thats a shame.

"5","/10","Now You See Me 2 improves with some new tricks, but creates new problems for it's show","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3488460/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2016","It's one thing to produce fantasy where wizards can produce magical energy to fight or resurrect the dead with a spell, but something else when your portraying stage magicians. One major rule when making a movie about these illusionists is that no computer-generated imagery can be used what so ever. Part of the reason that translating the stories of magicians to cinema is that the awe of the tricks are from witnessing them live. Adding a camera adds a sense of cynicism that a simple white rabbit out of a top hat could have been done using editing rather then hand trickery. Ironically, much of whatever's added in film to make things more magical suddenly takes away the wonder.The Prestige from Christopher Nolan seems to be the best movie out there about magicians. But when most people think about cinematic illusionists, they think about the 2013 film, Now You See Me. The movie had some interesting ideas, but I found the four horsemen too perfect for their own good. They didn't connect with me, but it did with audiences and was a hit (you have to give the movie credit for being original AND a hit). Now You See Me 2 continues the escapades of the four (in this case five) horsemen.Set a year after the events of the first movie, the horsemen, hypnotist Merritt (played by Woody Harrelson) street magician Atlas (played by Jessie Eisenberg), card handler Jack (played by Dave Franco), and newcomer May (played by Lizzy Caplan) have been in hiding, waiting for their next move from the Eye, the magician society they were recruited into before. With their leader FBI agent Dylan (played by Mark Ruffalo), they are assigned to expose a corrupt businessman whose software can steal data from users. They hijack the launch party, but are interrupted by a unseen individual who reveals that Dylan is in on the four horsemen. The magicians escape, but are unexpectedly taken and brought to Macau. They are brought in front of tech prodigy Walter Mabry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) who used to work with the same business that the horsemen tried to expose. They are given orders to steal the software chip from a secret facility under a casino. The heist goes well, but Mabry turns the tables on them and steels the chip back for his own benefit. Upon finding out that Mabry is the son of Arthur (played by Michael Caine), they travel to London to plan their next act to finally put an end to these villains.I'll say that I liked Now You See Me 2 as much as the last filmwhich was okay. It's not the same thoughts though as while they fixed some problems I had before, but accidentally create new ones. While the four horsemen are still too perfect as heroes, Mark Ruffalo gets some more background and becomes a surprising interesting character to follow. This film continues the heist theme, which seems like a good plan, but a lot of the story gets complicated.A lot of that has to do with the fact the idea of steeling a computer chip has been done hundreds of times before in film, so why should I care about this one? The villains' plans are just as predictable as it's just take over the world. Finally, some of the magic tricks are cool and visually neat (not as much CGI this time), but it requires a major suspension of disbelief. I doubt David Copperfield and Sigfried & Roy could have come up with some of these tricks in just one day. I'll give this five joker card out of ten. If you liked the last movie, you'll probably like this too. It's too much ""movie"" for me to get into. What I mean by that is I wish I could be seeing these tricks live rather then watch it in a movie. Though there are some tricks, the overall treat just isn't to my taste.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And, like most sequels, it's not as good as the first one. With The Horsemen being threatened by the threat of Daniel Radcliffe (odd to see him in a film about magic eh?) there are more hi-jinks, impossible feats of magic, convoluted twists, and witty repartees between the talented cast. The cast is undoubtedly the strongest thing about this film - the standout scenes are the ones in which The Horsemen are in their element, doing quick flashy magic and impressing everyone. Unfortunately there aren't as many of these scenes as there should be, with the filmmakers seemingly intent on switching from one underdeveloped subplot to another. Mark Ruffalo, as the Head Horseman, spends much of his tins with Morgan Freeman, with the two struggling to sell unconvincing drama. In a bizarre and distracting turn of events, Woody Harrelson takes on a dual role, introducing his character's twin brother as a campy villainous antagonist with almost nothing to add to the story which already has enough characters - it's always good to see more Harrelson but the twin aspect was unnecessary. There's a father-son relationship between Radcliffe and Michael Caine - who is great for his ten minutes of screen time - an FBI investigation team with a young officer who looks up to Ruffalo, a helpful pair of Chinese magicians with some vague link to The Horsemen....it is at times almost as overstuffed as Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's a classic case of sequelitis, and one which dooms the film almost from the get-go. Which is not to say there's not fun to be had: the delectable sleekness of some scenes is sure to bring a smile to the face and with this cast it's impossible not to be entertained. Standouts are Radcliffe's demented bearded tech whizz who is just fantastic to watch. He is an actor who has really thrown off the shackles of the Harry Potter legacy and is now just a great actor to have in anything, now showing his skill as a villain. Lizzy Caplan is bubbly and fun in her role, whilst Jesse Eisenberg, Harrelson, and Dave Franco are all solid as a team - if the widely purported third instalment of this franchise is to go ahead, then a good suggestion would be to bring down the stakes and focus more on the team dynamic. Ultimately, the film is flashy and at times fun, but drags more than its predecessor, is overstuffed, and is simply less enjoyable. One of the main criticisms of the first film was the empty flash, but the sequel has just expanded on that. A decent enough watch, but not something that will be remembered or re-watched. 53/100","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's just one boring, chaotic dress rehearsal. I picture a twelve year old sitting in the director's chair. This film, and the one before it, are Romper Room mayhem and there's nothing appealing about the script or the acting. Very disappointing.

It had a fun idea and fun characters to go along with it, but it also felt muddled. For example, the whole shadowy organization, The Eye, behind it all felt completely unnecessary. The movie could just have been a fun little heist movie with four magicians deciding to get rich by using their talents. There was absolutely no need to throw in bargain bin Illuminati with rumours of real magic.And of course that bargain bin Illuminati is exactly what they chose to focus on in the sequel. Because of course it was. Gone are the quippy one-liners, gone is the flash and razzle dazzle, gone is the magic. Instead our main characters are on the run. It's all very dark and grim. You can trust no one and the police is right on their tails. Instead of them being two steps ahead of everyone else - you know, the fact that made the previous film so fun to watch - now they're constantly two steps behind. Of course they'll prevail by the end - it's still a movie - but it doesn't feel earned.And let me raise one gripe above others. There's very little magic in this film. Towards the end we start seeing them pull shows once more, and at point it becomes interesting, but before that, almost nothing.Okay, there's one very long scene with card tricks and more specifically card throwing, but that felt so pointlessly unneeded and complicated that it become unintentionally hilarious. If you don't want other people finding the card you're holding, perhaps don't throw it across the room a million times.That being said, the actors were still very enjoyable. Mark Ruffalo gets a lot more screen time this time around and his subplot was the most enjoyable by a wide margin. Perhaps more of that would have fixed the film. Then again, I came to this film to see the Horsemen, so having even less of them could also be very bad.Not a good sequel. Usually these things try to cram too much of what made the previous film work down our throats, but this falls into that other dangerous category: not knowing what made the previous film so good.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
