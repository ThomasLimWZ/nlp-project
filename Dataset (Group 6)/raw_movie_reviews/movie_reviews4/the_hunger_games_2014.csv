"6","/10","Why is this in two parts?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3174123/?ref_=tt_urv","Vartiainen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30163554/?ref_=tt_urv","31 January 2015","The Hunger Games story continues with the third installation, Mockingjay. And it's about as padded and needlessly long as every other two-parter we've had since the studio executives came up with this money-grabbing monstrosity of an idea.Not to say you shouldn't see this one if you've liked the previous Hunger Games films. This continues the story just fine. Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Her presence and talent hold us through even through scenes you instantly recognize as needless padding and waste of our money. The returning cast is also as talented as they've always been and most of the new characters are also casted without hitches. Julianne Moore is perhaps a bit too... Julianne Moore to play President Coin 100 percent convincingly, but she has certain presence as well, that cannot be denied.What bugs me is the story. The book itself was the weakest of the trilogy, though not by much, and it seems that its faults bleed into the film. Especially because the iron tight pace of the previous installations is thrown straight out of the window and we spent most of our time building up atmosphere. And building. And building. And... You get the point. There's very little bang for your buck here and even when something substantial happens, it simply lacks that edge.Plus, they had the perfect closing scene, and for some reason they decided to keep going for about five minutes. Trust me, you know where they should have ended it when you've seen the movie.This is a good movie. It still looks great, the main actors are brilliant and it has enough depth to impress through its story alone. I just wish they had had the integrity to go with one movie. It very well might have been the best Hunger Games movie of the three. It would have had two movies before it to build up momentum and steam. Instead it lifts up the pedal from the gas and decides to stroll over the finish line. Poor form, extremely poor form.","83 out of 98 found this helpful.

A reluctant Katniss has only one thing on her mind, to save Peeta.I have to be honest, I have always struggled with this movie, it isn't bad, I just wish they could have got the story done in one go, I like the second part, I find this first half too fleshed out, it lacks any real content. It does get going, but later on, it's all build up for the second.The visuals are great, there are plenty of action sequences and explosions, and of course sets and costumes look great. Lawrence is very good once again, but the script doesn't offer her the range that Catching Fire did.Julianne Moore was excellent as President Coin I thought, very strong performance.I did enjoy that scene where Peeta turned, having been absent for most of the movie, it was good to see him put to good use.I liked that there was a message at the end for Philip Seymour Hoffman, RIP.6/10.","8 out of 8 found this helpful.

Boring to a mind-numbing degree. How many times can we see Katniss be horrified and/or emotionally distraught? Maybe the filmmakers thought they were adding depth to their characters. Well, they were wrong. Instead we, the audience, sit through one scene after another in which really nothing happens at all. This whole thing could have easily been compressed down to 40 minutes and then we could have had the rest of the book as the rest of the film. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they could make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with these franchises. Not good storytelling.","281 out of 459 found this helpful.

This is a realistic version instead, with a character-motive driven plot. Unlike the first two films this one actually matters. I hope the creators of this film are proud of their accomplishment. Instead of a cheesy thrill ride we have been introduced to the realities of war and rebellion and we were given good acting, good screen writing and characters we can identify with and care about. After watching hundreds of movies in the post apocalyptic genre this one stands out as significantly better than the others, especially the first two films. Thank you for making the Hunger Games series into something meaningful.","12 out of 15 found this helpful.

Now she must become the face of the rebellion as both sides use propaganda against each other. Meanwhile, Katniss is overwhelmed by balancing her responsibility to the people of Panem with her desire to save Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Mockingjay Part 1 is strong when it comes to the acting talent involved and showing the behinds the scenes propaganda of war. However, the decision to split the story into two parts has really hurt this movie by making it feel incomplete and filled with overstretched melodrama. While it is not a complete failure, it may be better to hold off watching this movie till Part 2 is released.Full Review:I never read the books but I enjoyed the last two movies in the franchise, especially Catching Fire. While I can't say I was aching to go see Mockingjay Part 1, I was interested to know how the story progressed after the cliff-hanger of the last movie. I was concerned that splitting the story into two parts may have been a detrimental choice, unfortunately my concerns were legitimate.I know I'm coming off really negative but there are definitely some gems in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, were the best part of the movie. Watching them clash and play strategic moves against each other was intriguing. The rest of the cast do a good job in showing how they have been affected and changed by this war. This is the first time we see the world outside of the actual Hunger Games and District 12, which helped enrich this movie's universe. Uniquely we get see how propaganda plays an important role in the war. I can't remember the last war movie that delved into that aspect. On top of that, these propaganda pieces were very moving thanks to the rage fueled words of Katniss and the fear mongering of Snow.A lot of the problems for this movie stem from the fact we are spending 2hrs on half a story. This led to us having an entire movie where Katniss keeps crying and moping about either Peeta or the people of District 12 being dead. The feeling that the movie is overstretched is only compounded by how several scenes are just a rehash of a previous scene, for example the recording of a propaganda (3 times) and multiple scenes per character sulking about the people suffering. Look I'm not heartless, I understand those are devastating things to happen to a person, but we want to see the story move forward. I can honestly say that apart from Katniss becoming the face of the rebellion, there is no significant plot development since Catching Fire. There is all this slow build up but that's all it is, a build up to an end that is unsatisfying. Essentially this is a 2hr preview ad for Mockingjay Part 2, and quite frankly I felt mad about this when I left the cinema, and that doesn't happen often.The pathetic cash-grab moves by studios to split the movie into two parts is the root of all the problems for Mockingjay Part 1. To fill the run time the movie is stuffed full with melodrama without much weight to make you care for long. All the momentum that the previous two movies had built has now come to a dull crawl. I'd recommend skipping this movie till Part 2 is released and hopefully enjoy a more complete story.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/","66 out of 105 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A Two Hour Preview of What to Expect in the Final Movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3127205/?ref_=tt_urv","prospectus_capricornium","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37599117/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2014","You may want to save your money and time seeing this movie and wait for the last installment to come out next year, instead. Aside from Jennifer Lawrence, this movie offers nothing more than just a long and tiring tale of preparation for an impending rebellion.Readers shouldn't get surprised: Mockingjay's first half chronicles District 13's efforts to groom Katniss as their heroine against the ruthless ruling Capitol. The process of transforming her into what they call the 'Mockingjay', a symbol of revolution, is engaging enough to ignite interest, but only up to a point, when long speeches and depictions of what the Hunger Games' downfall has caused, have almost become the only few things eating up the biggest slice of the movie's airtime pie. There is nothing much to see here, and while its refreshing to finally see the landscapes to have finally shifted away from the arenas, lack of action eventually makes the scenes that are almost only showing the events in the confinements, hard to appreciate, not to mention difficult to extract sense from.Fortunately, it has Jennifer Lawrence, and that alone, is enough to pull the entire movie away whenever it leans toward making the audience fall to sleep. Jennifer's charm proves to be the biggest asset of this movie, and she alone, singularly saves the film from being a total nonsense. Toward the end, it isn't clear whether the makers of the film have made their point (aside from making more money of course) in splitting the book into two movies. This first half only presents a preview of what to happen next in the other half, only stretched into two hours of tiring sameness and boring exchanges of bland dialogues. The new characters are interesting yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone of them has offered something more than Lawrence, to spark further interest. Well, at least we can take comfort from the fact that the last movie next year will certainly offer a lot more, gripping action and drama, and that's really something to look forward to.Mockingjay Pt.1 falls below the heights reached by the previous two films. Minus Lawrence, this film is a real bore, and its hard to seek something more than her to recommend. I give this film 6 of my 10 stars.","186 out of 364 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Mockingjay would've been a rushed mess as one movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128721/?ref_=tt_urv","PyroSikTh","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5261700/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2014","When it was first announced that Mockingjay was going to be split into  two movies, I gawked. It's one book. How can there possibly be enough  to fill two movies? It didn't help that my sister also found it weird,  having read the book. She couldn't see any obvious place for the split.  Despite what feels like everyone else on the internet is saying, I  actually support the split now. Mockingjay marks a massive tonal shift  in the franchise, so it would have been a bit jarring introducing this  tonal shift for the final movie, leaving you no time to settle into the  new status quo left from Catching Fire. The biggest reason for my  support though is how rushed everything would have been.  When a book is adapted into a movie, there are certain time constraints  to be taken into account. That inevitably means things are cut, which  leaves many fans unhappy with the final product. With Mockingjay they  decided to give it time to flesh out the characters; give everyone a  bit of limelight, expand on various elements in the book, and just  generally make sure it doesn't frenetically jump from scene to scene or  cut out important plot points. Having now scene Mockingjay Part 1, I  can't imagine it being compressed into half the running time without  sacrificing the emotional resonance or rushing through everything.  The emotional resonance is the big selling point of Mockingjay. For  some it might be seen as boring, drawn-out melodrama, but for me it  made Mockingjay a darker, more harrowing movie than the previous two,  which says a lot about a franchise hinging on a fight-to-the-death  between children in order to keep the tyrannical dictatorship in place.  Katniss has lost her district, lost Peeta, and now lives in hiding with  a group of rebels intent on overthrowing the Capitol. To not dwell on  how that affects her and the people around her would have been a  massive misstep. The franchise needed to slow down and focus on the  characters.  To say it's only half a movie is misinformation as well. It feels like  a complete movie, at least more complete than Catching Fire ever did.  As I mentioned, Peeta is kept prisoner by the Capitol, and he's being  used as a propaganda weapon in response to Katniss' propaganda by the  rebels. The whole plot of the movie is about this cat and mouse of  propaganda as the two opposing sides try to get an upper hand on the  people of Panem. The big final climax feels like the big final climax  of a story, bringing this cat and mouse to an end. It's final moments  are a resolution to the beginning and middle, and in that respect it  absolutely has all three acts. Of course it has a cliffhanger moment  right before the credits to segue into the next movie, but so did  Catching Fire (and Desolation of Smaug, and Fast & Furious 6, and every  Marvel movie etc. etc.)  Everything else ticks all the right boxes as well; the acting is  top-notch, especially from Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman  (with a little memoriam for him in the credits). The visuals are on the  nail. District 12 is now depicted in ruins, the CGI of the various  ships and futuristic cityscape of the Capitol is flawless. There was  also some fantastic use of CGI on Josh Hutcherson to make him look  progressively thinner and beaten up as the movie goes along, showing  the torture he must have been enduring. The musical score is fantastic,  with the Mockingjay theme coming well and truly into it's element, as  well as a fully fledged song that brings the rebellion to full strength  in the propaganda war.  Mockingjay proves that milking extra movies out of a franchise doesn't  necessarily have to be a bad thing (looking at you, Desolation of  Smaug). It slows the franchise down and gives you time to breathe  before the big conclusion next year, injecting plenty of heartfelt  emotion to the whole situation, fleshing out the world, developing the  characters etc. However it's not without it's higher-octane moments.  There's a number of action scenes despite it's calmer narrative, which  expand what was in the book to blistering effect (the fantastically  suspenseful climax is apparently just a few lines in the book, largely  glossed over). It's tense, unpredictable, emotional, yet has it's  light-hearted moments. I give Mockingjay Part 1 a very good 8/10. It's  made me very excited for next year when I can marathon the whole  franchise in one go.","85 out of 143 found this helpful.

Everything about the movie was done really well. The special effects and action sequences were top notch and the continually increased budget is evident here especially. The acting was fantastic and the setting was detailed and felt incredibly real. Even all of the little emotional elements delivered perfectly. The real problem is that, as I previously mentioned, it's only half of a story. The movie builds to something that never really occurs and the void in action will be even more obvious when the extreme action in the next film comes to fruition. Yes, I understand that the Lord of the Rings films do something similar. The difference is that those films manage to build towards their individual climax without actually failing to develop the overall story arc. I think Francis Lawrence tried to accomplish that with this film but the source material wasn't made for that to be done, where as the Lord of the Rings movies were. Mockingjay Part 1 is still a good film and ultimately will be incredibly important in setting the stage for what should be the best film of the franchise but it is still incomplete.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

Social criticism is much stronger than previous movies. Films theme is much more brooding and ominous than before. But that doesn't save this picture totally. Dividing the movie in two parts is clearly a huge mistake. Many scene are way too long and some of them are clearly just vain. Topmost feeling is just making more money. It would be much better to make only one movie instead of two. One three hour long movie is much easier to keep together, than two over length movies. It is clearly Hollywood's greed to capitalize on movie (and book) series fans. How many times more the audience will accept that? Jennifer Lawrece is great at her role as Katniss, but somehow Josh Hutcherson as Peeta's role as brainwashed puppet doesn't convince. There is a lot of good elements in this movie so it is a shame that Hollywood want just get few more money from the fans. Mockingjay part 1 is despite that quite eligible movie that end up in green money making. Good movie ends up to mediocre action flick and that is shame.","29 out of 60 found this helpful.

There has definitely been a trend of splitting up a story into multiple movies. These movies don't have a beginning-middle-end the same way other movies do but at the very least there's some progress. The problem with the Mockingjay Pt 1 is not that it's boring or poorly made. In fact, there is a lot of excitement in this movie. The problem is that from beginning to end there is hardly anything that changes. If you look at where the characters are in the beginning and where they are in the end there isn't much that's changed except for what happens in the very end. Katniss has been doing things but we haven't seen much of the effects of her actions.I didn't dislike this movie that much despite it's slow beginning.

Prim's attitude leaving the bunker to save her cat is ridiculous and why Peeta's broadcasting is live is hard to understand.

No contrast escapes the mawkishness; nature is pure, democracy a drab necessity, oppression a blatant evil.And however much value it purports to place on the power of image, the truth of spontaneity and so on, it ends up doing the opposite, image that has no real power, spontaneity that has been staged, the real thing beyond anyone's grasp and care; it's enough for images to be stickied on a narrative that justifies the means.In this sense it's disastrous work that closes portals in the imagination, but then again I'm not fussed; teens and preteens will outgrow it like we did the inanities of our time and grow to find value in something that chronicles the hardships of making sense without the contrivance.If I could nudge them in that direction it would be Harmony Korine, a film like Spring Breakers; a film without pretense of an important message, whose truly radical importance is a balancing it demands of the viewer between the colorful urge to revel and truth of its value.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

As MjP1's Katniss, a character burdened with being the hope AND the cause of Panem's war, she carries the responsibility placed on her with complexity, strength, fear and heartbreak. Add in the film's exploration of faith and fear, and its criticizing political spins of all kinds, and it becomes clear: the Hunger Games franchise is a cinematic force to be reckoned with. To shove this aside with the other YA films is grossly inaccurate; MjP1 proves that this is among the premiere SciFi franchises of this era. We catch up with Katniss in underground District 13, reluctantly leading the rebellion against President Snow and the Capitol. The story is skillfully told, with the power of fear palpable in the oppressed 99%, and the fear of power creeping up in the 1%. It's a solemn affair, to be sure, but not without its moments of levity, solidly exhibited in the high-caliber actors that are the strength of the series. Lawrence, Banks, Sutherland, and Hoffman are all standouts, with the nice addition of Moore as a political player with dubious motives. Like Harry Potter's second-to-last film, MjP1 is essentially a glorified first act to a two-part story. This will leave some wanting, especially in the areas of action and closure. However, with the amount of passion, scenery-chewing, and complex commentary within, it left me more than satisfied, while excited about the next one. Emotionally powerful and socially conscious, MjP1 is a massive step up in the zeitgeist-y franchise.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

This, along with a somewhat heavy handed study on propaganda are the movies primary attractions. This is not the kind of action film audiences of the first two ""Hunger Games"" movies enjoyed. There is a fair amount of fighting, but this movie is about charisma: Who has it, how its used and what it means. At this, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is brilliant, primarily because Jennifer Lawrence HAS charisma. At several points in the movie, watching Lawrence draw me into her Katniss Everdean, I thought of politicians who were able to evoke passion in the populace. Lawrence has that ability in large quantities. I also found the direction of the film to be outstanding. A particularly well-crafted scene occurs early when the Rebel's leadership are asked to suggest moments when Katniss was most effective at touching the spirits of the populace. This scene not only approaches a breach of the fourth wall, it could have caused viewers to suspend their ""suspension of disbelief."" But through precise timing and a brilliant performance by Woody Harrelson this scene succeeds in getting the audience involved interactively as we are invited to think of those moments from previous movies and nod our heads as we sub-vocalize our ""Uh-Huh's.""This movie is about the why and the how of making of ""The Mockingjay-the symbol of the revolution."" Why Katniss? How Katniss?WOW! Katniss!","44 out of 73 found this helpful.

Obviously I was lacking somehow and must be missing something I figured with all the rage around this movie. What I found was it was not me but the movie just does not connect, has no draw and feels like just a corporate money scheme. I feel cheated, dirty, like a stupefied sucker and want to take a shower. I get better vibes from used car sales lots than this movie as well the industry of late.There were some good movies this year; but all that has come out pre- Holidays have been lame to terrible and I see a lot of movies. Maybe the ""Interview"" had real potential compared to this tripe I have seen here and in other recent releases of movies.I watch a wide genre of movies and am open to diverse visual and story arts but this and the recent movies are so terrible literally. I am finding better more engaging shows on TV than what the theaters offer nowadays. Heck they can not be original and rehash same old stories; well okay that might be fine if the surpassed the originals and yet even special effects seem at best B movie compared to the epics of the 60's and such. Dang maybe they just need to go back to Spaghetti Westerns; at least they were entertaining somewhat....All I feel is fleeced; again by the movie industry and it is getting old. But all they seem to care about is cha-ching, cha-ching, cha- ching. Guess the 4th Quarter is more important than their long term outlook as a industry. More people are catching on and just say screw it and why theaters are more and more empty.We know the technology, actor resources and financial might of these studios more than ever and how they are refusing to do the real work it takes to put something out that is worthy out dollars. No wonder so many people seek other media sources over theater these days; with ticket cost outrageous, $2 in snacks costing $20 for stale muck, floors your feet stick to when walking and seating that needs a biohazard warning label. I have no idea why people are over the theater experience with such bad movies to boot!","19 out of 25 found this helpful.

She has sounded screechy and devoid of emotions for most parts which is a surprise considering what a fine actress she is.The movie is unbelievably stretched out that it gets to ridiculous proportions as you start praying for the movie to end.The Mockingjay should have been a one part movie but as we all know for commercial interests a 45 minutes plot has been dragged out for two painful hours. Only Jennifer Lawrence has hogged the lion share of screen time while other actors like Woody Harrelson are criminally wasted. The direction lack vision. The editing is probably the weakest part of the movie. The story of the movie can be told in 5 lines and they have made a two hours movie out of this.

The film picks up after the events of Catching Fire, where the story continued with Katniss, our reluctant heroine from District 12 finally becomes the titular head of a growing rebellion against the Capitol through a series of propaganda videos. This time, the film is lesser on the action, explosions or heavy violence and chooses to focus on being a political drama that takes the themes of war and revolution to the next level instead.The Hunger Games has always been a character-driven story filled with meaningful themes by exploring real-world issues about rebellion, politics, conflicts, war, survival that ultimately stands out among the other Young Adult franchises. Katniss' several acts of defiance against the fascist Capitol government during the Hunger Games in the first two films have finally fan the flames of rebellion among the districts of Panem to take back their nation. While the country is on the verge of war, Katniss must also try to find a way to rescue Peeta and the rest of the tributes, who have been taken hostages, tortured and imprisoned by the Capitol.Throughout the years, the franchise has done a great job in showing us that Katniss is truly the Mockingjay - the symbol of hope and rebellion in Panem. The books are written in Katniss' point of view, but the movies have made the effort of showing us other events largely unseen by her to allow us to gain a better understanding of the events that are happening in the film, such as the political meetings or discussions of President Snow or the control room of the games in past films. Mockingjay Part 1 takes time to give us a closer look at the beginnings of war by showing us some details about the uprisings that are taking place in other districts. From the brutal public executions, aerial bombing of cities and threatening speeches by President Snow himself, people are suffering and dying. The film also shows how easily people can be manipulated by media, by showing us that the people of Panem (Capitol and all the other districts) are easily influenced by what they see and hear, especially on TV. However, the ways the Capitol uses media to control all of Panem, it also shows that the rebels can use the same strategy to fight back as well. Both sides is using propaganda as a form of psychological warfare.The film essentially tries to tell the audience that there are no perfect governments or political systems. Political ideologies always fail in reality because of the greed of men who only seek wealth or power. In Mockingjay Part 1, we see how Katniss is being used by the rebel leaders to fight the war. There's even one particular scene where Peeta asks Katniss whether she truly knows the people she's working for, letting us in doubt whether the rebels of District 13 are fighting for the right cause or it's just another Capitol in the making. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence pulls another strong performance as Katniss as she's the one who gets the most character development in this film. With Peeta captured by the Capitol for the entire film, Liam Hemsworth gets more screen time this time for his character, Gale after being left out of the story in the first two films. The film also introduces new characters, especially District 13's rebel leader, President Coin who will soon becomes one of the antagonist that Katniss need to face in Part 2. Elizabeth Banks' character, Effie serves as comic relief this time around, but her character also shows that not all people in the Capitol are vain and oppressive as we think they are.However, Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel like a complete movie and fails to reach the heights of its predecessors. It's the first half of the final book adapted to film, which doesn't really provide any conclusions, it doesn't feel like it has a self-contained plot as none of the character arcs are fully resolved. The film keeps on setting the necessary pieces for the final epic showdown between the districts and Capitol but there's nothing significant happening throughout the film as all the relevant plot twists, the actual fight is in part 2. The film spends most of its time to show us the beginnings of war but couldn't provide further details on why the rebels in District 13 have so many resources and doesn't look malnourished compared with people from other districts. In my opinion, it felt unnecessary to split the final chapter into two parts as many of the scenes actually hurts the pace of the movie. It could be a far better film with a run time of probably 3 hours or so. We are all excited for the story's conclusion and yet we were asked to be patient and wait for next year's Part 2 instead. As the credits roll, I find myself leaving the cinema asking, that's it?Rating: 7/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-hunger-games- mockingjay.html","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I understand some of the reasons for this. Often in a book series, the earlier books include a lot of thoughts and internal conflict in the protagonist, which has to be portrayed by a few carefully selected images in a film. Whereas the last book is often full of actions and it is difficult in a film to decide how to cut any of them. Nevertheless, the film makers should take these hard decisions. The problem with splitting to two movies is that they are inevitably splitting what is in essence a single story. Stories have an important structure. Splitting them destroys this. The first part becomes an introduction and some of the middle. The second part has the rest of the middle and the conclusion. Basically neither have a proper structure. The result is a loss of impact. I have read the books and Mockingjay is a great and thought-provoking finale to the series. The film Mockingjay Part 1 worries me. It wasn't impactful. It didn't even work as a great trailer to part 2. To split this story into two parts has been I think a grave mistake.","17 out of 38 found this helpful.

""SET-UP!!!""If you're hesitant to see Mockingjay because of these claims, understand that they're both reasonable and misleading. Misleading because, if you're not expecting an action-fest, the plot is actually full. There's nothing wrong with the story itself, and the ""poor pacing"" claim is false. Although there are fewer developments here than there are in Catching Fire, they all definitely require the length of time it took them to develop. There are many scenes in this film that are similar to scenes in other good films of the same genre, and most of them elapse the same amount of time.But the claims of uneventfulness are reasonable because its execution is lacking. The movie is actually composed of equal parts subtext, exposition, and action. Meaning that the screenplay routinely cycles a scene that portrays a strong conflict, followed by characters verbally exploring that conflict, and concluding that conflict by taking an action. If the movie was perfect, these parts would have equal weight, because, since the story is less action- oriented than the previous films, the subtext and exposition are more important to creating the story. Unfortunately, the action is shot much better than the exposition is, and the exposition is shot so similarly to the subtext that they swallow one another up.As a small example, in one scene, Katniss attempts to engage in conversation with a character only to learn that he is a mute. You understand why he is a mute immediately, and its significant, and the story immediately becomes weightier and more intense because of this revelation, but the film treats the revelation as though nothing happened. Where other films would have a change in music or lighting or tone or direction to highlight significance, Mockingjay simply continues. Then, a little while later, dialogue is spoken that elaborates on this revelation. The line is delivered well, but because the audience has already picked up on the meaning, the mood that should have been created by this line is dulled. There are a disappointingly large number of sequences like this: a small, signicant development happens, in plot, or character, or overall implication, and it should change the audience's understanding and appreciation for the story - but the film treats it as though everything is progressing, as though it's just another step toward something big happening in an action sequence. The best way to fix this would have been to adapt a more Gary Ross- esque direction style to the non-action scenes - give them a different look, give them their own mood, and leave them room to breathe. Overall, Mockingjay is still a good film, and a very good story. But unfortunately, many of the things that make the story good are buried.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

I think the slower pacing of the characters is very important in this movie, because of all the changes that are happening with every one of them. I like what this movie did to fill in the gaps of what we could know in the book, because we could only see what Katniss saw in the book. It gives me more to look forward to in each movie.

I can say I like this film because I have seen the first two and I know what is going on so I wasn't at all disappointed.One thing I don't like what people are doing with the ""Hunger Games"" films is comparing it with ""Divergent"". I've never seen ""Divergent"", but I know ""The Hunger Games"" isn't like ""Divergent"". I know both of them take place in a post apocalyptic era, but I don't think they are the same. For one, Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) didn't need some played out clichéd macho man helping and guiding her through out the film. Katniss was always able to hold her own. That's one of the things I like about Jennifer Lawrence's character.Now, I know a lot of people saw the first two ""Hunger Games"" films and didn't like this third one, but if you haven't seen the first two films do so before you watch this one and judge it for yourself.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yet, even with all of the bloodletting going on, none of it visualised of course, this movie is a bore from start to finish. It is an illogical bore too. Snow has gone from being a cold but efficiently ruthless ruler to a parody of a dictator deliberately setting up his own downfall. Instead of taking the opportunity to destroy the mockingjay, he decides to play into her hands by wasting a hospital (no spoiler needed as this is clearly shown in the trailer).

The themes of media image, personality and manipulation are still present and this time worked in the context of war propaganda and media warfare, playing a big part in the fight for hearts and minds. The cast is for the most part is excellent, particularly Jennifer Lawrence as the traumatised victim forced to become the face of the rebellion, as her actions in the previous films have had unintended consequences. But Liam Hemsworth as Gale was very stiff compared to the rest of the cast, not being able to match their standards.There are changes from the novel, some are simply cutting out the fat like the hunting and the daily regimen of living and showing some scenes that we did not get to see in the novel. There are a few moments added to intense tension to scenes and a few characters replace other ones: but on the whole Part 1 is mostly faithful adaptation of the first half of the novel.Director Francis Lawrence continue to be a solid director with the exploring of the ruins of District 12 being very haunting and the big action sequence, showing the war. But the portrayal of President Coin (Julianne Moore) was not shown to be as a cold or hostile to Katniss as she was in the novel, saving it for the fourth film. This is a minor issue but I pictured Coin wearing her hair in the bun. James Newton Howard raises his game and gives us the best music score in the series so far.Mockingjay Part 1 is a solid film that fans of the series will be pleased with.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

"","","Exists To Only Set The Stage For The Finale","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3206527/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2015","While the splitting of the final novel in the Harry Potter film series was more than justified by the adaptations that followed, it also gave these major Hollywood studios another idea of how to milk any franchise for all its worth, thus resulting in few unnecessary expansions of final chapters of many other franchises into two films & The Hunger Games series is the latest to join this particular league.While I wasn't completely won over by the first two films in this franchise & watched them with half-hearted interest, the films weren't as terrible as I expected. Both instalments did make up for some nice lightweight entertainment & fabulously exhibited the screen power of Jennifer Lawrence but the only reason why The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 exists is to set up the stage for the upcoming finale.Set after the events of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Part 1 continues the story of Katniss Everdeen who finds herself in District 13 after being rescued from the 75th Hunger Games arena which she destroyed in the last chapter. Very much aware of the mass riots that has risen against the Capitol, Everdeen reluctantly agrees to become the symbol of rebellion in order to unite all districts against one enemy & also tries to rescue Peeta from his captivity.Directed by Francis Lawrence, Mockingjay - Part 1 lacks many elements that made the first two instalments click so well. The action is very much missing here, the story feels longer than its actual runtime, nothing much happens in the movie plot-wise & it's pretty evident that the idea of splitting it into two parts was indeed a stupid move. Jennifer Lawrence still delivers another fine performance while the contribution from both Julianne Moore & Philip Seymour Hoffman is a welcome one.On an overall scale, there isn't much to talk about The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 for it's a definite downgrade in almost all aspects when compared to its predecessors, carries over the usual political themes of the series but never does anything with it, is predictable from start to finish, is stretched beyond its threshold point & even has Lawrence exhibiting signs of weariness in her given role. Easily the weakest of the three instalments so far, Mockingjay - Part 1 may not be a worthy sequel but it nonetheless succeeds in setting the stage for the grand finale.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Then again, maybe I don't mind because I've already read the books and know how the story will end. For the record: I have yet to watch a movie based on a book I've read and found it better. None have even come close to being almost as good, except for The Hunger Games trilogy. And since Suzanne Collins' writing is simply amazing, a film adaptation that's almost as good is definitely a great achievement. (Note: I have to exclude the first movie from this praise because I found it a bit disappointing.) For fear of turning this into a book review, I'll be brief. the author of this trilogy is no doubt talented. she covered the subject matter beautifully and managed to make it exciting and appealing to both teens and adults. The character development in her books makes them believable, and makes you feel like you personally know them. I'd definitely advise everyone to read the books, and to watch the movies by extension. It'll be time well spent.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

She meets President Coin who convinces her to be the symbol of rebellion, while trying to save Peeta from the Capitol.Producers are making money with the saga so why not split one book into two movies? Twilight did it, Harry Potter did it and The Hunger Games is doing it as well. I am not a huge fan of the first Hunger Games movie, but I loved Catching Fire. It was a very smooth and well directed movie by Francis Lawrence; who is taking over once again for MockingJay. At the end of Catching Fire you were literally burning to see Katniss and everyone go against the Capitol and kill them all. Actually I was pumped to see what will happen. Unfortunately, MockingJay Part 1 is just an extended trailer for Part 2, nothing interesting and relevant happen until the last 20 minutes of the movie. They are trying to stretch the events of one book into several movies but the thing is that even the tiny details are not that interesting and exciting to watch. This film deals with how you run a rebellion against an evil empire, giving endless political and motivational speeches, this on purpose to be filmed for propaganda. It's not enough to keep the viewers check in through the whole run time of the film. However, I liked the fact that this film takes The Hunger Games to another level as you have to think things through all this propaganda and point of views, the political intrigue is good. It approaches the story and The Hunger Games world from another angle, different from the first two movies. Nonetheless, the shaky cam is back from the first movie and there is not much action aside this trailer scene where Katniss is shooting an arrow to a jet. Jennifer Lawrence is obviously a fantastic actress and gives a great performance once again but coming back to the first movie I don't see how Katniss' character grows, matures and learns anything. She is the exact same character she was in the last one and the one before. Consequently you don't get to catch the interest of the viewers with a main character, this added to a movie where nothing really happen, the viewers are checked out pretty quickly. In fact, all the performances are very good, the drama is very well done but the characters who are actually interesting don't get to do anything beside sitting around, talking and give speeches. For instance there is a really tense scene in which Gale, starring Liam Hemsworth, explains how District 12 has been destroyed and how he could have done something more to help people to survive. This scene is also dealing with his relationship with Katniss, and you get to see that Gale's character is really deep and interesting but in reality you don't care about him that much. Finally, in the last 20 minutes of the film I was relieved to watch the proper movie beginning and building tension for the big finale, but then, it ends.Overall, MockingJay Part 1 is a well directed and good looking movie filled with potentially awesome things that never really reach the proper core of the film, nothing really mesmerising happen throughout the run time.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Considering the lukewarm reaction to the final novel 'Mockingjay' by Suzanne Collins and the less than encouraging history of film adaptions being split into more than one film (Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hobbit), the odds weren't exactly in this penultimate chapter's favour. However, two years on, it looks like director Francis Lawrence defied the odds and Lionsgate has another winner. 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1′ is the most daring, thought-provoking, rawest, darkest yet humorous film in the Hunger Games franchise filled with powerful performances from its new and returning cast members as well as an intelligently and beautifully written screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong.The film immediately opens to a powerful and haunting scene, mainly due to Jennifer Lawrence's stunning portrayal of our heroine Katniss Everdeen, that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Katniss is no longer forcing smiles in flaming dresses or dropped into a televised reality game show wearing latex wet suits all designed to appeal and appease the Capitol audiences, she's now hidden underground in the bleak and gray District 13, a district that months prior, none of the characters even knew had still existed since its 'alleged' obliteration during 'The Dark Days'.One of the biggest surprises is that 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ doesn't feel like a 'Hunger Games' film that we've come to know in the previous two installments, more so than how many felt about the third book to the previous two books before it. It almost feels like a complete reboot of the entire franchise. The film is almost entirely set in District 13; besides the short but poignant visits to District 12, 8 and little cutaways to scenes outside of Katniss's perspective in the Capitol, 5, 7 and 11. There are no more ""games"" – which means no more reapings, no more chariots, or any of that lead up. Mockingjay has well and truly reinvented the franchise to reveal what 'The Hunger Games' series at its core is really all about and gives us a shocking and horrifying portrayal of war in Panem and how media manipulation is used through the use of propaganda videos (""propos"") in battle to control the populous.The film's split was not a problem at all. Out of the three novels in the Hunger Games series, 'Mockingjay' was easily the novel that required a split to fully flesh out the characters and to give justice to their arcs. There is a clear objective at the beginning of the film, laid out by our heroine and by the end, that objective is solved but also sets up another plot line that will most definitely be followed up on in next year's final chapter 'Mockingjay – Part 2′. The way the creative team are handling the split feels slightly like a television show – you get 24 episodes in a season, and that is usually split into two with a mid season break in between. Part 1 ends with a bang, it has a conclusion and resolution, but you know the story isn't over just yet.Overall, 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ manage to overcomes its obstacles to become another dark, epic and very chapter in the unstoppable 'Hunger Games' franchise. The film will surely make back its entire budget for both films alone within the first week of release alone. If 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ is anything to go by, than next year's 'Mockingjay – Part 2′ will be an absolute treat as we follow Katniss and her squad in their final journey to stop the Capitol. And I can't freaking wait.","35 out of 57 found this helpful.

The film takes off where the last one ended and works as a build-up for what is to come in Part 2. Though the film works as a ""bridge"" it is quite engaging with its 2- hour runtime and does enough to keep the audience entertained.The film works great as an adaptation because I felt the imagery of the film was almost identical to those I had made myself reading the book. This is something of a rarity, though I believe it is recurrent in the previous two instalments as well. As to potential errors with the transition from book to film, none were worth noting as far as I am concerned. The avid book fans will not be disappointed in other words.Probably the single strongest selling point in ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is Jennifer Lawrence. She gives an overall good performance and though it is worth noting that this is not her best role till date, there are moments wherein she shines. Had Ms Lawrence been given more material with which to work, I am sure she would have taken opportune advantage of it. Additionally Liam Hemsworth in the role as Gale Hawthorne struck me as heartfelt and believable. The only casting choice I draw in question is Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin. I thought she gave a bland performance and I think the film would have benefited from another actress in her stead.Although I liked the film, and thought Francis Lawrence did a decent job, I definitely believe that this is the weakest link in the series. The film does suffer from a lack of content that could have been averted by merging parts 1 & 2 in a longer cut. Some of the ""propos""- scenes were quite awkward at times although I grant they felt awkward reading too. Also, to my annoyance Ms Lawrence had a scene or two where her acting felt very forced and where I thought low credibility was being conveyed. This left me slightly less impressed by her acting in this particular film, but I thought she did a great job overall notwithstanding the flaws as aforementioned.""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is an entertaining teen film that will provide readers of the books with an accurate and satisfying rendering, and others that have not with a slight sense of disappointment perhaps. I enjoyed ""Mockingjay"" quite a lot, and although I acknowledge that it has its flaws, I would still recommend it. To call it one of the years best would be an overstatement, but it is however worth looking into.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Julianne Moore as Madam president is so beautiful she is distracting in a good way. The story on how a heroic heart of an ordinary girl with compassion to her fellowmen and how it inspires many to stand up against abuse of power and dictatorship is inspiring in itself.

"8","/10","More deliberately-paced than its predecessors, this penultimate chapter is still tense and gripping as an intimate character study and a smart political allegory on revolution","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3126884/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","18 November 2014","With the shot of an arrow, Katniss Everdeen demolished the annual Hunger Games and set in motion a rebellion that may very well overthrow the totalitarian rule of the Capitol which has held sway over the people in twelve Districts for the past 75 years. But to get to that point of the struggle, Katniss needs to be transformed from a survivor into an icon, a symbol that would come to represent what the revolution stands for in order to rally the people from the Districts to come forth from fear and join in the armed struggle.Opinion will certainly be divided whether the concluding book in Suzanne Collins' 'Hunger Games' trilogy should have been split into two movies, but unlike other similarly cleaved YA-franchises, the verdict is very much clearer in this case whether 'Mockingjay' merits that split. By leaving the inevitable showdown between the rebels and the Capitol for another film, this prelude instead leaves enough breathing room for itself to be an intimately sombre character study of Katniss, the reluctant heroine from District 12 who over the course of two years of her life and two iterations of the to-the-death bloodsport found herself in a position to become a leader of a cause, but at a tremendous price not just personally but also collaterally.Even though the Games are done, Katniss remains the traumatised centre of this penultimate chapter. Her rescuer, Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman), and the leader of the rebel cause, District 13's President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), want Katniss to be the star of a series of propaganda videos (or ""propos""), but as her former mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) shrewdly observes, Katniss has never done well following orders. Instead, her transformation would have to come from within, and this is in fact her two-hour coming-of-age story.Wisely choosing not to antagonise rabid fans of Collins' books, screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong (both newcomers to the franchise) remain thoroughly faithful to the book. From a solo visit to District 12 to see firsthand what is left of it to another tour of the equally ravaged District 8 where the dead, the dying and the starving are crammed in the same makeshift hospital, Katniss' witness of the extent of Snow's brutality and her empathy for its victims will eventually fuel her fire to rage defiance against the Capitol's President Snow (Donald Sutherland). But Snow has his own spokesman – Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), her fellow tribute from District 12 and no less than her lover; Peeta is Snow's weapon against Katniss, 'hijacked' by Snow and put on Capitol TV to plead with Katniss to back down.Not like in the Games, Katniss' trials here are more psychological than physical, so those expecting the same straightforward page- turning thrills of 'Catching Fire' will probably be quite disappointed. Gone is the colourful world of the Games, and in its place an austere subterranean environment where everyone dresses in boiler suits and even the formerly flamboyant Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) has to forgo her wigs and make-up. That change of pace and place isn't however a bad thing at all, for it does allow us the space and time to fully appreciate the emotional depth of Jennifer Lawrence's acting.More than in the other two films, Lawrence is simply tremendous here, conveying so many different shades within the same character – vulnerability as evidenced by how quickly she is seized by helplessness when she sees Peeta on TV, doubt in the her wariness towards President Coin and her spin doctor Plutarch, but most importantly her fierce determination when she turns towards the camera and delivers a personal message to Snow: ""if we burn, you burn with us"". Lawrence has always been the beating heart of this dystopian saga, and by letting Katniss' bow and arrow take a backseat to her emotional struggles, this chapter sees Lawrence deliver her most soulful, stirring and storm-raging performance yet.She finds plenty of support in similar acting heavyweights Moore, Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Sutherland. Such an ensemble may seem out of place in a YA- franchise, but their participation also indicates their confidence in the material. There is rich political subtext here about waging a revolution, not simply in military strategy but also in a more significant battle of the minds, wills and hearts. It was an inspired choice for Strong to be chosen as screenwriter – his previous work on HBO's 'Recount and 'Game Change' as well as last year's 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' certainly reveals his proclivities – and thankfully, returning director Francis Lawrence grasps the nuances in Strong's adaptation acutely and assuredly.He may not be the Lawrence in front of the camera, but this Lawrence behind it guides the proceedings with poise and élan, confidently balancing the action and politics while finding just the right tone that never comes across too heavy-handed on either tragedy or melodrama, managing to even insert some moments of levity (courtesy of Effie and Haymitch). The opening half hour could be tighter, but once the film gets into its stride, you'll find it just as gripping as the earlier films, in particular a daring raid under the cover of darkness into the heart of the Capitol's Tribute Centre to rescue the victors of the Games – most prominently Peeta.It does necessarily end on a cliffhanger, but this mid-sentence pause feels much more organic than say that of the 'Harry Potter' or 'Twilight' series. If you've just wanted a wham-bang thriller, then we say go re-watch 'Catching Fire'; indeed, Collins' trilogy was never meant to be just that. Without resorting to any voiceovers, this deliberately-paced but no less engrossing chapter retains the book's first-person, present-tense perspective of Katniss while losing none of the political allegory that Collins had intended from the very start. It may not catch fire, but it is a slow-burner that nonetheless captivates, enthralls and thrills.","31 out of 50 found this helpful.

Considering their YA roots, the previous cinematic incarnations had wowed due to their success in delivering exhilarating action alongside, rather than in place of, narrative smarts and maturity. Unfortunately, with the bulk of the action seemingly saved for the second entry (out next November), Mockingjay Part 1 is all work and no play, making it slightly dull compared to the excellent pair of films it has followed. It's also tonally darker and dramatically heavier, with the story venturing into super- serious territory and focussing on themes of death, loss and guilt. Returning director Francis Lawrence has a firm grip on this world though and, together with cinematographer Jo Willems, continues to craft an interesting look and feel to PanAm – both the gloriously pompous Capitol and the grubby, downtrodden districts aligning for an uprising. The whole cast is exceptional yet again: Jennifer Lawrence is a force to be reckoned with as the fiery Katniss, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore bring their usual gravitas as high- ranking members of the rebellion, Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson draw out some humour among the grimness, and Josh Hutcherson makes the most of his relatively limited screen time as Capitol puppet Peeta. There's just not enough pulse-rising adventure to elevate this to the high standards already established in the series, an especially disappointing flaw when taking into account some of the awesome set pieces concocted in the preceding instalments. It's a shame it can't truly excel as its own movie, however Mockingjay Part 1 is still a solid flick that succeeds in tiding over fans until the big finale next year.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The film had a great sense of pacing and storytelling while introducing us to the Capitol and the other districts and not just focusing on the actual Hunger Games. I thought it was a much better film than the first, but I still loved them both. They ended up in my list of the best films for the year in which they were released, so my expectations for this third film were huge considering Lawrence was back in the director's chair. I still had some concerns about adapting the final book in two parts because the first parts didn't work too well with the Twilight and Harry Potter franchises. My concerns turned out to be true because I did have a similar issue with Mockingjay Part 1. The entire film felt stretched, focusing on small details that didn't do much to build the tension of the story. It actually hurt the pacing of the film that the director had worked so well with in the previous installment. This first part felt like a slow build-up and a giant filler to what will come next in the grand finale, so I couldn't help but feel let down by what Francis Lawrence had to offer. I still enjoyed Mockingjay, but it doesn't live up to its predecessors. Mockingjay is a huge departure from the previous films. There are no Hunger Games and very little action scenes here, while there is a lot of exposition and preparation for what is to come. The previous films worked as a social commentary on reality TV, while this one focuses more on advertising. Catching Fire allowed us into the Capitol where we got a glimpse of who the real enemy was, but in Mockingjay we don't see what is actually going on in the Capitol and everything takes place mostly in District 13 where a big revolution is uprising. What all three films do have in common is the strong lead performance from Jennifer Lawrence who holds everything in place and keeps us engaged with this dystopian world Collins has introduced us to. When certain scenes in Mockingjay began to feel tedious or drag out a bit too long, Lawrence's Katniss reminded us why we are tagging along with this franchise. She literally is the symbol of hope for the rebellion as much as she is for the franchise. This film is more political than the previous ones and we are introduced to a lot of propaganda (not just as a build-up for the next film, but actual propaganda as the Capital and District 13 try to smear each other's credibility). The political intrigue plays out as a sort of chess game where one side tries to outdo the other. This was done really well here, but the problem was that it became repetitive, and that is where I felt the story was incredibly stretched out.Jennifer Lawrence has some great scenes in this film, and others that felt a bit cheesy (the nightmares for example), but during a scene where she sends a message to President Snow she gave me goose- bumps. I also enjoyed the scene where she sings ""the hanging tree"" lullaby. Those were the moments that drew me back to the film and reminded me why I loved this franchise in the first place. I am sure the second part of this film will work better, but the slow build-up didn't do much for me here. I missed some of the characters that I had learned to love and that only got a few minutes of screen time here. Haymitch and Caesar provided some of the much needed comic relief in the previous films, but here everything becomes political and serious and there is little room for them. Effie is perhaps the character who comes out better this time around and Elizabeth Banks nails the role once again. The new characters didn't do much for me and despite the fact that Liam Hemsworth gets much more screen time as Gale he doesn't do much either. Claflin's role as Finnick is nowhere as nearly interesting as it was in Catching Fire. Phillip Seymour Hoffman brings class once again to his role and he also stood out for me, while Josh Hutcherson shows much more range as Peeta here despite the very little screen time he's given. So despite having a lot of interesting characters in the franchise, they really don't get to do anything interesting in Mockingjay. Of course, the film ends with a teaser and we will all return for the grand finale despite the slow build-up because enough time has been spent on these characters and we care for them.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. And then Catching Fire really surprised me with where it took the series, ending with perhaps one of the best twists from last year. And the cycle continues to repeat itself, in the very best of ways, with Mockingjay - Part 1.What I love about this entry to The Hunger Games franchise, and what might turn some people off about this movie, is that it takes us out of the games and into the resistance. And I thought it was really cool what they gave us, and how they explored the build-up of this rebellion against the Capitol. I also enjoyed seeing what they've done with Katniss' character, showing how she is losing grip of her mental state and could lose it at any moment. It was nice to see her vulnerability in those moments, but it was also sweet to see her become a member a symbol of the resistance and take on that responsibility. She has her motivational moments and they are really effective, even to the point where you would want to fight with her. And I felt that Jennifer Lawrence gave an incredible performance (as per usual).One thing I noticed also is that this movie wasn't the most action- packed of the franchise, but it never bothered me because the intensity was so high. This had me on the edge my seat from beginning to end, and really took the franchise to what I think is at its best so far. Of course don't take that as there is no action in here. There's plenty to keep you going and there are some pretty sweet moments found here.There are also some noteworthy performances from Julianna Moore, Elizabeth Banks, and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (they put a tribute to him at the end credits of the movie, which was nice to see). It was also nice to see where they took the character of Peeta, which I won't spoil here but let's just say it will definitely be a shock. And I was surprised at the fact that the ending felt like it had some sort of resolution while still pumping you up for the next installment, which I'm sure is going to be one heck of a finale.Overall, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part I continues to lead The Hunger Games down the path that has made it so successful so far. It's intense, engaging, has some really great performances that I wasn't expecting, and I liked how it was able to keep us invested without having to rely on the anxiety of the games. It sucks that we have to wait another year to see the next one, but for now The Hunger Games continues to get better and better, and it shows no signs of stopping.","22 out of 34 found this helpful.

I thought the first book was overrated and the first movie was a piece of garbage. I thought the second book was surprisingly well written and the movie was excellent. I thought the last book was fine and the ending was just awful. Although I like things about the Hunger Games, I was also very reluctant (and still kind of am in a way) to buy into the whole series. Although I liked the second movie, I was really reluctant to see the new Hunger Games movie. For some reason I just do not like the legions of fans and the hype it generates. I kind of feel like a hypocrite here, but I really cannot deny the excellence of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part One. There is all this dreck geared towards teens likes Divergent and Vampire Academy, etc. If you are one of those people (you know who you are) who always says all of these movies are terrible (as they are) and wish that teens and audiences alike were treated with more respect by Hollywood, here is your movie. This movie depends on not much action action and virtually no dumb relationships but on human interaction, startlingly mature and graphic content, and the surprisingly realistic depiction of revolution through quiet and subtle direction from Francis Lawrence. Whereas the Hunger Games themselves were the driving force of the other movies, this movie takes a lot time and has a more adult approach to material and it is hardly boring, in fact it is engrossing. I was hooked from beginning to end. Talk about a chilling ending brrrrr.It delivers on every level. Media goddess Jennifer Lawerence does not ham it up with a freakout scene and does a great job. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (sadly in his last role) gives a really solid performance along as does the usually annoying Julianne Moore. In fact, everyone in the film is in top form. Also, how could you not love how intensely over-the-top evil Donald Sutherland is? Screenplay is great, directing is great, special effects is great, cinematography is great, shall I go on? This movie is just a great surprise. This movie is thought provoking, disturbing, and not completely crowd pleasing and that is part of why it is really great. Regardless of my liking of the second movie, the first and second Hunger Game movies were still seen by tweens saying, ""Is it Peeta or Gale? Who does she love. oooooooo!!!!!"", yet this is just a great film on it's own. I cannot say it enough times. I applaud this movie for blowing my expectations out of the water and delivering what may be one of this year's best film's. Movies like this and Dawn of The Planet of The Apes are proof that Hollywood is able to produce well-made and intelligent films. Please explain Transformers 4 then?Sadly, this film is like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows and Part Two is just a bloodbath. Will not be as well made and emotional (maybe I am getting to pretentious here), but whatever, but I am glad I saw this and I absolutely recommend it.","23 out of 36 found this helpful.

I assume that when Harry Potter did it, they were struggling with a way of resuming too many important details in 2 hours. 3 tops. From then on, screenwriters have done the opposite, which is focusing in the not so important details of the book to make a 6 hour script and 《then》being able to make two separate movies. In this case it was fairly evident. The scenes were slow at many points, too many longer than necessary dialogs and sequences. (Like Katniss repeatedly singing her symbol song, Katniss and Gale going hunting, and Katniss repeating at least 10 times ""President Snow, can you hear me?""). The movie can be resumed in the capitol being a bunch of corrupt mother f***ers and the districts rising against them with Katniss as their symbol. Most of the most exciting action sequences in the movie didn't even occur around the main characters and the ones that did, were not ones that put them in a difficult enough situation to keep the audience rooting for them on the edge of their seat. Basically, it becomes just a transition movie, unlike many other movies made out of extracts of a book, it doesn't count with a strong beginning, middle and end. It turns out pretty much flat and the inflection points throughout the film could have come out a lot stronger to keep the audience interested.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

""Twilight"" dominated the box office for its run while ""Harry Potter"" brought in more money than they knew what to do with. ""The Hunger Games"" took on a new phase of the genre, appealing to not only the young people it so desperately needed for box office results, but keeping the older viewers/parents of these movie-goers interested. The next installment of the franchise, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,"" is a purely entertaining set piece for what will likely be a most intriguing finale.The obvious quarrel with the film is the splitting into two separate movies. ""Harry Potter"" coined this tactic with ""The Deathly Hallows,"" breaking them into two films to maximize box office potential. ""Twilight"" soon followed with ""Breaking Dawn."" This installment is probably the least bloated out of any of the franchises seen yet. It feels legitimately focused on the development of the characters and the surroundings they are now inhabiting.Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss from a whole new perspective. The film takes place just a short time after the events of ""Catching Fire."" Katniss is living in District 13, angry and in despair after losing Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in Quarter Quell. To add, Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has revealed that District 12 has been destroyed. Only 950 of 10,000 survived the raid and Katniss is asked to be the face of the revolution that is now rising against the Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland). When Peeta is revealed to be alive and being held in the Capitol, Katniss must wage war against Snow, with the rebels, and try desperately to save Peeta.Lawrence continues to develop Katniss and bring us on her journey with a believable and authentic nature. Katniss is very broken in this installment, weakened by the events that preceded her, and Lawrence executes it just about flawlessly. The real surprise, is how effective Hutcherson and Hemsworth are this time around. Their roles are expanded, and they are offered an opportunity to showcase some very real and heartbreaking moments. Especially Hutcherson, who sheds all the annoyance he embodied in the first film, and brings a new life and lust to his eyes. I was quite taken by what he was doing and where's going.the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-sliceDonald Sutherland is a fantastic villain. The ying to Katniss' yang, the two are practically in an abusive love affair and it works tremendously. They're the two opposite spectrums of this new world where war rages on and the dead are not necessarily the unlikely ones. Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman are equally amazing in good measure of their respective roles. The pinnacle of the performers, and has been for this entire franchise is Elizabeth Banks. As Effie, she's embodied a soul plucked from her normal environment and thrust into the battle grounds of something she doesn't fully understand. Her appearances are both funny but impeccably warm. I hope people notice how vital and important she's been to the franchise, which should lead her to more vital and vivacious roles in the future.Francis Lawrence makes artistic choices that keep the audience at arm's length. Some of it is deliberate to hide things I'm sure we will know in the next installment. Some of it, is deathly obvious, bringing suspicion and tension to characters we know are going to be forces to be reckoned with. For the most part, everything is standard filmmaking. Something as massively popular as this needs to be to get the widest audience possible. I do wonder if that wasn't the focus on Lionsgate, and if they attempted to be more gritty with the material, show the destruction and blood of the people, and go up to an 'R' rating, if this isn't elevated significantly? Can only wonder.Overall, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is very satisfying. Setting the chess pieces of what is destined to be an epic finale, it's one of the best things you can bring your family these upcoming weeks leading to the holiday season. I took my 14-year-old niece to see it, and she emphatically expressed ""Oh my God! It was amazing!""

"7","/10","A change of tone from the first two, but gripping and engaging nonetheless","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3133749/?ref_=tt_urv","david-meldrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32106619/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 2014","It's a tough gig adapting much-loved books for the screen, especially if the one you're dealing with is generally seen as the weakest in an overwhelmingly popular series. That's the ground we are on with this, the third of the Hunger Games movies. The third and final book in the trilogy seems to be the least regarded by fans (I haven't read them myself); and with the now almost inevitable decision having been taken to split the final story into two films, one could argue that the film-makers have made a rod for their own backs.I really liked both of the first films. They were witty, exciting, disturbing and though treading similar ground managed to deal with sufficiently different narrative and thematic material to suggest to effect a meaningful progression between the two. This third film marks a narrative departure: there's no central motif of gladiator-style combat-as-entertainment to build central action sequences around. Instead, we're in the territory where a Katniss-fronted revolution is being plotted whilst Peeta remains behind in the Captiol, apparently manipulated into being a spokesperson for the Big Brother style-regime. Instead of intense action thriller we have what amounts to an intense and involving political thriller, this time taking the politicising of the media into its satirical and thematic spotlight. There's good action sequences as well, but this isn't an action movie in the sense of the other two.That's where disappointment may kick in for some viewers. It's a big call for a major franchise like this one to change its tone so drastically mid-stream; I can't think of another major series of films that makes such an obvious leap. Without emotional investment in the source, I was utterly compelled by it – I remained swept up in the dystopian wold of the film; Jennifer Lawrence's central performance remains a strong, engaging and layered one; the supporting players are all decent, with a special poignant mention for the characteristically studied depth of Philip Seymour Hoffman.When the film does need to move into action sequences, it does so very well – the last major such passage being a standout, effectively inter-cut with dialogue and character. Therein lies these films' consistent strengths; these are blockbusters aimed at the vaunted young adult market which prove a timeless truth – that if a film (or book, or music, or) is constructed with enough intelligence and substance, there's no limiting the market. If this has lost the shock value of the first two films' central ideas, it's gained space to breathe and worm into the consciousness. We'll only be able to really judge if splitting the last instalment in two has worked this time next year; for now this may be the least immediately powerful of the three so far, but it's by no means a dip in the quality of the series.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A good set-up to the impending action.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3133557/?ref_=tt_urv","garcalej","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56677665/?ref_=tt_urv","30 November 2014","I will admit, I was one among the many of the skeptics who, upon hearing that the third installment of the trilogy had been split into two multiplex sized chunks, heard the tell-tale ka-ching of the cash register going off in my head. It is not an unwarranted fear; there have been prior offenders, Peter Jackson and David Yates coming directly to mind. The same charge could have been leveled at Francis Lawrence had he wasted all the extra sand in his hourglass on maudlin handholding scenes shamelessly geared toward the film's core young female demographic. As it happens, there is indeed plenty of maudlin to go around in Mockinjay, Part 1, though nothing that left as bad a taste as those five surreal minutes Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson spent alone in that tent dancing awkwardly to music six decades their senior. That said, there are also just enough scenes to redeem the movie and perhaps even justify the extra hour and half of story, which veers uninhibitedly towards its dystopian roots. We find Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, who has expanded her repertoire from glowering teenager to shivering, emotional wreck) recently rescued from the wreckage of the Quarter Quell to serve Panem's revolution, which in spite of whatever Gill Scott-Heron once said will almost certainly be televised, and with Katniss front and center. Propaganda and its malfeasant uses, after all, are sort of the main underlying themes of Suzanne Collin's books. In the first two installments, we followed in the footsteps of Katniss and fellow tribute Peeta Malark (Josh Hutcherson), as they were trotted out as show ponies in the Capitol's increasingly desperate attempts to control the masses under their boot heel. Mockingjay finds Katniss handed off to the other team like a football and treated with much the same callow disregard for her underlying humanity. One can forgive Lawrence's character for not noticing; she spends much of the film in what appears to be a permanent state of shell-shock, albeit mostly over the fate of Peeta rather than the horrific genocide of most of her friends and neighbors, which lets face it, starts to get grating rather quickly, especially as the bodies begin to pile up around her fashionably sensible boots.The emotional claustrophobia is enhanced by the fact that much of the film takes place underground and centers around the propaganda war that has taken nearly as much importance as the actual fighting. Such a story you'd think would set the stage for some spectacular outbursts and tension between Katniss and her new handlers, but instead Lawrence seems content to sleepwalk through the usual motions and pine after her former teammate. Thankfully, there are points in the film when she and her camera crew are forced to go outside and witness the horrors full hand, and it is in these moments that the story goes from being typical opera to becoming dangerously relevant. In Collin's dyspeptic worldview, the sickening realities of the modern battlefield become yet another theatre production, though whereas the Capitol used our instinct for bloody voyeurism to keep us entertained and compliant, District 13 uses it much the same way Syrian insurgents use YouTube to whip up their supporters and with much the same outcome. The rebels, far from following the heroic cliché of the peasant soldier throwing off an oppressor, quickly become objects of pity in their all-too-willingness to throw themselves lemming-like at forces far better armed simply after watching one of Katniss' videotaped tirades. The film is good in that sense, but there are still plenty of things that keep it from being really good or great. Despite two installments in which to grow his character, Gale (played by Liam Hemsworth) has not yet progressed beyond having the personality of an AXE commercial, and Josh Hutchison does little better as Peeta, though his character's woodiness can be subscribed too having been held at gunpoint for most of the film. Many of the series' veterans, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Jeffrey Wright, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, retain a respectable but subdued screen presence. They are joined by Julianne Moore playing President Coin, who doesn't quite ooze the same villainy as Donald Sutherland's President Snow (or much of anything else for that matter), though this could simply be because she has yet to take off her mask. For now, she's resigned to holding daily pep rallies and uttering such messianic phrases as ""democracy"" and ""sharing the fruits of our labor"" in front of a giant screen, all the while sitting atop a stockpile of missiles, bullets, and thousands of fighting age youths who all dress in the same olive-gray jumpsuits.Should get interesting, but for now, the film leaves us waiting patiently in the bunker for the real showdown to begin.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

My first thoughts towards it were quite negative. Then I had to think of the film coming from the standpoint that it is, after all, a lead up to the grand finale, hence the Part 1. But then I came to the conclusion that whether viewed as a standalone or set-up film, Mockingjay - Part 1 fails to meet the high expectations set by its predecessors, leaving a juggernaut series deprived of its power.As a lead up to the (hopefully) bigger and better Part 2, Mockingjay - Part 1's job is simple: deliver an exciting film that builds the series' current momentum forward and creates mass anticipation for the eventual finale. At the end of the day, Part 1 doesn't meet that goal. Not only was it borderline boring but more importantly, my high anticipation for the final chapter of this series has been heavily damaged. I was far and away more excited to see Part 1 following Catching Fire than I am for Part 2 following Part 1, and in a two part film finale, that's exactly what you don't want.Let's talk about the actual movie a bit. We pick up right where Catching Fire left off. Lead character Katniss Everdeen as been chosen to be the face of a revolution against the tyrant Capitol and the movie makes it seem like all Hell is going to break lose. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the film suffers from being slow, shallow and uneventful. Too often does the movie trap itself in sluggish scenes while trying to make the audience care about the mass conflict between the Capitol and Rebellion. Any momentum the movie picks up is almost immediately shot down by another slow, heart-felt seen about being sad or angry at the past or at the present situation. The pacing of the film is that of a disjointed sloth, leaving little to zero space for the viewer to become eager for the next scene. All of this makes the movie seem like it's stretching itself way too thin, making you wonder if a two part film was even necessary in the first place. Action is scarce, something that is undeniably critical to create success for The Hunger Games name. I mean, Katniss fired ONE arrow the entire movie. Not exactly the idea of exhilarating. There are a few intense action scenes, but they're often too quick to get excited about. One clear downfall of Part 1 is it's lack of an actual Hunger Games. While I understand that the story bases from the book and may not exactly be the fault of the writers, what sets the series apart from others is The Hunger Games themselves. Now that you take that away, it just becomes another action film which happens to use past Hunger Games as a background. In terms of overall story arc, it doesn't hurt as badly because of the continuing development of the franchises's story. But in terms of the immediate story and the film's enjoy-ability, the absence of the franchise's most dynamic feature hurts. When it comes to action and intensity, Part 1 talks the talk, but certainly doesn't walk the walk.Jennifer Lawrence is now the glue holding this once great cast together. After having such words of praise for the film's cast in Catching Fire, most of the major players didn't seem to bring their A game for Part 1. Outside of Lawrence, I still deeply enjoyed the performances of Donald Sutherland as antagonist President Snow and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom the film was dedicated to. But unlike the earlier entries in the series, they same cannot be said for Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson and especially newcomer Julianne Moore as President Coin, who never captures the essence of her character's power and influence. For most of the cast, it was almost as if they were just dragging through the movie, like they were saying ""get on to Part 2 all ready"". This seems to be partially due to a poorly written script. Luckily Lawrence saves the day with another wonderful performance and stops the entire cast from completely nose-diving.The positives are still there, if minimal. Along with the acting of Lawrence, Sutherland and Hoffman, as a set-up film Part 1 does get some things right. Although dull, the character development and charisma between the characters grows deeper so when Part 2 comes along, we'll all ready known who everyone is and what they stand for. Some new characters are welcome additions, and though unexplored in Part 1, the background was set up nicely for Part 2 to blow people's minds.Some people say it was all for the second half and that you have to look past the minimal action and slow pacing. But my mind has been set. The painfully sluggish pacing, dismal scenes of unexciting dialogue, lack of hardly any action and overall poor acting puts the fire right out for this massive franchise. It may be blowing up the box office, but make no mistake, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is like a joke with no punch line; it's half-hearted and leaves you wanting more.5.5/10","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

Kateniss is the hero, but I'm not sure how she connects to the evils that are being perpetrated. Donald Sutherland's character is utterly rotten. But what is it he wants. I mean, is he getting any enjoyment out of his power other than to have it. I know history is dotted with megalomaniacs like this, but what will the world be. This part is filled with self- doubt and uncertainty. I fear that the power shift is like most (like the French Revolution) when evil trumps evil and we end up with evil.

When the first one came out I knew nothing about it except that the books were quite popular. Needless to say my first viewing of the first one I enjoyed it a lot but also was disturbed that it was considered a story for young adults. Now skip ahead and I loved Catching Fire and for me Mockingjay part 1 is every bit as good as Catching Fire in its own ways. It may not have the action that made the first 2 such good movies but where it lacks in action it makes up for with excellent acting and a compelling story. The war is beginning and the finale looks to be glorious. This is a dark and morose movie. You wont find hardly any smiles and very few laughs but thats not a bad thing. We are being thrust into a world where the Government is corrupt and a civil war is brewing, it would seem odd if it wasn't occasionally if not mostly depressing. But its not the kind of depressing that is going to make you leave the theater sad, no its going to make you leave the theater hungry for more. I care so much for these characters that I am finding myself heavily invested in their struggle. Katniss is in a dark place in this movie as she finds herself the reluctant symbol of the rebellion against the Capital. Its odd that after all she's done she doesn't realize her importance or at least doesn't seem to want the importance. She's the reluctant hero and Im starting to get a martyr vibe. It was a treat once again to see Phillip Seymore Hoffman grace the screen in what is his last fully completed movie. He filmed all but one scene for the second part. Julianne Moore joins the cast as the leader of the rebellion, President Coin and she is a welcome treat. It's nice this franchise was able to lock in such powerhouse actors, just shows that they believe in the material.This movie isn't going to satisfy action junkies and some may feel that overall not much happens to move the story forward but I believe there is enough going on here to keep you entertained from start to finish. I didn't want it to end and am not looking forward to the long months of counting the days until I get to see the finale to this brilliant series.","17 out of 26 found this helpful.

I am an avid movie go-er and enjoy great deal of fiction books. I have read all 3 books as well as watch the other 2 movies.If you read the book you would have seen this coming from this series. While first 2 books keep a good balance between inner dialog and the plot, the last book was emotional driven swamp that almost slowed the plot to a stop. (forgive me ladies) It read like the writer was going through her menopause for the entire 3rd book. It was just that bad, the only motivation that had me finish the book was my desire to end the series. The books series was clearly written by a inferior writer than the recent book-to-movie authors. The movie was accordingly was horrendous. Instead of introducing the character's feelings while the plot unfolds, the writer chooses to keep the reader on the character's emotional roller-coaster while giving vague news about the actual plot (revolution). The characters have no depth to them and the plot plays too close to archetypes. The movie was barely not worth watching therefore a 4. There isn't the quality or the quantity of action to be a serviceable action/adventure and the low quality of the actors/actresses doesn't save the terrible writing. The camera work or the directing isn't top shelf by any means, might be one of the worst big budget work I've seen in decades. I tried to like the book, I tried to like this movie but there is just no redeeming quality about either.","10 out of 14 found this helpful.

Panem is facing a revolt started by Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence, as set up at the end of Catching of Fire. In which previous victors of the games were once forced to fight for their lives knowing there would be but one left alive.After being thrown into the Hunger Games for a second time when Katniss thought she was safe, and having seen her friends die and Peeta held hostage by the Capitol, she is traumatized. Kidnapped and taken by the rebels to District 13, she is once again thrust in the heart of the revolution that she helped to ignite as the symbolic face of the effort.As far as adaptations go, The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 follows the story set forth by Suzanne Collins pretty accurately. Having split the final book of the trilogy into two parts allows the production company some freedom in faithfulness. Having read the books myself I know the third book is the odd narrative of the bunch, focusing more on revolutionary warfare than the cruel realities of the games.While I understand a potential film would have been a behemoth in length had the book Mockingjay not been broken up into parts, it seems that not enough content is in Part 1. It drones on for the first 40minutes at District 13 while Katniss comes to grips with her role as the symbolic mockingjay when this transformation easily could have been abridged substantially. The increased time invested in showing the rebel effort allows a lull to occur by the one hour mark when viewers realize they still have an entire second half of the movie to endure.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is relatively well acted though monotonously toned in the emotions of their characters. None go through any sort of transformation or evolution and by the end of the film all are exactly as they started. Mockingjay Part 1 does divide the book at a very appropriate point, though the film should have ended three minutes earlier, and still leaves audiences excited for the much anticipated conclusion to the series with Mockingjay Part 2.For more FULL reviews of ALL the RECENT releases, please check out our website.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

It may not be among the most expensive films but it's quite apparent that a lot of money has been spent. However, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' still looks and feels like a B-movie. Camera-work is overdone. Editing is shoddy. Too many subplots that aren't fleshed out, lots of plot holes. The use of light is ineffective especially in the nocturnal sequences. Most of the performances are average at best. Donald Pleasance does go overboard in several scenes. Jennifer Lawrence seems to only have been required as the directors daughter. Philip Kaufman does a confident job and... if there is one reason to watch 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' at all then that's Josh Huckman who easily steals the show as the male love interest. One good that came from the box office success of this forgettable, rather lacklustre thriller is the appreciation of this actor, most of whose memorable works received little recognition.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Mockingjay Part I fundamentally fails to capture the essence of Rebellion.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3129049/?ref_=tt_urv","neilbenammar","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51760879/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2014","Now before the Hunger Games fans try to gut me for this review, bare in mind I am writing this review without having read the books- which may or may not cloud my judgment, depending on different opinions. Firstly, I would like to preface my review by pointing out that compared to the shallow garbage we see nowadays the Hunger Games franchise is considerably better both in its ability to convey emotion and assert compelling themes ( FYI: they are also coherent). It has been a while since we've discovered a tale of tyranny - via the abuse of power, told from the perspective and voice of the people being subjected with violence. The theme of Injustice has been tackled countless times by Hollywood studios over the years and 90% of the time it was misrepresented or wrongly/poorly depicted. The strength of the Hunger Games is that the underlying motive of Revolt drives every character's story-arc and as a consequence universalizes the plight of the 13 Districts. From the very start of the trilogy, Katniss Everdeen brought conflict straight to the Capitol as soon as she won the Games. Her act of defiance not only sparked a series of events but it eventually exposed the autocracy of the Government- all this purely by accident ( Katniss reminds everyone in this third installment that initially, she did not willingly want to cause the uproar in Panem). Ironically, Katniss volunteered to fight in the Games, however she is made a symbol of the Mockingjay Rebellion involuntarily. Most audiences will be moved by the emotional journey Katniss undergoes throughout the film- however it was paramount for Francis Lawrence to capture the rebellion of the districts with the utmost sincerity and power. Unfortunately, he ultimately fails to do so. What works in the Hunger Games is that it explores an enthralling and extremely vivid background/back-story- namely ""The Districts, their diverse terrains and their inhabitants"". For instance, in ""Catching Fire""- we had a glimpse into the lives of the people living in District 12( and some other Districts such as 8)- this made us empathize with the characters at the helm of this blockbuster because it gave the plot a humane cause. The brave and hard-working people of Panem were given a soul and not just Hollywood props to play around with. To be quite frank, I was quite skeptical to watch Catching Fire after I heard Gary Ross was not attached to direct. Fortunately, to my surprise, Francis Lawrence did an outstanding job and kept the series with a fervent sense of conviction and audacity. Francis Lawrence's greatest accomplishment with Catching Fire was that he explored a plausible juxtaposition of sorts, which was: while The Capitol tried to dehumanize the people under its rule they gained the bravery to humanize their cause through the eyes of innocent Katniss Everdeen. This might sound complicated to understand but at its core is the primary motor for the denouement of the story. The political undertones of the Hunger Games have always been present in the shadows- this made it more than interesting for Lionsgate ( the film production company behind the Hunger Games phenomenon), as they had a young adult adaptation, which at the time of release, coincided with the political issues of today's day and age. From the very beginning, Mockingjay Part 1 had a daunting task to extend both visually and spiritually the magnitude of Panem's universe; in order to give us a look into the mind of the Rebellion- both through Katniss' eyes and the individuals who rally behind her. All in all, the essence of the Hunger Games was not entirely there as the movie failed to capture the Mockingjay Rebellion with enough heart and insight. That being said, I still think the first 2 installments deserve all the praise they get for defying the Hollywood ""status-quo"" and I'm glad The Hunger Games trilogy was acquired by Lionsgate-( a smaller independent studio compared to the normal typical ""powerhouses"") as they kept the movies relatively in-sync with the books and allowed both Gary Ross and Francis Lawrence to portray Panem without any influence from higher-ups( to a certain extent of course ). I certainly hope that when Mockingjay Part II hits theaters at the same time next year, we will dive back into a truthful and honest representation of the people of Panem and their fight against injustice. Finally, although Katniss singing ""Hanging Tree"" evoked the main ideas behind the revolution- the rest of the film falls short trying to do so.","12 out of 36 found this helpful.

""Mockingjay - Part 1"" repeats the same formula present in many of these current two-part adaptations of popular literary works: a slow-paced, exposition-laden first half that will be undoubtedly contrasted with its fiery, action-driven conclusion due to be released next year. Although the decision to do this makes ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" so far the weakest in the Hunger Games quadrilogy, solid performances and an overbearing sense of dread still make ""Part 1"" a worthy installment in the dystopian series. As the twelve districts amass against the oppressive Capitol, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself being used as a propaganda tool to garner support for the revolutionaries. She also finds her loyalties divided between those she is being encouraged to inspire, and those who are held captive in the Capitol, including friend/love interest Peeta (Josh Hutcherson).Like with the previous two productions, much of the film's success rests on Lawrence's more-than-capable shoulders. Her character shifts effortlessly back and forth from a reluctant victim of circumstance to a full-fledged freedom fighter. The actress can be just as dedicated in roles such as these as to those for which she has been Oscar-nominated (Winter's Bone, Silver Linings Playbook). Many of the other previously prominent characters, such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Peeta, are relegated largely to the sidelines in this installment, though they surely will receive their fair share of moments in the concluding entry. By taking a much slower, introspective approach, the film is perhaps able to reach a much deeper form of social and political commentary, as well as further insight into Katniss' now even more flawed psyche. Clear comparisons can be drawn between the turbulent climate Katniss is thrust into and the current relationships between first and third-world civilizations. Though this setting already provides an unnerving cinematic experience, the similarities displayed in real life make it all the more closer to home. The decision to split the final book adaptation into two films inevitably deprives ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" of a sufficient third act. We get a great build-up, but no pay-off, something which will unfortunately have to wait until next year. However, as far as build-ups go, ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" does the job well, refamiliarizing its audience with the chaotic world of Panem, its pivotal characters, as well as effectively raising the stakes for 2015's even-more-anticipated climax.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'm sorry if you liked Finnick Odair, because don't expect to see much of him, or Peeta Mellark, but the major problem with this movie is that it's telling the opposite story of the one the book told. All the foreshadowing is removed and there are newly invented scenes that directly contradict the subtext of the book and lead me to suspect that a radical change of ending at the end of movie two.It's not Mockingjay, the book, made into a movie. It's like Coin made a propo of Mockingjay from her point of view and released it as a campaign ad for her upcoming presidential run.Mockingjay wasn't a completely original story, it was Watership Down, but it was a wonderful end to the series, and just the sort of triple play that was needed. Now they've taken that away from me and handed me a star wars in its place. That's like taking away my swordfish steak and giving me a McFillet.It's a chopped assortment of action scenes, with all of the darkness removed, and absurd scenes added that generated actual mocking laughter from the theater audience when I saw it on the second night. That's never a good sign.Still, if you're just seeing it as a movie, it's not terrible, it's not like inception or some of the garbage they have at top of IMDb's list; meaning, it's not blatantly bad, it's just blatantly not mockingjay. Maybe if they called it mockingmockingjay, or maybe if it was a youtube fan video attempt it wouldn't have annoyed me so much.There are a couple of well done scenes taken from the book that actually appear in the movie. I think there are actually five scenes in this movie that are actually in the book, and maybe two of them are the same as the book. What's more difficult to forgive is the creation of scenes that aren't in the book to add in when there is clearly so much that was hacked out.So, if you didn't read the book, you'll be mildly annoyed, if you did read the book, just brace yourself with really low expectations and then you can still enjoy it.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, due to the vast improvements made between the first and second installments of the film series, I was rather excited to see how the writers would continue to improve upon Suzanne Collins' disappointing finale to the book series. Unfortunately, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (Part 1)"" delivers no such improvements and is just as slow and frustrating as the first half of the third book. If you go to see this, when you walk out of the theater, please seriously ask yourself, ""what was accomplished in this movie?"". The answer you give yourself should have one, maybe two, bullet points despite the 123 minute running time. This movie made it painfully obvious that producers only want to squeeze as much money out of fans as possible; there is absolutely no reason to have a two part film adaptation of Collins' ""Mockingjay"".I do not believe screenplay writers should keep true to books they base their screenplays off of, that is totally up to the original author and the writer. That being said, book-readers should be happy with any changes that were made, and mad that more were not implemented. This was a BORING movie. It also makes you hate the characters we are meant to love by making them seem like the most selfish and naive people despite the experiences they have lived through. While the acting is not bad (quite the opposite really, the actors are excellent with what little they have to work with), I was relieved when the main characters were taken off the screen in order to show what was happening outside of their ""bubble"". I found myself much more interested in the stories of the extras rather than the boring and almost irrelevant plot that follows the main characters. It makes you want to slap them and scream ""stop throwing a pity-party for yourself and do something useful for a change"".I gave this film a 4 because, while there is no doubt in my mind that I will see the final installment in theaters as well, I urge movie- watchers to wait. Wait until you have the chance to watch the first and second parts together, otherwise you will be mad and anxious until it is released. Hopefully by doing this, you will have a better impression of the film(s) than I have.","15 out of 23 found this helpful.

The third installment of the Hunger Games series diverges from the first two in that things have gotten a lot more serious. No longer is Katniss Everdeen simply trying to stay alive, she is now leading a cause, a revolution.This is one of the main reasons I didn't like this movie as much. The root of it all is the book of course, which I read; so the book is a lot to blame. To be fair, I didn't really like book three as much as the first two, so it is quite possible that I was biased going into the movie. Be that as it is, Katniss was more likable as the girl on fire just trying to survive. Now she is the Mockingjay trying to incite and invigorate the people to action. Along with this character shift the movie was slow.Mockingjay Part 1 was a build up movie in my opinion. The entire movie is setting the stage for the eventual battle between the rebels and the Capital. Not that they haven't been fighting already, but the stage is being set for an all out offensive. So, as a build up movie it was slow as to be expected. There were some exciting and active moments sprinkled in here and there, but the majority of the movie was very chess like. Like President Snow said, ""Moves and counter-moves.""","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was given the task of setting up all of the action to come and that hurt the film both in terms of runtime and overall content. The movie is littered with lots of dialogue between the characters that although is somewhat interesting, but does get a little tiring by the end. On the plus side Jennifer Lawrence's character does get a lot of development throughout the film, but that did create a negative by taking away many chances to have other character develop. In the end the film was very well acted by all involved, but let itself down by having to setup all of the events in Part 2 of the final film.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

The action sequences are drastically lesser as compared to the first two installments, but it works well as a bridge to connect what has already happened previously and to expect what is yet to come. It is clear to see the main intention behind to separate this adventure into two parts, which might look necessary providing that it has just covered a quarter of the last book, but unfortunately rather than presenting further details, it keeps on dragging certain unnecessary parts even though the political satire seems to be quite smart, if audiences are patient enough to follow the dialogues. As the core of the story line, Academy Award winner - Jennifer Lawrence undoubtedly performs extremely well physically, mentally and emotionally once again as Katniss Everdeen, it also presents a stunning ending compared to Catching Fire; not to say boring but overall this chapter appears to be a little bit overlong and weak, causing the lack of powerful revolution and rebellion spirits.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

A love triangle spun into a four part series. Walking into the cinema... Part One: This is like walking into a fine restaurant and knowing that you will only get the appetiser. We are just supposed to be satisfied with part of the Mockingjay story. Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3.5 stars Family value: 2.5 stars*For those who have not been keeping up with the district drama of The Hunger Games narrative. Katniss and the rebellion destroyed the Hunger Games and the nation of Panem is set on is on a disastrous course towards civil war. The districts have begun to rebel against the Capital and all they need is a catalyst to begin an attack. The rescued tributes, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Finnick and Beetee, have been taken to District 13. The district that was rumoured to be destroyed, but has flourished undetected and underground by the watchful eye of the Capital's peacekeepers. Katniss is asked to push past her personal horrors of the Hunger Games, the assumed loss of Peeta and take on the role of the people's symbol for the rebellion, the ""Mockingjay"". President Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) devise a plan that will weigh against the propaganda of the President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capital. Katniss must weigh out how she will be utilised for the role and the eventual knowledge of Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) survival and his perceived betrayal within the capital. Peeta seems to have become the puppet of the capital and she must find a way to save him and still fight the power of Snow's army. After visiting the destruction of District 12 and seeing the devastation throughout the other districts, Katniss is motivated to become the central figure in the fight. She must wrestle with the responsibilities of being the face of the rebellion and determining what do with her potential love for Peeta and Gale. The Hunger Games series has become another teen dystopian drama phenomenon. The book series and the movie series have set new records and developed stars of its characters. Regardless of opinions of the series, it's theme or the genre, this film is destined to be a hit and affably serves as the bridge to the conclusion of the story. The challenge for director, Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend), is to make us willing to wait another year for the final instalment. Lawrence took over the film series for the second instalment, which is arguably the best of the series. With Mockingjay: Part 1 Lawrence does a masterful job of keeping the keeping the story on the front burner at a low boil and draws us slowly into the drama. The story moves seamlessly from the last film and manages to keep the audiences attention. The performances by Jennifer Lawrence, Hoffman and Sutherland felt comfortable and familiar, keeping the relational tension intact for the final instalment. It is difficult to watch Philip Seymour Hoffman in his final performance. An unfortunate loss to the industry, but a welcome addition to this film. Julianne Moore and Liam Hemsworth perform well, but seem like bit players in this portion of the tale. All the other characters are merely window dressing for the set up for the final battle. This leaves them one-dimensional and lacking depth, but serviceable as building blocks for the building storyline. Thankfully, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) are allowed to flourish and add the needed humour to a relatively somber tale. There is action in this film, but it seems minimal in comparison to previous two chapters of The Hunger Games. This all adds to the needed tension to serve up Part 2. Interestingly, the direction does not play up the love triangle portion between the three lead characters. The story weighs in on psychological tension of the battle between good and evil. For the fans of the book series, the filmmakers have honoured the characters and storyline. For the fans of the movie series, this portion of the story successfully sets up the final chapter. As a film it is good, but merely gets the story to the boiling point . Mockingjay: Part 1 succeeds in moving the storyline along, but is not satisfying on its own. We will sit at the table waiting for the main course... next year. Leaving the cinema... This film was a test of patience. It was not a bad film and did the work that it was supposed to do, set up the last film and make millions of dollars in the process. You will need to see this portion of the series to understand the conclusion. So, go, enjoy the film and then wait until next year for resolution. *This is a film for pre-teens and older due to mature themes and violence. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. How will the world come to an end? (Matthew, 24:36, Revelation 20:1-15) 2. Should we rebel against bad leadership?

It included every important aspect and detail, and even went more in depth than the book did.I was amazed with Jennifer Lawrence's acting, it was convincing and real seeing that she has gone through 2 hunger games and now is suffering with PTSD. People need to remember that Katniss is not supposed to be this strong, fearless leader, she is a 17 year old girl suffering with PTSD and only wants to save her love from torture.I thought all the action scenes were intense and visually stunning, everything looked real and made you want to sit on the edge of your seat. I was very impressed by the CGI effects.As for Peeta, I think that Josh Hutcherson did a phenomenal job capturing his character. He's so different from the Peeta we saw before, and to see him deteriorate slowly through out the movie made my heart ache. The last scenes of the movie were well acted, and I think that Josh captured Peeta perfectly as a victim of the capitols hijacking. Everything about this movie was so well done, the acting, the characters, the visuals, I could go on and on. For those who are disappointed that there wasn't enough action, that's not what it was mainly about. There's more to this movie than that. Katniss' character is severely depressed and has PTSD, so to expect her to be this incredibly strong heroine is unrealistic. There's so much more to this movie than the action scenes, and if you fail to see that then this is not the movie for you. I cannot wait for Part 2, I think it might even be better than part 1, but it's hard to top.","63 out of 115 found this helpful.

I came in expecting a good experience that I had received from its predecessors, but was left with an utter mess of a film and a disappointment to the name. From watching the previous movies, I know these films aren't exactly 10/10 material, but they are quite entertaining and have some emotional high points. The ones here were few and far between, and Katniss's many emotional breakdowns were not any of them. You know it's bad when the main character becomes a drag and isn't nearly as inspiring (nothing against J-Law). While Haymitch and Effie were awesome once again, they could not salvage everything else. Torrid acting and drawn out sequences that were re-played over and over helped make the story so predictable that even those who don't know the books could figure it out Overall: If you're a fan of the books, you might enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality work that entertains you, moves you, and gives you the chills you got in the previous entries, skip this one. Hopefully the next will do better.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

The entire first hour of the film could have easily been consolidated to 20 minutes without effecting anything. On top of this the acting in the first half was horrific. I'm not sure if the actors are to blame or the director. If I had to do it over, I would wait and watch this on Blu Ray right before the final movie releases next year. Save your money and the frustration of sitting through the first half of this film. The second half picked up nicely and we got some story. The acting improved and things started to seem OK. The problem is that I was already half asleep by the time anything happened so I really didn't get absorbed into the movie. I think this is a clear example of how not to break up a story and it is obvious they were simply trying to stretch things out to accommodate an extra box office release.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Although as interesting as it may sound, the film falls short because of the 2 part cash grabbing finale formula that has become a recent trend.If you are planning on going into the theaters to see a satisfying movie that will end on a high note then you are completely wrong. Having read the books a thought kept circling through my mind before watching: ""This movie will surely end in an unsatisfying manner."" having read and realized how short and quite mediocre the book was, and as predicted it ended at the climax and will force you to give more of your money for next year. The movie started well and was faithful to the source material. However, when the climax was nearing it all just fell apart. You have scenes which will bore you and just doesn't get you engaged well enough. JLaw and the veteran actors did well and gave their best, but they do little to save the movie. Visuals improved way better than previous films and were one of the most notable improvements. Shaky cams return and ruin the experience for the most part when there is a tense moment. As for the action, if you've seen the trailers then you've seen most of it. The only high point of the film is the propaganda between the Capitol and the rebellion. It was clever the way the two parties threw their propagandas at each other. Without the propaganda there would be no plot whatsoever rather than the annoying goal of saving Peeta and the love triangle. The film also spends too much time on the bunker rather than showing more of the rebellion and interesting stuff out there. The reason for this is because it's a two part film, of course they'll show more of the interesting parts in the finale. This is the result of a clever excuse for a money grabbing two parter in which you will have to wait for another year to see the next one and for them to steal more of your cash. If this was just 1 whole film, then it could have been better on it's own right judging by the length and simple narrative of the book. But since studios are hungry for money, the movie feels like a long long trailer for next year's finale-Less interesting stuff shown6.8/10","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

The long awaited squeal to the best selling dystopian book series, The Hunger Games. After the success of Harry Potter and Twilight, it seemed like a nice idea to break the final movie of the hunger game series into 2 parts too. But the book isn't that long. Because of that the movie started to drag at moments and the pace of it was slow. But with the amazing cast and widely loved Jennifer Lawrence in it, it's hard not to like. The movie addresses the problem of a stronger government torturing their subjects. Many countries could relate to this today. Overall a good movie. Brilliant acting, well written and really good Cinematography. I personally liked Catching Fire a lot more. The movie primarily set the stage for the final part set to release 20th November next year, kinda like a 2 hour long trailer.The soundtrack by lorde was stunning and perfectly suited the movie.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

So angry, frustrated and furious that in fact I wanted to forget I had ever taken the time to see it. Which is why this review is four months late. I've always considered myself an avid fan of the series and I still do. When I saw the first film I felt the need to read all of the books. Then came the film adaptation of 'Catching Fire'. I loved it and will continue to watch it throughout the rest of my life. But I remained split in two about whether I would like 'Mockingjay' in the weeks leading up to its release. Francis Lawrence directed the previous instalment, but I do not consider myself to be a fan of the last book. Would splitting it in half detract its flaws or add to them. Unfortunately, it piles them on and there was me thinking the book had its fair share of problems, wait until you see the film.This time around Katniss Everdeen having survived two rounds of the fatal Hunger Games is to lead a revolution. The Capitol and President Snow have Peeta and Johanna captive and are seemingly brainwashing Peeta for their cause. However, things are going to be anything but easy, except easy money for Hollywood that is. Katniss initially refuses to join the Rebel's cause and become the Mockingjay. A decision the President of District 13, Alma Coin takes with anger. Coin is portrayed by Julianne Moore who gives a worthwhile performance. She shares plenty of screen time with Plutarch Heavensbee played (in one of his last roles) by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The two provide perhaps the only bearable element of 'Mockingjay', believable and interesting performances from the both of them.Eventually, Katniss leads a rescue mission to bring back the captives and take revenge on the Capitol; except the last part does not even happen. Instead Francis Lawrence gives us the cinematic equivalent to watching grass grow. For all of its 123 minutes, make no mistake, this Hunger Games is one dull, dreary dragged out affair. With no real beginning, middle and end. It feels like a botched job. We watch and wait restless in our seats with bated breath, waiting for something, anything in fact of consequence to happen. All this build up and nothing. No tension, no real drama and no emotional heft or pay off. I would rather fight to the death in the arena than watch Part 1 again.The problem does not squarely rest on the Director's shoulders though. The writing, cinematography, music, most of the acting and the plot all contribute to give audiences one of the worst major releases from Hollywood in 2014. Save for 'Transformers: Age of Extinction'.'Mockingjay' is written in such a way that it drags out scenes for far too long just to pass the two hour mark. There is a scene, I am not kidding that lasts for a good minute or more, where Katniss inexplicably shines a torch at a cat and watches as it tries to attack it. She laughs. We don't. Hollywood does. This is clearly for the cutting room floor and any great Director would know this. Lawrence does not have a clue. Even the cinematography is as bland as they come. The whole film is bathed in shades of grey and any colour is washed out in favour of murky blues and dull blacks. It is a very depressing experience to watch 'Mockingjay'. Especially when you realise that Katniss only fires one arrow, which is the films only legitimate action.James Newton Howard phones it in using his music cues from the previous instalments, he should think of himself as a disgrace. Sadly, Jennifer Lawrence is no good moping, crying and whinging; wherever the old Lawrence is I want her back now! To cap it all off, the film could have been finished in twenty minutes. I am worn out now and I know you don't need me to tell you to avoid this film and to not be fooled by cynical marketing strategies from Hollywood and its hack Directors.In 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' Francis Lawrence provides the fans with everything that they do not want; a disengaging story, mainly awful performances, dreary cinematography, repetitive music and plodding directing. It is in my eyes time for a revolution against bad film making and bloated runtimes. I have a message for Francis Lawrence if you direct another film we will boycott it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If that was the only problem with this movie.I have no problem with splitting a book into two movies - it worked well with the final Harry Potter book/movies. It has not worked so well with this movie.Why? The movie didn't work on it's own as a movie. It might work just fine as a ""3rd of 4th"" movie, but we won't know that until next year. At this point in time, all I can do is judge it as a movie on it's own - and how it builds on the movies before it.And it just doesn't work.Besides one scene in the middle in District 8, this movie is basically locked inside a bunker in District 13 and we watch Jennifer Lawrence looking angsty over Peeta for 2 hours. The climax isn't really a climax, but will have to serve for a bridge to the next movie.The stellar cast is pretty much wasted - Woody Harrelson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Stanly Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Julieanne Moore and Jeffrey Wright don't really have much to do. Add on top of that some terrific young actors - Sam Caflin, Natalie Dormer, Jena Malone, Willow Shields - who also don't have anything to do.Only Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket shines in this movie in a twist on a character that I have grown to love over the course of these 3 movies.Ultimately, this movie focuses on the ""love triangle"" between Lawrence's Katniss, Liam Hemsworth's Gale and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta. It isn't what I go to Hunger Games movies to see. Mockingjay, Part 2 better bring on the action.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis).","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

After reading your review I don't know how anyone could take any of yours seriously, when you try to imply that movies which are split in to different parts IE PT1, PT2, PT3 etc cannot and do not work. If this is the case could please give your reviews on a little film which is also filmed in parts known as THE GODFATHER!!! You could also try and explain this to the Star Wars Fans out there. And while you at it.......LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!!!!!!!! Unfortunately for you, your talents as a critic lack total credibility from your false statement. ANYONE ELSE WITH ME ON THIS GUYS?

Without getting too technical, and strange plot devices aside, the directing is good with just a few miscues, much like catching fire. The acting is incredible, though some of the dialogue is cheesy. They didn't take the Harry Potter road of making part one more art driven, nor did they use the extra time to more fully explain the world outside of district 13, which would have been a better choice. Instead they chose to focus more on katniss' inner turmoil. That proved to be a bad choice as the peaks of this movie were actually all events that took place away from her (there is a particularly effective dam scene dealing with members of outside districts). Basically my recommendation would be to wait until part two comes out and watch this right before so you can pretend it was one big movie because this film constantly reminds you that it is only half a story (especially the huge let down at the end of the climax.)","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I have not read the books and so the films have been my only exposure to the series. That obviously coloring my opinion of the films; I quite enjoyed Mockingjay Part I albeit for a relatively singular reason. The story and content of the plot is rich, engaging and enticing. Mockingjay Part I feels like the (partial) culmination of the first two films that come before it. This should be an obvious statement but important as each following film seems to be less independent from the greater whole. The previous films build into the effectiveness of this offering and with your audience primed for hating 'The Man' and baring witness to the difficulties of an essential uprising in the name of freedom which starts Mockingjay on a high and thankfully, it stays there. There are impeccable story moments that Director Francis Lawrence use incredibly well, as well as a few of the expected but emotion provoking 'moments of grandeur' and even the predictable moments similar story arches tend to enjoy. My criticism on this film is that it is too connected and depended on what came before and what will come after. The film is powerful but much of the content is assumed straight from Catching Fire which left me trying to remember exactly where certain characters fit in and which also left me with ample anticipation for Part II of the series resolution, but what does that say of this film? The greater story feels lost while we wait for the conclusion though soaking up such effective story telling while you wait definitely scores some points.I find it a little hard to pin down an opinion on much of the performance of the film. The acting is definitely effective and there is a moment where Jennifer Lawrence really impressed me (I won't spoil beyond mentioning that having an actor in character act badly and keep character is not always that easy and is something I hold commendable). Beyond that the characters do what you expect them to. They react to what you expect in the way you expect, which is a little disappointing. The plot throws a lot of curve balls (in various degrees) at the characters and diversifying their responses would have enriched the whole film to me, but I'm not complaining on what is presented on screen. The style of filming drew my attention a bit, which I always consider a bad thing – unless it is very deliberate. It bothered me the most in the exposition of the film where the change from hand held to stabilized shots felt messy. Some of the editing cuts also felt abrupt (early in the film) which made me aware of 'the line', continuity and other film making concepts I expect film makers to know but which I would like to forget when enjoying a film. The plot didn't really allow for too much use of music to enhance the visuals though I expect we'll be seeing more of that when (if?) the war finally breaks out in the final part of the series.In closing, I enjoyed sitting in the cinema and watching this film. I took some food for thought from it (the main and overly perpetuated theme of the series) and I'm looking forward to the next one. Beyond that, I fear Mockingjay Part I will fade into insignificance.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The best part of this film by far are the action sequences, such as the great lumberjack revolt and the assault on the Hoover Dam. And the ""Hanging Tree"" song and sequence was really moving and gave you a brief glimpse of what this series is always trying to pull off but never actually delivers. The problem is, Katniss is still too passive to carry a story that involves nonstop action. In fact the name of this movie might as well be ""Hunger Games: Pining for Peeta"" because that's all she ever really does. And the love triangle remains really awkward and absent any real sexual tension, probably because the target audience is twelve years old. (""You kissed me because I'm in pain."" You're not the only one, pal. You're not the only one!) At the heart of this series is a fundamental flaw. The film makers want to have it both ways, sending a vaguely populist message while sneering at the great unwashed. In the story, we're told that when Our Girl talks, the common people listen, and that once they get on their hind legs there's no stopping them. Yet we're also told, in a very smug, nudge-nudge, wink-wink sort of way, that the people will never really listen to Our Girl UNLESS she has the right gown, the right hair, the right makeup, etc. etc. It's patronizing and it really grates on you after the fifth or sixth time. The old Hollywood did this kind of thing with much more class, without the condescension. Speaking of the old Hollywood, I must really be getting old, because all through this film I kept closing my eyes and pretending I was watching ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland (heroic outlaws in the woods bring down a tyrant) or else ""Casablanca"" with Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. (Steaming hot love triangle set against the backdrop of a fight against unspeakable evil.)And then I opened my eyes, and found out I was out of luck.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

They ignore so much.Some fans of Japanese cinema have still been unable to forgive The Hunger Games' resemblance to Battle Royal. They miss out on the bevy of differences and the depth of the setting within The Hunger Games. However tantalizing the world within the movie may be, most reviewers are prone ignore Mockingjay Part 1's greatest strength: Lawrence. No, not Jennifer Lawrence, though she still plays the part well (albiet a tad too heavy handed). The director Francis Lawrence does a grand job of utilizing visual storytelling and cleverly grafting it in with the plot. Also, this is one of the best edited movies this year, next to Interstellar and Edge of Tomorrow. The soundtrack is notable and Lawrence expertly uses and properly represents the power of music in Mockingjay Part 1. Addressing the other common complaint - splitting the source material into two movies: Many condemning Part 1 as a shameless cash grab, they wearily buy a ticket and pout while maligning the talent, time, and money (yes, movies COST money) online by engaging in an aggressive campaign against this ""overrated"" and ""plagiarized"" series. This sort of pessimism will surely prevent anyone from enjoying the emotional effect of this story. In conclusion, this middle movie will be viewed more fondly once it is part of a box set.","88 out of 166 found this helpful.

After Katniss destroys the games forever in the previous film, she is now in District 13. President Alma Coin(Julianne Moore) tells Katniss that she should lead the rebellion against the Capitol. Katniss also finds out that Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson) is in the Capitol. So, Katniss reluctantly becomes the face of the rebellion to overthrow the Capitol & wants to save Peeta at the earliest. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a great film. However, it's not as action packed as the previous two movies in the series. Unlike in The Hunger Games(2012) & The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013) there are no actual Hunger Games in this movie. There are just three or four action set pieces in the movie. There is a lot of character development in this movie. Despite the limited action in the movie, it managed to hold my interest throughout. Should they have split the movie into two parts? I don't know. The ending of the film, though an amazing cliffhanger, leaves the viewer wanting more. I know for sure that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2(2015) is going to be epic! Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Katniss Everdeen. Lawrence portrays the varying emotions of Katniss with ease. Josh Hutcherson is outstanding as Peeta Mellark. Hutcherson portrays Peeta's vulnerability & fear, effortlessly. Liam Hemsworth is awesome as Gale Hawthorne. I liked the fact that Hemsworth is given more screen time, this time around. Woody Harrelson is amazing as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as Plutarch Heavensbee. Julianne Moore is mind blowing as President Alma Coin. Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks, Mahershala Ali, Jeffrey Wright, Paul Malcomson, Stanley Tucci & Natalie Dormer are spectacular as Primrose Everdeen, Finnick Odair, Effie Trinket, Boggs, Beetee, Katniss' Mother, Caesar Flickerman & Cressida respectively. Though I really liked this film I prefer the previous two movies. Still, kudos to director Francis Lawrence for making this film an amazingly tense, emotional & thrilling preview for next year's final film. A must watch!","21 out of 34 found this helpful.

The shallow acting from almost all characters certainly does not help its case, when its elapsed time of action is less than the time of JLaw making weird faces on screen. This movie was an obvious cash-grab that had no purpose other than to make money and set up a finale to the Hunger Games movies. In the end(don't worry I'm not giving out spoilers), the movie does not pay off what it was trying to build up for the whole movie. The whole plot kind of repeated and then becomes redundant towards the middle. The climax is not exciting, because we are too busy seeing Katniss crying, while the real action going on is not being showed on screen. I rated this movie so high, because I am excited for Part 2, and hopefully it will not be filled with the boring garbage that made this film inferior.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Predictably, the studio wants to make the same strategy of any successful YA finale have done recently. But after this film, I feel like there should be a rule that not every successful franchise must have a ""split"" conclusion, but this is the part that will definitely be ignored. But seriously, the movie is already good as itself; the storyline is nicely constructed, there's tension even without the noise. This isn't probably the most showy blockbuster you'll see, but there is a terrific quality to be found in any of its scenes, even if the movie itself isn't so satisfying.There are movies exist that has an opened ending and yet satisfies as an experience as a whole. We can point out a number of titles, but one of them is Catching Fire. Although there was a cliffhanger, there is a meaty story embedded within the piece. This one is nothing more than a half part, preparing the audience for the real revolution. To those who haven't read the book and expecting for tons of action, regarding this as a blockbuster hit, would definitely be disappointed. However there is still a fight going on, this is basically a battle where both sides are using the power of media, convincing people to stand along with them. This is an intriguing portrayal of how modern society reach out through politics and other concerns, the movie excitingly rises up tension of bringing unpredictable consequences at every campaign they release.The film put these scenes together with an excellent pace. It just simply gives necessary details at their campaigning precision and concerns what affects would appear outside their district. Overall, even at the scenes of talking in rooms, the movie is totally gripping. The action of the franchise was never about the spectacles, and once again, it's the quiet and grim suspense that make the set piece work. It just keeps showing the unpleasant results of their supposedly glorious revolution. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is engaging, as usual, backed up with also great Julianne Moore and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Donald Sutherland also gives some compelling threat even when his villain character is at the distance. The rest just did what they usual do.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 feels rewarding until it literally stops. This is the major complain one would clamor. What's wrong with an extra hour or more of runtime? But again, we are wasting our breath, the answer is at the corner of obviousness. The movie, again, does a good job at telling its own story, it would have been a way better movie if it just continues without waiting for another year. If we are going to take the series's revolutionary metaphor in our own terms, then: if the first movie is the spark, and the second is (duh) the ""catching fire"", then this one is basically the slow burn. It's not a bad thing, neither is a great one. I mean it's fun leaving the theater with questions scattered around your head and those thrills still looping on your memories, but they could have been wiser by just finishing it. There is hardly any reason for us to wait, in fact, leaving the storyline intact might possibly make it a classic.","32 out of 55 found this helpful.

I wish they were all dead and we were too. It would be best.""Ushers in another crucial build to the story so gripping that it would leave you waiting for more. Francis Lawrence who brought us amazing movies like I Am Legend and Constantine, also the previous instalment, who is also going to do the next (Whoopie), is still magnificent underneath the direction cap. His frames are slow, the focusing and the feeling kind, and at the same time extremely powerful. The impact that he makes whilst an actor delivers his lines is a beauty to perceive.Words fail to describe the acting prowess of Jennifer Lawrence. She has this grave demeanour that she carries which at once rivets you to the screen. She is still very dramatic and exhumes the right kind of emotional vibes. And boy! the song she sings is just beautiful! The Hanging Tree. Ah! So powerful and just so right! She carries it gorgeously without any music.The Hunger Games might be over but the perversion of President Snow is still extant. He pervades like Poison and delivers the ultimate blow just like it. We see a lot of Gale here and some Finnick in agony. The screenplay puts all the right words in both their mouths. Even the score that goes in the background is captivating.Mockingjay is a brilliant depiction of the amazing Suzanne Collins series and the finest kind of drama you would ever see, and Lawrence, both the actor and the director, do justice to it. Can't wait for the final chapter.PS: Only for drama lovers and The Hunger Games followers. Nothing here for action buffs.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The horror of this desperately poor screenplay could not be mended nor sound actors. Hollywood seems to run out of steam...

"6","/10","A nice little build up before the ultimate end game","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3148899/?ref_=tt_urv","InMyHonestOpinion","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57390014/?ref_=tt_urv","26 December 2014","Why at the moment and for the past few years have film studios, directors and marketing companies decided to turn the one film into the many? Why have they turned those great novels into a two or three part mini-series? You most likely have heard or even created your own theories as to why they keep doing this to us. For me it comes down to the cash income, the money they can not only make but save, it costs so many millions of dollars to make a movie so if you can make two films at once wouldn't it be rather absurd or perhaps even rude not to take that opportunity? I've heard a lot of people get quite aggressive when one film is split into two but just take a second and reflect as to why. Mockingjay Part One begins quite abruptly in fact I will say this, ensure you have seen the two earlier films ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" otherwise you will be left with a WTF is happening face for a good 30mins into this film. It almost feels it needed a ""Previously on the Hunger Games"" voice over just so we can recap what we may have forgotten, after all it's been a good twelve months since Catching Fire. It begins with Katniss Evergreen played by Jennifer Lawrence waking up after being rescued and in an underground bunker in District 13, there she meets President Alma Coin the Rebel leader played by Julianne Moore, she informs Katniss of the uprising against Central City and Panam's President Snow played by Donald Sutherland and how she want's Katniss to become the face behind the revolution. Katniss decides for her to become the face she needs to see for herself what has become of the districts while she has been away. She soon discovers that Peeta played by Josh Hutcherson her partner throughout the games so far is in Captiol City and has become the voice of President Snow and his mounting war against the rebels, in fact he has become the enemy Mockingjay is one of these films where they made two separate films at the one time, Mockingjay Part one and Mockingjay Part two. The tragic story behind this one though is the unexpected death of one very talented actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, I think one of the things a lot of people will go into the film is to see where or more to the point what scenes the late Mr. Hoffman wasn't around to finalise. Without giving anything away, you will not notice, for the simple reason he had one bit of dialogue left for Part One which they gave to another fine actor Elizabeth Banks who plays Effie Trinket one of my favourite characters throughout all the films so far and the very underutilised (in part one anyway) Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch Abernathy for his one left over scene in part two. Mockingjay part one is very much the buildup needed for the big and what will hopefully be massive conclusion that will come In part two, so in saying that the film itself lacks a lot of the action the previous two films had there is a lot of dialogue and build up in this movie, a little more character development for the main characters but not a lot else. There is a very heavy underlining good vs evil to the film for those who think way too much I'm sure you'll put the current world's crisis into the positions of the two parties rather than just enjoying what the film has to offer. It doesn't hold back though, the atrocities caused and the thousands murdered will only make you think about the ""what ifs."" I loved the way the director Francis Lawrence ( Constantine, I Am Legend, Catching Fire) created his two very separate worlds, when dealing with the citizens of Capitol City the colours where clean, bright, white, the lights the same, the surroundings rich and filled with stuff and things. Then when he is focusing on the districts the colour palate is dark, the people are brooding, they have flickering lights, gray walls, gray clothing, no makeup no hairstyling and nothing of any great importance but what keepsakes the individuals can carry. I thought that was a great way to tell the two different sides of the story. I enjoyed Mockingjay part one and if being completely honest I really wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did knowing there was Part two to come still and would no doubt be left with some silly cliffhanger for the next year. If you're a fan of the series so far I'd say be sure to see it, just watch the previous films sometime before hand. If you're not a fan get the first two films first and watch them before seeing this one, it is a pretty good series so far and you're only missing out.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There are more actions scenes at a great scale... but the tempo of the movie is slow. There are some powerful scenes and Jennifer Lawrence shines through. Maybe she is not the Katniss Everdeen that you had in mind after you've read The Hunger Games Books. But she is good, she is good indeed. I was curious about Josh Hutcherson. In this third movie, his character is like a new territory, a wild one. I think, the actor was waiting for this new phase to start. This is his opportunity to shine. He has a very shocking scene and he delivers some very intense acting . But we have to wait to Mockingjay Part 2 to see more of Josh and if he can pull it off. There's a lot more of Liam Hemsworth. He is OK. He has the opportunity to show his acting skills. Julianne Moore is a very good Alma Coin, joyless, cunning and intimidating. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson are perfectly cast. The movie feels like a ""waiting room"" for the grand finale. It is a good movie though.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the so-called BR 'fans' look more pathetic than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering what film they saw.","22 out of 36 found this helpful.

The story picks up right where we left off with the previous movie with Katniss being full of regret because she was saved instead of Peeta and the other tributes. It quickly evolves in this movie about a war and what it means with the underlying theme of the consequences of the games over Katniss and what PTSD can do to you.Jennifer Lawrence brings a marvelous performance and successfully portrays this complex character.  One of the most memorable scenes was when she got back to District 12. We also see Josh Hutcherson a.k.a. Peeta go through many transitions and his acting has only improved since the first film. The newcomers,  Julianne Moore and Nataly Dormer are scene-stealers.Many people,  including myself,  we're afraid that 'Part 1' is going to be dull and boring. It was nothing whatsoever. The pacing was on point and the same goes for storytelling. The director,  Francis Lawrence,  has delivered the best experience you could possibly expect from the first half of the book. There is,  in fact,  humor added which was missing in the previous installments. He had also done this remarkable job at expanding the universe with showing us more from the different districts. The CGI work is better than ever before and so are the cinematography and editing.The score is also very fitting and has borrowed a few things from previous installments. The longly awaited 'Hanging Tree' song is very unique and got stuck into my head. In short,  I can easily say this is the best book-to-movie adaptation and even surpassed the book in a few ways.  The acting and storytelling are phenomenal and the ending is sensational.  The film ends on such a high note and cliffhanger which leaves the fans yearning for the fourth and final installment of the series.","26 out of 44 found this helpful.

I was however, somewhat entertained throughout the movie even though there wasn't much action. It was probably the fact that the acting was decent. The one thing that will annoy you is Jennifer's whining in this movie.If you can watch it for free, you may as well (currently on Amazon Prime Video) otherwise I would not pay money to see it. You won't walk away amazed. You pretty much have to watch this in order to see the last one anyways, which is supposedly going to have lots of action (according to those who read the book).

"7","/10","The First MOCKINGJAY Feels Like a Major Departure for the Franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3350587/?ref_=tt_urv","brando647","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3947986/?ref_=tt_urv","7 November 2015","The saga of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and the growing rebellion against the capitol of the fictional nation Panem continues in THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART I. A franchise aimed to teenaged girls and, here I am, three movies deep and undoubtedly going to watch the grand finale. Movies based on young adult novels generally send me running (I've never seen the Twilight movies or the Divergent movies, and I never intend to), but I can't deny that this series is actually done really, really well. I actually really enjoyed CATCHING FIRE (the second of the series) and it got me excited to see this one. The movie begins immediately after the previous events, where we saw Katniss being airlifted out of the Quarter Quell games after literally blowing the lid off the whole operation with an electrified arrow that shorted out the force field around the game field. We rejoin her in the mythical District 13; thought to be an unlivable wasteland following a previous rebellion, District 13 operates in tight military fashion from underground bunkers. Far from dead, the inhabitants are going strong and planning the next move against the Capitol. Support for the rebellion is growing in the other districts despite President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) declaration that any sign of dissent be eliminated with extreme prejudice. Now the rebellion wants to rally the people together under the symbol of the Mockingjay/Katniss. But Katniss is suffering a bit of post-traumatic stress from the games and she's worried about Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who we know had been left behind following Katniss's rescue. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the beginning of the end, where Katniss must rise up to meet her responsibility as a figurehead for rebellion even if it means earning President Snow's personal vengeance.First impression of MOCKINGJAY 1, it's a major departure in style from the previous two movies. HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE were vibrant films, with bright colors all over the scenes in the Capitol and then the beautifully shot wilderness in the course of the games. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the depressing opposite. This is a movie about flickering remains of hope and it wants you to feel the same oppressive dread as the inhabitants of District 13. Gone is the bright wilderness in favor of underground concrete bunkers where the population all wears drab blue jumpsuits. Even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the series' resident peacock and Katniss's personal attendant from the Games, is neutered, relegated to patchwork jumpsuits and scarves. All of the beautiful imagery of the Capitol's effluence is gone so that the audience can be brought down the reality of their suffering. While the first two films would probably be considered action/adventure with science fiction elements, MOCKINGJAY 1 is a war film (with sci-fi elements). No joke, this is a war film closer in spirit to PLATOON or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (though, of course, toned way down as to be appropriate for a younger audience). We confront the realities of conflict such as refugees, collateral damage, and self-sacrifice for the common good. It's nuts and nothing like I expected. At one point, Snow callously orders the bombing of a refugee hospital in one of the districts and we're right there with Katniss as, after everything she's already been through, she watches the incineration of men, women, and children and can do nothing to stop it. Heavy stuff for a teen movie.These movies have, no doubt, made Jennifer Lawrence's career. She is a talented woman and these movies brought her into the spotlight where she was able to latch on to bigger and better things; yet she still continues to return to the character that brought her to the top of her game and she still gives it her all. Katniss, in MOCKINGJAY 1, is at her worst. She's mentally-broken, she's terrified for Peeta, and she is constantly reminded of the pressure on her shoulders as the one person who can unite the districts against the Capitol. In the previous movies, she's shown the strength and conviction of her character but now she's getting angry. Lawrence handles it all effortlessly and brings the viewer along with her in what serves as her character's big transformation. On these same lines, it's worth mentioning the pedigree of acting talent these movies attract. In addition to the returning cast from previous movies (including Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Jeffrey Wright, and Philip Seymour Hoffman), MOCKINGJAY 1 adds Julianne Moore as President Coin, head of District 13 and the rebellion. She's the no-nonsense sort who oversees operations in 13 with military precision, but her intentions seem pure. She recognizes the importance of Katniss's involvement but she's rightfully hesitant at first to put all her faith into one girl and risk everything she's accomplished so far. Hoffman and Liam Hemsworth get upgraded to larger roles. Hoffman (as Plutarch Heavensbee) has betrayed the Capitol and operates as Coin's head of propaganda, and Hemsworth (as Gale, Katniss's former flame from her time in District 12) is now a militant rebel intent on doing his part in bringing down Snow. Having been out of the picture during Katniss's time in the Games, the two of them reconnect but he's no longer interested in pursuing their relationship as a) he's got more important things to worry about now and b) Katniss has obviously developed feelings for Peeta. This not-quite-love-triangle is mercifully given little screen time whereas other young adult movies would probably make it the focus.MOCKINGJAY 1 is a drastic departure from the tone of the first two movies and I wouldn't be surprised to find out it may've turned off some of the younger viewers. It's a pretty good film but you can tell it's just killing time until MOCKINGJAY 2 for the big final battle. Despite some pacing flaws and the general aura of depression, it's a nice lead-in to the final act and an interesting progression for the franchise.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And it's getting progressively worse. This Hunger Games 3 is an incomplete complete mess. It should be more accurately called Hunger Games 2½, as it ends abruptly with the sole purpose to rake in more money from its movie-going audience. However, I do agree with the downtrodden in this film: let's start the revolution, but aim it against the Hollywood studios and their greed.The film starts off immediately from where we ended in Part Two. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has be taken by rebel forces and her love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), has been left behind at the Capitol, captured by the evil President Snow while her close friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) pines forlornly for her. Katniss discovers that her hometown, District 12 has been destroyed and a new band of fighters have joined forces to overthrow the corrupt government, led by female president elect Coin (Julianne Moore, speaking in a low monotone voice that is suppose to resemble authority) who wants Katniss to become their spokesperson and leader of the uprising, its Mockingjay. Misdirected by Francis Lawrence, who doesn't build any tension in this part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is so S-L-O-W that it appears lifeless. While the other previous films had some spark and wit to them, this one is dreary and sanctimonious. Everyone is way too serious or bland or ready to cry a single tear to show that they are really hurting inside. Believe me, it's the audience that should be crying! A feeling of distress felt by these characters overcame me in the same way as I watched this dreadful film.The actors, especially Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine and a smirking self-righteous Donald Sutherland, do a yeoman-like job with a script that is filled with filler and lots of talk, but very little action. The script by Peter Craig and Danny Strong plods along with none of the speechifying being credible or interesting. Many of the more colorful characters established in this series are undervalued and underused. Fleeting moments of pleasure are given by Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and the aforementioned Josh Hutcherson. They are mere afterthoughts to the dull sluggish plot. Only the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as a controlling empowered publicist Plutarch Heavensbee and Elizabeth Banks as the vain Effie make an impression, giving the film a hint of comic relief it sorely needs.For a sci-fi adventure film, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 has very little of both, and no hunger games at all. This is one of the more disappointing sequels ever made, not deserving of one more chapter, let alone two. Teens may enjoy this dumb movie, but I suffered hunger pains watching this insufferable movie.

If you have read the book, then you would know that it was WAY too long and action-packed to be put into one movie. Yes, Mockingjay: Part 1 was not very action-packed, but that was the point! There were so many details in the book that you need to understand what is going on before you jump right into the action. I have read so many complaints that the movie was ""just a two hour preview"", but are you going to just jump into a war without knowing the details first? I, personally, am a huge fan of The Hunger Games books and movies. I think all of the movies have followed the books very well and they did a great job picking the actors. Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job portraying the emotions that she needs and she plays Katniss, the character, very well. She especially did a great job portraying the many emotions of a distressed Katniss after two games. It's also nice to have two extremely attractive prominent characters :). They, too, do a great job of portraying the characters from the book. The plot was not super action-packed, but that's how the book was. The first half started out in more details of District 13 and the rebellion that is starting. Overall, I think the movie was really good!

It is thought provoking and raw. I am a fan of the books, and this movie is about 80 percent book.

That it was boring. That it should not have been split into two films. These people are wrong.This movie is slow, but that is for the buildup leading into part 2.

In fact, the districts are rebelling now more than ever, and the war has started. She is in district 13, a district thought destroyed long ago. They have been underground this whole time though, and been planning for the war.This movie is different than the other two. it is darker. It is now transitioning into a war movie.

Her motivations become so muddled by yet another generic YA love triangle (screaming over Peeta and listlessly kissing Gale). This all certainly isn't helped by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence seemingly just doesn't understand the acting technique of subtlety. Her highly hysterical/overreacting character leaves much to be desired in regards to actual nuance—a case that would allow the viewers to look into her eyes and judge for themselves. Lawrence's sheer overacting has dominated most of her work since the Oscar win (actually, including Silver Linings Playbook as well) with this manner becoming even more noticeably cringe-worthy with Mockingjay Part 1. Her loud- mouthed/attention-provoking, apparently ""real"" persona has won many people over and her way of forcing her ""acting"" in audiences' faces (weeping, yelling, or generally acting in aggression in almost every other scene) makes it unsurprising as to why she's still in the public's favor.As for the narrative, the stakes always appear so heightened and forcibly gloom, but the resolutions are always so perfect to the point where it's difficult to seriously believe in the peril of the story's characters. In this addition, Katniss Everdeen has fully assumed the ""Mockingjay"" symbol—a public leader for the final revolution against the Capitol. More and more of the district's citizens have become aware of the atrocities committed by its government and the vileness of the Hunger Games. It's time to courageously fight back! Each one of these films possess very obvious—perhaps, even heavy-handed—analogies to the contemporary climate and the world's current circumstances when it comes to ""radical"" revolutionaries, government control/failure of democracy, media influence, etc. Considering that the series' premise centers on people who're forced to kill each other in order to survive, our primary characters always end up fine by the conclusion. ""Is he dead?"" ""Did they die?"" No, not for a minute am I convinced that anyone is on the brink of death. Maybe they'll make the drama and danger genuine in the finale next year, maybe not. Then again, it's the same annoying issue every expensive blockbuster suffers from these days, especially the Marvel films. (Yes, I know this is a film adaptation of a book series that's following an already-created narrative; it still doesn't change anything about the tale's quality or the right to criticize it.) On the other hand, this time around, we thankfully don't have to deal with the utterly predictable and tedious hunger game sections. Part 1 of this two-part climax reminds me of the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in that it focuses more on the set-up and grounded drama rather than the explosive ultimate battles, meaning that I'll likely prefer this one to next year's (yes, I much preferred the first part of Harry Potter's finale to the last half).Moreover, the stunning visuals/cinematography really does improve with every installment. The look of these films always seem to darken and grow starker with every new entry; the style of the franchise is very much its distinctive own. As a matter of fact, the exceptional sound mixing and grand production design drastically help distinguish this franchise from the innumerable cheap YA rip-offs that came after its success. Nonetheless, the overall cast, filled with bland pretty boys and unremarkable veteran performances, makes the entire film (which, keep in mind, is considerably shorter than its predecessors) feel like somewhat of a bore to get through. The objectives for the characters are set into motion fairly quickly, but most of the film is wasted on needless dialogue and repetitious scenes (""I love Peeta,"" and then, ""we have to rescue Peeta!"" about a dozen times throughout). It only makes it that much more obvious that the studio simply separated the films to blatantly cash in on the property—the newest irritating trend in the industry.","36 out of 68 found this helpful.

Many of the reviewers here went to see this movie expecting it to be awesome and were disappointed or didn't expect it to be that great and thus saw all the faults rather than the strengths that still brought the movie to light. I am a huge fan of both the books and the movies and am always going to see plenty of movies when I can. My review isn't just my thoughts and opinions, but more of an influence on why you should give the movie a chance.First, we should focus on what a lot of movie goers want in a film and how you should approach this movie. If you haven't read the series, it may seem like Jennifer Lawrence is a terrible actor, when in reality that's just her role in the film. Pick up the book and read it and you will understand her part a lot better. The dialogue may come across as weak, but you need to understand what is going on a bit by reading the book. You won't get a full understanding until then, because the book is from Katniss' point of view and you are reading her thoughts and feelings the whole time. Also, a lot of you people may be all about the action, fighting, and explosions. If that's really all you look for in a movie, then you don't know what you're talking about this being a bad movie.When you look at it from the book's perspective, you get your typical book to film movie. Hollywood almost never takes a book word for word and screws something up that people don't like. I'll admit there were definitely parts that they cut out of the book that I think they shouldn't have, but they did add things in for some of you just movie goers so you will understand what's going on a little better. The one thing I liked about the movie when comparing it to the book is that it still grabs the main and general concept of the first half of the book. The book is by far the weakest of the 3 in the trilogy in a sense that it is drawn out a bit and may come across a as boring sometimes, but when you look down deep enough it does have a strong story. The story is definitely still being told in the movie.I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but like the book it had it moments when it was a little boring. All these other reviews are strongly exaggerated with how boring and how stupid and pointless the movie is, but they are all just opinions. Also, there are always trollers who just hate everything so you can't always trust what other people think. Watch the movie for yourself and develop your opinion on the movie.I give this title 7 stars for a decent movie of a decent book.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first two were terrific, and no matter how many times I read the third book I just plain didn't like it. I didn't like the direction the story went, it lacked excitement and what made this series so interesting was completely missing. I wasn't crazy about the first movie, the second one was vastly improved and this movie might have been the best adaptation of the book that I've seen yet. I can tell you that this movie was more interesting to me than the first half of the third book. I've been going to the theater with the same group of people for all of these movies and I expected this one to be really bad and it wasn't. It kept my attention, the acting was decent (except for Liam Hemsworth, I still fail to understand why he's allowed to be in movies) and it created some suspense that the book didn't have. Aspects of the book that seemed downright silly didn't appear that way in the movie. It gives the finale some hope, not that I wouldn't go see it anyway. I give it an honest 7 out of 10 and I'm a pretty hard grader. It's worth going to see. It doesn't have the pizazz that Catching Fire did, but they're on the right track with this one. And a big reason it's not higher is because of the lack of material they had to work with. The last book in this series was really bad.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Mockingjay has all the piece-placing, anticipation-building and scene-setting with none of the payoff, and that can make it feel terribly flat. President Snow is a ruthless dictator. The capital lives in the lap of luxury. The lower districts are ready to revolt. These plot points were already established in the first two films, and here they're only further reinforced and expanded. When its second half arrives, this will probably feel much stronger than it does today, which is an interesting proposition because despite its inherent flaws it's very well-made. The landscape (both physical and political) is startlingly realized, easily the most grimly authentic of the series, and the majority of its star-studded cast carries their roles above and beyond what I'd encountered in print. The exception, strangely, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who quite clearly doesn't seem himself. It's a very unusual performance, one that instantly reminded me of Orson Welles's presence in the 80s animation Transformers: The Movie. Of course, Welles also passed just before completing his work, and with the benefit of hindsight it's clear that both already had one foot out the door. The film works, often quite well, but it's just not a whole product and that's problematic. Still, it's appropriately weighty, dark and explosive, with more depth than I thought it was capable of: an ultra-rare case of the screen outdoing the book.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was a wonderful experience. For those who are complaining about ""nothing really happens blah blah"" Didn't you see in the title that it is ""Mockingjay Part 1"". It's just the beginning of The End, which was an epic introduction that how great the last part will be. And I mean what else did you expect? For me it was a very good movie. It was really touching and I really enjoyed it and yeah it also gave me goosebumps at some points. Jennifer Lawrence once again has proved that she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. She really acted great. The rest of the cast did great too. People who are giving negative reviews, actually they are used to enjoy death-games of hunger games only. It's not only thrill and action that always matters.This movie is different from the first two movies because there were games in the first two movies, but now it's about the relationship between the Panem and The Capitol. But still there are a number of great thrilling scenes, which I really enjoyed, however, the sad thing is that I'll have to wait one year for the next part for which I am anxiously waiting. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, if you are a true movie fan you will really enjoy it. Thanks, have a good day.","26 out of 44 found this helpful.

The sets are massive and the look and feel of desolation is quite something to behold. The movie then moves at the usual break neck speed, with plenty of explosions and fast paced action sequences, that will keep fans satisfied. There is also a good sprinkling melancholy as you see Katrina feeling the strain and hopelessness of the situation she now finds herself in. If you enjoyed the first two movies, you will undoubtedly love this one, another well made movie and Francis Lawrence's direction is breathtaking at times. The Mockingjay Part 1 will have you eagerly waiting for Part 2 for sure.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Good.And the film delivers exactly what I expected. And because of this, it is, indeed, the weakest installment thus far.Why? Well, reread my first sentence. It is the first part of the third book....which means that, from the third book, all the good stuff is going to be in the SECOND part and this whole film is all about ramping up to the (what will most assuredly by) the epic conclusion of this series.That being said, this film still has many strengths, including Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence as she continues to shine as Katniss, this time as the woman who needs to rise and lead District 13 into a full on rebellion against The Capital while still trying to overcome the mental stress of all she has been through. And, of course, the very odd inclusion of the always great Julianne Moore as the rebellion leader, President Alma Coin.The groundwork which is set by the film no doubts raises expectations of the final film very high, but I could not also help by feel that there seemed to be things even I missed as I watched this film. As I sat there, taking it all in, I wondered exactly what Effie (Elizabeth Banks) was doing there....it kind of went unexplained. Exactly how much time passed between the last film and this one? And it seemed like a lot of my questions stems from items that were, indeed, somewhat changed from the book. Effie should not be such a prominent character this early on in the final story, but Banks' character proved to simply be too popular to ignore.That would be the only major downfall of this installment, and that is the lack of clarification of key points brought up in the film. But beyond that, everything else was right on par and I am most certainly looking forward to the final installment hitting theatres next November 20th.Grade: B","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Jennifer's charm proves to be the biggest asset of this movie, and she alone, singularly saves the film from being a total nonsense. Toward the end, it isn't clear whether the makers of the film have made their point (aside from making more money of course) in splitting the book into two movies. This first half only presents a preview of what to happen next in the other half, only stretched into two hours of tiring sameness and boring exchanges of bland dialogues. The new characters are interesting yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone of them has offered something more than Lawrence, to spark further interest. Well, at least we can take comfort from the fact that the last movie next year will certainly offer a lot more, gripping action and drama, and that's really something to look forward to.Mockingjay Pt.1 falls below the heights reached by the previous two films. Minus Lawrence, this film is a real bore, and its hard to seek something more than her to recommend. I give this film 6 of my 10 stars.

I'm now even further removed from the target demographics than for the first two Hunger Games movies. Regardless, I have read Suzanne Collins' trilogy and have now seen the 3 movies based on her books. Oh, wait. There will be FOUR movies, not three, from her source material. By definition, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is a warm-up act ... it's setting the stage for the finale which will be released in one year.So for this one we get a Hunger Games movie with no Hunger Games. In fact, there is very little combat action at all. Instead, we are witness to the strategic planning and ""selling"" of a war (think Wag the Dog), replete with short promo videos featuring Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) as the Mockingjay ... the rallying symbol of the rebels. There is a terrific scene featuring four great actors: Jennifer Lawrence, Julianne Moore (as President Coin), Jeffrey Wright (as Beetee) and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Plutarch). Four great actors in harmony elevating a movie based on YA novels. Pretty cool.With no Hunger Games, the color palette of the film is almost entirely grays and browns. Even Julianne Moore's famous red tresses are toned down to a streaked gray. The bleak look reminds of the Metropolis set, and also makes President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) vivid white wardrobe and beard stand in contrast to rest. Mr. Sutherland has another juicy scene flashing his devilish grin and twinkle. He's another example of the perfect casting, which extends to Elizabeth Banks (Effie), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), Stanley Tucci, and Mahershala Ali (as Boggs). You should expect much less Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) this time, but a little more Gale (Liam Hemsworth).Jennifer Lawrence proves again that her recurring role as Katniss is underrated from an acting perspective. She is now best known as an Oscar winner, but that doesn't affect the sincerity, emotion and tenacity that she exhibits here.This ending of Part 1 feels a bit awkward, but the break comes at the right time considering how the book is written. If you are a fan of the franchise, just accept that you will be buying a ticket for this move as well as next year's finale.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I am a huge fan of the books, so I had a general idea of what was going to take place in this film and where they would end it. I was a little disappointed with the movie, I still liked it very much but was a little disappointed. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is well thought-out, very well acted, but lacks the action and intensity that made the first and second films so enjoyable. Aside from adding in a few propo(propaganda pieces used in the film) scenes, the director did a pretty good job a keeping it true to the book. That is the problem though, it was one book and this is only half of it. The book was honestly a little boring for the first half compared to the other two, but was still a great book because it picked it up in the second half. The film obviously had scenes that were only there to lengthen the film and were very unnecessary and added little to nothing in terms of the plot. It would have been a much better film if it was closer to three hours and was just one film. That way they could have given the book adaption justice and would have been much better overall. Of course, they would make nearly double the money by splitting the book into two parts which is the only reason why they did it. The director did his best with what he was given and I give him much credit for making it a very enjoyable film. What made this film still incredibly enjoyable to me was the acting ensemble they had. They have so much great actors and actresses across the board that they used tremendously well throughout the movie. Jennifer Lawrence(surprise, surprise) still gave the best performance. She continues to perfectly convey the personality and attitude that is Katniss Everdeen. Liam Hemsworth also did a outstanding job since this is the film that gives the most screen time. He is no Peeta Mellark to me, but he did a nice job at playing the tough, honest guy who you can tell really wants Katniss to love him the say way he loves her. Josh Hutcherson has far less screen time in this film, but was given a much more challenging role. I was curious to see how he would take to it since it is abnormal for a character to have to change his entire personality during a film. He was brilliant. He exceeded everyone's expectations and I have very high hopes for him in the final Hunger Games. The rest of the ensemble did very well. Woody Harrelson continually gave the audience nice laughs throughout the film. It is up to you on this, I think you should see this film in theaters, but you will honestly have a better experience if you just wait to see this a little before you see the final Hunger Games. Still, I think you should see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 at some point, whether it is in theaters or on DVD.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

And why I bother...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3406715/?ref_=tt_urv","Karin_Reimertz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11869024/?ref_=tt_urv","1 February 2016","First, let me start with saying that I do like a lot of books that has been made into movies. I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter movies/books and loved ""The Golden Compass"" and was so sad that the sequels of ""His dark materials"" where cancelled. So I do understand and generally don't mind that a movie can never capture a book completely, and that sometimes it's necessary to change or remove some scenes. My problem with The Hunger Games movies – and this one especially – is that it's not the scenes that's been altered but the personalities of the characters. When doing so, it becomes a completely different movie. Think of it, what if you put Winne the Pooh and his gang into the Avengers movies or vice versa? Yes, maybe it would have been really interesting movies, but you would never dare to claim that it is a remake of the book. Katniss, but also Johanna, Haymitch, Gale, and several more characters have become something a lot more mainstream. And I'm usually not a feminist, but I can't help but getting really annoyed that Katniss is so weak, bleak and boring in the movie. In the books she has all of these strengths and weaknesses and not to mention free thinking of her own – while in the movie(s) she's just showed around like a pawn and not bothered about it at all. Given that this is a movie with a younger audience I think it's so sad to withhold them a picture of a strong female role model, a young woman who both bleeds and fights. In the books people are afraid of her, admire her, trusts her, loves her. But in this movie she just becomes this boring girl who rarely speaks up and even more rarely are being listened to. Why are we still so afraid to make a movie with a strong, female role model? If you are watching this with your teen daughter, or if you are reading this knowing that she has or will see this movie, give her the books. Show her who Katniss really are.If I try to put this aside, as hard as it is, you end up with a good movie. It's not amazing, but it is your time worth. You have some really strong actors who are really giving their everything to the script. Kudos to both Harrelson (Haymitch) and Hutcherson (Peeta) for trustworthy playing their roles as two of the most important characters next to Katniss. The scenes are most of the times breathtakingly beautiful and Suzanne Collins world of tomorrow has really come alive. One thing I can't help thinking though is; if you haven't read the book to you really get what the fight is about? I'm afraid without more of the questions raised in the background, this just becomes another ""fight the bad guy just because we said he was a bad guy"" movie. And what message does that send to the audience? And as a viewer, if this movie just blends into any other teen action movie, then what's it really worth?Teachers – read the books with your students and especially teachers in higher grades working with media related subjects, bring these thoughts into your classroom. And if you aren't a teacher or a concerned parent, watch this and sit through two hours of good enough action.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Especially considering that I hate the last book in the trilogy. Even so, the way Francis, the cast and the gifted production crew managed to astound and emote me throughout.However, what I found most surprising was how the movie affected my husband. He is not a reader, whatsoever, and indulges my obsession with this franchise because it makes me happy. So, I tend to consider his opinion pretty unbiased. He loved Mockingjay Part 1. He found the plot and character development from the last movie fascinating. He even developed a grudging respect and the pity for Peeta (a character he has only shown disdain for over the last 2 movies because his characterization has been so poorly established). Just about the only thing he didn't like was that the movie cut off--ended. He was so unsatisfied. I asked him if he understood why the movie had to be split, if he believed what he had seen could've been accomplished in that kind of detail if everything that was left to be resolved had been crammed into another 30 to 45 minutes of film.

He does not want to wait a year to find out what happens and, believe me, he does not want any hints. He found the movie compelling.If Mockingjay Part 1 can do this for someone complete uninitiated into the world Collins created... and am going to go ahead and call it a triumph.","27 out of 46 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3359809/?ref_=tt_urv","keithlovesmovies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34445672/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2015","Following her rescue from the devastating Quarter Quell, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) awakes in the complex beneath the supposedly destroyed District 13. Her home, District 12, has been reduced to rubble, and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is now the brainwashed captive of President Snow (Donald Sutherland). At the same time, Katniss also learns about a secret rebellion spreading throughout all of Panem, a rebellion that will place her at the center of a plot to turn the tables on Snow.So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far. I think I must have been the only one who hasn't yet. It's human nature for things in the second film to not seem as climactic when you've previously known things about films past and future. This review will be based on this.So this is the last one before the next entry comes out. This one picks up right where the last film, Catching Fire, left off with Katniss (Lawrence) being saved from the last Hunger Games. She wakes up within the underground complex comprising the supposedly destroyed District 13. She soon learns of a rebellion developing amongst the other 11 districts. District 12, Katniss and Peeta's (Hutcherson) home, was destroyed by President Snow (Sutherland) and the Capitol. This rebellion, led by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), hopes to unite the people of the remaining districts against Snow and the Capitol. Seeing that Katniss has gained a following amongst the people of the Districts following her actions in the last few Hunger Games, Coin and Heavensbee aim to court her to be the face behind their rebellion. Initially skeptical of joining, she eventually decides to join. With interference from the Capitol and the brainwashed pleas to stop the war by Peeta who was kidnapped by the Capitol, Katniss must rally the people of Panem to their cause. So the film took a different direction from the previous two films in that it is less about the actual Hunger Games (which I've always found silly) and more about developing the backstory behind the world which I've enjoyed so far. I still don't know how their world came to be but seeing it as it is now was interesting enough. I just wish I had seen more since I didn't get a chance to see the results of their actions just yet which is why I hate it when they split stories into two films. Also because of that (I think), there wasn't as much action as I would have liked but I think they might (I hope) make up for that in the next part. The one thing that has been consistent with the series so far has been the quality of the acting and it is no different here. I found that Lawrence and Hutcherson did the best with what they had which was primarily set up for the next film. I think Hutcherson was good but I did not agree with the use of his character in this film as I found that it did not add much. I also thought the returning supporting characters, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) (just to name a few), were good as well. Some may not like the pace of the film since it is a little slower than previous films and the purpose of the film serves as buildup for the next film but I mildly disagree as I thought it could have been better but I wasn't completely disappointed. Overall, this is another decent entry in the series, albeit a buildup to the next film. I'll just say that the next film better be great.Score: 6.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot consists of Katniss finding a bunch of nothing and talking to people once. She barely does anything at all that genuinely has anything to do with the plot. The movie is abysmal at best and should be avoided so movie companies stop ruining finales by splitting them into 2 parts. The same thing happened with Harry Potter. Part 1 was slow, dull and overall, a horrible experience. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 follows the same pattern.

I thought that the first one was a bad version of Battle Royal (yes, no matter how the writer denies it, there are too many similarities to the story for it to be a coincidence). The second movie I just found terrible. I didn't plan on going to see this third movie, but my friend convinced me to go anyway. I didn't plan on reviewing this movie, but I was so annoyed by it that I had to. The writing for this movie is just awful. I can't blame the actors for their performances, there is only so much they can do with the material. I think they did okay with what they had, but that didn't make it good. Overall the movie was just boring. The pacing was really slow. Not a lot seemed to be happening. And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, Katniss starts to sing a horrible song. And when I thought it couldn't get worse than that, a choir starts to sing along with her! I would never ever recommend this movie to anyone. I must not be the right audience for it. What I would have liked to have seen in this movie was Katniss and Peeta get together and be forever referred to as either KatPee or PeeNiss. I'd settle for any one of those.","16 out of 27 found this helpful.

"","","Money Making Gimmick but the Film is Good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3137542/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2014","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 (2014) *** (out of 4) The third film in the popular series appears to be getting some heat from fans and critics and for some pretty good reasons but at the end of the day there's no question that the film contains the great acting and compelling characters from the previous two. This time out, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is recruited by President Coin (Julianne Moore) to lead the rebellion against the Capitol but her heart remains with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and makes her question what she should do.I guess I'll start with the controversy. People have complained that not much really happens in this film and I would certain agree with that. It's clear that the studio wanted to make as much money as possible so they broke this final film into two so that people would have to fork over double the money. By doing that they've made part 1 someone laid back, character driven and without too much action. I understand the studio wanting to make money but at the same time I can't help but think that everything covered in this here's two-hour running time could have been done in forty-five minutes and then we could have gotten to the events that are going to be in part 2.WIth that said, it's somewhat hard to really be too critical of the actual part 1 because once the second film is released we can just view them as one and when that happens, I think fans and critics will be a little kinder to this here.I thought for the most part the story was good and I didn't mind too much that they tried to deliver more of a character and emotional drama than just pure action. I thought there was one reason this work and that's because we're given such a terrific cast who are strong enough of actors that they can keep us drawn in. Lawrence, who has obviously became one of the best actresses out there today, has no problem in her role, although I must admit that I wondered if the screenwriter was just wanting to see how many different ways she could cry. Either way, Lawrence was terrific as is Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Moore and of course the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth are good as well.I will say that visual the film was pretty impressive and I thought the CGI here was much better than in the previous two movies. The music score is top-notch as you'd expect and there's no doubt that the cinematography perfectly captures everything. Again, I understand why people feel ripped off but in the end, the entertainment value is what counts and while this is the weakest of the three films, there's no question that it does its job in making you want to see the next installment.F.T.B.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This doesn't usually work and one part of the double bill or trilogy is always just a 2 hour (3 hour in the case of The Hobbit) build up. Katniss, after destroying the games, becomes a symbol for the rebellion and tries to save Peeta for the Capitol. This is the weakest of the franchise, but I enjoyed it more than others have. Mockingjay Part 1's main problem is the lack of action, but it manages to get away with it just about. Thankfully it's not another Breaking Dawn Part 1. It can feel like something waiting for happen for 2 hours, but it's a pleasant wait. The acting is excellent, and Jennifer Lawrence is a great heroine aside from an overdone nightmare waking up scene. Donald Sutherland doesn't appear that much, but he's wonderful as President Snow. It's still got politics and emotional depth which is what makes the franchise maybe the best YA adaptation series of them all, and the depth combined with the acting places it far above the Harry Potter films.It certainly comes up short on the action front, but there's enough going on to hold the attention. The trouble is that the film is a blatant cash grab and you can't help but yearn for a 3 hour finale instead of 2 films. Do we really need another hugely anticipated release in 2015? This is well made in many ways, but the endlessly drained colour palette occasionally evokes memories of Twilight and the last few Harry Potter films in a bad way. I still enjoyed this movie and it has plenty of drama which makes it very watchable, but there's too much filming political videos and not enough actually happening. They have a good twist and jump scare at the end though. A decent but disappointing sequel which I enjoyed, but without the acting this would be less bearable. I might go as far as to call this slightly underrated, but the way this is just unnecessary is fairly off putting. Still, it makes us even more eager for the final chapter.7/10","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It doesn't matter how it looks, but what it represents - and, for that, nothing better than makeup to sell the product well. The propaganda war between Presidents Snow (Donald Sutherland) and Coin (Julianne Moore) is created, where it is curious to note that both exploit the same tactic. If presenter Caeser Flickerman (Tucci) is biased to the extreme, the resistance film crew also seeks to explore Katniss's emotions in her favor, without the least bit of shame. The end justifies the means, some would say. But if this is true for resistance, wouldn't it also be true for Capital? At least in relation to the method of conduct, there is not that much difference. This similarity deepens even more when he sees the almost tyrannical way in which Coin rules and the fact that, however much she defends democracy, there is not the slightest indication that she has been elected to the position she holds. Once again, good and evil are not that far away in relation to the way of acting, which in itself arouses a series of considerations about the philosophy behind the series.It is precisely this political game behind the scenes that is the most interesting in Mockingjay- Part 1, be it for the manipulative / manipulated duality or for the twists and turns that the script holds. On this board, Katniss and Peeta are mere pawns whose emotions serve the interest of the moment, however much the relationship between them serves as the main line of the script. It is also interesting to note how the other pieces (Haymitch, Effie, Plutarch, Beetee) are relocated in this new reality, each according to their interests: some because of their beliefs, others due to their lack of choice or sense of opportunity.If, on the one hand, it is interesting to see the media manipulation imposed by both the rebels and the Capital with Peeta's interview, on the other hand the hype seems empty. Much expectation is created at all times to make way for nothing. It seems that something is always going to happen, but when it is about to reach a climax, the wait is frustrated. Basically, everything revolves around this small part of the story. Something that could be solved in an hour of film - at most. After all, in the first 60 minutes, the viewer is confronted with a monotonous narrative in which Katniss slowly regains her personality, making visits to territories such as District 8, where an improvised hospital operates and where one of the rare action scenes in this sequence takes place. In fact, this is the film in which explosions and struggles give rise to speeches by social critics. This first part of the adaptation of ""Mockingjay"", has very few action scenes, being more focused on the media war between the rebels of District 13 and the tyrannical Capital.Bearing in mind that the film's narrative is practically all directed towards Katniss (there are rare moments when the character is not on stage), the setting of the story follows its protagonist. There is a contrast between the opulence of the Capital and the poverty of the 12 districts and we began to explore together with the character the besieged environment that is District 13, with quick visits to some other environments touched by the war, especially District 12. Katniss dives in a war environment, where almost everything is plunged into gray practicality. District 13's own scenarios are reminiscent of a war submarine, linear and tight. Seeing the extrovert and hitherto multicolored Effie (Elizabeth Banks) without her extravagant wigs, makeup and strange clothes is the biggest representative of this reality shock for Katniss and the public. Another shock is Peeta's gradual debilitation, portrayed with care by Josh Hutcherson.The Hunger Games arena is left out of this film so that we can get behind the scenes of this revolution. With the action fundamentally taking place at the underground headquarters of the rebellion, in devastated District 13, what we have is darkness and even the beauty of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is hidden, rendered speechless by the demands of a heavy story as it should be. This complete change of tone in relation to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire shows the production's courage in doing something different, which will not necessarily please everyone. For that very reason, it is at least necessary to respect what Lionsgate managed to put on the screens.Just as it happened in the first film in the saga, it is gradually that Katniss accepts the role that destiny has imposed on her. Again showing rare courage in blockbusters aimed at teenagers, Francis Lawrence does not shy away from showing images like burnt bodies and crowds machine-gunned by soldiers from the Capital. Katniss' reactions in those moments collide with the pragmatic coldness of Alma Coin, composed by Julianne Moore as someone who has long since passed the point of allowing herself to feel any passion. In fact, it is palpable that Coin and Snow have more in common than the first lets on (and perhaps doesn't even realize it). The propaganda game played by the intelligent Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) depends on Katniss, and the girl's speeches and actions, in order to work with the public, need to be spontaneous and authentic. Thus, Jennifer Lawrence finds herself quite demanded. Not only because of the character's almost omnipresence in the narrative, but because of the range of emotions it requires from Katniss, which ranges from the traumatized girl to the warrior symbol of the rebellion. And, once again, the young actress is up to the challenge. The confidence in Lawrence is such that the production has the luxury of placing Sutherland, Hoffman and Moore in smaller participations, since we follow the story unfolding basically through the eyes of Katniss. The feature film still uses this to its advantage by placing the young woman away from the most elaborate action scenes, relegating her to the role of spectator and creating greater tension in those moments.To give vent to this strong political tone present in the story, director Francis Lawrence needed to make important changes to the series. In addition to the visual change, there are far fewer action scenes compared to previous episodes, as well as greater psychological development of the heroine. There is also a certain loss of dynamics in the narrative, largely due to overly elongated sequences and the very reflective tone that guides part of the film. It is too early to say whether it is to blame the decision to split a book into two films, but this Part 1 could have a shorter duration if it went through a more rigorous edition. The division, for those who read the books, in fact complies with the much desired fidelity in adapting books for the big screen, taking care to create scenes for the smallest details ever written, but fails to win over viewers who do not know the book and, consequently, they have to deal with a film without major events. The division's decision diminishes the brightness of the work as a cinema, in addition to the high risk of transforming the second half into an endless climax, taking the focus away from the introspective moments, the great dramatic force of the series so far.If Mockingjay escaped the trap of the necessarily more explosive sequel, it failed to escape another, which, in fact, is almost a disease in Hollywood: the division of films into several parts in the name of profit. Harry Potter and The Hobbit suffered from this and Mockingjay is the latest victim. There was not enough material for four hours of projection (each of the final two chapters will have slightly more than two hours) and this is evident with the thematic repetition, with Katniss returning to her old district twice, with the same images, the that kills any impact and excruciating delay in understanding Peeta's painfully obvious situation.As a result, Mockingjay loses its rhythm several times, literally looking like a long and inexplicably extended prelude to action. Action that never comes, by the way. There is only one busy sequence in the projection - that of the hospital in District 8, which fulfills its function of showing who the Thrush is and it is surprisingly short and economical, with the production focusing much more on Coin's eternal speeches and interviews Caesar Flickerman's (Stanley Tucci, underutilized) television shows with Peeta. The problem caused by the lack of cadence in the stretched script ends up erasing characters that could have been better used, such as Finnick (Sam Claflin) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), in addition to demanding too much of the viewer's patience with slow, contemplative plans and without any kind of reward. Esperança literally looks like what it is: the beginning of an unfinished film.Mockingjay - Part 1 is a good film that points out instigating paths for the series, but, paradoxically, it is also the least impactful. The adaptation is surprisingly faithful to the source material, in addition to having the courage to be a different film compared to the two that came before. The division of Mockingjay prevents a full assessment, but this ""beginning of the end"" certainly validates The Hunger Games as the most courageous and contradictory product of current pop culture. At the same time that it addresses complex issues, condemning social imbalance and the manipulation of the media without fear of showing its own violence. In this part 1, the action drama with political touches manages to give drama to the story and deepen its characters, leaving the action aside (even if it exists and spectacular) to deliver something bigger: a blockbuster with social criticism. However, its narrative claudication, caused by a slow and rhythm less script, prevents the Thrush from taking higher flights.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The adaptation of 'Mockingjay' didn't need to be split into two parts; doing so dampens only the effect of both movies. What stops it from being a complete waste of time is the fact that it's actually quite conceptually interesting, ditching the series' customary death games in favour of a propaganda battle which comments on the use of manipulated media in wartime. The hero is transformed into an unwilling mouthpiece for the rebellion, used by the seemingly 'good' District 13 as much as she was used by the more obviously 'evil' capitol. The difference is that here she is weaponised as a means of rebellion, whereas before she was meant as a reinforcement of oppression. Sadly, the film itself is honestly rather dull for most of its runtime. It takes ages to get going and never quite gets out of second gear. It lacks a true finale, principally because its sequel is an extended version of it, and just isn't as compelling as either of its predecessors. It isn't bad, but it's certainly the weakest in its series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For me the important thing was seeing a very good actress in Jennifer Lawrence and I was not disappointed. The wig that she wore was somewhat distracting, but she is a class act nevertheless. I do wish that Woody Harrelson and Phillip Seymour Hoffman had more screen time and dialogues as they provide a comfort zone for me. They are that good.

Going into this movie you must know, There are no games, There isn't a lot of action but there is killer suspense, and great acting by Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. The film begins where Catching fire left off, in the opening scenes I thought I was watching a Horror movie, It WAS that dark. In District 13, Katniss Everdeen is very emotionally unstable as she learns that her hometown District 12 is destroyed and no longer exists. District 13 Leader President Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Try to convince Katniss to become the symbol for the long brewing revolution, but Katniss Isn't down with that, not until Coin agrees to rescue Peeta and the other tributes.This film is very dark and emotional, scene after scene there are people being executed, shot to death or blown up. But there's also a great action sequence in the movie that features ""The Hanging Tree"" sung by Jennifer Lawrence, Which she did a great job of.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a great political thriller, it is mostly a media war consisting of Propaganda video vs Capitol Propaganda video. Towards the end of the film it gets very intense and suspenseful, the ending scenes reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty, so if you enjoy extremely emotional films and War. This is one you want to watch.But if you're expecting tons of action sequences, maybe waiting for Part 2 is something you should consider. I think people have confused themselves into thinking Part 1 will be full of action, it isn't, but It's very good and stays true to the book, in fact the most faithful book to movie adaptation I've ever seen.That's why I give The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 | 8/10 Stars, Roll on Part 2.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

But this is Hollywood greed and short sightedness at it's absolute worst. They took one book and attempted to split it into two films, essentially taking one or two minor plot points and stretching them out over two unenjoyable grueling hours. If you have NOT seen this film yet do yourself a favor and wait for it to show up on cable for free AND for you to be terribly ill and perhaps half out of it on medication, for you'll need to be to be in order to endure this plot less plodding mess of a film. Simply out there is no movie here. Just a lot of better than fine actors walking around doing nothing. It's that bad.

This chapter is based on the first half of the final book (titled 'Mockingjay') and deals with Katniss Everdeen (once again played by Jennifer Lawrence) having to become a symbol for the rebellion, in their war against the ruthless Capitol. It was directed by Francis Lawrence (who also directed 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE') and written by Peter Craig and Danny Strong. Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Sam Claflin, Jeffrey Wright, Stanley Tucci, Willow Shields, Jena Malone and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman all reprise their roles from the other films and Julianne Moore joins the cast. I loved every minute of it and in many ways think it's an improvement over the previous two films!The story picks up right where the last film left off; Katniss (Lawrence) has suffered a mental breakdown and is having a horrendous time adapting to life at District 13, with the other rebels. She also can't get over the fact that Peeta (Hutcherson) was taken by the Capitol and she'll do almost anything to get him back. Plutarch (Hoffman) introduces Katniss to the leader of the rebellion, President Coin (Moore), and they ask her to be their movement's symbol, in propaganda adds, to incite a rebellion. She reluctantly agrees under the condition that they rescue Peeta, and the other captives at the Capitol. The rest of the film deals with Katniss struggling to adapt to her new role, as the face of the revolution; 'The Mockingjay'.There's been some criticism over the fact that the final book was split into two films and that there's not enough action in this installment to make it as worthwhile a filmgoing experience, as the other movies. I strongly disagree. I think this chapter is much better because of it. There's so much character development and believable human drama that any true fan of film should be thoroughly satisfied. We also get some great acting; Lawrence gives the best performance of the series here and it's arguably one of the best of her career. She also has a lot of help from multiple veteran actors, like Hoffman and Moore. Peeta doesn't have nearly as much screen time, as he did in the other movies, but he's always a strong and pivotal part of the plot. Gale (Hemsworth) is in a lot more scenes, this time around, but he's still just as underdeveloped (he has one powerful dialogue moment though; where he's at least given a chance to show some acting ability). The love triangle definitely doesn't feel necessary anymore, it's obvious that Katniss loves Peeta but the certainty of how Peeta's character will end up is certainly still up in the air. I also enjoyed how much more epic this film feels, over the last two, it really feels like the first half to the conclusion of a classic sci-fi trilogy. The directing, cinematography and music are all breathtaking to watch, as well, and we get to hear Jennifer Lawrence sing! Fans that only look forward to action are sure to be disappointed but everyone else should be more than pleased!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/RGEBSjKSuEk","40 out of 72 found this helpful.

It's a solid foundation to what has honestly been for me the best movie adaptation for a young adult book series.There are moments of tension, menace, suspense and rousing inspiration. Propaganda, symbols, strategic discourse these are the elements that further flesh out the world of this series to make it feel grounded in spite of the survivalist set-pieces in the previous two. There was a moment towards the end where I was genuinely quite surprised with how nasty it got. This is what good YA fiction can do, incorporate some tough adult themes with strong characters to allow them to bridge the gap between adolescence and adulthood.It would be hard for me to pick it apart because I would be afraid that the stuff I did like would have been destined to be cut out. Director Francis Lawrence continues to show the sharp and purposeful direction seen in Catching Fire. Jennifer Lawrence keeps pushing herself as Katniss in this third film, her performances grow increasingly informed with every portrayal, in spite of what must be a punishing shoot her register is never one of complacency. The film does seem unsure of where to go at times but the foundation has been more than solidly set, they have taken advantage of the suspect conditions under which the movie was made.People often point to how The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy or some other Marvel pop fluff piece is the second coming of Star Wars, I must disagree. To me after Catching Fire it became clear if there was ever to be an adequate contemporary equivalent to Star Wars, it would be this. The characters, politics and social equivalences mirror that of Star Wars in tone and structure on more than a few occasions but with the Hunger Games we are firmly in another equally well realized world and Katniss is the perfect protagonist for this adventure.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nothing actively bad about it, but at the end of it all, it does seem like while things happened, nothing much of importance really happened. Saying that, it's still well-made and pretty entertainingWhat I did have a problem with was Katniss' characterization. I don't think the first two films and this one really connect in terms of her characterization. I get that she's traumatized, but putting only one person ahead of the whole nation? That selfish? She just never showed this side in the first two films. I'm not okay with her being in love with Peeta, I thought it would've been so much better if it had just remained a strong friendship. But alas, the problem really lies with just how annoying she was. I get that people behave differently in different circumstances, but it just felt like such a wildly different character several times.But really, it's a good film, aside from Katniss' problems. Although gurl, if you don't want Liam Hemsworth, I'll take him. Considering how hot he is and how completely selfless he is, how anyone could NOT want him over any other guy is itself a flaw (kidding)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yesterday, I begrudgingly watched Mockingjay Pt 1 with my son, and was surprised at how much I liked it.What makes this penultimate chapter so much better than its predecessor—despite being rather light in the action department—is the progression in the story, which is now far more epic in scope, following Katniss as she leaves the confines of the Hunger Games arena to become The Mockingjay, the face of District 13's rebellion against President Snow and his dictatorship. What started out as a rather blatant teen version of Battle Royale has developed into a complex, gritty political drama wrought with emotion, its star Jennifer Lawrence now able to deliver a powerful performance worthy of her talent.Having fanned life back into the once dying embers, I hope that Mockingjay part 2 will end the series with a bang, packing in some of the action that this one clearly held back from delivering.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

What a day it was to see this film!! I've been a fan of these movies because they embody for me the same cause and ideas that revolutions in my country have stood for. I bet the many fans of this film (who are just obsessed with the love triangle) are not aware of how realistic and relevant it is to events happening in Egypt, and in other corrupted political systems around the world.I will NOT try to refute all the reviews that deemed this film as 'BORING'. I understand their argument, but this film is an indispensable emotional transition between a story about a brutal reality show, to a story about a freaking revolution!! And if you see it that way, it won't be boring!! The military corruption and spirit of rebellion captured in the film, is something all Egyptians like me have lived through. The whole cast rendered this spirit beautifully. Jennifer Lawrence, I was so happy that she pulled off that rage that makes the audience hate brutal regimes (The Capital) as much as Katniss does. Josh Hutcherson gave a powerful heart-breaking performance that reminds me of all the brainwashed people we have in Egyptian media. And last but not least, Mr. Sutherland successfully portrayed our previous AND CURRENT presidents who just enslave their people. Thank you Donald!! I know I'm hailing the film as great because I can relate to its political context. But even if the film is not actually great, it has redefined the YA genre with the importance of its message, which redeems ALL its flaws for me. Knowing that there are people out there, especially teenagers, who will connect with this film and understand how tyrannical systems work, makes me hopeful about the future leaders of this world.I can't wait for the FIGHT to start in Part 2as well as the THIRD revolution in my country!!!","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

You have the hook, you have the set up, the character descriptions, some action, some life changing decisions, the twists and so on. Since part 1 of part 3 is just half a story, you only get the set up! The hook is presumably in the first two movies, but let's say we have a weak one at the beginning of the film, as well. And then it goes something like ""Tomorrow... Panem!"" and the movie ends.One year later, you get the second movie, which starts where this one ended and it's overly long and obviously artificially so. However, Part 1 is not so bad. In fact, I would say it is definitely better than the second part. The characters are described, their motivations laid bare, we only need the action stuff, that doesn't really happen here. However this slowness of pace is also what forces the actors and movie makers to improve on the quality of the exposition.That doesn't make it a great movie, but it is a decent one, and it certainly raises expectations.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games concept is a copy of Battle Royal. When a writer is trying to develop the concept to be something else than young people killing each others - well - the result is quite boring. This movie could have been a 15 minutes intro to the next movie. In order to add some excitement they are adding small scenes that have nothing to do with the story or the story boarding. I have forgot all about the characters from the last movie - and I don't care. The only thing I can do is to be amused/entertained by Donald Sutherland's evilness. Jennifer Lawrence is not a bad actress at all - but her acting skills are not sufficient to save this movie alone. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman is/was indeed a great actor is role is to small as well to make any difference.This movie is a disappointment - and they are ""milking the cow"" shamelessly.","18 out of 32 found this helpful.

As per the title, the 3rd novel is being split into 2 movies, ala recent other young adult novel series last installment being split in two movies. As someone who has read the books, I felt there was more than enough material to justify two movies. The movie picks up where the last one – ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" left off, with protagonist Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, living in District 13, after being liberated from the Arena by the Rebellion. District 13 President Alma Coin, played by Julianne Moore & former Game Head, revealed as a Rebel at the end of Catching Fire, Plutarch Heavensbee, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, want Katniss to literally be the MockingJay, the face of the revolution. Katniss is still mad over the failure to rescue Peeta, by Josh Hutcherson, from the Arena, but as one would expect, she eventually acquiesces with a couple of conditions. Jennifer Lawrence is once again outstanding as ever playing Katniss. In the last movie, Jena Malone was the scene stealer as Tribute Johann Mason. This movie it would be Natlie Dormer, as Cressida, the Director of filmed propaganda pieces, that Katniss has agreed films to help spur on the rebellion. In her fairly brief scenes, she portrays a power and confidence in her character. Elizabeth Banks, returning as Effie Trinkett is also a stand out, and Woody Harrelson, also returning as Haymitch Abernathy continue his great performance in the series. For the most part I liked it, particularly the mending of scenes in the book in one of the final sequences in the movie, which effectively build tension, and other variations of things in the book. My rating may go up on second viewing, for now - 3 ¼ stars out of 4.","20 out of 33 found this helpful.

I think that the cast is awesome, except I don't like that the guy who is playing Peeta is about 5'1 in height. Peeta is supposed to be 6 foot at the least.

President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is holding Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) hostage and using him as a media tool. Katniss does a deal with District 13 President Coin (Julianne Moore) to rescue the Victors in exchange for her being the Mockingjay symbol of the resistance.I like the idea of Wag the Dog. However it has to be executed with precision. Those scenes of trying to handle Katniss could have been funny or foreboding. Woody Harrelson has some fun but there are too many awkward moments with the media idea. The writing needs to be sharper. Katniss indirectly causes the destruction of the hospital and it doesn't even occurs to her.I don't mind limiting the action in this episode. It's trying to set up a lot of things for the finale. Although the rescue ending could have been an exciting sequence. It needs Katniss joining the rescue team. The switching back and forth drains the tension out of the action. It wouldn't cost that much and it would be a great way to end the movie. At the very least, it would silence most of the complainers about the lack of action. This is a good set up for the finale. There are some awkwardness and minor annoyances. Lawrence is able to deliver on a difficult role. There are some good additions to the franchise. I expect a great explosive final chapter.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Good half of a chapter; it'll be essential viewing come 2015","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3139070/?ref_=tt_urv","squirrel_burst","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55782634/?ref_=tt_urv","9 December 2014","I find reviewing ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" to be kind of tricky. I'm literally seeing half the story, which means we have a beginning, a middle and kind of an ending, but not really. I suppose in a way the movie feels somewhat underwhelming, but then again, anytime you go into a movie where a portion of the title is dedicated to ""Part 1"", can you really expect a big action-packed climax and a resolution to all of the plots? It tells you from the get-go that you're only seeing half the movie here. Despite this, on its own, we are just seeing the first half of a bigger story and that makes this easily the weakest of all of the ""Hunger Games"" films. Does that make it bad? Not at all, it just means that it is incomplete. I think it's only fair that we all re-evaluating how good this film is when the whole story is concluded, but I still feel like in the mean time, there's plenty of material here to make it worth your while. If you haven't seen the previous chapters, this is not a good point to suddenly jump in. At the end of the last film, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her new allies escaped from the Hunger Games. Unfortunately, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) has been left behind and captured by President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Learning that her home District has been completely annihilated by military forces as punishment for her rebellion, Katniss prepares herself to become the symbol of the rebellion against the Capitol.While in the first two films there was plenty of action to balance out the character drama, this film is much more focused on the emotions of the characters. There are a lot of things going on here. Peeta has been captured by Snow and he's probably feeling pretty betrayed by the fact that he's waiting on Katniss to come and rescue him. Our heroine feels guilty about leaving her friend (is it OK to call him her boyfriend at this point?) behind and also feels outrage at what happened to her home. She wants to go up to the old tyrant and shoot an arrow right through his forehead. On the other hand, she doesn't want to get manipulated into being a figurehead for a cause she doesn't believe in. Then we've got other angles as the relationship between Katniss and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) is being tested and the strange relationship between Snow and Katniss. Just because you're not going to see nearly as much of Katniss jumping around shooting her trademark bow, doesn't mean this film is lacking in material. Seeing the movie actually really made me appreciate the performances and the characters that we've seen develop throughout these films. If you're planning on seeing ""Mokingjay part 1"", I'd highly recommend that you freshen up on the first two films, particularly if you haven't seen them since they were released in theatres because it will give you a whole new appreciation for the story that's developing here.There is a good mix of big developments and small intimate moments here. As much as I liked seeing the seeds for the rebellion against the Capitol being sown and seeing Katniss debate whether or not she wanted to join up with the fight, I think I actually enjoyed the quieter moments more. I realized that some of the characters that I didn't take seriously when the series started have really started to grow on me. The best example has to be Elizabeth Banks as Effie. I distinctly remember thinking that her character was just a generic, airhead minion for the big bad in the first film, but now more than ever I see her as a truly three-dimensional character. If we have to sacrifice action for more intimate moments with the people of this world, I'm not entirely opposed to it. I'm even less offended at the idea knowing that when the next part of the story comes around, all of the big action and epic conclusions we've been waiting for since 2012, when the first ""Hunger Games"" was released is going to be there. A bit of quiet time before the storm ensures that everyone watching the movie will care about what the outcomes are.I'll admit there were times where I did find myself craving sequences with Katniss going around kicking butt instead of seeing the dominos get set up for the big conclusion. Combine that with the fact that the movie has an ending, but not a big splashy one like you would prefer seeing and yes, that does mean that some people are going to be disappointed with this film. Just keep in mind that there is more coming. This is only Part 1, and they're getting ready to load that one in the firing chamber, it's not like there's any chance whatsoever that we're not going to get a conclusion to this franchise, so just calm down. ""Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is setting up the high stakes for the final fight, and it will be essential viewing when November 2015 comes around. If you're a fan of these movies, just keep that in mind and I think you'll be more than happy with the movie, even happier when part 2 finally arrives and we get to see how it all comes together.

Trapped in a plane in an intercontinental flight, the choice was THG:M1 or movies I had already watched. So I selected it. I had not seen THG, but I had heard good things about it. I was not expecting a life- changing experience, but something entertaining. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is a life-changing experience, in all the wrong ways. Not only was it unable to relieve the intense boredom of a long haul flight - it made it worse. This movie has not plot, makes no sense, is ridiculous from beginning to end. There is no saving grace to it, not even Miss Lawrence, who seems to be lost in the movie herself. As for actors like P.S. Hoffman, J. Moore and D. Sutherland, one wonders why they acquiesced to get involved in this brainless trash - I doubt they need the money (albeit you never know.) In order to make sure that it was not the lack of knowledge of previous films in the series that was spoiling the experience for me, I made a point of watching them, even if cursorily. I watched the first one, and that was enough. The Hunger Games is the most ridiculously hyped and overrated series of movies ever. Addressed to teenage public, this series seems to assume that teenagers are collectively brainless and stupid. This series is an insult to intelligence and discrimination.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

I've finally seen ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"".With the first two, it was obvious how the story represented a stratified society that comes up with ways to keep people from resisting. A particular scene in this one recalls a quote that I once heard: you can't appeal to your oppressor's morality. With the events here, Katniss fully understands what's at stake.As to criticism that the last book in the series got broken up into two movies, I can't comment on that, having not read the books. I will say that I'm eager to see the final movie (and I understand that there's going to be another addition to the franchise).As for Jennifer Lawrence, it's a bit odd to watch the franchise all these years later when she's now more known for serious movies (Don't Look Up, Causeway). Elizabeth Banks, meanwhile, directed ""Cocaine Bear"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The acting was so flat you wonder whether the director also slept through it all. Indeed, we all know the actors are good but, watching them in this film, you'd think they're straight out of a failed 2nd grade sitcom. There is no tension whatsoever, no excitement, no suspense, no life.The storyline is even more boring than the acting and the special effects are like watching paint dry. What a load of drivel the dialogues are and don't start me on the music which is no better.Looking at the 7.5 IMDb user rating I now know for sure that the studios have fake user accounts to cheat the IMDb rating. Looking at metacritic high scores also demonstrates what goes on in this movie business/PR/marketing.

As being an fan of the books, I did enjoy seeing the characters on screen, but reading a book before seeing a movie should never be an excuse for a movie based of a book being bad. For those of you who expected an action thriller, you will be extremely disappointed. I do believe this is the worst film out of the series, and could only see me watching this with a couple of friends at a Hunger Games party. Also the action sequences aren't very well shot, as director Francis Lawrence returns, although not very often, to the dreaded and sickening shaky cam.

She, as always, leads the cast. Another actor who stood out from the crowd for me had to be Josh Hutcherson, due to the dramatic change in atmosphere he added to the story. He and Lawrence work perfectly together, and the scene involving their scuffle was executed well.Despite the great tension that occurs every now and then, the pacing is a little sluggish, saved by Jennifer Lawrence's exceptional acting skills. Personally, I believe that this movie achieves what every first part of a franchise finale should achieve: intrigue the viewer into desiring to watch the second part, which is exactly what it has done for me.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Francis saved this series. The Hunger Games's shaky camera bugged me. But now, Francis came to the rescue. I'm not a great fan of the splitting, but I still loved it. I got the chills every time a scene is done powerfully. It does feel like a set-up for the next part but that doesn't really bother me. Some complain of the lack of action and unnecessary dialogue. But I never got bored and the action felt necessarily distributed. The dialogue was interesting and didn't feel unnecessary. The ending (though I expected it) broke my heart and was just so well done! The way this series is going, Mockingjay Part 2 will be epic. If you complained of the lack of action and haven't read the books, don't worry, cause Part 2 is packed with action. The only thing that bothers me is that we have to wait a whole other year. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out in July 2011, with Part 1 coming out in November 2010. They don't need to make us wait a whole year!

"7","/10","More great character-centered drama from this franchise, but drags and occasionally forgets to be entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3137716/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2014","""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" takes a drastic turn from the previous two entries of North America's biggest active movie franchise, but any fan of Suzanne Collins' trilogy could tell you that was coming; what doesn't change is the series' devotion to character-driven drama. In fact, it takes center stage.The games that defined the original ""Hunger Games"" and ""Catching Fire"" are long gone in this entry; Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has been taken to District 13, which exists entirely underground, where it has developed a massive operation aimed at revolting against the Capitol. President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her trusted adviser Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) try to enlist Katniss as the Mockingjay, the face of the revolution, but she requires some convincing seeing as Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is in the Capitol's clutches.""Mockingjay Part 1"" takes on the tone of a political thriller with 13 and the Capitol engaged in a chess match and Katniss and Peeta serving as their respective pawns. This is dramatically different, almost a 180 from the previous installments — those films were about survival and the main characters' lives were at stake; this film is about psychological warfare with the entire world of Panem at stake. Although ""Catching Fire"" does transition into a larger scale, it still ultimately becomes about the games.Consequently, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" lacks in action and tries to make up for it in intrigue and suspense. At many points that suspense is quite effective, but screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong hope it will serve as a substitute for action sequences. Well, that's not how blockbusters work. Ultimately, the decision to split the book ""Mockingjay"" into two parts feels like the real culprit for the film's flaws. There's a ton of build-up, but very little payoff, probably because the payoff comes in ""Part 2.""Otherwise, director Francis Lawrence really makes the most out of the story. This is a darker, much more introspective film, and seeing as those darker, introspective moments in ""Catching Fire"" worked so well, he doesn't struggle making the jump with to more of them in ""Mockingjay Part 1."" He's careful to give the other Lawrence, Jennifer, the time she needs to communicate what Katniss is struggling with to the audience. The change in this film turns Katniss' motivation from survival to something bigger — to the choice she must make about leading this revolution. Her wants and desires start to get foggy and the film does a pretty good job of making sense of her, honing in on her protective instinct.The film also does really nice things with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). Before, they were colorful one-dimensional side characters; now, the way the start of this revolution has shaken them from their previous wants and desires comes through. We see a totally raw, emotional side of Effie, for example, that stands out among the better character components of the film. We also spend more time with Gale (Liam Hemsworth), seeing as Peeta remains rather distant from the plot of this third chapter.All the character development is lovely, but the lack of action really makes ""Mockingjay Part 1"" drag. Toward the end you can really feel the plot stalling and the movie selling us small parts of the book as big climactic sequences. In order to make what was actually half of a story feel like a whole story, certain liberties need to be taken or scene/sub-plots added (take ""The Hobbit"" trilogy for instance). ""Mockingjay Part 1"" doesn't really do that, it just tries to exaggerate what's already there.""The Hunger Games"" franchise continues to deliver multi-dimensional storytelling and character development (in an extremely mature way for a mass-appeal PG-13 blockbuster) with ""Mockingjay Part 1,"" but it's missing the fun, sit-back-and-enjoy factor a movie of its kind ought to have. Even if you disagree that a huge event movie doesn't need to be action-packed, you can't disagree that this one feels longer and more dragged out than it needs to be given the summation of what happens. As slow as it might be, however, it should prove to be a pretty huge set up for a more exciting and satisfying finale.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Looking at the movie independently, I don't think of it as a bad movie. In my opinion its a very great movie that portrays amazingly well the gruesomeness and consequences of totalitarian regimen and how people rise up against their evil dominator and how rebellion is stoked. Both sides use clever propaganda to gain more followers or make the enemy loose hope and loose followers. Katniss has emerged as a symbol of hope and resistance against the Capitol. The movie shows us well how in war every decision made, might it be to save your friends or to create hope by broadcasting powerful speeches, will have a response from the enemy that could result in a loss of more supporters and casualties. It brings to the viewer a much a darker and realistic view on civil war, its terror and suppression as some other movies featuring the same thematic. The movie is a bit more reserved when it comes to action and battles, but focuses more on the psychological aspect.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence looked like she was recovering from a hangover throughout most the movie and seemed overly melodramatic in parts. Her acting skills seemed weak in this movie and at times she looked as bored as I was watching the movie. This movie just does not work in its two part format. The previous two movies has well rounded stories and build up of characters but in this movie the story was jumping all over the place. Although I applaud the directors focus on the different elements of war i.e propaganda, rescue missions, bombing raids I found some of scenes of Katniss with her old flame and friend boring and dead. The movie seemed pretty thin on the use of SFX which I attribute to the saving of the budget for the second part of the movie. So don't expect any action like the other two movies. Ultimately this movie is a slow boil set up for the second and final installment of the series. You could probably watch a 5 min overview of what happens in this movie before watching the second part when it is released and save yourself a boring 2 hours of watching Jennifer Lawrence moaning away.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

So an atmosphere in all similar to the previous chapters (but with a movement toward the rebellion argument) is at the service of love story between Katniss and Gale or Peeta: the ambiguity of this strange triangle is very bad defined and the decisions of the main characters seem to be taken for contingent choices and can't react positively with the dystopian ambient.

Don't get me wrong, i couldn't be more excited for the second part, but there isn't really happening something in this movie like the last ones. Ofcource is there some action scenes here and there, but it has nothing compared to the last books. I would like to say, that the actors are doing a REALLY good job. Their acting is really good, and you can clearly feel the emotional part going on their lives, and the directors did a good job making the audience feel the same way. I would like to say tho, that if you have read the books, and you know whats coming and what its like, you will properly like the movie (not giving any guarantees. I've heard that it matched the book pretty well. In my opinion isn't should there be more action, or there should be more excitement. There is a lot of talking and a lot of emotional going on, and for a person who hasn't read the books, that not what you wont to see, not after the 2 before that.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Why are they splitting it into two movies?"" You aren't going to enjoy this movie no matter how good it is. That being said, I was disappointed that they split the movie. I knew it was a ploy to get money, but I figured that I might as well try and enjoy it. After all, Deathly Hollow was pretty good, so why shouldn't this one be? When I got to the theater, I was shocked at how good the movie was. The camera-work was brilliant. Every frame was beautiful. The acting was absolutely superb. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) proved her acting chops in the first five minutes. Francis Lawrence obviously wanted to make up for the studios decision and had everyone step up their game. Even Josh Hucherson (who, let's be honest, is the weakest actor in the bunch) nailed it. That being said, not much happens in this movie. There are a few scenes (the propo scenes, the water dam scene, the last 15 minutes) where action takes place and it is brilliantly done. But most of the movie is politics and character development. If you are in the theater for an action movie, you're gonna be disappointed. I don't think this movie deserves the backlash it is getting. Get angry at the studio, if you must, but don't take it out on the movie itself.","15 out of 24 found this helpful.

The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the so-called BR2 'fans' look more justified than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering how entire sequence are shot for shot ripoffs. How can this go unpunished?","16 out of 29 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem justified in this case. The movies are divided prior to the Mockingjay/District 13 assault on Panem – or, in other words, the good bit. Which makes much of this movie essentially a build-up to its sequel. Lawrence is her usual brilliant self as a conflicted Katniss, who is called upon to portray a full rainbow of emotions and does so effortlessly. Her relationship (broadest sense) with Gale (Hutcherson) is played down, and in his few appearances Peeta (Hemsworth) steals the scene. Haymitch (Harrelson) is criminally underused but magnificent when he is given some screen time. Two major casting decisions affect this film greatly. The first is the inclusion of Effie Trinkett (Banks) who doesn't appear in the first half of the book. She takes the place of Cinna's erstwhile prep team; her stage presence and characterisation is much stronger in the previous movies, and it was a very good move to give the lines to her. By contrast, Julianne Moore is miscast in the role of President Coin. She lacks the commanding gravitas to play the fearsome leader; the ilk of Judi Dench would have been much better suited to the part. Her dialogue with the likes of Katniss and Plutarch (Seymour Hoffman) falls flat. James Newton Howard's score is marvellous, with the haunting mockingjay rift and The Hanging Tree adding an eerie sound. The interspersion of the song with Peeta's address to Panem is one of the few rousing moments. There's every chance Part 2 will be a terrific film as it has brilliant source material and an excellent cast to perform it, but Part 1 is a real disappointment. The action-free instalment did not require the time it was given, and there was no climax or payoff. Collins' novel has not been done justice, so let's hope the odds are very much in Part 2's favour.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Though I would have rather gotten one 4 hour movie, Hunger Games: Mockingly Part 1 is satisfying enough to make me want to see the final story next time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3138779/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","9 December 2014","Let's face it, at least once in your life, you've fallen into a leader position for which you were either not ready or simply had no interest in. Some people want to be leaders and some would rather follow. I've heard of people wondering why some people don't take greater control of their life and to quit some dead end job that won't make them which. What the asking people don't understand is that while there is certainly a mindset to be your own person, you also need a particular personality. There are people out that simply feel better to taking instruction rather then give them. It's not that they don't want anything better in life, they simply don't feel like they need more; in another word, they're content.This leads to Katness Everdeen's position as a leader in The Hunger Games franchise. This poor teenager had never dreamed of doing anything else besides farming and hunting. She may have the survival skills that helped her win the games the first time, but it spiraled out of control when she was seen as the sign of a revolution. She never wanted to take the spotlight, but she at least does her best with the situation. This is what makes her a great character. We are going into the beginning of the end here with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1.The previous movie ended with Katness escaping the Games into a hideout while Peeta was left behind.Living under the ruins of District 13, Katness Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) along with the other tributes that made it out, have been learning more about how a huge group of rebels have been planning an attack on the capital for a while. Katness is reunited with her mother, sister Prim-Rose and even Effie Trinket (played by Elizabeth Banks), but is bitter about leaving Peeta behind. She's introduced to the rebel leader, President Alma Coin (played by Julianne Moore) who asks Katness to be the ""Mockingjay"" for their cause. She says no, but changes her mind once she's shown two horrific sites; her District 12 bombed out and Peeta (played by Josh Hutcherson) now appearing on Capital TV, with his mind brainwashed, asking for the rebels to stop. After staring in a series of propaganda commercial for the rebels, she then travels to District 8 to meet the injured, but only before the capital shows to bomb the place. Still going, Katness vows to continue fighting the Capital as she juggles being a symbol and sticking to her oath of saving Peeta. I've never been a fan of splitting stories. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1 suffers from really only being half of a story. I would have been willing to sit through a four-hour movie, and I think fans would have done so too. Does only having a little of a story ruin it? Not totally. In fact, I still recommend this movie as a great continuation of this saga. I've warmed up to The Hunger Games more recently as it's manages to get across a grim subject to teenagers and young adults about post traumatic stress and a Soviet-like government (I can't recommend this to anyone under 12 though; too violent). As before, the cast from before takes it's story very seriously and all play the parts well. Julianne Moore is a nice welcome who rarely picks a bad role. My favorite newcomer is Natalie Dormer as the resident director of Katness's propaganda movies. She is passionate about the rebellion, but knows when enough work is enough to allow Katness to be herself. I'll give this seven hanging trees out of ten. What may throw off previous fans is that this is a slower, more political based Hunger Games story. Action fans will probably be pleased, though not as much as before; they just need to really pay attention. I'd see the other movies before checking this out. I'll be checking the final one come next year!","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

They said there is too much story to fit in one movie. Yeah, right, and I'm Lady GaGa. I still tried to look on the bright side and remembered how the book felt rushed at times and maybe the story will have more space to breathe. But here, it kinda seems like the story was forced to breathe very deep. Too deep. This isn't a bad movie at all. It's just too stretched for it's own good and turns out to be a total cashgrab. It's very well done and ""The Hanging Tree"" sequence with the dam scene was one of the best moments in the series. The plot doesn't really go anywhere for the most of the screen time. There's the District 8 part, some rebel scenes and the movie's third act. That's it. But the third act is awesome. That part wasn't really that intense in the book and that's when they showed the potential and some creativity. The book is in first person POV, but the movie isn't and that's the good thing because in the book we hear about some exciting stuff, but in the movie we actually get to see it and that's really good and the third act is mostly what made me like this movie. If you didn't read the book, the twist ending will definitely get you and you will want to watch the next movie immediately. One more problem I have with this film is that Katniss simply isn't an interesting character anymore. Tears, nightmares, traumas... I know she's been through a lot and I can understand that she's stressed and that they should show it in the movie, but they show it way too much. There was this scene when she's dreaming and I was like: ""And this was necessary because..."" In conclusion, this movie is still pretty much okay and will totally make you want to see the next one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND CINEMA, WATCH THE ORIGINAL FIRST!Yes, I am caps-lock yelling at you! This is one of the few times where you would truly lose out on a beautifully tragic experience. This isn't the typical foreign language to English port where some things are lost in translation, yet despite a few missing scenes or poor acting the story is still conveyed. This is practically a complete rework, however, it still manages to (almost) come to the same conclusion. Consequently this ruins any chance you have of watching the original and being able see the story unfold the way it's meant to, because the whole time you know how it will end (even as the other 99% will be new to you).Do yourself a favor and watch the original, it's really worth it this time.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

The 3rd installment is a little darker and that is not unwelcome. I won't waste time commenting on the fact that it has been stretched thin to make it into 2 movies. Enough reviews have rightly pointed that out. The story is gritty and uncomfortable and we see more of the harsh reality of war against an unforgiving oppressor which is done well. The main cast are again capable. With the character of Peeta developing nicely. I found Julianne Moore to be pretty wooden and uninspiring. In fact the whole new society of District 13 had shades of the 3rd Matrix film for me. A little over egged and an extra facet of the story that was not really essential to the plot. Again this may be to thin it out a bit more. Hoping the last installment brings it back up. Drop to a 6 for this one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's hard to believe the main character is stupid enough to reject the cause of the rebellion, but she does, repeatedly, because there seems to be a desire to re-create the same formula as the previous in this part of the series. I guess the idea is that she's independent and thinks everyone is trying to use her, but she becomes utterly impossible to sympathize with in this film because she leverages everyone's life for Peeta's. Unfortunately, it doesn't work, and it isn't believable. I have to say, though, all the comparisons to the Japanese film Battle Royale are absurd, as the Japanese film is nothing like Hunger Games, and it also took its story from another, and so on. Rejecting a novel or a film because it has some plot similarity to another film or novel or short story will eliminate all stories ever made. If we want to be precise, we can go back to the original short story by Ralph Ellison and discount all variations, but that's wasted time, and it has nothing to do with the merits of this film. I'm on board with the complaints that this was artificially cut into two parts. Film makers are trying to trick us with this nonsense, and I refuse to pay any time and money to Peter Jackson's absurd over-extension of the one-book classic, when he spent three (admittedly overly long) films on a six book series. This should have been one film, and since it wasn't that great as the half of the film it should have been, I'm going to be reluctant to pay for the next part. In fact, I might just buy and read the book instead.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because, what else to call it? Have any ideas? No, I didn't think so. It's the same about the third part of The Hunger Games. It missed ideas. It was very good the first hour, with some good plot twists, amazing propaganda talk, dramatical attacks and the revolution of the country they were trying to do here. Everything seemed interesting at first, but in the end, they served everything on the plate, and lost the good ideas. The action was good only the first hour, because later, it became very basic, the action music wasn't convincing, too. Katniss Everdeen is back to strike and make a difference, but the movie ends with her doing nothing then talking, even if she knows nothing is going to help. The action in the end is nothing more than making the movie longer and give it a longer runtime, unnecessary. It could have been at least a half hour shorter. Part three ended on the middle. But before the weak stuff came, it was actually very entertaining. The popular Hunger Games song ""The Hanging Three"" was a good symbol and did the job with the good singing, too. It gave us a brighter idea of the society in district twelve, and I liked it. Good moral about human rights, too, and they introduced us new characters, one of them played by Mahershala Ali, who is a pretty good actor. He didn't play so good in here, unfortunately, mostly because he did almost nothing and didn't have a convincing character. So what to say? The first hour was great, the second was empty, I hope the last part will give something that will change everything, in a good way.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There were some parts that weren't great, but the other parts totally made up for that. Usually i'd rate this movie as a 8/9 but after reading some of the other reviews, i decided to give it a 10, because I really thinks it deserves better. It has a interesting plot and even though there is not a lot of action, it doesn't get boring at all. Most of the characters were very well substantiated, which made it easy to sympathize with them. I heard people saying the acting wasn't good, i totally disagree, Jennifer Lawrence was great, Josh Hutcherson was amazing, I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman a lot as well. I even liked Liam Hemsworth, he's getting better, I didn't like him that much in the first movies. And i'm actually quite happy that they made the book into two movies, it would've just been to much to put in one movie, people who have read the books will know. Overall it was a very nice movie, if you liked the first two movies you'll certainly like this one as well.","23 out of 40 found this helpful.

The characters, the action and the sets breathtaking. But the only problem is that they don't match the level of the books. The book explains everything in details. I believe one can never actually understand and feel the story from the movie like from the book. The book is pooling with action all over and yet quick and interesting. There are movie franchises like Twilight that do better than books but The Hunger games movies are not that. There is a lot of scope of improvement ant entertainment. This movie seems like a sluggish attempt at picturing half the book. I wouldn't even give it 6 stars if I had watched the movie without reading the book. It wouldn't engage and hook me. All the while I was comparing the movie with the books. And I realized the book was so much better. So if anyone finds the plot of Hunger Games interesting, he'she should give the books a shot. But if you can't read the books, the movies aren't that bad either.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, burdened with being a part 1 of a story that didn't really need to be split in two, it is undeniably hindered by pacing that's just too slow.As Katniss becomes an idea, Jennifer Lawrence makes sure she still feels human. Both in the devastation she portrays in her most gruelling journey yet and the odd bit of self-aware humour such as when Katniss is struggling to act in a fully digital environment. This one also has her sing a beautiful rendition of The Hanging Tree which she nails.Donald Sutherland's President Snow has always been an intimidating presence that looms large over this franchise but it reaches new heights here. With a few characters gone or relegated to smaller parts since it's now out of the games, he gets to be a more consistent presence and delivers his most iconic line in a chilling fashion.Francis Lawrence does a great job of showing the brutality of the Capitol within the confines of a PG-13 rating and the heavy desaturation makes everything feel appropriately bleak. It also has a nice circular structure and a really strong final shot. James Newton Howard outdoes himself yet again. Because of the slow pace his score is even more vital in making sure things stay engrossing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To break it down to the non book readers, the 2nd part of the 3rd book is even more dull, so get ready. It's just really bad material and it was a painful book to get through. Most people didn't like the 3rd book and those that did are kidding themselves. Prior to the 2nd movie being released, I knew it was going to be a really good movie because the 2nd book had a really entertaining story line. This movie on the other hand had a 0% chance of being good and to score a 6 is actually an awesome achievement...awesome job with the movie! The production crew had a really tough decision. Do you break from the 3rd book since it is soo bad or do you keep the book Nazis happy? They let everyone know after Catching Fire that they would stay true to the book (based on their demeanor and response I say they weren't thrilled about it). The only way this 3rd move stood a chance is if they spent at least 1/3 of the movie going into the back story of Haymitch. It was understandably something that had to be cut out of the 2nd movie, due to both budget and time. Basically, as Katniss and Petah are preparing for the 75th Hunger Games they watch/study several of the previous Hunger Games, including Haymitch's. They watch his interviews and how he won etc. This would require a new Hunger Game Arena etc., but the 3rd book doesn't have a whole lot of entertaining material and they split it into two parts, so the Haymitch idea would have filled half of this first part perfectly. That would still leave 3 hours to cover the 3rd book which is more then enough. I can't even begin to imagine how they are going to fill the time for the 2nd part. I mean there is very little tangible material that I can even think of except for the end.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Under the leadership of President Coin and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss reluctantly becomes the symbol of a mass rebellion against the Capitol and fights to save Peeta and a nation moved by her courage.Now, what I think of this movie. The reason why I am so confused is because I don't hate this movie, but I will say that this might be my least-favorite of the HG movies.This movie has gotten some unfair hate from critics and fans for "" lack of action and for splitting the novel into two separate adaptations."", but it has gotten some nice reviews for the acting.The acting is strong here again. You have all of the cast members returning including Jennifer Lawrence, who is still attractive as Katniss Everdeen, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne. The rest of the cast includes Julianne Moore as President Coin, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Evan Ross, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin, Donald Sutherland as President Coriolanus Snow, Stanley Tucci, Jeffrey Wright, Sam Claflin and Natalie Dormer, who I think is beautiful and I have recently seen her in the movie ""Rush"".The action is sort of lacking in this film because it's in two parts, but this is only the first part so what do you expect? I can't wait for Part 2, it's gonna be packed with action. The music is composed once again by James Newton Howard and the soundtrack is awesome with songs from Coldplay and Imagine Dragons.The script is not that strong, but it's still okay for this film and I really do like that this film is setting up the epic finale, setting up the end, but I think this movie could have used a lot more action.The costume and production design is really not horrible either and I give credit to the franchise for being awesome, but it's so messed up that this is the lowest-rated film in this series, as it has a rating of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes and the general consensus is: ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 sets up the franchise finale with a penultimate chapter loaded with solid performances and smart political subtext, though it comes up short on the action front."" and in it's own way, it is stupid but it's also really not that bad.The visual effects and action sequences are good as well, so, overall, with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, I both love it and hate it. I like the acting, script, score, soundtrack, visuals, production techniques, but I hate some of the scenes and the lack of action.6/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Mockingjay part 1 kept me hooked into it from start to finish and I was very entertained. With great acting (especially from Jennifer Lawrence) and a very interesting plot. I might have enjoyed it because I was expecting a dull start to the end of the series, as nothing really seemed to kick off until the second half of the book. The film just seemed to flow by and made good use of the 2 hour runtime and I never found myself sitting there in boredom hoping for things to pick up a bit more. The tension was kept well throughout and finished well; it didn't finish on an appalling cliffhanger such as catching fire where you are left questioning the film but it also didn't drag on and bored everyone. Some scenes in the film were very tense and entertaining and had a few minor twists which kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall, If you like me are a big fan of the series but not as excited for this installment, I highly recommend you lower your expectations and go and see it. You will not be disappointed.","22 out of 38 found this helpful.

The first 2 books had the games to make it action packed. The last book (and the last 2 movies) are just not as spine tingling as before. So, I give Mockingjay an 8/10 just because it was a good movie- just not the 9/10 I would give to the first 2 HG movies.

HOWEVER, as part of an epic that began when Katniss volunteers to be a tribute, to her ultimate destiny, this is a GREAT MOVIE. If you are a Hunger Games fan, disregard any criticism or shortcomings written by movie critics. Mockingjay 1 is a delicious appetizer that is the bridge to what will be, undoubtedly, the culmination of the greatest, most prescient movie(and books)of the dystopian genre. Kudos and praise to Suzanne Collins. But it is Jennifer Lawrence who transforms Suzanne Collin's Katniss Everdeen into the greatest female leading role in the history of movies. (And, to add, which male leading role surpasses Jennifer Lawrence's stellar performance in what will be 4 movies)""My,oh my"", to use a phrase that Caesar Flickerman once said to Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence may become, blossom into, the greatest American actress in the history of cinema. I've seen the greatest of the greats during my 60+ years: Meryl Strep, Katharine Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Betty Davis, Audrey Hepburn, etc. In life, we often look back and only then realize that we witnessed greatness. Be grateful and appreciate the fact that right now, at this time in your life, you are witnessing greatness in the performance of Jennifer Lawrence.","21 out of 37 found this helpful.

People complain about a lack of action; really? I think it's sad that a movie has to consist solely of explosions and gun fire in order to work for a wide audience.The first two movies of the hunger games series were okay, but this one takes the tale to a whole new level. It has a depth to it its predecessors lacked entirely. It's about the construction of a rebellion. Most positive reviews describe this film as a ""warm up for part 2, the real deal"". No, no, no. Part 2 will have all the action, yes, but this one has the >thought<. It deals with thoughts few films targeting young people ever do, and it does so reasonably well. I'm not saying this is a perfect film - not by far. There are tons of things to complain about, for starters the enforced teen romance bullshit. But gash, please don't complain about it being slow. If so, i guess it's just a bit too intelligent and deep for you.And finally, i really have to take a stand for Lawrence. I think she does a beautiful portrayal of the deeply psychologically wounded Katniss.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

All the scenes were drawn out and there were so many stupid and unimportant scenes slotted in. ( Despite the fact everything was explained so a twelve year old could understand. Not only did it pretty much copy the first film. It started with Gale and Katniss hunting, like the first. All of it was a cliché and barely anything unpredictable. It's a shame that Jennifer Lawrence is incapable of making her role good. Just plain good. Nope, she's too bad an actress for that. After seeing this film, I doubt I will ever go to see another 'Jennifer Lawrence' film again unless my friends drag me to it. Save your money, do NOT spend your money on this, you will regret it. It's an awful film which contains: Clichés Plot holes the size of the state of Texas Ignored subplots Flat, boring characters Unrealistic ideas (I don't CARE if it's the future, some of the stuff is just plain stupid) Lack of acting skills. Only Phillip (R.I.P) could really do some decent acting. Even then, it was ONLY decent. Phillip was a brilliant actor, he let himself down in this film by not giving the best performance, but oh well. Finally, the most horrible thing of all: Overall. If I could rate this film, it would not even get 6 on IMDb. It'd get less than Disaster Movie, at least 1.2 stars. Do not see this film, unless of the age 12-14. If you're older, it's not a good idea. The film is not suitable for you. Honestly, the plot devices and conveniences are like they've been written by a (profanity removal) 12 year old. I feel as if the director didn't make this or his inner 12 year old allowed the script. I have no clue how Jennifer accepted the stupid childish ramble in her lines. Yes, the lines are all childish ramble. Nothing deep or clever placed into the script. It's effortless, but it is not well written. Jennifer Lawrence seriously needs to learn to pick appropriate roles. She's not a bad actress, but this is making me think she is.I'm not sure if the film is so bad because the books weren't great, but even so, this film should have been written properly to make sure the script made sense. If you want a good film... watch Battle Royale 2: Requiem, you'll enjoy it way more than this and so will your children.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

This had all the foundations of a solid movie. Great production. Good cast. Decent story- although they were working with half a book worth of material so they stretched it out until it was pretty thin sometimes. There was less action in this movie than the other Hunger Games- this one was more of a political intrigue focusing on character portrayals with Katniss at the center; lots of focus on her inner turmoils. So a lot of the movie focused on Katniss. And Jennifer Lawrence's acting was just horrible. She was crying and being hysterical like four out of every five scenes that she was in. Lots of sophisticated actors and actresses in the movie and then there was Jennifer Lawrence like she was straight out of high school trying too hard and overdoing everything. It was very irritating to watch her for two hours. Imagine having to watch a teenage drama queen have attitude followed by breakdowns for two hours. To tell the truth I am surprised because she came across as a sophisticated and mature actress in American Hustle. Her performance reminded me a little of Shea LeBoef's acting in Transformers. Just neurotic and way over the top. Some people might like it. Not my style. Was it not for her, the movie was pretty good. She just managed to singlehandedly drag it down.... a lot.","16 out of 31 found this helpful.

She went through two Hunger Games, her love Peeta has been taken by the Capitol and as witnessed later, she sees that her home District 12 has been destroyed by no other than the sinisterly wicked President Coriolanus Snow who has kidnapped and brainwashed poor Peeta in order to call off the radical rebellion that's happening against the dystopian world of Panem and to get rid of the cause known as the Mockingjay. So far, it totally seems that we're closer to the end of an amazing series. The tone gets very dark, the political ideas and serious themes are more thought-provoking and it's surprisingly different from the previous two. Gone are the stunning arenas and colorfully bold costumes and it adds in a more darker (or gray-ish) palette and a few key elements that makes the first part of the third and final book of Suzanne Collins' marvelous trilogy a gripping and strong, if not better, addition in the series. The always wonderful Oscar-winning Jennifer Lawrence takes Katniss to new heights. She's broken, haunted, tormented by nightmares and still suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. She's confined in an underground bunker known as District 13, run by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore in a solid performance). Coin is unsure about Katniss, seeing that she is still suffering after the events in the Third Quarter Quell in ""Catching Fire"". Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his final roles) insists that she still has to be the Mockingjay. It's a simple logic: Show the rebellion that she is still standing and fighting until the end by filming propaganda (or ""propos"") videos. Take the scene in District 8, after a airstrike sent by Snow (Donald Sutherland), she speaks from the heart knowing that the rebels won't surrender that easy after that event. Still, Katniss is ripped apart by many things. She still cares for Gale (the incredible Liam Hemsworth) who's ready for the revolution to happen, but her heart belongs to Peeta (a heart wrenching and soulful Josh Hutcherson), as mentioned that he is the Capitol's puppet or just saving Katniss from devastation. But she is saved by her mom (Paula Malcomson) and her sister, Prim (the adorable Willow Shields). Also joining in the ranks are another broken victor Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Katniss' mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) who is now sober and still very helpful, Cressida (a wickedly cool Natalie Dormer from ""The Tudors"" and ""Game of Thrones""), a filmmaker trying to capture as much as she can with Katniss in the middle of all this along with her camera crew, a wheelchair-bound Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) who communicates with transporting video signals and crashing it through the Capitol and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a smart deviation from the book, who does not like being in a world full of gray jumpsuits but comes around eventually. Taking apart the final book in a series and turning it into two movies doesn't really seem necessary (it worked out before with ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight""), but returning director Francis Lawrence of ""Catching Fire"" and screenwriters Danny Strong (""The Butler"", ""Game Change"") and Peter Craig (""The Town"") with adaptation by Suzanne Collins herself manages to keep the film moving at a slow but breakneck pace to give us some deep insights in the world of Panem, expands its scope a bit more, and getting us really connected and involved with the world while staying true to Collins's book and changing and fixing some of the weaknesses of the book. There's not much action this time around (there's only two big set pieces), but it's deeply rooted in the story and characters and the human drama behind it works its way though our minds. And again, the movie and this franchise wouldn't work if it weren't for Jennifer Lawrence. She makes Katniss a wounded, vulnerable, but strong and charismatic heroine that's joining in the ranks of strong females such as Lisbeth Salander and Hermione Granger. In a surprisingly sweet moment, she belts out a signature moment from the book, ""The Hanging Tree"", a bluegrass-type of song. When she sings, we immediately feel it and we see that she becomes a beacon of hope for the rebellion. I know it's only one half of a movie but it's only half good when it ends with a thrilling climax involving a rescue mission and a striking cliffhanger that leads our way into the finale. What will the final film bring to the table? I don't know. But if you're thinking with a groan or a relieved sigh for next year, make sure your homework is prepared and you got enough information so that you won't be lost in the system. Since it's the calm before the storm, ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" may not have a whole lot to take it all in, but it refuses to back down and stands up for the revolution and the power of changing the world one day at a time.","15 out of 25 found this helpful.

I loved the past 2 hunger games movie and i was excited to see Mockingjay, but i sat in the movies with my eyes begging to be shut. It is terribly boring. I'll go straight to my point, the trailer is misleading because the plot doesn't go anywhere. It doesn't build like a normal movie plot should, no introduction no climax no ending no nothing. I spent 2 hours sitting there waiting for something to finally happen. For a war to break, or someone to die, or the setting to change, but the actors just talk and talk and continue talking right to the end. I understand the directors or whoever is in charge is trying to make this movie two parts to gain more profit but this is a total rip off. I don't know if it's just me but I don't quite get whats happening most of the times, I haven't read the book so i was a little confused about the story in Mockingjay but shouldn't book adapted movies be watchable to everyone. I loved the actors and their acting was good in the last two movies but i find them not believable in this one, including Jennifer Lawrence. Many people might not agree with me but i think the actors kind of lacked effort in Mockingjay. There is one thing i liked in this movie, and the only one, which is the song Jennifer Lawrence sang.

While overall, the movie is good and largely true to the book there were elements of it that just didn't work for me.Jennifer Lawrence delivers another stellar performance as Katniss Everdeen, but somehow, she looks ""too old"" for the role of the 17 year old tribute. While there is no doubting her acting ability, there were times when I found myself thinking that it just wasn't working. The same applies to Willow Shields (Prim) who no longer appeared to be the ""little sister""Other returning actors, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta), Phillip Seymour Hoffman (PLutarch), Donald Sutherland (Snow) and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch) all put up great performances worthy of mention. By far and away, the stars of this movie were Sam Claflin (Finnick) and the amazing Elizabeth Banks (Effie). For me, Julianne Moore just didn't work as Coin. I couldn't work out if it was a casting error, an acting issue or a screen writing problem but it just wasn't right. It was evident that there was a bigger budget on this movie than the previous 2 and I do think there were things that could have been done better, but overall, I thought the movie was good. The decision to include Effie Trinkett in this move was absolutely right and it's definitely worth a watch.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

There's not much to be happy about in ""Mockingjay,"" which shouldn't come as a surprise if you've read the book (it's pretty depressing). Much of the film plays out in District 13, a secret underground bunker revealed in last year's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" that's led by President Coin (Julianne Moore). Unlike the previous two films, ""Mockingjay"" doesn't have a whole lot of action. Katniss fires off only one arrow throughout the film from her now iconic bow. The first movie of this year that I kept checking the clock for movie to end . It was so boring , I felt like I just watch 1/4 of the story line .

"8","/10","A great slow burn that sets up a fantastic finale","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128536/?ref_=tt_urv","smorse2434","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44306501/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2014","The Hunger Games books are surprisingly great reads, but fans would mostly agree that the third book just isn't as consistently engaging as the first two. It's not dreadful by any means, but it does not make good use of the extra room it has with the lack of the hunger games themselves. I will say that I like the games as entertainment but the most thought provoking parts come outside of the games, so it was disappointing that Suzanne Collins just could not come up with enough interesting interactions and moments to keep it interesting.The fact that the first two books really focused on Katniss worked very well. Sadly, the third book continues focusing solely on her point of few when it should have opened up more. As a reader, you miss out on the big picture because the only picture we're getting is Katniss. This expanded focus makes The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 one of the few films that is better than the source material.Mockingjay starts almost exactly after the conclusion of Catching Fire. Katniss Everdeen, Jennifer Lawrence, arrives in District 13 where she discovers that Plutarch Heavensbee, Phillips Seymour Hoffman, and District 13's president Alma Coin, Julianne Moore, want her made into the revolution's face/symbol. Next you learn that Peeta, Josh Hutcherson, has been taken captive by the Capitol and is forced into doing propaganda for President Snow, Donald Sutherland. Katniss agrees to be the face of the revolution, which entails filming propaganda, but only if District 13 agrees to rescue Peeta and so the revolution begins.This movie has far less the action than the previous two movies and instead can be seen more as a character study of how previous events affected the characters. The film touches on issues of PTSD, War, Remorse, death, and is pretty depressing at times but emotionally stunning at others. The films themes about control and perception are expertly injected, and never take a back seat to action sequences. Director, Francis Lawrence, wisely focuses on the story and all the characters instead of the world. This might be the most subdued film in terms of action in the series despite being the biggest in terms of budget, and yet that is a positive not a negative.In the third book, the reader is forced to get all its information through Katniss, and it just does not work. The film's take shifts the focus to a wider view of the characters and this makes even small events that occur have more meaning. For instance, The rescue of Peeta really is not explained well in the book, but in the film it is constructed way more effectively, and revs up the tension dramatically.The films drastic change in focus creates some changes in plot that some purists might get upset about, but in the end the story is better off. Katniss feels less powerless in the film and it makes her character more interesting. With the first two movies under her belt, Jennifer Lawrence is really bringing the character to life, and man does she know how to deliver a powerful speech. She is surrounded by a cast that should get its due as well. Moore is solid as Alma Coin and Hoffman's subdued but great performance shows what a shame it was to see him go too soon. Woody Harrelson Haymitch is still fantastic, but his character gets moved a bit to the side thanks to a complex plot and the love competition between Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) that is actually handled well. Most of the rest of the cast really do a great job as well.Book adaptations are more often than not tricky business, especially when a single book is split into two movies. The main problem is trying to find a spot to stop the movie about halfway through where nothing was supposed to conclude. Mockingjay mostly avoids this, even if there are some small parts that make this feel like part one of a single story. Mockingjay part 1 builds differently from the previous two films. The difference being that the film is actually building toward something, but instead of just the plot advancing you get character advancement as well and that makes this a very different but improved experience. (8/10)","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

There was also action for those of you who like that and the love triangle is still there, but not as painfully in-your-face, for those of you who watch it to see Gale.-The pace is very good. I didn't get bored at all. It has some very funny moments too! Also the tone is much more optimistic than Catching Fire.-The acting is better too! I loved Jennifer Lawrence in it. She's totally hot. There, I said it. Philip Seymour Hoffman is in a lot of the film and I loved him in it! Yeah everybody was really good.-The characters themselves are pretty solid. It's nice seeing Katniss make up her mind. And this film offers more room for lovable characters like Haymitch and Effie to grow! -The effects were very good.-The music is even better than the other two! -So some negatives. It does feel like it is split up into two films. It introduces new characters and we don't see a lot from everybody. That's about all.-Content: This one is tricky. There is no language and no suggestive content or nudity. There are some violent images that are tough even for PG-13. It's not Schindler's List, but not for young kids.-So overall I will say that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is great all around. If you liked the first two, see this one! It is TOTALLY worth seeing in theaters! I'm probably going to see it again! I would give Mockingjay a strong 8.5/10! If you haven't seen Catching Fire, it's on Netflix. Watch that and then see this.","16 out of 27 found this helpful.

This epic story continues with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peetar Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who both play a big part in the lives of District 13'ers, each in their own way. They want to unite and save an entire nation. In order to do this, they need the help of their friends and new alliances. I completely love this film and the overall production. It's intense and has such a grand feel to it. With scene after scene, it gets bigger and bigger and you see just how powerful one voice can be. The aerial shots, emotions, excitement and the anticipation of what's happening next basically keeps your eyes glued to the screen. I've read all the books and this adaption is very true to the original stories. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is incredible. She becomes her character completely with a range of emotions - anger, doubt, disbelief and feeling sorry. She is so convincing. My favorite character is Peetar. Although he is not on-screen time as much as the other characters, he plays a big part in the film. Peeta is what drives Katniss throughout the film as she struggles to get to him. Almost everything she does is a result of her wanting to save Peeta. I also like Peeta because, every time he is on screen, he seems to change and intensify the situation. My favorite scene is when Katniss sees Peeta for the very first time. She is shocked and, at the same time, grateful that he is alive. It is nice to see all of the questions that go though her mind through her own eyes. Katniss' eyes reveal how she feels about Peeta. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 and I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is a little slow in the beginning, but I understand why. They have to bring you up to speed with what happened in the previous film. I cannot wait to see Part 2!Satisfy your excitement and see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1. It is playing in theaters now, so please check it out.Reviewed by Brianna B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","27 out of 50 found this helpful.

So, no, it's not quite as good as Catching Fire (and thus, nowhere near the level of The Hunger Games). But still, this edition does a good job expanding the Penam universe, and developing the story of our heroine Katniss.Katniss works so well because she's authentic, free of the practiced cynicism that permeates President Snow and even the leaders of the rebellion. A key moment is when Haymitch Abernathy explains this fact to them. And it's really hard to imagine any young actress pulling this off as well as Jennifer Lawrence, who exudes authenticity herself. So Mockingjay has the emotional pull, it has a solid story line, it has a well-constructed dystopian world, and it has a solid cast with an exceptionally talented lead. It lacks only a satisfying conclusion, but as Part One, that can hardly be a surprise.","17 out of 30 found this helpful.

Judging the films on their own terms is to me a fairer way to judge though, and will be done here because they are problematic on their own. Of the four films (which all have good points but just as enough problems that stop me from caring for them much), 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part I' is the weakest, it feels too much like set-up and set-up that's very tame and really struggles to justify its length.There are certainly good things. The production values, some dodgy special effects aside, are very well done with the nightmarishly dystopian production design faring best, it's lit with atmosphere and luckily the cinematography and editing is not the sloppy and frenetic kind seen in the first film. The score is thrilling and emotive, and there are some good performances here. This is particularly true of a terrific Jennifer Lawrence, dastardly Donald Sutherland, moving Philip Seymour Hoffman, smarmy Stanley Tucci and classy Julianne Moore.Not all the cast work. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are still lacking charisma and expression, while Elizabeth Banks (a high point of the first film) and Woody Harrelson have nothing to do.Lack of character development and halfway-decent writing plays a large part here. The characters had a lot of meat to them before but here are pretty bland stereotypes with non-existent development or direction, Katniss excepted. Didn't find myself caring for the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, mainly because of Peeta being written and played so blandly but also the chemistry didn't seem to be there. The writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part I' could have easily been shorter, because the story feels far too thin and over-stretched which makes some scenes interminably dull and dreary. The film is basically set-up and after finishing on a note every bit as abrupt as the ending for 'Catching Fire' it feels like set-up that doesn't lead or go anywhere. Atmosphere-wise, it just feels rather tame in alternative to tense and leaden rather than edgy. The direction is pretty pedestrian here.In summary, bland and over-stretched despite some good performances, production values and music. 4/10 Bethany Cox","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

In my opinion, both occasional viewers and faithful fans should ignore this release, read the novel instead, and come back to the cinema for the second part of the grand finale. This movie only prepares for the last part of the series, a little bit like ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" but it's even worse.Everything that I enjoyed about the entertaining first two releases is completely absent in this movie. The story has no tension at all and consists almost only of hollow dialogs. One could almost say that there is no real story. The rebels are trying to turn a few propaganda movies, the population is demonstrating against the Capitol and that's it. Instead of survival action, we get to see depressive and lengthy chamber play scenes in grey bunkers. The colourful and exciting locations are gone and replaced by dark concrete structures that make even the most functional Soviet cities look beautiful. The special effects in this movie are not even close to the breathtaking images from the first two parts. Even the soundtrack of the movie is a lot more generic than before. One of the worst parts of the movie was when main actress Jennifer Lawrence suddenly started to sing. It sent shivers down my spine but in a very negative way and it reminded me of some lyrics from an old Puddle of Mudd song: ""I never wanna hear you sing, you sound just like a little kid."" Jennifer Lawrence' vocal performance must be the worst I have ever witnessed in cinema. Nothing improved in this movie and everything that made the Hunger Games franchise so popular is gone.Even the acting is a lot less convincing than in the first movies as it mostly feels numb and unreal. Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin is pale and not credible at all in her role as nobody would follow such an uncharismatic leader in real life. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee looks like an annoying and old guy who thinks he is funny and cool but happens to be only embarrassing and stupid as he acts like he was mentally retarded. Even the characters I appreciated in the first two movies seem like pale copies of their former selves. I was eager to see Woody Harrelsen in his unique role as Haymitch Abernathy again but he only has a very small role and feels like a completely different character all of a sudden. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket is a lot less colourful, eccentric and sarcastic than before. I'm aware of the fact that the general mood of the movie is supposed to be darker and more mature but the acting hasn't become more credible but simply shallower. In an unfitting contrast to this, Jennifer Lawrence is simply overacting her role as Katniss Everdeen. Every five minutes, you see her crying in a corner of her bunker, exaggeratedly hobbling through some ruins and yelling at everybody and everything when she's not pleased with something. In the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie, this acting seems like a welcome change to the tame acting of the others but a few minutes later one gets the impression that the main character has not only become a lot less mature than before but that she is simply out of her mind and dealing with important mental problems. It's not realistic at all to count on a bipolar princess who acts less mature than a twelve-year old and who only cares about her lover even though this is one of the least credible cinematic love stories I have ever seen to lead a revolution. At some point, her cringe-worthy emotional outbursts become unintentionally funny and would rather fit into a slapstick comedy movie.It was incredibly hard to sit through the entire movie. I kept believing as I was hoping for an explosive ending and the only interesting scene of the entire film takes indeed place in the last fifteen minutes but it isn't worth the wait either. Giving three points out of ten in here is still extremely generous. Instead of making me impatiently wait for the final chapter, I'm now seriously asking myself if I should not give up on the franchise. I really liked the first two movies but this one here is plain awful. As I said before, read the novel or a short synopsis but avoid this hollow flick at all costs. It's not worth spending money on it, it wouldn't even be worth watching it if it was for free.

This movie follows EXACTLY the book. It IS the book. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was so excited throughout it, and went through all the emotions, even tearing up!So if you don't like it, your beef is with Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay book, not the film. Which is understandable, because many consider Mockingjay the weakest in the trilogy.That said, I LOVED THIS MOVIE. It blew my mind. It brought clarity to the book, it made it clear. I actually liked this movie BETTER THAN THE BOOK. There IS action, but it's a different kind of action.I couldn't take my eyes off of Jen, and Josh (Peeta) really pulled it off. I didn't think he could do it. Liam (Gale) stepped up too, because for the first time in the series I actually felt sorry/understood his character. Willow (Prim) also feels more dimensional. The only thing I feel leery about is Moore's Pres. Coin---she's likable, perhaps too likable, and I might feel sorry for her in P2 because of how likable she is.","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A Good Setup for the Finale","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3132104/?ref_=tt_urv","jacobclark512","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51142198/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2014","My first reaction to Mockingjay Part 1: wow, this is going to be long.My second: wow, this is good.Those two thoughts pretty much sum up my experience viewing Mockingjay Part 1. I really didn't care for Mockingjay the book as much as the first two parts of The Hunger Games trilogy, so when I heard it was being split into two parts, I knew this was a good possibility. Taking the same cast and crew as Catching Fire plus a few additions was a good idea, but making Mockingjay into two movies made me think of other young adult series that have suffered the same fate and not turned out as well as they could have if it was one film.That being said, Mockingjay Part 1 gets off to a good start for this two-part epic, mostly because of the script. The pace is a little deliberate, and there's not much action; however, the film turns into a war film shortly after it opens and begins poking fun (in a completely legitimate satire kind of way) at propaganda films. This makes it the darkest of The Hunger Games movies yet, which suited me quite nicely. This being the first of the series without the actual Hunger Games, it felt like a natural step forward for the franchise, and I quite enjoyed its highly political themes. Many times, Mockingjay Part 1 feels more like a political exploration of war and its logistics rather than a battlefield epic, making it quite interesting and thought-provoking. I am fairly confident in saying that Part 2 will have far more of the battlefield epic fans expect and less of this ""boring logistical stuff""; however, Part 1 works very well as a setup for an action- packed conclusion.Speaking of being dark, Mockingjay Part 1's aesthetic is very dim. Most of the film is set in the tunnels and underground chambers of District 13 or takes place at night. I personally felt that District 13 was a more than adequate adaptation of Collins's world from the book that also blended in with Panem as we are familiar with it in the films. The outlandish costuming and extravagant makeup is gone; however, this is the way it is supposed to be, so I didn't mind it one bit.The acting in Mockingjay Part 1 is solid to say the least. Jennifer Lawrence once again commands the film in her role of Katniss; however, she and Donald Sutherland as President Snow are the only characters who actually remain static from Catching Fire to this film. Josh Hutcherson's Peeta is very different (sorry, no spoilers), Woody Harrelson's Haymitch is sober for the first time since his youth, Elizabeth Banks's Effie Trinket is deprived of her Capitol fashion, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch is less double-crossing and more commanding. Liam Hemsworth also gives one of the better performances of his career as Gale due to his increased role. The various newcomers from District 13 perform admirably as well, especially Julianne Moore as President Coin. However, I sometimes feel that Haymitch and Katniss are not given enough moments to shine in Mockingjay Part 1, making this film not quite as enjoyable as it could have been.The direction of Mockingjay Part 1 is very similar to Catching Fire, mostly due to the retention of the latter's director, Francis Lawrence. The cinematography brings a little of the first film's shaky camera-work, but it's just the right amount, making the film feel a little more raw and personal. While I didn't think I would like this, it was done in a very tasteful manner. The pace feels a little off sometimes, especially in the beginning; however, as a rule, this is a well-directed film that sets up its sequel well.Overall, Mockingjay Part 1 is a good film. It's not a drastic improvement on its source material (and definitely not its predecessor Catching Fire), but it does what any first-half movie is supposed to do in setting up the ending. Fans of the Hunger Games franchise should like it; however, those unfamiliar should at least view the previous two films before seeing this one. It does feel a little long at times; however, Mockingjay Part 1 is a delightful political war film that beautifully sets up the finale to the Hunger Games saga.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

I have always loved the political side of HG, the revolution, how an entire nation finally says NO and stands up for itself, like V in V for Vendetta says: ""People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people."" That is the entire message of the HG trilogy for me. And this movie nailed it. I dare to say they give a more powerful message than the one given in the book. It is more clear, more intense, and I loved it. The movie was excellent.The performances were incredible. I always loved The Hanging Tree and the way Jennifer sang it was beautiful. There are a lot of powerful moments that are well balanced with comic reliefs.

The lack of action in the movie was very saddening and it felt like a very long preview for Part 2. I am sure Part 2 will be awesome now, since all the action will happen, but I think this movie could have easily been 30 minutes long. The acting also just felt awkward for the first half of the movie, and it often felt like more should be happening. The reactions of the characters just felt bland and unrealistic.

This movie is all about one military district trying to start a televised revolution with Katniss Everdeen being their spokesperson, despite her most dire concern is freeing Pita from the clutches of President Snow. So it moves from a kind of game show/reality show theme into a metaphor on how two different political struggles use the media to campaign their agenda to the people.But I make it seem like I went to see the movie because of it's complex reflection on contemporary mass media. No, it was action packed with JLaw looking crazy hot as the mocking jay, battling the capital. I thought this was suppose to be a chick flick? My mistake. In the mist of spinning ideas that make it seem like movies similar to the recent release, Kill the Messenger, between are action sequence that make it seem like Black Hawk Down. It's almost a fantasy version of Zero Dark Thirty, which at times seem like quiet overkillBut it did get my heart pumping with suspense, and I loved every minute of it.","20 out of 37 found this helpful.

More so the if i loved the original. I know there are extremely few which equals or excels to the original but it's not a big problem for me 'cause i don't even expect them to. It is to me like a bonus track of a beloved album, no more no less.So i got no hesitation in checking Hunger Games as well (i was even excited actually) 'cause the original must be in my all-time best 10, but, oh my..I won't say any more about this XEROX COPY crap. (copied on retarded machine, moreover) Nough said by nough people.Now one thing i just can't believe is how this could be legal. As far as i've read on internet articles, Suzanne Collins and her people haven't even paid a penny to the original Battle Royale makers for doing this, which means Hunger Games is not an official remake of Battle Royale. Then what the h..! is Hunger Games's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Suzanne Collins and her company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Suzanne Collins's kept saying she's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Hunger Games is totally different from Battle Royale 2 or something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from Battle Royale 2, Suzanne Collins intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Battle Royale 2's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : Hunger Games is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY. I don't understand why Battle Royale 2 makers let them make money with this stolen thing.Am i disappointed ? No i'm fine i didn't even expect. I'm just p***ed and upset for this shitmakers' shamelessness that's all.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

Even before seeing the first movie I always thought the premise had amazing potential (never read the books, just based on the premise), that was confirmed when I saw the first movie. The potential was huge and was there, but unfortunately it wasn't used. I thought the first one was a plain bad movie: it had huge storytelling problems and repeatedly failed to live up to its own intentions. The second one was definitely an improvement. I still didn't see the franchise living up to its potential, but it certainly had some very good moments. Yet, the huge storytelling issues remained. That's where my problems have always laid with the franchise up until now: it has never really given me a coherent world building. Well I can say that now, with the third installment, the franchise has finally given me the satisfaction I wanted from the very start, it has finally realized its potential, used it properly and, call me surprised, it has given us an f**cking good movie.Some minor storytelling issues remain, but finally the major shortcuts and grand visual incoherences from the first couple of movies have gone away and gave me the possibility of looking at the movie without having to be taken out of it every other moment. Visually the franchise has never looked better, the camera work is very smooth and polished and gave an enormous contribution to tension in multiple scenes, yet most importantly there are great set pieces and moments that, thanks to some good CGI, contributed to fantastic imagery. But, where the movie really succeeds is in characters and commentary. Everybody has their moment, everyone gets a full rounded job. You will feel depth and various levels on every character both in good and dark. Doing this at the very best and definitely the highlight of the cast is Hoffman. He was magnetic every time on screen and I didn't even really like him in the previous movie. But here he is astoundingly great and adds to every single moment he has on screen something more to his character, he gives him true depth. Aside him Moore and Sutherland are excellent, Hutcherson is amazing in what he is given, a lesser actor could have really butchered the part, and obviously Lawrence is as stunningly spectacular as always. I was on the edge of my seat many and many times and that final act was absolutely nail biting, this is definitely helped by the strong imagery used by the movie that is exactly what I wanted from it (that last shot was amazing), something that the previous entries din't succeed in. Good job Francis Lawrence, you brought me from nearly hating this franchise in the start to ""can't wait for the next movie"" status.Allbeit the movie has missteps. It falls into useless sentimentality more than a couple of times and it did this totally gratuitously in one sequence (involving saving a cat) and brought down the movie a lot instead of elevating it. I cringed more than once and that is never a good thing. The first half of the movie could have been slightly cut, it gave weight to way too many things that didn't have it and dragged out story lines that could have been solved in a much more easier way, even worst is the fact that some of these were basic clichéd moments to get an initial drama going. Moreover, most unfortunately, some story issues remain, they are very smaller than previously, but still they were made the more annoying by the fact that the previous entries had a very bad track record in the matter for me.I've seen lots of underwhlment in regards to this movie by fans and by people who were excited for it. I think that there is one main reason for which I liked this movie so much and so much more than everybody else. I wasn't excited for it. I had never really liked any of the movies before, only like the second one, so I didn't really care a lot for this one and moreover I had no absolute idea where it was going, I really don't know anything about this franchise other than what the movies show me so that's why I was so surprised by this entry.The movie is the best of the franchise so far for me, it was a truly thrilling experience and more than that, it was a really good film that ranks definitely in the best dozen or so of the year so far.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

I believe the running time is perhaps this movie's biggest enemy as most scenes were heavily drawn out and padded with needless and dull dialogue. There were a number of scenes that were clearly supposed to be tense and gripping, but failed miserably.The entire movie is just so underwhelming and should have been better!I love sci-fi. It's without a doubt my favourite genre. It doesn't take much to satisfy my sci-fi needs.

Jennifer Lawrence delivers an emotionally intense, but believable Katniss Everdeen. The Characters portrayed were intelligent and believable. At no point did they make choices that would seem illogical or out of place, simply to drive the plot forward... (with one small exception) like in so many movies these days.The movie was genuinely inspiring, and generally unpredictable. Leaving the audience squirming in their seats as they try to anticipate the coming scenes. Certainly I am glad to have never read the books, because knowing how things would have played out would have ruined so much of the suspense and intensity. At no point was I bored, choosing to hold my bladder for the final half our, so as not to miss a moment.EXTREME SPOILERS AHEAD, only for those that have already seen the movie: My only small gripe, the only thing that makes this movie not completely perfect, (and this is certainly a subjective opinion) is President snow's choice to allow the rescue-team to recover the tributes from the capitol. Sure, one of them had a small chance to kill Katnis, sure she would feel emotional trauma at the pain inflicted on Peta, but I imagine it would have been a lot more effective to execute them, than to give them such a moral boosting victory and allowing them to save more important figure-heads of the rebellion. This decision did not seem as smart, nor as sociopathic as I imagine President Snow to be. I can live with writing this off as President snow being rather demented and therefor somewhat unpredictable, but not without a little reservation.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

In principle the division could have been a good thing for the scenography, the narration and so on, but they have cut the story in the wrong point. In the end we have a slow and boring movie. In the most of the film there wasn't any action, just one arrow is shot by Katniss through all the movie! And in the majority of the film there was no tension. I didn't like the scenography, i.e. what they have chosen to play. The book is so much better.

I tried giving the books a shot and didn't like the style, the first movie was alright but the second was pretty good. This movie however, is filled with the most arbitrary plot points a five year old could possibly conceive. It seems that the entire resistance movement spends the movie convincing themselves that Katniss and her boy toy matter in the scheme of things. Honestly I'd be spoiling the plot if I elaborated, but it involves dropping flowers after a bombing run, throwing around intel like hot potatoes, and the weakest sleeper agent anyone could find. Honestly the presidents actions have become so contrived that every scene he had was him being filled in on how stupid his enemies were and then just staring off into the distance and muttering something cryptic. There were so many stupid scenes that I laughed out loud several times. There was seriously a scene where a deer looks at Katniss pointing a bow at it and just casually looks away. Gale then mutters ""it's never been hunted before."" Apparently the screenwriters believe fear and fight or flight are conditioned responses. There was also a scene with Katniss, a flashlight and a cat, where she plays that game that everyone plays with cats where they chase the light. As she does this she seems to have an epiphany about her current situation and I'm all like ""okay now this is good, the cat is the resistance, and the light symbolizes freedom. This could be some good stuff."" She then walks over to one of the other tribute boy toys and basically says that it made her realize she needs to save her boyfriend...So much potential for good sci-fi squandered on typical teen romance bullshit","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

My biggest complaint about this movie is I feel like this was a cash grab. Don't get me wrong I think this was a really well done cash grab up but I feel as though the last book Mockingjay part one and two could have been combined into one single movie.With that out of the way I think this was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a really good job being Katiness Everdeen as the lead in this movie. The acting in this movie was very good all around and I really can't point to an actor and and say they had a bad performance. Some of the people cast in this movie made there roles in this movie more memorable then if it was a different actor. For example Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Julianne Moore as President Coin really add something to there roles which might not be present otherwise. The special effects were really good in this movie. I felt like I was really a part of this futuristic world. This was aided by excellent editing by Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa. I think the way they cut some of the more dramatic scenes in this movie really increased the suspense.I think this was a great movie and is worth seeing but I think that the reason to make a Mockingjay 1 and 2 instead of just one movie is to make money. Granted 300 million dollars is a lot of money but I think artistically speaking this movie would have been better not split up between part one and two.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

There are no Games, for one thing. For another, there's nowhere near the amount of action, as the tale focuses much more on the political machinations between the Capitol and the fabled District 13. And yet director Francis Lawrence does a fine job of presenting a gripping story that, like its predecessors, brings the heart-wrenching pain dappled with grand fire and brimstone. It's a rare 'tweener movie that can stand on its own, too.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), you've just blown a hole through the Hunger Games. Whaddya gonna do now? Hop on over to District 13, apparently, which is the home of those who are darn well fed up with the crazy shenanigans of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol. Katniss quickly learns that her fellow Games winner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is alive and well, sort of, doing propaganda interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) in an attempt to get the rebel scum to lay down their weapons. Katniss, appalled at Snow's use of Peeta and at the destruction that the Capitol's military military has wrought, decides to become the Mockingjay, a true symbol around which the downtrodden, beaten-down residents of the not-well-off districts can rally.District 13 is run by President Coin (Julianne Moore), who's every bit as intelligent, strong, creative, and resourceful as you'd suspect Julianne Moore to be in real life. She's convinced by former gamesmaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) that Katniss should be welcomed into the district and become the new face of the rebellion. This, naturally, leads to Snow's use of Peeta as more of a personal propaganda weapon aimed at Katniss herself. But who's zoomin' whom? Peeta seems awfully convincing when he tells everyone to lay down their weapons and surrender. It's no wonder that the rebels see him as a tool of The Man and are out for his blood, right? With no games to carry the bulk of the movie, the run time is a little shorter (by about 20 minutes), but that doesn't mean there's no fighting going on. Katniss and her former boyfriend – or is it also future? – Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) are armed with a bow and a Big Gun, respectively, in defense of District 13. We may not get to see hand-to-hand combat, but at least we're not seeing children kill each other. In fact, this entry in the series features far fewer on-screen deaths. But rest easy, there are plenty of harrowing moments, because when one side has a metric ton of big weapons and you do not, you're likely to get stomped on a little bit.The decrease in violence allows the viewer an even better look at some truly terrific acting. The performances by Lawrence, Hoffman, Moore are all award caliber, and I don't mean ""for an action movie based on a young-adult movie,"" either. They're really great, which isn't a big surprise considering the pedigree each possesses. Still, it's nice to see layered character development in a blockbuster, and if this were a more-typical drama, even more praise would be justly heaped upon the cast.Also along for the ride are Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) as the scraggly former Victor with more sense than he lets on; Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) as Katniss' fashion consultant, even in hiding; and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), the former Tribute who's the tech wizard for District 13. They all have jobs to do in this new world order, and each job centers around making Katniss not into just a one-dimensional heroine for the world but to bring that heroine out of Katniss. You know, organically.I'll admit that the first twenty minutes or so felt a little slow. Not forced, just a stark contrast to the pulse-pounding action of the earlier movies. But then things kick into a whole 'nother gear once Katniss see what's become of her beloved District 12, reduced to rubble in the aftermath of the last Hunger Games. It's compelling, wrenching stuff, particularly when you realize that's not just rubble laying before Katniss.In all, I think Lawrence and company did an exemplary job. You know, it doesn't seem terribly difficult to stage manage action scenes – you let the tech guys do their thing and listen to your DP. But when you have to get your audience to identify with characters and relate to their plight, that takes a softer touch. And it's all well and good to just let Hoffman and Moore and Lawrence do their thing, but Lawrence also elicits fine, underplayed performances from Hutcherson, Hemsworth, Harrelson, and even Sutherland.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

She's not even sure if she can be, but when Peeta(Hutcherson, clearly abused, broken) appears on TV, calling for a ceasefire, she realizes if they win, he will likely be executed as a traitor. In exchange for his safety and rescue, she does agree – and has to convince the thousands of civilians in Panem to rise and fight the hundreds of Peacekeepers(with a very relevant image of a now-militarized country) and the evil, selfish and dictatorial Capitol, led by the vicious President Snow(Sutherland, sinister and terrifying).Where the first two are satire on Reality TV and gladiatorial combat, this completely abandons the Games, instead exploring modern media and how it reflects and affects the culture, with both the State and the guerrilla fighting in part via propaganda, with this 2010 book predicting that aspect of IS. Going into this expecting it to be the same thing as the first two will lead to disappointment. Unfortunately, clever as this is, there are other issues. I'm not only referring to the love triangle, present but only annoying when it rarely flares up into passive-aggressive insults. This should not be merely a part of a story. There is some focus, but mostly, the structure(unlike the others, where the competition accomplished that) here does not work well for a movie. Not a lot really happens, and it certainly isn't as fast as we've gotten used to from these. They felt the need to add a few action scenes, and while they work and increase the scope, they are clearly ""put in"", and change little, if anything. The characters don't have enough to do, and we can tell there is something missing to their arc.I recommend this to any fan of Young Adult fiction. There is a lot of mild violence and some disturbing content in this. 8/10","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

I could hear people laughing at some ridiculous scenes.. The typical laugh you hear when you're watching a BAD movie. I think this is an example of how a studio wants to make more money by extending the franchise. You can tell the budget wasn't big, yes there are some cgi and special effects, but it looked very average. I felt asleep in some parts as well.

But it was just like a trailer of the whole Mockingjay movie. (No matter how good the trailer is, movie determines everything)It was actually a bad decision to split the movie in two parts and now, we have the result. I know it's all for earning more, but take examples of ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Hobbit"", ""GodFather"", they're all lengthy movies but successful ones. Mockingjay had that potential but, the splitting not only shortened the movie length but also decreased its appreciation.However, I personally liked the movie. I didn't find any useless moments here. It always goes unsaid that book is better, but this movie does justice to the book more than the previous ones. I don't recommend this movie just now. Wait until the Part 2 gets released. Then watch both the movies together. Only then you'll truly enjoy ""The Hunger Games : Mockingjay"".","19 out of 43 found this helpful.

"8","/10","An excellent adaptation of a difficult book, Mockingjay explores the political in a different but very welcome way from its predecessors.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3133720/?ref_=tt_urv","shawneofthedead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48490287/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 2014","Type three words into Google - 'Why is Mockingjay...' - and the search engine helpfully fills in the blanks: '...so bad?'. It's a common complaint about the final book in Suzanne Collins' best- selling trilogy of young-adult dystopian fiction. There's too little going on in the first half of the book and too much in the second. Characters become overblown and unsympathetic, particularly our heroine Katniss Everdeen, whose angst-ridden narration of the story grows increasingly annoying as she dithers between two boys when she should really be focusing on the war raging around her. It seems like a particularly perverse decision, then, to split this book into two films. And yet, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is something of a triumph. It's a smart, powerful adaptation that mines the great ideas and strengths of Collins' third book while excising its more frustrating elements.Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is no longer trapped in the live-or-die arena of the Hunger Games. Instead, she's been transported to the gloomy secret hideout of District 13, which almost all of Panem thought had been destroyed by the Capitol years ago. In reality, the soldiers and warriors of this District had quite literally gone underground. The subterranean District 13 is now the base of operations for a simmering rebellion against Coriolanus Snow (Sutherland), the imperious leader of the Capitol. Alma Coin (Moore), with arena designer and fellow rebel Plutarch Heavensbee (Hoffman) by her side, wants Katniss to serve as the Mockingjay, the face of a campaign to rally and unite all the Districts against the Capitol. But all Katniss wants is to save Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), the sweet, steadfast boy from District 12 who entered the Hunger Games - twice - to keep her alive, and is now the prisoner of President Snow.Shorn of Katniss' morose ruminations in the novel, Francis Lawrence's Mockingjay is far more effective than Collins' at morphing into a dark, bitter political thriller. Indeed, it becomes a war movie quite unlike any you've seen before. Typically, audiences are plunged into the heat of battle, or accompany survivors as they struggle free of the carnage of war. Here, we watch with bated breath as the Capitol and District 13 edge slowly towards war. Snow and Coin are playing a ruthless game of chess - political brinkmanship with life and death for stakes - with Katniss morphing from pawn to queen and back again. In one moment, she is at the cruel mercy of Snow, who taunts her with footage of Peeta begging her to stop fighting; in the next, her eyes blaze with righteous rage as she swears to make the Capitol pay for its crimes.No wars can be waged without propaganda - stories and ideas and battle cries that are amplified, twisted or manipulated to either galvanise or terrify the populace. Mockingjay gets this very right indeed, folding some genuinely astute political commentary into its narrative. Katniss may not be required to kill others to survive, as she was in the arena, but she's asked to do things that are arguably even more difficult for her: acting the part of the perfect rebel, speaking lines she doesn't believe against a backdrop that isn't real. The true villain here, Mockingjay suggests, is the media, which splices footage in a way that alters perceptions and truths. There's something both heartbreaking and almost farcical about Katniss' new role in the fight against the Capitol - she's forced to enter situations that will bring out the Mockingjay in her, as she's trailed by a camera crew into the field, with the calm, cool Cressida (Dormer) finding the best angle to shoot this almost-broken rebel hero at her most inspiring.It's true that Mockingjay is considerably less action-packed than its predecessors. The tale proceeds at the leisurely rate of a slow burn rather than a frantic tumble, and might strike many viewers as a story treading water before a tumultous climax. But this is a problem derived from the source material, one which Francis Lawrence mostly turns into a strength. Without the need to constantly serve Katniss' inner monologue, the film slips from war games into actual war with remarkable intelligence and wit, finding something to say even in the expansion of Elizabeth Banks' role as Effie Trinket - first, into a reluctant refugee from the Capitol, and then, Katniss' fashion consultant. There's more room to breathe in between scenes, as Katniss adjusts to her new life in District 13 - a life lived in an underground bunker, but a life preserved nonetheless. Jennifer Lawrence remains the franchise's trump card. She has been miscast in many of her recent films of late, called upon to play characters far older than her years. Strictly speaking, she's not even a physical match for Katniss. But she's riveting here, playing both Katniss' desperation and determination with a burning fire that feels right. It helps, of course, that the character on screen rarely slips into the mawkish anguish that dogged her throughout Collins' last book, but it's the actress who ensures Katniss shines as brightly as she does. The cast that surrounds her is just as good - Moore brilliantly underplays a very different sort of political leader, forming a final bittersweet tag-team with her frequent co- star, the late, reliably great Hoffman.Anyone primed by the gore-free violence of the first two Hunger Games movies might find Mockingjay a bit of a letdown. Even fans of the series will know that it is simply marking time before the politics of this war spins out of control in the final film. And yet, Francis Lawrence's film doesn't feel dispensable. On the contrary, it takes what meanders in the book and transforms it into something rich and characterful for the screen. It may be treading water within the overarching narrative of the franchise, but these are shark-infested waters, and the film draws that out in plenty of clever, rich detail.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

The scope and magnitude of the effects and cinematography was absolutely amazing; creating a very raw and believable world; and the other thing I adored was the action and empathy of this movie in stark contrast with one another; the action was very well done for a female led film; which, finally, with this franchise have decided not to skimp on that element. I agree not too much happened, but I was wrapped up the setting and the excellent portrayal of emotional fragility and mental illness to care; and while it may have been overlong in itself, I think each individual scene was as long as it needed to be. My only qualms are the overall pacing, at a push, the moments when Jennifer Lawrence did feel forced, and the under use of the brilliant supporting cast, and god did the romance underwhelm me. However; the depth of the visuals and emotional pull did win this over for me.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

The only scene worth watching is the one that climaxes with Katnis shooting down a plane and that can be seen just by watching the trailer. I can think only two reasons they made this Part 1 movie and there is no way there is a third. Either to make more money by two separate movies instead of one, or because they wanted to put all the unessesary melodrama in one movie and keep the action for Part 2. Or both. Either way the 2 minutes trailer was very promising and the 2 hours trailer we watched was very disappointing.

Oh how wrong they were, instead of sparkly vampires we are given necks being snapped and poisoned foliage. So I suppose the reel question is with this being Part 1 will it be a Desolation of Lawrence or a Battle of 13 Districts? Mockingjay has something so much deeper locked inside of it's run time than what is produced. Considering the film now after watching it and having time to think, it has so many ideas and themes. It articulates them so precisely and so subtly that it's only with distance can we truly understand how measured a movie this is. Here is a film that comments on every single major issue in our society simultaneously. The film talks about fashion and our own personal image, racism and decimation, oppression and slavery and so much more. For that alone, it deserves to be seen by all, for it's cultural significance in our world, but that's not it's only success.The film also succeeds as a film. It's true that a film that's all comment and no action would be a documentary, and Monckingjay isn't that, Monckingjay is a film that feels like a grand sceptical, it knows how important it is to fan. It has clearly learnt from Harry Potter, which is the benchmark for adaption fandom, and it just about reaches it. This is from a director who hasn't really had a good success rate with adaptions from other mediums, his previous work includes Constantine and I Am Legend, however it looks as if Francis Lawrence has became stronger over time and I can honestly say that Mockingjay is one of the strongest films I have seen all year.See the problem with Mockingjay (and in fact any 2 part film) is that you have to split the movie in two, and you have to give people a reason to come back for more. Mockingjay does this perfectly. Having read the books I would have split the film exactly where the film does, and the final movements are nothing short of spectacular. It leaves the stakes high and many questions hanging in the air, as soon as the credits roll you only want to know one thing, what happens next? (and let me reassure you the best is yet to come) I should say that Mockingjay is probably more of a drama in comparison to the other 2 films which were more action, but this is how the book is, and at no point feels forced, but more like a logical evolutionary step in what would happen after the events in Catching Fire.I could list of all the cast and explain how they now inhabit those roles, but what would be the point? We all know it anyway, however it should be said that the stand out cast members are Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson, both of who's stark contrast in previous movies are what brings the reality of the message of the film home to us.Mockingjay is violent, and savage, it is brutal and nasty. It is also gripping and beautiful and one of the best films I have seen this year. It is superior to other films in it's genre in just about every way that could matter.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The story really never led anywhere. There were a few scenes that were very well executed that I really liked, but for the most part I found myself bored and checking the time constantly. It was a very obvious attempt of splitting one story into 2 movies to increase profits. This movie has no real plot, no climax, not even a good cliffhanger. Many scenes were so drawn out it was an obvious attempt to just increase screen time to make a full movie. I have to say I found Jennifer Lawrence's acting to be particularly terrible and emotionless in this film. Skip the theater on this one, just wait for part 2 to come out and watch them together, or just watch the first 5 minutes of part 1 and then fast forward to the end because nothing happens in the middle anyways.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

I like the previous two movies, but I did not read the books (because Im not a reader. The Only books that I have read, are the Harry Potter book-series, because I am a big fan of HP).I liked the first movie better, than the second. I know that many people would disagree with me, but I like more the indie lower-budget movie style (1st movie) than big budget, that just wants to impress you (2nd movie).About the 3rd Hunger games... I have mixed feelings. It is definitely the weakest of all movies. It just isn't satisfying. It feels so empty. Everything that is in the movie is good or great, but than, when you look at the whole movie again, it is just 1 hour and 45 minutes of talking and 15 minutes of action. It is kind of boring. Smart, but even smartness after an hour turns in ""boringness"".Like I said, I did not read any of the books (but I heard that Mockingyaj is the worst one), so I can not really know if this is true, but I got a feeling, that the novel was split in to two movies just for the money. Because, you know, you just have to do that. HP started it (witch was clever, because that book really needed to be made in two movies) and now ALL the novel based teen-type movies do it.So, to sum it all up, this is a money grabbing movie, with clever dialogue & powerful acting. But this was definitely not necessary to THG movie franchise. It kind of ruined lot of respect for the till-now-praised movie series. It is the same, what is The Hobbit to Middle Earth, or Star Wars prequels to Star Wars franchise. Not bad, but the worst.But, the thing is, you have to watch this movie, to understand what will be going on in the next. Well done Linsgate, you failed with this one, you sell-out!","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Mockingjay, Part 1 picks up where Catching Fire left off, with the resistance having rescued Katniss but left Peeta to a potentially disturbing fate in the capitol. Katniss herself seems a bit disturbed--like it or not, her courage, compassion and honesty have left her as the face of the resistance--a role that she is clearly uncomfortable with. The movie is mostly a character study of her, as she balances her love for Peeta against her role as the Mockingjay, while also fighting the fact that she is still a very young woman. I will first say, however, that I understand why people are upset about this movie. The spectacular action and cliff-hanging thrills of the first two movies are mostly gone. Those looking for the slick and admittedly thrilling tension of the teenage violence of the first two movies will miss it very much here.That said, this movie is really interesting on its own merits, as it tries to do something both engaging and different. Mockingjay creates a sense of tension quite engaging for moviegoers who like character studies. Katniss has to decide, for example, does she really want to be the Mockingjay--ie, symbol of the resistance? The resistance is portrayed cleverly in the movie, as the good-guy, except that they too engage in a highly specious propaganda and behavior that seems more sketchy than meets the eye. At the same time, Peeta is in the hands of the government, but he appears to have turned traitor to the resistance as the government uses him as a propaganda tool. Or has he turned traitor? The film is admirably not clear. What is clear, however, is that Katniss's actions, as the lightning rod of the resistance, could get him killed, so she has that weighing on her as well.Additionally, the film's treatment of the notion of propaganda itself is ingenious--who would ever have conceived of a teenage movie on this topic? And yet, Mockingjay makes us understand how images can or cannot be manufactured for the purposes of swaying and deceiving a crowd. Much of the movie consists of the conflict of the resistance trying to produce effective propaganda--in other words, lies--from a character as relentlessly honest and principled as Katniss. This is again really interesting.I realize that this movie is not for everyone, but I personally thought it might be the best of the three. Jennifer Lawrence plays it brilliantly, as a teenage girl constantly on the verge of coming unhinged (which is exactly what the movie is about), on the one hand overwhelmed by the awesome responsibilities that seemed to be thrust upon her, on the other hand a young woman in love trying to save her endangered beloved. Only Lawrence could do it, as she seems to possess some special quality of emotion or spirit that only 1 in 10000 people have. She walks through the movie actually torn apart by its conflicts (or at least she seems to!) and that in itself is really impressive.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong i love to see more heroines starring in movies and therefore i was willing to give this movie a chance. however the directors of this movie made it so obvious they were trying as hard as they could to create a female lead role that they turned the potentially interesting story into a bland, frustrating, badly acted mess which doesn't do justice to the hype created around this movie. Every second word in this movie was about ""peter"", and about how she didn't care about anyone in the big picture just about saving her peter, whilst constantly collapsing in tears, endangering her peers and blowing off her boyfriend who wants to be loved but instead is ignored because of a less attractive scrawny pipsqueak, who is also blown up to be a hero undeservedly. Even the people in the movie seem to get annoyed with Jennifer Lawrence's annoying portrayal of the ""mockingjay"" and her obsession with peter. my girlfriend and i are both in agreement that we wasted money and 2 precious hours on this hyped up, big budget, badly directed movie which left us totally underwhelmed. the best part of the film was the trailers at the beginning for better movies.

If you think about it in that way, then Katniss and Peeta aren't really heroes. They care more about saving each other than any revolution or rebellion. Saving their loved ones is their number one priority. They're not classical heroes, which honestly makes them a lot more interesting to me. Truthfully, Gale is more of a hero in this story than either of them, but does that mean he is necessarily a better person? I don't know. What I do know is that it makes him feel less real or authentic. While Gale is fighting to save the world, Katniss is fighting to save the ones she loves. It's a different motivation, and although it might not make her a hero, it does make her a beautiful person!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Do not go to see this, unless you are under 15, or an absolute die hard fan of the franchise. She plays the weakest superhero since Tobey Mcguire in Spiderman. This film is painful to sit through. Very, very little story. Although in general I like Jennifer Lawrence, in this film she really missed the mark. She displays little in the way of power, dignity, grace, or inspiration. It is very poorly written, the characters are becoming very tired, and the entire enterprise lacked inspiration. I could not more heartily encourage you to avoid seeing this turkey. It was very hard to sit through.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

What's going on?!! Did you ever go to a very fancy restaurant that served tinny portions of mediocre food? Well, walking out of this movie sort of felt like that: an overcharge and a big letdown.The whole movie could have been edited into 15 minutes, but the actors (all except for Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Haroldson, whose acting is unapproachable) intentionally act and speak slowly to stretch the running time of the movie. Mockingjay Part 1 is just a bad trailer for Mockingjay Part 2 to be released probably next year, but after seeing the trailer, I'm not sure whether I want to see the real movie.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

This was a boring annoyance that was more a waste of my money and time than anything else. They just wanted to drag out the series, when really... you honestly could just skip to the end of the movie where the real action (or whats actually important) happens out of the entire movie. You wouldn't have even needed to see the first hour and a half. The entire first hour and a half was ""okay, now what?"" ""seriously storyline? get to it, nothing is happening"" all complete FILLER until the end where they want to leave you with a poor excuse for a cliff hanger. Pathetic. VERY DISAPPOINTED! For those of you who say ""oh well this was still an entertainment and still worth watching, and (justification justification justification, blah blah blah) still watch it""- I absolutely disagree. It would be more worth it to wait until you can rent it, or watch it on Netflix just before the next (hopefully redeemable) movie comes out.

""Mockingjay Part I"" contains some of the most iconic lines of the entirety franchise and some really powerful cinematic scenes. Jennifer Lawrence is asked to play a more vulnerable Katniss in this and she shines throughout. James Newton Howard is giving us one of the most iconic soundtracks.

It's not a bad movie, it's just not on the level of the other three (yet I still give this a 10/10 rating just because I love The Hunger Games so much). Upon this rewatch, I primarily noticed just how much this installment can drag, particularly when they're shooting the propos. Also I would say that the reason why this is not generally rated as highly as the others is simply because, nothing really happens here, at least not up until the last 10-15 minutes. But even at the climax, the ending is a relatively small one in comparison to what we've experienced from the other installments, hence why this is the weakest film out of the bunch.Yet I still love it, and I can't even describe why. I guess I just love the vibe of it more than anything else.But one thing I wanted to mention which I noticed during this viewing was the impeccable, and even terrifying, performance of Josh Hutcherson, especially during the ending. If there's one thing this sequel has going for it, it's that it contains arguably Hutcherson's best singular piece of acting of the entire series.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, I was disappointed to find 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' to be shallow and weak. If you want to see the movie for the action, don't. There are very few 'heart-pounding' action scenes. But I get it, the book series matures into a larger statement about oppressive governments and the concept of freedom itself. That said, the movie was neither political nor philosophical. A good example of a stellar film in this category is 'V for Vendetta.' The greatest disadvantage this film wrought was its insistence to focus on Peeta's personal struggle. It was hard to sympathize with Peeta's problems because the film dragged it along for so long. In the end, the movie was boring and sluggish. It was neither romantic, political, philosophical, nor a simple action film. It was a dull combination of all of these.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

This Part 1 thing wasn't a problem for me. I was expecting a good set-up movie for the Part 2 and that's what I got. It had emotion and humor mixed well. The story however is slow, probably too slow for some, but the great performances save the day. Jennifer Lawrence, Philip Seymour Hoffman are especially good. Not to forget other cast members.The movie also gave some wonderful moments. Partly thanks to the great soundtrack by James Newton Howard. I noticed some parts of the soundtrack to be the same from the first film and it was great that they used some of the same music because the first Hunger Games film's soundtrack was amazing.The movie will need the second part however and I am looking forward to it. The part 2 will surely make this one look better on some viewer's eyes as well.Concerning the source material. To those who have read the books: I think this movie stays more true to the source material than the earlier ones. Even more than Catching Fire. So in that sense this is my favorite movie of the series. In the sense of a stand alone movie, not so much.If you liked the first movies you will surely like this one as well. If you didn't like the first ones, well you were probably going to pass on this one anyway so I don't need to tell you to do that.BUT if you are a new viewer to Hunger Games as a whole, watch the first two first or this will confuse you very much.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Having read the book trilogy a few years ago, the idea of having a film series based around the novels seemed like a good idea... Unfortunately, none of these films have lived up to the hype surrounding them. I walked into the cinema expecting something far better than the previous films, and by the end of the movie I was more disappointed than I have been with any other installment in the series.As with the previous films, what felt like an hour of time was completely wasted at the start. The time is taken up by boring dialogue and meaningless, confusing conversations between characters that feel like they were written simply to extend the running time of the film and serve little to no purpose at all. The second half of the film begins speeding up, but even then the majority of the time given has been wasted on those 'does anyone really care' scenes from the previous films. Then there's the acting. In both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire', Jennifer Lawrence's acting has been one of the few things in the movies that was actually done properly, when compared to the poor acting of the rest of the cast. In 'Mockingjay' however, Lawrence's performance is extremely overdone... Luckily some of the supporting cast manages to do a fairly good. Lastly is the fact that Mockingjay is being split into two films. It's common for a single book to be made into multiple movies (I mean, just look at The Hobbit), but the issue with Mockingjay is that the entire novel could have been adapted into a single film. As I said earlier, the amount of time wasted in this film is insane... The entire Mockingjay novel could have easily been into a 2 hour film if those 2 hours were actually spent properly. Personally, I think this movie doesn't deserve the 7/10 rating it currently holds here. Unless your a 13 year old girl and/or really don't care about the pacing and acting in this film.... I wouldn't recommend it.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

I was, however, pleasantly surprised with how well the movie treated its source material, and in particular the complexities of the characters.There are a few things people need to understand, in order to enjoy this movie. This trilogy (3rd and 4th films are technically one film) is not Battle Royale. That film was good, and there is a similar core concept. But the Hunger Games never was Battle Royale.This is an important distinction because The hunger Games has always concentrated much more on subtle character developments, and this becomes the Mockingjay's primary focus.The film has never been merely about survival in the arena, this was only ever part of a much wider picture. I you have not appreciated the politics and power play going on, I assume you are unlikely to appreciate this film.Mockingjay focuses on the reality of what the characters go through in times of war and accurately brakes the characters down to their core. before rebuilding (some of) them.Other reviewers have criticised Katniss, for he perpetual focus on Peeta. However Katniss is a very selfish character, she always has been. She is focused on the people that she loves as her primary motivation. The other side of her personality is her natural reaction to things. This movie is as much about that (emotional) battle, as it is about the conflict with the Capital. If you don't like how this can pull one way or the other, then this will likely bug you.Others suffer in their own unique ways. I feel if subtleties are lost on you, then you won't enjoy this movie.Finally, I feel people might not warm to the movie as it is just a continuation. There is not traditional beginning, middle and end. Some people need this structure in the movie to feel like it is moving in a direction, and not just repeating itself. (note:this point was originally brought up by CBG19 on youtube)I like this movie because I enjoy the politics, I enjoy the accurate representation of how war can breakdown people, I do not think this trilogy has been all about the arena, I enjoy the subtle character developments, and I don't need a traditional story structure.I hope you see this movie and enjoy it as much as I did.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I thought they were watchable enough, watched them one time each, did not obsess too much about them and did not read the books; so, walking into this third film, I didn't have any sort of high expectations for where the story was going or what would happen to the characters - I didn't even remember any of the characters' names aside from Katniss, Peeta, and President Snow. I was just in the mood for some action. That's it. It's all I wanted. Just as long as there was some action in the movie, I would have been satisfied. But... this movie failed to deliver even that much!There was only one scene, involving some evil attack-planes, that can qualify as a genuine action scene in the entire movie, but even that sequence was rather short - in fact, the most exciting moment in that scene (and the whole movie) was one they'd already shown us in the movie's preview trailer, when Katniss shoots her arrow at the planes.The rest of the movie is just nothing but extended scenes that go nowhere, in which nothing much happens, dragged-out far longer than they needed to be. In fact, with our main character stuck in an underground bunker for most of the movie, almost all the action primarily happens off-screen. Whenever something potentially exciting happens, we generally don't get to see the action itself, just a bunch of people in a room staring at monitors.The movie also had a big problem with feeling repetitive, continually showing us scenes that establish nothing except what we already know. For example, the first time Jennifer Lawrence wanders through the wreckage and rubble left behind by an attack from the Capitol against the innocent district-dwellers, we get the sense that the Capitol is bad and they do horrible things and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad; we get the idea. But then later on, she wanders through another scene of wreckage and rubble in another long-and-drawn out scene. And then we get yet another scene just like that! We get it already! How many times do you have to establish that the Capitol are the bad guys and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad? Hurry up and get on with it already!But they don't get on with it. It just keeps dragging on and on until by the time the movie ended, I found myself asking: That's it? The movie's over already? Really? But nothing happened yet!Without having ever read the books or knowing what's going to happen next, even I can tell that they did not need to split this chapter into two segments. Instead of this dull, unnecessary episode, I'm sure there's no reason they couldn't have just squashed all the events of this film into the first act of the final film.What a disappointment.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes, this is undoubtedly a Hollywood cash-grab scheme, but that is not to say these first-part films should be given any leeway in terms of mediocrity. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. I, along with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, have been solid proof that ""the end is near!"" films can be both highly entertaining and successful. I am pleased to announce that the same can be said about Mockingjay Pt. I.Mockingjay is, without a doubt, my favorite film in The Hunger Games series so far. I suppose this came as no surprise to me, considering the final book is my favorite of the trilogy, and its bleak, despairing mood is captured impeccably in the film. The Hunger Games franchise is no longer about panicked children in an arena fighting to the death. The Games are over and the Rebellion against the Capitol has begun, with Katniss Everdeen (played with ravishing ferocity, once again, by the ever-lovable Jennifer Lawrence) as the Rebellion's poster girl—their ""Mockingjay."" The film makes profound statements about human injustices and the morality of governmental power rather than bloodshed and death, and therein lies the film's success. It has transcended from a violent tale of oppression to a deeply moving and masterful portrayal of fighting for what you believe in, despite the inevitably dire consequences.Mockingjay is melancholic and nerve-wracking from its first shot to its final one, and is therefore an incredibly difficult watch for those expecting a happy or satisfying ending. It becomes clear in Mockingjay Pt. 1 that this is an unlikely outcome, and yet, this by no means makes the film and the statements it is making any less important. It is a tale of anarchism for the sake of rebuilding democracy, which is a fascinating juxtaposition with the utilitarianism of the Capitol. While Mockingjay may not be as action-packed as its predecessors, it makes a much more crucial and relevant assertion through its powerful dialog and somber depictions of the aftermath of a civil war. Fear not, Mockingjay has enough heart-pounding action segments to keep you at the edge of your seat, yet this is notably not the point of the film. From the beginning of the series, The Hunger Games has focused on the sorrow and desperation of government brutality in a dystopian future. As we near the conclusion, Mockingjay delivers the perfect set-up for a satisfying ending. In many ways, Mockingjay Pt. I is simply just that: a set-up for the grand finale. However, it does so without ever losing touch with its vitality as a part of the story and is equally as (if not more than) immersive as all the previous Hunger Games films.You may have noticed I have keenly avoided discussing the plot of Mockingjay Pt. I. This is with good reason. The plot of this film is very keenly laid out and progresses with the perfect amount of subtlety and suspense. Every word spoken and every measure taken is of massive importance to the series as a whole, and giving anything away would feel like desecration. Yes, I have provided you with the basics: The Rebellion is in full swing, Katniss is as vivacious and unrelenting as ever, and the Capitol has initiated a murderous civil war. In all honesty, this is all one needs to know when entering Mockingjay Pt. I because there is truly nothing as satisfying as experiencing the film and contemplating its political and moral viewpoints afterwards. That goes without saying, many that have flooded (and will continue to flood) theaters to watch this film are avid fans of the previous films or the novels, and therefore know exactly what they are in for. I will admit that the film feels incomplete, but I believe that it should, because the best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) is yet to come. Mockingjay Pt. I is undoubtedly the most profound film of The Hunger Games films as of yet, and I have no doubt Pt. II will surpass it next November—even if it does shred my heart into thousands of pieces. Stock up on your Kleenex, folks.This review is dedicated to Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was astounding in this film as he was in every role he ever played. May he rest in peace.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I better state right away that I have not read the books so I do not know how good the books are or if the movies actually follow the book. However, if the movies are any indicator then I will probably not bother to read the books. So far these movies have been a display in over-hyped mediocrity as far as I am concerned.The previous movies had a somewhat ludicrous setup with people running around in ridiculous hair-do and makeup. I was not too thrilled about it but at least it gave the movie some originality. So did the games themselves. This one lacks all of that. It could be any one of a dozen post-apocalyptic stories.The movie plods along at a fairly leisurely pace, sometimes it is quite dull and slow, with some outbursts of action. Katniss herself is really not taking much active part except for being a front figure and propaganda element for the rebellion. In order to milk the series as much as possible for money (I see no other reason why it was done) it was decided to break the third book into two movies. I would say that this movie is a good example as to why that is generally not a good idea.The acting is on par with the movie. It is decent enough but nothing to write home about. Then since most of the movie really is about Katniss hulking and moaning about the unfairness of it all it is maybe not too surprising that I found most of it somewhat uninspired and dull. The same can be said about the special effects. Actually I found most of them to be rather underwhelming. There were also a fair amount of lost moments. For instance the attack on the dam. It could have been made into something nice but instead we get a ludicrous display of a bunch of unarmed people running straight against machine guns planting some bombs and then poof goes a model dam.Having now seen three out of the planned four movies I am of course going to see the fourth one as well but I am definitely not going to be in a rush to go and see it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The first was highly flawed but mostly enjoyable, and the second a large improvement, actually among the better blockbusters of that year. This third entry takes the franchise into a dull, predictable and hugely underwhelming direction however.The first thing to note here is the acting. It is generally subpar. Lawrence gives the least interesting performance of her career, clearly either tired with the franchise or not engaged by the weak script. The supporting cast is generally filled with talented actors, Harrelson, Hoffman, Moore, Sutherland and Dormer. However they are almost all wasted, given little to do and often spend time filling the screen with no real purpose. The is most glaringly obvious with Harrelson, who spends the majority of the film wandering around in the background with zero purpose. All of these great actors are shelved in favour of the dull mediocrity that is Liam Hemsworth, who is given a huge amount of screen time here. His presence is comparable with a small moist stone in your sock, irritating and uncomfortable without arousing much of a direct reaction from the victim. The only good performance of note is Natalie Dormer, who is given a passable amount of screen time and appears to be the only actor enjoying themselves.The cinematography, CGI, lighting and set design are all dull and forgettable, not worthy of description or discussion. As is the predictable and horrendously repetitive script, which features around four separate scenes wherein Lawrence's character cries whilst surrounded by rubble and debris.Finally, I will look at the film from the perspective of somebody who has in fact read the trilogy. Mockingjay is a bad book. It has some of the most rushed pacing I have ever seen, and has no character of emotional depth to it. However this film is bad in a totally different, if equally offensive way. It is bland, personality free and lazy to witness. The action is tacked on and boring, the characters are as dull as in the book, and the pacing non-existent. This is a massive disappointment, and a sad collapse of an otherwise decent film series. I would say I have hopes for Part 2, however the second half of the book is a hilarious disaster already, so I am very sceptical.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

My friends kept asking me if we can leave the movie in the middle. This is how boring and slow this movie is. I really find no reason to divide one book into two movies besides money in few pockets, of course. Some people argue that you had to split the book into two movies to develop the characters but I dare to ague. If you cannot develop a character in one scene for a two hours movie then there is something wrong with your direction, Mr. Lawrence. The movie lingers on the same subject again and again. They keep talking about the same thing. Repeated dialogues between sisters, with Gale, with Finnick, with team from Panem, with President and Heavensbee. How to make Katniss a rebel kind? Wasn't she a kind from the beginning of this series? What is the need to keep telling her that she is the face to the revolution? I think it was made pretty much clear to her in Catching Fire. But somehow every character in the movie felt the need to convince her that she has to lead a revolution. Come on now. How much prepping up does Katniss need?On the brighter side, the movie has really done well in special effects, creating cityscape and spectacular visuals. Showing gradual decline of the Pita's health is also a smart move. But in spite of that, movies has failed miserably to keep the audience engaged. This is because the story just refuses to advance. Some sequences are unnecessarily prolonged, even the action sequences. When everyone is running to find shelter why is it necessary for the cat to stay behind thus stretching the scene. Suddenly, in the middle of revolution saving the cat became high priority.The movie has too many flaws. In an advanced world with top class weaponry two fighter planes have to circle around multiple times to hit a target. Now, the target is not one person. It is a huge hospital building for crying out loud. When you are forcing an enemy to broadcast a message in your favour isn't it a good idea to record the message, edit it and then broadcast it. Not that you give him every chance to say anything on a live feed. I am sure, in a technically modern world, this wasn't a difficult thing to do. And where is this war going on that everyone keeps talking about like a cheap play on the stage. But there are hardly any scenes of war. On top of that, there is a confusing love story between Katniss, Gale, and Pita. What is with her obsession of saving Pita? She is not even sure if she love him or not. When everyone is planning to revolt against Capitol she doesn't mind endangering the mission by only talking about how to save Pita. Focus girl.Besides the special effects, other good thing about the movie is Philip Seymour Hoffman. The man just doesn't stop to impress me with his subtle improvisations in acting. In a room full of actors he can simply steal all of your attention. I am not sure how much he has completed the second part but he might be the only reason I will risk my reputation to watch it. In conclusion, movie is just waste of time and money. Do yourself a favour and watch something else.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Second, I'm assuming that you're not a huge Transformers fan and/or didn't think that Pacific Rim nor Sharknado were the height of cinematic perfection. After the first two movies, we already know a lot of back story and setup/conflict between Katniss and Pres Snow. Mockingjay PtI then introduces us to District 13 (her destination as mentioned at the end of Catching Fire) and the District 13 society (only lightly limned in MJPT1). We know there's a war coming and MJPT1 sticks to the story line as outlined in The HG book(s) to a great degree.In terms of the movie and expectations, I never got the least bit bored nor did I feel I was just being dragged through Pt1 primarily to suck money out of me. There's a lot of there-there to be discussed, outlined, and philosophized about and, if you pay any attention, lots of action, too. Sure, this installment is a lot darker but that's how the story plays out. If you compare the structure of THG to LOTR, you know what the protagonist has to do: The Capital is Mordor; Katniss is Frodo; she's the Mockingjay and he's the ring-barer. Neither has an enviable job -- just a sadly necessary, burdensome one. You know where Katniss eventually has to go and MJPT1 does an excellent job of setting this in motion.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Listening to the album on Spotify with pulsating glee, I was surprised to find that amidst the various rappers, teen pop queens, and R&B crooners, the soundtrack exploded with the aura of rebellion and fire. So does the film.There are no Hunger Games. There is no obvious cashgrabbing on display. Mockingjay has textures not seen in the previous films; it's more in sync with its political undertones and the thrills are no longer slightly fantastical. Like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Mockingjay Part 1 is a setup for what's to come. What's coming, it seems, is a finale more exciting and more finger-lickingly satisfying than one could ever believe. But Part 1 is hardly just a buffer.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) began simply as a sister to the rescue. But by this film, she's become a warrior, even if she isn't as can't-stop-won't-stop as Black Widow or Lara Croft. At the end of Catching Fire, we found that underneath all the sparkles of the most recent Hunger Games, the workings of a rebellion against the Capitol were coming to light; Katniss would become its symbol.In Mockingjay, she's shaken, rattled and rolled. She's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and her beloved Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) has been claimed by the Capitol. Her home district, 12, was bombed, with only 45 survivors; both Katniss and the remaining fighters find themselves in District 13, which has been bound underground and is now being lead by the steely President Coin (Julianne Moore). Coin, along with enigmatic gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), are leading a massive uprising. Katniss will be the face, showing the other districts that turning the other cheek would be catastrophic.Mockingjay doesn't need much of a setup — it moves along like a train off the rails. It doesn't have the slow development of its predecessors, having an everything-is-at-stake attitude that doesn't have time to take prisoners; it's more risky and painstaking than ever before. It's the best of the films, and certainly the smartest. It doesn't feel like a part of a billion-dollar franchise. It's a politically minded thriller that takes you by the throat and demands your attention.Some have complained that there is a severe lack of action. Other have noticed that most of the characters are limited to the claustrophobic walls of District 13. But these are all things that make Mockingjay even better. Without so many brutal fights and faux exotic locales, we are giving a chance to dig deeper into Katniss' psyche, and Lawrence's stunning performance allows us to be compelled. District 13 serves as a reminder of how vulnerable the rest of the districts are to the powerful Capitol; even President Coin, with her monotone delivery and calm figure, seems unsure of what's to come.Mockingjay: Part 1 is unpredictable, unshakeable, and teary. It's a work of fiction, but it somehow feels intimate, close to home. 1984 has always been scary, but there's an underlying understanding that our government would never become so totalitarian. But as we give up our privacy for protection these days, would the rosy evil of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) ever take over? Maybe not, but the film is confident enough to make us believe it. Part 2 may be a year away, but Part 1's heavy, dramatic attitude leaves an impression that has a rippling effect.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Movie Review: ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128259/?ref_=tt_urv","griffolyon12","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6136793/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2014","Continuing the trend of Harry Potter and Twilight, the third and final Hunger Games book, Mockingjay, has been split into two movies because it's, ""So much story to be told in only one movie."" Yeah, I'll let the filmmakers live with that explanation as long as they make Mockingjay - Part 2 as good as they have Part 1.Picking up literally right where Catching Fire left off, Mockingjay - Part 1 very quickly dispenses any pleasantries and jumps right back into Katniss's struggles and psyche, with Jennifer Lawrence once more proving that Katniss may just be her role of a lifetime. Katniss is now in the long thought destroyed, District 13, and is being used by their President as a figure to rally all of the other districts to rebellion against the Capitol. With war almost all but a certainty, Katniss still finds herself unwillingly thrust in this larger than life game for not only her life, but the lives of all those she cares for.This is a film about war, not only the costs and horrors of war, but also the way that media and propaganda are used in war. Watching Katniss being directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee for a propaganda video they are making -- which is ridiculously stupid, yet authentic in the way our own media represents figureheads -- is one of the few genuinely funny scenes in what is a very tense two hour movie. As it is, what keeps you trucking through some of the horrors that these characters go through is the humanity of the characters and their little quirks that often lend themselves to a little laugh here or there to alleviate the tension happening all around them, because as I've already mentioned, this is a war film.Mockingjay - Part 1 harbors shades of some of the great war films of the past few decades, with one scene in particular that reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty. These scenes, while being played out in a science fiction world, feel startlingly real because of the similarities that are easily seen between the world of Panem and our modern day world with all of our wars and injustices. However, this isn't an anti-war film, nor is it pro-war, it just shows the harsh realities of the world. Sometimes we have to fight for the things that we cannot afford to lose. While peace is a great ideal, as long as there are those who are causing unrest and want to kill all who do not bow to their whims, wars will be fought. It was that idea that I thought was the most poignant thing about Suzanne Collins' book when I read it, and that is an idea that director Francis Lawrence and his screen writing team of Peter Craig and Danny Strong have managed to keep intact for the film. If The Hunger Games crew can continue to build off of the ideas presented here and deliver a moving finale next November, we may be looking at something genuinely special with Part 2. As for now, Part 1 is definitely worth the time of any fan of these books, films, or good science fiction stories in general.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

The pacing was painfully anemic. The script is so mired and bogged down with cheesy, weepy, whiny dialogue, that only the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman can transcend the mediocre script and deliver an interesting performance. Hollywood's darling in Jennifer Lawrence brings another predictable ho hum performance - - a much overrated actor, in my 'unpopular' opinion. I had absolutely no problem with the splitting of the Hobbit film into three parts as many filmgoers decried and whined. There was a boat load of action and thrills in each of those three films. Here, there is none; therefore, the producers are knowingly and wilfully prolonging the agony filmgoers will surely endure. Prepare to yawn... a lot. This two hours of drivel and melodrama will annoy and depress you.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The only reason why this movie was split into two is because the studio wanted to make money. There is no other logical reason for this nonsense. Plot - This movie isn't very interesting or compelling. The first half is all filler while the second half is a series of semi-violent sequences of poorly choreographed action in between more boring filler. For the most part these movie are very predictable. Anything that is unpredictable is only made so due to the level of stupidity involved. I'm not sure if I can stress enough how much of this movie is boring filler. Characters - None of the actors really care anymore. The guy who plays Haymitch is still enjoyable, but he's a minor character. The characters are all as boring and idiotic and simplistic as they always were.Cinematography - The whole look of this movie is just as bad as the previous movies, but at some points its even worse. There isn't really anything to say about this movie. Its just a load of boring, predictable nonsense.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","follows the book quite well - if you liked that, you'll like this, or...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3137429/?ref_=tt_urv","Quinoa1984","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0453068/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2014","... If you haven't read the book, but keep up with the series, Mockingjay part 1 - the first half of an adaptation of the third book in the Hunger Games series - it still works. Or it did for me. One of the main things is that it takes its story from the book, and it gives some time to breath for the characters. You get to see how this develops - how Katniss is poised to become this symbol/figure of the revolution for all the other districts, how she's molded (at first unsuccessfully, then majorly) as a figure for the people through what is another ""reality"" show, only this time more on the side of propaganda - and you don't have to rush through it, it's laid out piece by piece, you get a sense of this District 13, the other districts rebellions, and so on.So, first things first, it's its own movie. It's not simply easily dismissible as a 'it's only HALF a movie' sort of thing. Also, the acting is still top-notch for what this material asks for. Lawrence is still incredible as Katniss, having to express more the PTSD that her character has by this point going through two hunger games; Hoffman, in one of his last performances (part 2 of Mockingjay will be the last) strikes a jolly-calm-stern balance throughout his work here as the progandist; newcomer Julianne Moore maybe has the toughest role to play - and she is a lot colder in the book for those who have read it and know - but carries herself strongly in her scenes, aided by gray hair; more surprising is Liam Hemsworth, who I thought was weaker in the previous films, kind of like window dressing. Here, he has to if not carry scenes be more of a firmer presence, like when they return to District 12, or scenes between him and Katniss. He's gotten better.What I liked here is the mix of the 'Media Image', on both the sides of District 13 and the malevolent President Snow with his interviews staged with prisoner Peeta (some of the make-up as he gets weaker is a bit cheesy), and how this is set in the backdrop of this revolution. How much people want change? Well, enough to storm a dam or fight back by going high into trees for a couple of things (these are things we at best hear about in the book but don't see, one benefit of film vs the book in terms of point of view). But best of all I like how director Lawrence paints a relentlessly grim picture, and it's never entirely dour. Nor does it have to be super action-packed; this might deter some audiences who just want the blood and carnage of the Games of the previous films. And to be fair Catching Fire did improve upon it.But unlike something, say, Harry Potter 7 part 1, there's not a lot of aimless wandering around or pondering. Things keep moving, the story keeps going, Katniss' progression as a kind of 'icon' that she naturally becomes through her anger and persistence (and of her handlers), not to mention the bit-by-bit rising of the other districts, it makes for a dynamic film that is really about politics as much as anything else. So that by the time Snow and Katniss have their brief face-off through a video screen, the intensity is white-hot. This is a smart, brawny blockbuster that is not exactly, you know, a ball of laughs, but for what it presents as another in a line of thrillers, it's different and has enough of a satiric edge amid its epic qualities to make it stand out from, say, the Divergent series.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Loads of people are getting killed and there homes are completely destroyed just because of this one girl who is wondering around doing publicity for the rebellion. On top of that, she keeps on going on about saving Peter when she doesn't have a clue about his state of mind or why he is going on TV saying that she should stop fighting against President Snow. The storyline seemed a bit to far fetched to me and Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) should have used her powers to kill President Snow except for causing an unnecessary political war. I also thought it was a bit stupid that she was visiting all of these places whilst being filmed, knowing that there was an army looking for her, but thats just me being picky. Anyway, the movie lacked action and it took some time to get going. The performances aren't that bad but I wasn't that impressed with the storyline. I'm not a big fan of the earlier movies so my expectations weren't that high but after hearing all the hype surrounding the movie and seeing the huge box office takings, I was expecting a bit more. On the plus side, it does have me wanting to see the 2nd part of Mockingjay because it was left wide open and it does seem like the true war hasn't begun. Watchable!Round-Up: The director didn't use Woody Harrelson or Stanley Tucci as much as he did in the previous movies and I did miss Lenny Kravitz who seemed like her only true friend. With one week of filming left, Phillip Seymour Hoffman sadly passed away but the director pieced his footage together well. Anyway, the movie seemed more like a political statement then a epic adventure which was a bad choice from the director. The cinematography was done well and you really can see were the $125 million budget went but as I haven't read any of the books, I really don't know how close this movie is to Suzanne Collins original story. At the end of the day, I can't really comment on this franchise until the final movie has been produced but for entertainment, it does drag in places and I'm glad that I didn't have to sit through this 2 hour political drama in the cinema.Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $752million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their epic Sci-fi/adventures about a girl who tries to save her colony which is under attack. 5/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

For me, the first part of Mockingjay was the least exciting of all (I still really enjoyed it, I'm just saying compared to the others). You have to remember that this is not just the first half of a story, it is the last part of the series, so this part is not meant to be exciting and action packed, it is to bring you back to Katniss and prepare you for the end. I feel like they did not have much of a choice, if Mockingjay was one whole film there would have been too many crucial part cut out or it would be a very long film. I am sure people that did not read the books might be OK with that because Francis Lawrence can make anything work, but I am sure Suzanne knew that this was something that had to be taken apart to be right. I love this series, I love the cast, so I did love Mockingjay Part 1, it is not my absolute favourite (Catching Fire is) but, looking at it as a Part 1 movie, it was amazing. I was so impressed with how they changed some things to add excitement in the film, it was enjoyable as a viewer.

All she had to do for her part was practice her facial expressions and emotions because there was nothing else coming from her. When I realized the movie was over 2 hours long, I groaned. On one hand I'm waiting for the action to begin and on another, when it does, the reigns are pulled in and it continues it's slow crawl. It's a sleeper. I can honestly tell you that a part of me wanted to see Katniss killed off just to end my pain.

This turned out to be a poor decision.When I was sitting in the cinema, I had thoughts about leaving the cinema which is new for me. Of course, as I've read the books, I felt like I couldn't – I had to know whether it would improve in the last hour. To me, the whole movie appeared as a preview of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. There was hardly any action at all, and Katniss (portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence) just seemed to be crying for half of the movie. We all know Jennifer Lawrence is better than that, and the script given to her didn't show all of her talents. The ending was dull, and I'm unsure whether it was predictable as I read the book before going to see the movie.All I can say is hopefully the final film will make up for this one with tons of action scenes and shocking twists, possibly even a twist for those who read the book first.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film.In this film, we follow Katniss' first steps as a revolutionary. After being rescued from the arena and recovering from her injuries, she discovers that she is with a group of rebels, the same ones who allegedly lost the civil war seventy-five years earlier, the same ones who inhabit the supposedly extinct District 13. After all, everything was a lie. Everything was a manoeuvrer by Snow's regime to hide the existence of a strong movement of political contestation. Alma Coin, the head of the Resistance, asks for Katniss's support, wants her to become a symbol, a mascot. But she only thinks about the fate of her friends, especially Peeta, who is in Snow's power and seems to have been brainwashed.Well, after the second film turned out to be excellent it was difficult to do better, but it was totally possible to match it. I don't think that happened, although it is very close. This continues to be an excellent film and to be within a standard that does not clash or belittle the other two. I just don't seem to have managed to be that good. To begin with, I hate when a film based on a book splits into two halves, it is almost always a sign that there is immense straw that could be perfectly removed in an editing room by a skilled editor. The film, in fact, drags a little more than those that preceded it, but if the audience gets involved in the story it ends up not even noticing much. It is also a film that has a lot of sci-fi, the most focused on that genre in all of tetralogy.Jennifer Lawrence has remained excellent, but it brings nothing that we have not seen. In addition, attempts to create a romantic plot around her character are weak and cold, whatever the target of Katniss's interest. Donald Sutherland continues to surprise and now gives us an almost perfect villain, in his megalomania, narcissism and thirst for control and power. He is truly an exceptional actor, at his best. Stanley Tucci was much more serious and restrained in the way he brought Cesar, a sensationalist TV host, to life, but it reveals how his character is just a puppet of the regime. Elizabeth Banks is an actress who reveals herself in this film, thanks to the profound mental and psychological transformation that her character will undergo here, and Woody Harrelson gains strength and seriousness, as she becomes one of the most fervent supporters of ""Mockingjay"". Julianne Moore alternates between contained sweetness and charismatic strength and presence; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are very good, but they don't do much more than they ask. Josh Hutcherson continues to sound weird, although in this film this is almost required by the character.In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, excellent sets and costumes and great CGI and sound effects that make fights and combats seem like they want to get off the screen . The soundtrack also deserves special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.Full of action and with an excellent story, this film is excellent, although it is not as engaging and intense as the film that preceded it. It drags on more, some scenes seem to be expendable, but that's what happens when, for money, a book unfolds in two films.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As a fan of books and previous movies i was a bit afraid 'Hunger games: Mockingjay - Part 1' will disappoint me. But it DIDN'T. Of course this movie is different from first two, but so were the books. It's the first movie in Hunger games series without actual Hunger games. Action buffs may be disappointed, this movie is slower than previous two, but i didn't feel prolonged. Two hours which it lasted, passed very fast. I even started to think that splitting the third book into two movies is a great idea. Stunning performance of Jennifer Lawrence reveals true Katniss Everdeen. This Katniss (at least for me) was closest to the one i read about in the books. All in all, i enjoyed watching this movie. Maybe my expectations were too low and this is why i it surpassed them. Performance of Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket) must also be mentioned. It's a pity she played only a few scenes. Puff of energy in a grey strict world.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Although it's only the first half of book three which is a little slower than the rest, it was full of action and stayed true to the intense story line of the book and set it up perfectly for the epic conclusion of Mockingjay Part 2. As an active reader I'm extremely critical of movie adaption, but this was spot on. This is not just an action film, but the story of a young girl who is forced to face the odds to protect the ones she loves. It's about taking a stand for what's right in dark times, a lesson you're never too old for. This film features fantastic actors, amazing special effects, and an incredibly spine chilling score from James Newton Howard.

For someone who has NOT read the books, it was a very enjoyable picture and kept my interest throughout. The acting, as usual, was really nice and once again Jennifer Lawrence did a great job in the lead. The film was filled with action and excitement. Before I went to see the film, I was a bit annoyed that the final book was split into two films. Is this shameless commercialism? Sure.

I really liked the characters. The characters all serve a purpose for different reasons in the movie. The Stunts were awesome! Georgia has been a good location to film this movie.This moment has an unmistakably kitschy ring to it, and it speaks to the quintessence of young-adult fiction and why no real adult should take it seriously (though more than ever, they do). Civilisation hangs in the balance, but what's really at stake is Katniss' feelings for Peeta – the dewiest of junior love stories. Of course you could argue that Casablanca, minus the puppy- love factor, works in pretty much the same way, with the outcome of World War II hinged on the issue of whether Humphrey Bogart's Rick will remain with Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa. But if Katniss is the forceful prime mover in Mockingjay – Part I, Peeta, let's be clear, is no Ilsa. As played by Josh Hutcherson, he has all the charisma of the least interesting member of the Yale crew team. Katniss, for most of Mockingjay – Part I, is more interested in saving this preppy hand- puppet than she is in bringing about the overthrow of tyranny. By now, even much of the audience may not share Katniss' Peeta fixation. Three movies into the Hunger Games series, their bond comes off as more desperately theoretical than ever.Lawrence, who had the implacability of an Olympian in the first two Hunger Games films, now plunges Katniss into a mood of Hamlet-Esq doubt: having become the poster girl for revolution, she's not at all sure if she wants the role. She's wary and woeful, just like the Katniss who first volunteered for the Hunger Games to save her sister. Lawrence has a chance to show some more vulnerability, but Katniss' tearful ambivalence about whether she's committed to the cause, or merely to saving Peeta, plays out in a less than scintillating way. It's not the actor's fault. This is what happens when you split the third installment of a YA series into two blockbuster movies: Part I is basically all dragging exposition.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

But there is just something about these movies that makes me hate them...In fact, there is quite a few.The actors, for the most part are not that appealing. This is made even worse with the characters they play, with such over-acting and pantomime like approach.Their character names are some of the most annoying I have come across, and cringe when each and everyone says Peeta as if they have a speech problem and just want to call him Peter.Regardless, and for the sake of my husband, I had to endure the first two, of which you can find my reviews there. There is too much nonsense and typical Hollywood goofs to go on about, but with part 2 slightly better than the first, I went in to this one without complaining much, expecting a rip roaring adventure that may see the actors a little more comfortable in their roles that would lead to enjoying them a bit better...Boy was I wrong!Thumbs up for creating a darker, more bleak version of its previous movies, but having hardly any recollection of how part 2 ended so abruptly, I was lost from the get-go.What I did find however, was that this was more Divergent than Hunger Games, layered somewhat over the blue print of the Matrix Revolutions, which in itself was a big mess of a movie!Once again, the sheer appearance of the chubby faced Lawrence and not-so-pretty Hutcherson had me cringe each time they appeared on screen. Other characters were less pantomime which was helpful, and yet again, the mess of Hollywood goofs kept me entertained to the end...Katpiss' arrows always staying the same number even after being fired. The Capitol being able to broadcast video even during a power shortage. And my favourite, the Hollywood CCTV camera!Even with so many 'talented' crew and film makers on board, this one never fails to amaze me... We, as the viewers, watch as Katpiss shoots down some aircraft that are after them. Then later, we see a cleverly edited video of her doing so in a promotional effort, that includes many of the shots used by the film makers for us.That means, those in District 13 would have had to contact the producers of THG: Mockingjay 1 and ask for said footage, which in theory we all know would be a tricky thing for them to do. But somehow, it all happens for them. Amazing!A film about democracy, that sees all of those in the corner for it, dressed alike, living alike and chanting alike, in a very communist way... All that state of the art technology underground, and they are still serving slop, dressing in boiler suits, and don't even have a coffee machine.Mockingjay Part 1 will do for the fans no doubt, but it was long winded, boring and then some. No doubt when we all see the last instalment, we will then get a better idea of what they could have chopped out to make one big film that entertained.Until then...","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

The first movie was really average for me, but I loved Catching Fire for scene after scene of powerful film-making. I've read Mockingjay so I went into it expecting it to be a cash grab and I wasn't disappointed?....The film started out fantastic for the first minute, and thats about it. Most of the acting was fairly good, Julianne Moore was a good casting choice for President Coin, Woody Harrelson was great, Philip Seymour Hoffman always does good etc. Jennifer Lawrence was good as always, except for 2 moments when I laughed in scenes that were meant to be taken seriously, maybe a tad overacting.However why was this split into 2 movies? They added Effie's character into the story to stretch out the run time, and talking about stretching out the run time, The entire finale was about 2 pages in the book! In the book it worked because when the eventual twist did happen, we weren't there for the initial scene, only the aftermath. And because there isn't any actual Hunger Games in this movie, they felt like they needed to stuff some action into the movie which again just feels so forced.Also Donald Sutherland? Hes a great actor, he was fantastic in Catching Fire! The entire capital seemed really threatening in the last movie, here it just seems so forced, they shoe-horn him into the finale just so he can get some sort of screen time at all.I've already mentioned how a lot of the characters feel pushed into the storyline. But even Katniss doesn't feel genuine. Katniss is still the same person as she has always been, she doesn't learn anything new but cry awkwardly over dead bodies at least 3 times. I thought we'd get more time with Gail and Finnick since they haven't had a great amount of on-screen presence but nope. They are wasted here. I missed the conversations that Gail and Katniss shared in the book, but without comparing it to the book, Gail just seems like a piece of wood anyway.The movie looks the same as Catching Fire, it's color graded darker and the cinematography is pretty sleek looking. But there was some shaky cam in there... What the hell? The last movie accomplished beautiful wide shots of action, not awful shaky cam - its not even done effectively. At least with Harry Potter, the book was around 750 words, so there was a lot of content to grasp in Deathly Hallows Part 1. Here i feel like they could've just taken a risk a made it a 3 hour movie for the fans. But even if you haven't read the books, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is terribly unsatisfying and can't help but feel like a 125min trailer for the next movie. By itself, it sucks as it's own movie.OK ill stop now, enough ranting! There isn't a thing about this movie that is horrendously bad, but there aren't the powerful and thrilling moments of the last installment. Mediocre plays a more prominent role than any of the shoe-horned characters in the movie. A generous 5/10","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A film that needs to be justified before it can be praised","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3130187/?ref_=tt_urv","StevePulaski","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23483288/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2014","I've made my lukewarm opinions about ""The Hunger Games"" film franchise rather apparent in my reviews of the last two films. While being enjoyable for a short period of time for their action sequences during the actual games and the appeal of Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen, the previous two films have always found a way to include some sort of feature that prevents me from giving them positives reviews. The first film was burdened by mediocre direction, which felt almost constantly off balance or unsteady in its videography, and the second film found itself including too many hokey sequences before descending into tiresome survivalist action.""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is the first of the two part finale to this series, and can effectively be summed up as a two hour trailer for the second part. Being a film conducted in two parts, the first part is inevitably setup for the second part, which will undoubtedly be the climactic part of the two films. With ""Mockingjay"" being only ten pages shy of four-hundred, splitting the film into two films over two hours in length is a questionable decision. Taking a book that is already questionably long enough to sustain two parts and making the first part a dreary plod through exposition and talky setups is enough to make me lose the limited amount of appreciation I had for this franchise.The film sees Lawrence reprise her role as Katniss, and reminds us of how Katniss destroyed the annual Hunger Games and essentially left her home of District 12 in ruins. After being relocated to District 13, Katniss, suffering from severe flashbacks and trauma, is recruited by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), a rebel leader, who wants to use Katniss as propaganda for a potential civilian unrest. On top of this newfound gig, Katniss is also trying to rescue Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) from the capital, who have taken him prisoner. Katniss blames old District 12 victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) for Peeta's capture, who promised to save him before her. The film follows Katniss's many battles with what seems to be some type of post-traumatic nightmares, her fragile emotional state, and her gig as a propaganda figure for the potential capital uprising.For starters, any outcries of praise for Katniss being a dominate and strong-willed female character should dwindled to faint muffles after the complete character reversal we see occur in this film. Katniss, who has always been something of a cliché of herself or, at very least, an archetype, has no resorted to being a character who whines and cries powerlessly with every event. Never do we see the same determined and incorruptible force of a character we saw in the previous films, who is innovative and selfless, but instead one who is far less interesting and cursed with a weepy and fragile ego.On top of that, we get dreadfully boring exposition in the way that talks about the rise in propaganda in Panem. What could've been rich with commentary unfortunately finds itself remaining stagnant in terms of simply existing and providing little payoff. Scenes involve Katniss, Coin, and a gaggle of other characters talking about potential civil unrest in the districts before we see Katniss having another traumatic nightmare inside a hospital, desperately crying out for Peeta. The film keeps circling itself in this manner, and it doesn't help that Lawrence, who, as I've said before, is a gifted actor when she's playing human characters in realistic environments, handles the emotional scenes with an evident element of overacting that neither intensifies or captivates but instead finds ways to offput.The contents and existence of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" will be justified by the devoted fans of Suzanne Collins' book series as necessary for a complete adaptation, to which I do not disagree; we need elements of setup and narrative articulation not only for clarity but so the climactic parts can succeed on greater, more emotional levels. The issue is we don't need two hours and a separate film for the events, and what perhaps could've worked out at least adequately results in nothing more than a blatant cash-grab for a franchise Lionsgate clearly doesn't want to only be worth three films.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

I'm not a die-hard fan by any means (I haven't read the books, nor am I into teen fiction), but I enjoyed the first two films, especially Catching Fire, which displayed a great combination of thrills, humour and tragedy.Mockingjay Part 1 felt like a bit of a letdown in comparison though. By all accounts there was really no need to split the third book into two parts anyway, and it's all too clear to see on screen. It's like what Deathly Hallows Part 1 was to Harry Potter, a slow plodding instalment in the franchise, made purposely to make more of a profit for the studios involved, and to apparently flesh out the characters' backstories and plight.Someone obviously forgot to tell the writers and director this almost kills the movie dead, and reduces the whole thing to a snail's crawl.I didn't hate the movie by any means. There's a few good intense scenes in the film to sustain one's interest until the end, and it's interesting to see how the overall story of The Hunger Games develops here, plus the cast, as with the previous entries, is a joy to watch, notably Donald Sutherland, still quietly menacing as President Snow, newbie to the series Julianne Moore as the commanding President Coin of District 13, the always watchable Woody Harrelson, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, who brings some much needed warmth and humour to the film. Among all this though, nothing much really happens in the end, aside from a few skirmishes to keep the viewer entertained now and again, and Jennifer Lawrence delivers an unusually one-note performance, compared to her other stints as Katniss. It's like she's been told to act more moody and glum than usual so we feel sorry for her, which backfires, with certain set pieces made to show her anger and rebelliousness towards the Capitol, which here somehow feels a bit too fake and staged. She does try hard though with a rather uneven script, and doesn't disgrace herself. All the young cast acquit themselves well with the plot, especially Liam Hemsworth, and Josh Hutcherson, but some people, such as Natalie Dormer, are virtually wasted. Not that it harms the movie, mind.Overall though, compared to the colourful excitement and buzz over Catching Fire, this film feels like the brakes have been applied to the franchise, and is consequently all the more dull and soulless because of it. Hopefully Part 2 will put everything firmly back on track, because after watching this, you will feel satisfied enough, but because the inconsistent pace and mood rather distances the audience from the characters and the movie itself, it also puts a dampener over the overall hype of how it will all end in the last film.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

This is what happens when you take a long book and try to split it into two movies- which, I get it, they really just wanted more money. If you make it into one, people will argue that it's a bit too long, and you may end up losing some great scenes when they make cuts on the director's floor. But this movie dragged on and on, so many references to the previous movie that we didn't need, and I was getting tired of Jennifer Lawrence: 1) Staring deadpan into the camera in a ""deep"" connection, 2) Crying at the drop of a hat and constantly having an emotional breakdown, 3) Only talking about Peta and basically not giving a damn about anybody else, 4) The lack of any kind of REAL action for at least 3/4 of the movie. I get it, and yes, I have read the books. Katniss goes through a lot, and I understand that mentally/emotionally that takes a toll on any person. But Lawrence falls incredibly short with this one (though it's really not all her fault by any means). Where I used to be rooting for the characters, now I was getting more annoyed with their movements, bored and uncaring with their problems, wondering where the STRONG connections in the first books went between SO MANY characters, and wondering why when their were breaks between characters none of it was really played out or portrayed in a way that would make sense to the audience member. I saw it at a movie tavern, and I watched people walk out THIRTY MINUTES before the movie was done. I was incredibly tempted myself but I figured I paid so I should wait. I didn't even stay to see if there was an easter egg- I ALWAYS STAY TO SEE IF THERE'S AN EASTER EGG- because I was so over it and just didn't care. Don't waste your money in theaters, a dollar rental or a download to your T.V./computer will do just fine- there was no real action to see in this anyway, save for the last 2 minutes of the movie, and even THAT I'm sure you can find on youtube. So sad, I'll probably just download the last one online when it comes out, not getting duped and wasting my money like that again.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

""Mockingjay Part 1"" being Part 1 of a 2-part story it obviously not going to be the fastest paced film. This being said the story didn't feel like it dragged on and was still a fantastic entry to the franchise. Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived. She awakens from the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell deep inside the hunkered catacombs of District 13. Separated from some of her closest allies and fearing for their safety in the Capitol, Katniss finally agrees to be the Mockingjay, the symbolic leader of the rebellion. Still uncertain as to whom she can trust, Katniss must help 13 rise from the shadows, all the while knowing that President Snow has focused his hatred into a personal vendetta against her-and her loved ones. ""Francis Lawrence"", the director of this film, once again directs it very smoothly and differently in the fact that there are no games in this one. He takes advantage of the sets to make them as useful as possible and he takes a smart turn with this one. The acting from ""Jennifer Lawrence"" is once again amazing with a lot more emotional scenes put on her. Although ""Josh Hutchersons"" character doesn't have much screen time he defiantly redeemed himself from his previous attempt with Peeta Mellark in ""Catching Fire"". The last lead is ""Liam Hemsworth"" but his look on his character, Gale Hawthrone, makes him seem like a very boring and self centered character, although its not ""Liam Hemsworths"" fault that his character seem self centered he defiantly plays a role in it. ""Sam Claflin"" is back playing his character Finnick Odair but his character doesn't have much screen time, saying that ""Sam Claflin"" does make use of his time. Although the characters in this film are mostly the same as the last two films there are a couple more characters introduced. One of them include President Alma Coin who is the leader of District 13. They mostly leave her character in the dark to make her seem on Katniss' side. But Katniss doesn't really know who's side she's on. Another new stand out character of the film is Cressida, who is part of Katniss' camera team. The returning characters have massive character development through the film especially Katniss and Peeta. Another great part of this film is the score composed by James Newton Howard, although there aren't so many great songs in it the ones that are great, I mean are really really great. Obviously having less action in this film you would think it would need less special effects. Wrong. The film had a high budget of an estimated $125 Million. Most of this probably went into the set design of District 13, but if you think about it they can't build a whole civilization underground in three months. So what does this mean they have to use. Special Effects and my god you can't even tell if the characters are standing in front of a green screen. Another place they succeeded in in the special effects department are the action scenes. Including the District 8 bombing and the Hanging Tree Action sequence. The only issue I had with this film is a small pacing issue in the beginning. It didn't drag on but it did have a couple of filler scenes near the beginning, but if you took them out some of the movie wouldn't make sense so I guess they should've made those couple of scenes different from the book which it stayed true to. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" was a very good entry to the fantastic ""The Hunger Games"" Franchise with once again smooth directing and spectacular acting from most of the cast. It had great character's, a good score, amazing special effects but it did have small pacing issues near the beginning. I give 2014's ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" a 9.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Following the path previously set by the Harry Potter and Twilight Saga franchises, the producers also decided to divide the last book in the series, Mockingjay, into two parts. Now that I have seen the first part, I thought this decision may have been misguided.This film begins right where the previous one stopped where Katniss wakes up in District 13 where she was taken by rebels after she destroyed the Quarter Quell arena with her arrow. Katniss becomes the symbol of the rebellion by appearing in incendiary promotional advertisements, but Katniss was angry with them because they left her partner Peeta behind at the Capitol. Backed with the technical knowhow of Beetee, President Coin of District 13 sends a covert mission led by Gale to rescue Peeta and the other Victors from their captivity. Jennifer Lawrence is far and away the best performer in this film. Her face is really rich in unspoken emotions. Josh Hutcherson gets to flex some of his acting muscles more in this one as the brainwashed Peeta Mellark. It was good to see old characters played by Woody Harrelson, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Hemsworth, Jeffrey Wright and Sam Claflin, though their roles were very limited here. New to the cast, acclaimed actress Julianne Moore is rather one-note in her performance as President Coin. The best moments of this film for me actually had to do with music. The first would be that sublime moment where Katniss sang the haunting tune called ""The Hanging Tree."" The next one would already be during the closing credits when the incredible new song of Lorde ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" was played. Overall though, I felt disappointed that this film cannot stand on its own. Unlike the action-packed first two films, this one was just a lot of slow talky scenes which the talented actors cannot do much about to make them any more exciting. That one awesome scene where Katniss shot down a plane with an arrow was even already shown in trailers. No other action sequence matched that one. This whole film clearly served nothing but to just set-up for the big concluding episode to be shown next year. There were a lot of scenes which were unnecessarily prolonged just to pad up the running time. The scenes showing the destruction of District 12 were actually shown twice. The escape to the underground bomb shelter scenes were extended too long. I thought judicious editing could have made these scenes tighter, so that the whole story could have been told in one big spectacular film. Judging from what happened to this one, dividing the last book into two parts may have just succeeded to make the last two films two incomplete films.Anyway as US box office receipts come in making ""Mockingjay Part 1"" earn the biggest domestic opening weekend this year ($123M!), I'm sure fans will still all watch this whatever critics and other people say. And definitely, we will all be hanging on for one more year for that explosive Part 2 to come along and blow us away. 5/10.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

Brilliant addition to the series even as part 1 of 2. Mockingjay has dispensed with the killing games of the 1st two instalments in favour of war, political power plays and the beginnings of a rebellion. There is also an underlying theme highlighting the power of the media and it's influence in such matters. This one is intense and really packs an emotional punch - aided by some excellent direction and some great acting from the lead players. It is sad to have the knowledge that we have now lost a talent like P.S. Hoffman - his Plutarch is a wonderful exercise in subtlety and intellectual prowess. An interesting match against the power of the capital, with it's abundant troop numbers and heavy firepower. He is a gifted strategist and the one who seems to really know what is going on. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent once again as Katniss. It is clearer now (than in the 1st two films) why she had been picked for this as she really makes you believe the up and downs of this difficult journey, and you are with her for every step. Some of the heart wrenching scenes/speeches (one early one in particular) may have fallen flat in the hands of another actress. I found myself completely engrossed for the entirety of this film, not wanting to take my eyes off the screen for any of it. As I said previously, this is heavy on the emotion and it rarely lets up. Even with little knowledge of the intricacies of the back story and history of Panem, you are wholeheartedly behind the rebellion and you so fervently despise the man behind the suffering. Sutherland hasn't had much screen time in any of these films but credit to him to still make you loathe the Snow character and his relaxed attitude to the genocide of entire cities of people. It's a pity that this film had to be split in 2. It's annoying to have to wait so long for a conclusion. I am deducting a star purely because it feels unfinished. However, considering this is based on fiction for young adults...it still hits hard and will stay with me for a while.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Actually it is where I belong, unfortunately, Moore is the new addition in the cast, as President Coin, leadership usually is not in her wheelhouse, remember CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10)? Plus my perfectionist side urges me to continue since I have watched the first two THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10) and THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE (2013, 6/10), for better or worse, I will definitely watch the final chapter next year to wrap it up, sorry to fall into the machination of capitalistic greed. However, I will keep a clear mind to next year's INSURGENT (2015) and MAZE RUNNER: SCORCH TRIALS (2015). One thing I do appreciate from this film is its subtle inclination to obscure the absolute dichotomy between the capital and the rebel and puts Katiness (Lawrence) into a moral dilemma, her unassuming personality and indomitable bravery enables the heroism which can motivate the suppressed hoi polloi, but here she is so easily being demoted as a propaganda weapon to wage a war against the capital, which for herself, she is not quite sure too. What's the difference will be if the rebel finally wins? The sacrifice will be grave, and no one can assure the new government will not follow the same old road to ruin. The story actually has a clearer mind towards the political game, but eventually the author and the filmmakers would all pander to what readers or audience want to read or watch: the final combat with barrages of visual spectacles and the corny love stories in the battlefield, so much for YA demography. Due to the fact that Part 1 only covers the preliminary measurement of the endgame and lacks of substantially tantalizing action pieces, apart from using her arrow shot down two bombers, Katiness is barely in the move, instead, she broaches a more dramatic mental reconstruction in the movie, Jennifer Lawrence noticeably has more close-ups on her rational struggle and personal revelation, she needs to fight her own conscience to be the war instigator, even it is under the name of righteousness, and finds her own place of being ""the one"" instead of a replaceable pawn in the plot. It is her powerful acting (plus a mediocre singing) makes up for the discouraging inertness, still, it is not enough, especially for such a heavily budgeted tent-pole, the film never shows where do they use the massive money? Peeta (Hutcherson), although retreats to a talking head most of the time, Hutcherson in fact eventuates in a more admirable performance than rest of the group, especially he is the key variable in the final stage. Moore, with a fruitful awards season beckons, in here, what she pulls off is President Coin's affable persona, her air as a true altruistic leader, her gentle but affirmative deliverance is formulaic yet, under such circumstances, is affecting. As a Moore devotee who have never read Collins' novel, my wishful thinking is that there is a dramatic twist here to explode in the culmination concerning Coin's patina of inscrutability and caginess. Since Katiness is the sole center of the narrative, the bulky supporting crew is relegated to bells and whistles, it will be a shameful waste for Dormer's killing coiffure if her Cressida remains so characterless in the Part 2. Finally, it will be remiss not to mention the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, although it is really a nuisance to end his luminous career with such effortless offerings, he will be warmly remembered.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Well, I guess the actual Hunger Games is missing. I feel the same way but drama overrides action here. Substance weighs heavier than style in this third entry in the series.Katniss arrives in the catacombs of District 13, which people believe is destroyed by the Capitol. The rebellion is rising, and it asks for her volunteerism. Meanwhile, her loved ones are captured by President Snow.I love how the actors are great. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson really shine in this movie. There are less action scenes, but there's more setting buildup, especially for District 13, a new location. I love how Lawrence tries her best to sing ""The Hanging Tree"", the rebellion song from the book. It's nice she did herself instead of passing it to other professional singers. I applaud her dedication. Give her a Grammy! Haha! Splitting the book into two movies has allowed more room for the story. If you read the book, you'll appreciate it a lot.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

When the third book was released some loved it, and others loved to hate it. Events and ideas were mentioned in the first half of the book yet not told in great detail therefore confusing the readers. The book only began to pick up it's pace half-way through. This is why I was initially worried about the third book in this popular trilogy being made into a Part 1 and 2. Yet this film pulled all the best ideas and events out of Mockingjay into a film that had a heart. A heart that leads towards the climax of this franchise without the film dragging in pace. From the music to the acting this film had it all! I loved that this film wasn't afraid to bring forth strong themes that are often hard to swallow for the Young Adult demographic. This is now my second favourite film of this franchise (1.Catching Fire, 3.The Hunger Games) as it portrays themes similar to those in our own society. This film isn't all doom and gloom as some instances of comic relief are used perfectly. I think this film should appeal to teens and adults alike, both books readers or only movie goers.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It followed the book more closely than the first two parts, but this is also the problem. It makes the movie too slow, too boring. There are no exciting parts in this movie whatsoever. Where Mockingjoy part 1 ends, the book starts to become more exciting and beautiful, so I expect Mockingjoy part 2 to be better. The acting is great and the movie is visually beautiful, but as a fan I have to admit that this movie disappointed me.

Still, reading through such reviews you see that most complaints are about ""lack of action"" and ""nothing happening"" in this third Hunger Games installment. This is definitely correct - the movie contains much less of ""slash and smash"" and suspense type of moments than the previous two titles. However, this is also exactly what blows your mind if you don't start watching it set on a suspense filled clash in life-or-death setting. What does blow you away is the development in the movie of the pain and hopelessness of the people of the Districts pitted against ruthless and inhumane actions of the Capital and president Snow. The movie develops in quite an orthogonal direction from the previous two titles, and this indeed rubbed a lot of HG1-2 fans the wrong way. In short, the movie does not contain excessive amount of action or breath-taking developments, but connects on a deeper and emotional level to show the things about Panem that did need to be shown. Don't come set for a suspense/action flick, and you will be rewarded with a deep and rich experience.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Creating two films out of one book which I might add I have not read, also created a plodding by the numbers predictable film, which leaves you empty and a bit cheated at the end. Also I cared less about the characters and I am not sure I will bother watching part 2.

The film fails to deliver action though and is kinda slow, but the script keeps it intriguing and you can never doubt The Hunger Games to succeed even when it has flaws. The world of this war torn country gets more unique and beautiful with every new entry in this film series. Liam Hemsworth actually steps up to the table and delivers some intense, moving and emotional lines and delivers the Gale I remember from the books. Julianne Moore as Alma Coin I thought was pretty cool and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is so good and I like what the direction their going with his character. Hoffman will get some intense emotional scenes to remember in Part II which will be a great way to respect him.

But escaping is just the start, as Katniss finds herself having to embrace the symbol she has become to the people of Panem - a symbol of rebellion against President Snow and the autocratic Capitol. I was really looking forward to Mockingjay, because I thought the squeal (Catching Fire) was a big improvement and just overall a better movie then the first one. The trailer to Mockingjay won me over by it's excellent tone and it's brilliant shots, and I was actually counting down the days for the movie release, but now after seeing the film I got to say.... I'm a bit disappointing. Now let me get something out there, I don't hate this movie, I just think it's really disappointing for and please don't hate me for this.Let's start off with the good things in this movie: Jennifer Lawrence was just flawless in this movie and now every time I see her in interviews or new movies I straight away like her as a person and as a actress. Rest of the cast did good as well. The movie had that Apocalypse settings to it and it suited the tone of the film and I'm just happy they got that right.Now for the things that did not work at all and came off messy: The fact that this is a two parter really spoils the film for me, because without giving away anything, but basically this movie is just a set up for the next film and sometimes movies can pull that off, but when the the second part comes out not a lot really of people won't be talking about part 1 anymore, just like Harry Potter and I know I keep bring up Potter a lot but it's really hard not to.The movies pasting is like watching a snail starting walking to point A to point B, that's the movies paste right there. The movie really wants me to care about the character's and the character's may not be boring, but there not really that interesting to me. Overall Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 feels less then a stand alone film, but more of a cash grab and I hate saying that because I really wanted to like this and I trying my damn best, but I'm sorry for letting you all down but this movie was a disappointing to me and saying that sucks.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

If ""Catching Fire"" was expansive in nature, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is a full fledged disengagement from the theme of the original film. There is no new ""Hunger Games"" event, with the story instead focusing purely on developments that happen for Katniss, Peeta, and the variety of supporting characters that are now engaging in a rebellion against the Capitol City.The good news is that while ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is very different in theme from its two predecessors, the movie never the less works in a way that is engaging and enjoyable, all while advancing the plot of the franchise well beyond what a more repetitive sequel would have done.One thing that occurred to me while viewing this film (along with having watched ""Catching Fire"" again just before seeing it in the theater) is that the franchise itself can be interpreted as a robust criticism of fascism. The Capitol City is essentially a caricature of fascist ideology, and the rebellion against the Capitol can be read as a liberal (in the classic sense of the word) revolt against authoritarian ideology.At any rate, regardless of what one makes of the political philosophy that undergirds ""The Hunger Games"" movies, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is a great sequel in an expansive, visionary film franchise.One word of caution, though: It was surprising and shocking to see Phillip Seymour- Hoffman on screen for the duration of the film, with his having died in early February of 2014. After reading up on this, it seems that Seymour-Hoffman must have filmed for ""Mockingjay Part 2"" before his death as well, and that film (which won't be released until November 2015) will be his last credited film. His performance was fine, but there was just something unnerving about seeing a dead man on screen for so long, particularly given the fact that the film came out nine months after his death.Still, the movie was great--in my opinion, it was a step up from ""Catching Fire"", even if the original ""Hunger Games"" still stands out as the best film in the series. Thus my 8/10 stars.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie moves at a snails pace (which would have been okay if it had strong writing to back it up), but nothing original seems to surface. The movie focuses on turning Katniss into the face of the revolution, but what was she before this then? Did we really need a whole movie showing us what we already knew was going to happen, whether or not she was going to accept such a role? The movie moved away from originality, which is what made The Hunger Games so fascinating and into a territory we have seen done before.Mockingjay Part 1 adds nothing to the story which we didn't already know, we knew Katniss would be the symbol of the people (wasn't she already?), we know President Snow is a ruthless dictator, and we know revolution is happening, everything that happens in the movie we already know. I guess the one thing we didn't fully know was the fate of those left behind, but that surely does not justify this two hour movie. On the other hand, the movie does pack a solid amount of emotion into the two hours, we saw the extent of the evil the capital is willing to take just to stay in power.But besides that, the story is not nearly strong enough to justify splitting the final book into two separate movies. Mockingjay Part 1 is all about propaganda, but that is exactly what the movie itself is, propaganda, trying to persuade us to see Part 2.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That was a decsion made in Hollywood by a studio looking to double and milk every last dime out of its blockbuster franchise. The suits probably thought ""Hey it worked out well for Twilight and Harry Potter, so why not us?"" You can't blame them for wanting to keep the good times rolling. But it's a pretty cynical business plan, and it's led to a film that feels needlessly padded. Mockingjay Part 1 is like someone in my school doing a paper and there is a limit you need to get too and they just want too jack it up. This is very disappointing because the previous chapter Catching fire, I thought exceeded the first film and helped the franchise, cause I did not like the first film it's a battle royal rip off. Catching Fire though gave the main character Katniss played excellently by Jennifer Lawerence into a brainy badass. Now she is become passive. The film picks up after the incendiary conclusion of catching Fire's Quarter Quell, when Katniss was rescued and brought to the rebels, underground fortress in District 13. Here, the anti-capital leaders plot their next strike against president Snow(Donald Sutherland), hatching a plan to turn Katniss into fiery symbol of the resistance in a propaganda war as their secret weapon known as the mockingjay. The film is interesting, the suffering this film has is that to me I felt bored while watching this latest entire in the hunger games series. The performances are ultimately what kept me me invested and interested in what was going on, but the script feels like such a jumbled mess that I didn't care what was going on. I suppose director Francis Lawerence and writers Peter Craig and Danny Strong deserve some credit for daring to sneak any political cheekiness into a movie that's as big and corporate as this. But overall their hands are tied too tightly. While the series' second film had better character development, Mockingjay is mostly bound to the bleak and claustrophobic bowels of a bunker. It suffocates the film. And when the story does get interesting and you know something important is about to happen the movie ends. That's not a cliff-hanger that's a tease. I give The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 a two and a half out of five.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was bad. Look, the concept of a being movie cut into two parts just does not work. The whole thing felt like a two-hour exposition. The first 30 minutes were so damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and move uncomfortably in my seat. There really wasn't anything special going on as it progresses, too. There was a war going on, but they did not really show it and it didn't suck you in. It was very slow paced with lots of teenage drama and not a lot of ""games"" or ""hunger"" as in the previous films (which I liked, by the way). And now there was Jennifer Lawrence's acting, which was trying too hard (while making lots of weird facial expressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments). Overall, I think the idea of splitting a movie into two parts; this made the first half boring, wasn't a very good one.

I do not read the book, but i love the Hunger Games and THG: Catching Fire a lot.Jennifer Lawrence shows something difficult to act as Katniss here.Josh Hutcherson is too looks unsure to be Katniss' lover.I want to watch the Part II, so please..

It was a solid performance by all concerned, and in fact, I consider it Jennifer Lawrence's most mature. Her acting was real, except in a few places where they obviously inflated her reactions to engender more emotional impact, an unfortunate downside to Hollywood - but otherwise, this show wasn't about the special effects nor even the action, rather, it focused more on the humanity and her vulnerability. It sets the stage for a good sequel, and for sure, by this point, as much I like Donald Sutherland, I hope to see him and his capital city leveled to the ground.

Not every scene has to be dramatic or action packed to convey meaning.Jennifer Lawrence was once again awesome as Katniss. However, for me there were two big surprises. First, I am no Woody Harrelson fan, but he is great as Haymitch and may be my favorite character after Katniss and Peeta.Second, after reading the novels, I wasn't sure who I would have picked as President Snow. However, Donald Sutherland is perfect and he could not have been better cast. Lastly, if anything about this movie is boring, its Liam Hemsworth's Gale. I like Liam, but his portrayal of Gale lacks any emotion or action for me.I think this movie is well worth seeing and I can't wait for Part 2.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Propoganda and war feel we get when watching the film is perfectly done, intense and hard to watch, but at the same time great. and the uprising of the Districts. 10/10it's direction great! Francis Lawrence is an amazing director and always will be, it's gritty tone really sits with you throughout the entire movie.the acting in the film is also really strong just like catching fire and hunger games I really mean it, it is some of the best acting I've seen and the films have some of the best actors I've also seen in other films!Overall, I love the film because it tells a very realistic story with great visuals, great acting, great cinematography, superb music and fantastic directing i give this film a 10/10 its very realistic and gritty and violent.Just as a warning I felt physically sick during the film, mainly because of how harrowing it was.Now taking all things into consideration, I suggest that you should watch this film, simply because of how great it is. It's my favourite of THE HUNGER GAMES films, and I will definitely be watching them again! :D","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And when the movie was over, I was just like ""that was it? really?"" these will be your only opinions when the end credits roll. I think splitting books in parts only worked for 'Deathly Hallows' because both of them could stand as single movies , I mean there is more story than setting up the final battle in 'Deathly Hallows Part 1'.

Other times however, another reaction to a film could be one of disappointment. Whether it be the film not living up to its hype and potential or seeming like a film that was too big to fail, there are many films that while not overall bad, are considered major disappointments. Many would tell you that this film would be a continuation of this trend, due to being overlong, slow and not much payoff, as well as being a supposed weak follow-up to the previous films (which admittedly aren't great films to begin with). The film is a lot better than many give it credit for however, and is definitely the best of the series so far.The story is that after the events of the previous film, Katniss has gone into hiding along with her family and the rest of the rebels who are planning to overthrow the capital. One way they'll try to do this is through propaganda videos, using Katniss' image as the Mockingjay in order to inspire rebellion in the other districts. However, with her allies at risk and the closing in on the rebels, will she give in?The plot development is the best of the series yet, as despite not moving at the same quick pace as the previous films (mainly due to how the film is mostly set inside a bunker), in place of it, there is a lot more attention paid on character, story and themes that the other films lacked.Firstly, all of the characters are well developed. Katniss finally forms into a three dimensional character at this point, and is a lot more interesting this time round. We see her interact with her family, her close friends and the rebels, and because of the amount of time spent on her, we become more sympathetic towards her cause, as she is no longer the whiny and annoying character as seen before, but as a caring, bold and rebellious young woman with a lot of internal conflict to deal with, due to her struggles with her image as the Mockingjay and how it affects everyone around her. Her character is much more rounded this time round, and Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all, clearly showing that after her previous below par performances in the other films, she is fully comfortable in her role. The supporting cast are all around great as well.Another thing that is really well done is the themes, as they are delivered in a more subtle way this time round, in particular, the idea of the rebels being as bad as the Capitol, considering how they use propaganda and terrorist attacks to inspire rebellion, but arguably are no better than the Capitol, who use similar tactics against the rebels, and in the process, both sides take major losses. It's a very clever idea that's well handled that gives the series more depth than it did previously. The action in the film is also well done, as there is none of the shaky cam nonsense of the previous films, but now scenes which are well shot and paced and have a strong sense of tension throughout. This is helped by the fact that the villains this time around feel a lot more threatening, with many scenes showing how ruthless they can be, with the highlight of these scenes being Katniss returning to District 12 and finding the place to be completely in ruins, eventually stumbling across skulls and other body parts in the rubble. It is due to this that the villains feel much more intimidating this time round, which makes you even more invested and caring towards the main characters. However, despite many positive attributes, there are still some problems. Despite the increased threat that the villains have, Donald Sutherland still feels widely miscast as President Snow, delivers a goofy performance that would be more appropriate of the Adam West Batman show of the 60's, rather than a dark and gritty film like this. Luckily, he doesn't have much screen time, but kills the mood when on screen. There is also some really unfunny comic relief as well, particularly in the case of Katniss' cat and while humour is needed to calm the audience after so much action and dark moments, the comic relief sometimes goes too silly for its own good, and once again ruins the tone. But outside of that, this film was fantastic. After the below par efforts previously, this sequel finally gives the series the jab in the arm it needed in order to truly take off, with a great story, strong characters that you care about, subtle themes and humour and a lot of exciting action with a lot of tension throughout. While not succeeding in every area, this film is something everyone should see as it is truly great cinema. Ignore the naysayers and check this movie out.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie has a few scenes of action here and there, but the main focal point of the film is Katniss struggling with Peeta being captured and becoming the Mockingjay. The director did an amazing job at exposing more of the country of Panem, and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is one of her best performances yet! In the novel, it is only through Katniss's view, so we only see and hear what she encounters, but in this film we see tons more and really feel the impact that she has on all the districts.

This particular movie, in The Hunger Games series, has received criticism for being kind of a drag and not a lot of action shows in the movie.

It's true that there isn't a lot of action, but who needs action, when a movie is blessed with such wonderful actors as Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and many other talented actors and actresses.

I thought that the books were engaging and, at times, dramatic and felt that the first book was not adapted well to the screen. There was no real tension between Peeta and Katniss and some of the finest moments of the book were butchered in the film.Interestingly enough, Mockingjay, I felt, was the worst book of the series; but as far as I am concerned it might be the best film so far. The first film, in my opinion, was a train wreck; the second film was a brilliant recovery; and this third film is far above my expectations.Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress, but this is not her best acting. I feel that the script is so poorly written that she is forced to do unthinkable things on screen - yet she manages to pull them off. For instance, how many times can an actor be expected to cry, gasp, or yell in a single film? Jennifer Lawrence does very well under the circumstances. I think that the surprise performance, however, was from Elizabeth Banks as Effie. I have never truly enjoyed her character until this film, and in this film she nearly steals every scene she's in.I was not convinced that this story was worth filming until I saw this film, which is far better than it should have been. See it. It is dramatic and even touching - and very timely. You won't likely be disappointed.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The story explores the themes of propaganda, manipulation, and the consequences of war. The story is engaging and thought-provoking, as it dives deeper into the political and social issues present in the previous films. It is a story of struggle and sacrifice, highlighting the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The production of the film is extremely high standard, with excellent cinematography and visual effects that create a vivid world. The script is well-written, capturing the complexity of the characters and their motivations. The lighting and colors are also noteworthy, creating a somber and atmospheric tone that reflects the bleakness of the story. The editing is well done, allowing the story to flow naturally. The sound and music are also exceptional, with a haunting and atmospheric sounds that adds to the tension and drama of the film. The acting is excellent, with Jennifer Lawrence delivering a powerful and emotional performance as Katniss. The costumes, makeup, and styling are also impressive, contributing to the immersive world of the film. The costumes effectively convey the utilitarian and militaristic nature of the rebellion and the makeup and styling add to the realism of the characters. Overall, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is a well-produced and well-executed film that delivers a compelling story with excellent technical aspects and superb performances from the cast. It is a thought-provoking film that explores important themes and raises important questions about the nature of power, propaganda, and the human spirit in the face of adversity.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the interim period, she rallies round the various districts to let them know that she is back and also to drum up as much support as possible in order to take on The Capitol.If I'm totally honest I'm not a massive fan of The Hunger Games - I thought that the first film was OK and thought that the second film was a slight improvement over the first film. I went in with positive expectations hoping that this film would be a slight notch up on the second film (or equally as good at worst), but unfortunately it isn't and it's definitely the weakest offering so far.There is a REALLY long and slow build up where we essentially see Katniss visiting the various districts making several propaganda type videos in order to try to unite the districts and get her help to take on The Capitol. It's an interesting change of direction from the first 2 films, but the problem is the propaganda aspect is all that there really is to the film. Considering Katniss & the districts are meant to be at war with The Capitol it might have been nice to have a bit more action, a few fights, more confrontation etc. It really did just feel like 2 hours of talking and not much else.I was also a little disappointed with some of the characters in the third film; Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson were real standouts in the previous films whereas in this film there were merely shadows of themselves. Harrelson was an alcoholic in the previous films and his character being sober in this film made his character a lot less fun. I'm not criticising Banks & Harrelson's acting, but merely felt that their characters were a little more flat in this film.The star of the show here is Lawrence and the more films that I see her in the more I like her as an actress. As this franchise has progressed, I think that her performance has got better with every passing film (she's been excellent elsewhere too). The likes of Snow and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman offer good support, but aren't really given much to do. This is Lawrence's show and she shined brightly amidst all the tedium.Aside from the strong performances by the cast there's little else to recommend here. It was basically a long, repetitive and boring film with very little action, tension, conflict or excitement.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it. I have never been more angry with a movie. Imagine Titanic being remade, but the ship doesn't sink and everyone lives happily ever after. That is what they did to this movie. I was blown away by how literally EVERY scene and plot point this movie is known for was neutered entirely. I know remakes tend to change some details for the audience of that country etc, but they basically wrote a whole new Twilight subplot 30 minutes in. This would have been far better off if they took their plot of 'BFF's live happily ever after' and just made an original movie.

In it, our beloved Katniss Everdeen is put in a situation where she becomes a symbol of a revolution. With an entire District looking up to her, she has to lead them to rebel against the Capital. The film is rated PG-13.Again, I reiterate: the movie was a bit disappointing, for me at least. The performance of Jennifer Lawrence as the heroine was still above fantastic. The visuals got an upgrade, having the best CGI of the series. The action scenes were intense and exciting, which has become a staple for the series. It IS called ""The Hunger Games"".Unfortunately, the compliments stop there. As much as I tried to take away the fact that it is only the first part, there were some aspects that just felt off. First, the rest of the characters. With Katniss, Plutarch and Coin being great in the film, everyone else felt expendable. Characters like Natalie Dormer's Cressida and even Finnick and Gale weren't relevant enough in the film to care about them. Also, there were a lot of slow moments in the film, especially near the beginning. You'll be on the edge of your seat...waiting for the movie to get rolling. Even when it does get going, it's rather unfulfilling. It is a big propaganda piece that I think that feminists might really enjoy, as it deals with Katniss fighting the government. That's not a bad thing, but it is something to note. The thing that really brings it down is the fact that it is split into to two parts. With the book being a little longer that ""Catching Fire"", it doesn't seem right to split it apart other than for the almighty dollar. It's just a cash grab, but a successful cash grab, with the movie grossing $245 million. ""Mockingjay"" isn't the best ""Hunger Games"" movie ever. It's not the best movie of the year (""Guardians"" holds that title). But it's not horrible. It has good things, but is completely overshadowed by it's flaws. I still recommend at least one watch, but just one. If you like it, then fine. I wasn't a fan of the first part.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The date went well, but that is not what I am here to brag (er, talk) about.* THE HUNGER GAMES weren't on my to-do list, I consider lots of movies featuring pretty actresses, but the premise didn't exactly appeal. Of course, the opportunity to win it for free for very little effort I took on ""like that"" and to cut a long story short, I have been watching, first the kick-off, then the sequel, and now, here is the... tired re- hashing?People, you have to get off this big franchise thing. It's that old ROCKY X joke, the fans would go watch Rocky until he's in a wheelchair, with dentures and failing eyesight. Go on to something new!This was basically my line of thought as I was watching the first half. This Joan of Arc kinda story-line. Then came that air raid on the hospital, and suddenly, I am with the die-hard fans of the series. That sequence I rate full marks. Doesn't change the fact that the movie plods on through about 45% of its running time as one big yawn, not so much for nothing much happening, but for me NOT CARING... And this movie played to eager fans... swarms of them... there must have been disappointment caused by the slow progress. You lose fans that way. They walk out of theaters disillusioned, and spread the word of their disappointment, or switch off television sets. Get the picture? Like I said, it does get better. But first impressions count, and the movie starts off dismal and continues that way for far too long. Of course the fans expected outdoor competition, and got claustrophobic bunkers.Willow Shields, the young actress playing Prim, seemed to hold so much promise in the original. But, no, big letdown performance from her. It's like that stuck-with-the-cast curse of TV, the first time round they might fit in perfectly, next season they're just blah!Treading on many toes now, but Philip Seymour Hoffman, I fail to see anything standout in his final role. Including CATCHING FIRE.Liam Hemsworth has considerable leading man charm, that other guy, Josh whatever, can go home! The Mockingjay logo is the real star of the entire movie, especially after sitting through ten minutes (or more?) of end credits.The uglification of the characters (and their hick names, yee-ikes, the ugliest names, Haymitch Abernathy sounds like a hillbilly goat farmer and Plutarch Heavensbee... oh good grief...) Okay, what I was going to say, on the DVD, the cast appears, and everybody looks a hundred times better than they do in the movie. Basically, this is a movie with loads of unattractive, weird and dorky characters. Except J-Law and Liam, of course.All in all, there's another reviewer here who's tag-line reads ""two hour movie could have been edited into 20 minutes"" or something like that. I agree. There is a pervasive tedious feeling to this movie.Must have cost the franchise a lot of fans. Burst bubbles...*something in this review is just a lie, but I'm keeping my trap shut.

Similar to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1, there is a lot of depth to this film but at times it feels like nothing is happening. On the surface, when I think about the 7th Harry Potter film, all that I remember is the trio wandering the wilderness in a tent. Similarly, when I reflect on this film, all that comes to mind is Katniss in a bland jumpsuit hiding in the vents of District 13. While there is much more that happens in this film (and HP7), they pale in comparison to what came before and what comes after.The characters are great, the acting is superb, and the action sequences are well-choreographed. While this helps Mockingjay Pt. 1 stand above the competition, it has become an expectation for the Hunger Games franchise rather than a surprise. I wanted higher stakes. I needed more Finnick. I craved something to happen that wasn't bland and gray. In the first two films everything led up to the cannon going off at the start of the games.

"8","/10","If you were bored by this movie, you didn't get it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3151845/?ref_=tt_urv","ellapauly99","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53220552/?ref_=tt_urv","30 December 2014","I completely disagree with what other users said: ""set up"", ""boring"", ""melodrama"", all are valid opinions but I think these perspectives are missing something.Most blockbuster films maintain a sense of detachment between the story and the audience. You walk into the theater, things explode, people hook up, and then you walk out, having gained two pounds in popcorn but gaining nothing emotionally. Maybe that's just what audiences want for entertainment, but I for one want to be impacted by a film somehow, or it's $15 wasted. To be bored by such a powerful and realistic depiction of a dystopia, you'd have to be totally missing the point. What happens in Mockingjay is happening in the world, and I don't see how you couldn't find that jarring and intense. The action that everyone says is missing is there, it's just more complex than your typical one- liner + apocalypse combo. The action is under the surface, in the complicated themes and ideas that the writers are conveying to you, in the internal and external conflicts between characters, in the emotions that are at once dramatic and hauntingly real. You don't get that every day anymore. If you wanted things blowing up and obvious plots that you don't have to invest yourself in, there's probably another Transformers movie you can go see instead. Indeed, I think what people are calling a ""set up"" movie presents a far more important story than what it's setting up for - the explosive conclusion is not what matters. Sorry, Suzanne Collins, but we all knew how Mockingjay would end. Why is that part so important to viewers? The interesting parts of the Hunger Games novels have never been in the love triangle plot devices or 'shocking' deaths. We see that all the time. No, what differentiates the Hunger Games from other series of its kind is the extra level of depth in its themes and morals. The characters are well-written, and the actors portray them well; the plots are simple, yes, but the emotions that drive them are not, and the movie doesn't over-simplify. IThis was the best Hunger Games movie by far. Emotional, intelligent, true to the story, and well-made. Jennifer Lawrence is incredible (though that goes without saying). A perfect balance is held between the witty romanticism of a YA lit adaptation and the somber, harrowing tone of a true dystopia. We throw the word dystopia around all the time, but what makes a good story of that genre is that it has both a sharp systemic criticism and a deep human aspect. This does that - you see Katniss as a symbol and also as a person, which is important. They talk big ideas about government, but they use that to say something about human nature, too.(Also, if you say you didn't get chills in the Hanging Tree scene, you're lying.)","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

While the Potter franchise successfully transitioned from it's 12- year old demographic, The Hunger Games, did not quite manage so well.Not all is bad. There is some interesting criticism here of media and propaganda, but those are all smack -in-the-face type of observations. The film makes no secret of it. The darkness comes from the topic itself: the film is set in the aftermath of a violent crackdown by the Capitol onto the rebelling districts. It is dystopic, but what is missing is the emotion behind it. Jennifer Lawrence is more Jennifer Lawrence than Katniss, and when she is Katniss...well, Katniss is annoying. The consistent need to push her into doing what she has to do is quite frustrating. Mind you, it is (probably?) a limitation imposed in the Hunger Games books, but that still does not make her any less annoying and infuriating when she'd rather choose Peeta over the future of the whole world.Technically, the Hunger Games have polished up quite nicely. The CGI does not look as dated as it did in the first film, which is good. This film is very grim and dark - the colourful costumes of the Capitol have been replaced by the darkness of the underground shelter and the military uniform. Overall, though, the film sustains the continuation of a mediocre, yet entertaining, franchise. That being said, this one is the least entertaining film so far. The whole ""Part 1"" charade is a charade at its best. Not much really happens here, beyond some character ""development"" for Katniss (also known as everyone pushing her to get her act together).The first film is still the most engaging and entertaining one - let us hope they will end the series on a better note than Mockingjay Part 1, because otherwise, it will be a snooze.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While it would be cruel to state that the result is half a complete movie, Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel finished because, well, it isn't. So we get a build-up without a satisfying climax, while the action remains suitably thrilling and Jennifer Lawrence again demonstrates why she is the most powerful actress in the world right now.The Hunger Games - which pitted a member of each of the lower-class districts against each other in a fight to the death - are now over, and full-scale rebellion is under way. Katniss Evergreen (Lawrence) has been whisked off to District 13, where freedom fighters are holed up as they plan to finally overthrow wealthy dictator President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Under the leadership of rebel leader President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), Katniss is groomed by former Hunger Games Gamekeeper Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to be the face of the rebellion and places her in propaganda videos, only Katniss can't act for s**t. In the hope of drumming up support, Katniss is sent out into the field with a group of film-makers to witness the destruction inflicted on her people in her absence.My main gripe with the Hunger Games movies (I haven't read the books) are that the 'good guys' we are meant to root for are little more than a collection of one-dimensional generic heartthrobs. Noticeably lacking charisma are Katniss's two love interests, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), now a soldier in the rebellion, and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), survivor of two rounds of the games and now a prisoner of Snow. Out of the young actors on show, it's only Lawrence who manages to sell her character, evoking sympathy as she is forced in front of the camera as a tool of war to spout ridiculous speeches that she struggles to deliver with any earnestness. On the other side, Snow is placing Peeta in front of the camera as he interviewed by TV host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) pleading with the rebels to put down their weapons and end the fighting.The focus on the artistry of propaganda from both sides is one of the most intriguing aspects of the film. Like the themes of class divide and capitalism from the first movie, the way the adult themes are weaved into an action movie made mainly for young adults works well, helping to give the story a gravitas rarely seen in blockbusters franchises. Sadly, scene-stealers Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks are given very little to do as the story struggles to fit them in, but the introduction of Moore as the straight- talking Coin adds class and Sutherland positively purrs his way through his role as the big bad, a character deserving of more development and screen-time. The film is dedicated to Philip Seymour Hoffman, who tragically died during filming, and it's humbling to see the great actor deliver a masterclass when the role doesn't even call for it. As half of a finished movie, Mockingjay Part 1 is as entertaining as it is frustratingly unsatisfying.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

One thing I can say about this film is that not only is the action thrilling, but the acting is superb and scarily believable. Although Josh Hutcherson did not have the most screen time in this one, his acting is astounding. Without spoiling anything, his last 2 scenes will leave you scarred in the best way possible and his scenes before that will have you tearing up. Also, Liam Hemsworth stepped up his game from the last 2 films. Previously, Hemsworth played the lovesick boy-next-door who was also surprisingly hot. In this film he pulls through as a warrior and shows a step up in his emotional depth as Gale. However, I still believe that the true gem of this franchise is Josh Hutcherson. Although all eyes are constantly on the stunning, Oscar-winning JLaw, Hutcherson never fails to absolutely kill his performance and touch the audience. The show- stealing performers like Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson as the drunk...yet understanding Haymitch Abernathy, and Elizabeth Banks as the charismatic Effie Trinket that compliment Lawrence's performance and help to make the Hunger Games the international phenomenon it is.The film's directing, writing, special effects, and (much to my surprise) score were very well done. The combination of those four aspects made for an excellent movie experience. There were moments during this film in which I was completely engulfed in what was happening. And to me, that is a true film success.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Sadly it is completely different from the excellent Hunger Games...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8792247/?ref_=tt_urv","Erik_Surewaard","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135771508/?ref_=tt_urv","11 January 2023","The first two movies of ""The Hunger Games"" were so impressive that I both awarded them an IMDb score of 8 stars. I was able to relate those two movies with a society like ancient Rome - having in its center ""The Collosseum"" - which controls its population by not only entertaining the masses, but more so by means of fear. A fear for ending up themselves in the arena, having to fight for their own life. Apart from ancient Rome, I also see in it references to our nowadays society: this where the rich entertain themselves with over-the-top content whereby the poor - with their daily struggle for survival - are ignored.Before watching ""The Mockingjay"", I hoped to be surprised again by not only the great acting of the actress playing the role of ""Katniss"", but also of how we get to see her character develop in an each time more sophisticated personality.So it may be seen as an understatement that I was looking forward to watching ""The Mockingjay"".But I am sorry to say that it was all a big disappointment. Completely gone is the format that made the first two ""Hunger Games"" so interesting. Instead of watching 'Rome and its Collosseum', we are now shown the totally different 'Rome at war'! So before you watch this movie, it is only fair that you know that the genre is changed to the dystopian type.Apart from the totally unexpected genre-change, I was also let down by the very weak storyline. With this big a budget and such an experienced cast, it should at least be possible to make a movie that distinguishes itself from the generic dystopian movie. But nothing is further from the truth. I was especially let down by how the writers changed the characters of both ""Katniss"" and ""Peeta"", the other contestant of ""Zone 12"". A change of character that was not only unrealistic but actually so pronounced that you could hardly recognize the original characters. From two strong and secure persons at the end of the second ""Hunger Games"", we are all of a sudden faced with unsecure and weak characters in ""The Mockingjay"".Watching ""The Mockingjay"" was actually so unappealing, that I couldn't continue watching when I was just 20 minutes into ""Part 2"" of ""The Mockingjay"". It was just that bad in my opinion.This also raises the question why it was decided to make ""The Mockingjay"" a two-part movie?! It is so rare that I can only think of the two Matrix movies as another case: i.e. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"", two movies which were both released in 2003 with just a few months apart. My guess is that the producers of ""The Mockingjay"" decided to do so purely from the standpoint of maximizing financial gains.Looking at the total duration of the two parts - which is well over 4 hours - it is my opinion that the storyline had better been shortened to 2.5 hours. The current ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"" have so much unappealing content that it should be possible to reduce it to that length. Instead of giving up 20 minutes into ""Part 2"", a reduced version of 2.5 hours would at least made me completely watch it.Summarizing, I rate ""Part 1"" of ""The Mockingjay"" with 4.9/10, resulting in an IMDb score of a 'meager' 5 stars. Considering the budget and cast, the producers should be ashamed of their product.Since I was not able to get any further than 20 minutes in ""Part 2"" of ""The Mockingjay"", I decided to give it only an IMDb rating of 3 stars. Those 3 stars are thereby supported by the visuals, like e.g. Scenery, costumes and CGI. Unfortunately that is the only thing that I can say something positive about for ""Part 2"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Our protagonist shows a sense of maturity and responsibility towards society, emerging as a necessary symbol of hope. Politics and action take central focus, with brushes of science fiction.Acting and costuming again shine as highlights, helping to unwrap a story including personal drama. A few questionable actions come to mind, as well as gaps that likely formed in translating book to a movie. For example, I found Katniss to be a bit unnecessarily or unreasonably chilly towards Gale.

The first hunger games I could look past a lot of the issues like weird dialogue and bad acting and inconsistency. The second movie took me by surprise how good it was, and going into this I tried to think of it as a political war drama but... my lord. This movie is just bland. They gloss over so many things in this film. Like the camera placement being all over the place. Also, you know-how in the last film Katniss was all about defying the Capitol and saying what she means? Yeah in this film she starts out by refusing to be the one thing to take down the Capitol, all because they like... didn't save Peeta?This film also has so many unnecessary scenes. The two main ones being the hunting scene and the stairwell cat scene. They serve little to no purpose and don't invoke any real emotions at all. The action scenes at the end are done pretty well and it's very tense then but that pales in comparison to anything in the last 2 movies. Not to mention it's like watching paint dry for 45 minutes and then going on a roller coaster for 15. Not really worth it.I feel like the main appeal of the Hunger Games is two things. The actual games and lots of bloody combat, and Katniss as a character. Katniss doesn't do any growing in this movie and the little action there is doesn't feel like it was earned from the previous 45 minutes of the movie. Finally, my main problem with this movie is I feel like it wasn't needed. While the second movie is long I feel like it could have been worked into the second movie.Honestly, if you're doing a hunger games rewatch like I am skip this one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The last chapter to the popular Hunger Games movie series that broke literary sales records, made Jennifer Lawrence's career and influenced young girls everywhere to take up archery is finally coming to a close... well sort of. This is only part 1 of the final chapter. In it's infinite wisdom, Lionsgate films has decided to take the Harry Potter route in finishing off the Hunger Games series. What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said about the second to last Harry Potter movie? Some may call this film a necessary bridge to the final chapter of the series, others may call it a gradual build to something far grander in scale than what we've seen before in other Hunger Games films. Some may say that but the fact of the matter is, this movie is just plain old fashioned filler. Trust me, I've read the books and the only thing you're seeing in this film is pure filler. I don't think I'm giving anything away by telling you that The third book of the Hunger Games saga depicts the events of a massive war between the capital and the other districts but it's not ALL just a battle, there are quite a few pieces of plot that need to occur leading up to the epic spectacle of war, things that the makers of the Hunger Games film series would rather just get out of the way than have them share the spotlight with what is sure to be the special effects event of fall 2015.I could go on and tell you about everything else in the film as far as the cast and the story and the special effects but honestly, nothing has changed since the last film. Everyone does a good job and the film ends up where it needs to be but the overarching feeling behind it all is that it all of it adds up to being just a bunch of Hollywood BS stretching out projects for no reason. There's no real reason for this movie to exist, everything that happens here could have been explained in the first 20-30 minutes for the most part, Lionsgate just decided that they wanted to line their coffers with a little more coin before this franchise ends. Eh, who can blame them. Money is money after all. Unfortunately it doesn't add up to a very entertaining ride for everyone else in the theater.All in all, if you're a fan of The Hunger Games films, you're seeing this for only one reason, to get to part 4 where the real action is. If you're just a casual fan, I'd say read the back of the DVD case or the wiki synopsis and hell, just watch the trailer and prepare yourself for part 4 because that's what you should be paying to see, not this. Perhaps I'll have a different opinion of the series once part 2 of Mocking Jay comes out, but as it stands right now on it's own, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 gets a 2.5...out of 5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It complements the series, but it isn't a film to stand by itself. Having read the books as well as seen the previous films, I quite enjoyed part one of Mockingjay. True, there isn't much action, but we get to see a lot of character development which I'm always hoping for more in movies.The acting was pretty great, though Hemsworth and Moore's portrayal of their characters seemed a bit flat. I guess Hemsworth's Gale has always been rather flat, but I was expecting a little more from Moore. Lawrence captures the emotions of her character well, as does Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch. But for me, Elizabeth Banks was the one who really shined. She isn't on screen for long, but her character's personality is so unique and blatant that you can't help but notice her. She has done a great job in playing Effie Trinket so consistently throughout the series.The effects as well were well done. This had a lot of explosions in it, and thankfully they did not look fake. Also, the graphics for the debris and destruction was really life like.However, there was one major goof that was quite noticeable in the film. While filming propaganda videos to show the other districts, footage that wasn't captured by on-screen characters turned up in the video, which makes one think: who filmed that? There were also several other scenes that had me questioning things like that.Overall, I wasn't disappointed like many were and quite enjoyed it. At first I questioned the splitting of Mockingjay into two parts, but it gives room for them to add more detail into the finale. I can't wait for part two!Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can not think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's. performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta,. Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the. so-called Battle Royale 2: Requiem 'fans' look more pathetic than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering what film they saw.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Mockingjay Part 1 is presented almost perfectly and watching this brought back my feelings, thoughts and all the images I have created in my mind when I had been reading the book. There are no more Games and now we see the aftermath. Katniss is trying to ""recover"" from her traumas mostly mental and psychological created by the Games. She has become a symbol of rebellion and hope to the people of Panem. They expect almost everything from her and that is what makes things worse for her. She is struggling to, lets say avoid her predetermined role, but deep inside she knows that she cannot. So this movie, Mockingjay Part 1 is all about her awakening, her personal transition to maturity, and the realization of what she has become. This is what matters in the end...for creating the path of the forthcoming Part 2.

Then he went on and turned the third book of the original Suzanne Collins trilogy into two movies. Whether that was his idea or somebody else's, it was a terrible one.Having watched part 1 and 2 back-to-back, I am convinced there was enough of a story for one fairly good final installment. Sadly, however, there wasn't enough for two. The story arc is decent and the cast is pretty impressive, with big names in supporting roles. There just wasn't enough there to stretch this novel into more than four hours of film. Or into two movie tickets, which is probably the reasoning behind the decision.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Focus on Character-Driven Story lines and Political Subtext Off-Putting For Some? Conflict Between Characters Needed More Emphasis.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3180331/?ref_=tt_urv","alexgarcia732805","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52579777/?ref_=tt_urv","9 February 2015","I personally was very put off by the idea that Mockingjay would be split into 2 parts. (Now it seems every movie has/will do that-- Breaking Dawn, Deathly Hallows, Avengers: Infinity War, Allegiant, etc.) I read many reviews online, and they almost convinced me (without even watching the movie) that THG: Mockingjay--Part 1 was a pointless, boring cash-grab; a set-up movie filled with exposition and ""filler""; a holdover for ""THG Mockingjay--Part 2"". But if I have learned anything from watching so many recent films, it is this: don't judge a film by its posters, trailer, or reviews without seeing the movie for yourself--some films may really surprise you and are better (or worse) than you expected. I think some of the characters didn't get the screen time they deserved. But I truly only think that because you got to know the characters well in the books, and I think it's kind of hard to replicate that in the movies without some kind of internal monologue. If Mockingjay was a standalone film not based on a book, I'd probably have a very difficult time relating to the characters. However, I know them all well enough to not be that disappointed by a character's short screen time. I can understand why some people who didn't read the books were disappointed with and failed to connect to Mockingjay--Part 1. But those who read the books should've been satisfied with the film. I think that because I read the books, I maybe could appreciate the movie better than some people (due to the fact that many of scenes in the movie might've seemed pointless, unnecessary, or boring to those who haven't read the books). I personally wasn't bored during the movie—because while nobody was fighting to the death, and there wasn't much action—there was still good performances from the cast and some nice ""political subtext"". Because of the focus given on character-driven story lines and political allegories, I think that some viewers were distanced by the film's approach. I personally think that instead of adapting the book as well as they did, they should've created some battle scenes (possibly focusing on missions from each side of the war between the districts and the capitol). Maybe they could've shown some battles that rebel and Capitol soldiers fought, with people such as Beetee, Haymitch, Boggs, President Snow, etc. overseeing it all. ""Mockingjay Part 1 is less popular than its predecessors because it's a deliberate move away from action towards a more cerebral, darker kind of war movie."" Because the movie doesn't rely on action scenes, and it's still good (IMO), it's proof that THG films aren't dumb YA novel adaptations. They can do well without deadly competitions in arenas and ""silly teenage romance"". The movie has a lot of things that probably turned off some people-- no Hunger Games, not much real action/fighting, less of an emphasis on the love-triangle romance, being split in two parts, etc. And being on top of ""Fandango's list of most-anticipated films of 2014"" probably contributed to this film's lukewarm critical reception. When people had such enthusiasm and high expectations for the movie and they were disappointed, they probably got angry. So, besides a lack of action sequences and some characters getting little screen time, I actually thought that the movie wasn't bad. This movie probably could've explored/developed certain aspects of the movie's environment/atmosphere better than it did, but I think it's still a bit better than the first HG film. It's still not nearly as good as Catching Fire though. Mockingjay-Part 1 ""did not do a good enough job showcasing the conflict between the characters. The third book was very somber and full of distrust. The moviedidn't really capture all that you read, where previous movies they did."" The second one can reach level of tension and excitement that this one never can. Mockingjay-Part 2 will be released on November 20, 2015. I have reviewed 38 other movies on IMDb and Metacritic, including the 2014 and 2015 films: Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X- Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more.

This time around, Katniss Everdeen has to lead the revolution against the evil President Snow. Actually, before she can do that, she has to make some propaganda films to evoke the citizens interest in fighting for the greater good.To be honest, I'm not a big Hunger Games fan. I never read the books, I never went to any fan conventions, if there were any, but I did watch the previous two movies and as most people already said, they are superior to Mockingjay in a lot of different ways. The problem this movie suffers from, is undoubtedly the ""part 1"" scheme that most studios tend to do nowadays. What this causes is a lack of plot and action. Normally, a good movie doesn't necessarily need a great plot to be great, it needs a great story and Mockingjay just doesn't have a great story because as it stands now, its incomplete. It's not the whole thing. And what pisses me off is when studios think movies are some kind of TV show, where every part of the franchise can be handled as some kind of TV episode. So basically, I don't have a lot to say but there are some good aspects in this entry.First of all, the acting all around is strong. Nobody really sticks out, everyone does a good job with what they are given. However, there's one exception and that is, of course, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I don't think even the die hard fans of this series know what a loss he is and I truly hope he wont be remembered for the work he did in the Hunger Games but anyway, he is very good in the movie as is Woody Harrelson who shines with his character. These guys have a great screen presence and are just a league of their own. The rest, as I said, does a fine job.Another strong aspect is Lawrences direction. While there are not a lot of exciting and well executed shots, there are some that stick out. The few action scenes are handled very well, as previously highlighted in Catching Fire, I just would like to see more energy with the camera. Its all very stale and cold, some movement would definitely help. I don't know where these 125 million dollars went because the movie doesn't look any better than the first one and that one had way more going on. So film-making wise, it could have been better. I hope Lawrence goes back to the way he did the 2nd one because that one had way better direction than this one. It felt a lot like a ""film that then that""vibe was going on. If you have this kind of budget, you better use it to your full expense. All in all, it's a passable movie, it's definitely not bad, just very mediocre. It feels more like a product than a real film which is sad, because I had a totally different feeling from Catching Fire. That being said, I'm sure the final chapter of this franchise will deliver what was missing here. Just stop with the cash grabs Hollywood. Movies can be more than just a way to make money. Respect film as an art form.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's because I've read all three Hunger Games books by author Suzanne Collins, and I knew that the first part of Mockingjay includes very little action. Still, I like what director Francis Lawrence did with Catching Fire (2013) so, when I had the time, I watched Mockingjay - Part 1. This was over a month after it was released in theaters. I have to say that I was again impressed by what Lawrence and producer Nina Jacobson managed to do. Mockingjay - Part 1 is not a dull film. In fact, it's quite entertaining. In my opinion, director Lawrence should get most of the credit. Together with the producers he once again made a thrilling and well-paced film in which not one scene is wasted. Parts of the film can even be called inspired. The actors also did a good job. I don't think that there's one performance that stood out for me but every actor was solid. This time Josh Hutcherson, playing Peeta Mellark, managed to pull off a good performance. It's particularly effective during the Capitol television interviews. In my previous reviews I mentioned that Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have the looks to play Katniss Everdeen. But I admit that she really is a good actress, and for this film she delivered her best Katniss performance yet. But it's Donald Sutherland, the master actor, who continues to impress the most as Coriolanus Snow. The way he speaks and his facial expressions are mesmerizing. He makes every second count, and in the bleak offering that is Mockingjay - Part 1 he is particularly memorable. Of course, this film is a Hollywood product, even if it is very well-made. It also doesn't leave a lasting impression on viewers, which is the big reason why reviewers didn't like it as much as, for example, Catching Fire. There's no big payoff or struggle at the end of the film. It can only be viewed as the first part of a larger film. But I still recommend it. The film's marketing campaign made me interested, and when I watched Mockingjay - Part 1 I wasn't disappointed at all.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie follows Katniss Everdeen as she becomes the figurehead of the rebellion against the Capitol, leading her into a dangerous mission to save Peeta Mellark and the other tributes who were taken captive by the Capitol.The acting remains solid, with Jennifer Lawrence once again delivering a strong performance as Katniss. The supporting cast also stands out, with notable performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. The film also explores deeper themes of propaganda and the power of media, adding a layer of complexity to the story.However, the film suffers from a lack of action and excitement, particularly in the first half. The slow pacing and lack of thrills may leave viewers feeling bored and disengaged. Additionally, the film feels like a setup for the final installment, with many loose ends left unresolved and the story feeling incomplete.Furthermore, while the film is faithful to the book in many ways, it still falls short of capturing the depth and complexity of the source material. Some important plot points and character developments are left out, which may leave fans of the book feeling disappointed.Overall, Mockingjay Part 1 is an okay adaptation that has its strong points but falls short of the previous films in terms of excitement and pacing. While the acting and exploration of deeper themes are commendable, the film may leave viewers feeling underwhelmed and wanting more. Additionally, the book remains superior in terms of depth and complexity.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The result is not surprising.After the events of the trilogy's second act, Catching Fire, Katniss wakes up surrounded by new allies with dubious motives. She desperately wants to rescue Peeta, who has been taken by the tyrannical Capitol, but her allies want her to become a symbol of strength and hope for the downtrodden Districts.Compared to the first two films, this one feels like the most grim, realistic interpretation of the themes involved. Mockingjay Part 1 is a bleak, visually monotone and narratively reserved; there are lots and lots of visuals depicting death and destruction, we see heroine Katniss standing in a field of burnt bodies and skulls, we have executions and brainwashing to drill into our heads that The Capitol are vicious. Wow. I never would have thought I would say that, the incompetent villains are actually evil here, we actually get a real sense of uncompromising tyranny that could rule over millions of lives. The threat is finally real, and there's a sense that Katniss really must choose, that her fate is now entwined with the fate of all the Districts.But this whole cutting the chapter in half nonsense continues to not work. My prevailing memory of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 are those of stale, dull, elongated moments (mostly camping in the forest), and Mockingjay Part 1 is no different. Scenes are stretched, padded and unnecessarily quiet and dull. When watched in a vacuum this only makes the persistent thought of ""this isn't going to conclude"" all the more apparent. Most of the film is about Katniss trying to get over tension and shock to become the poster girl for a rebellion. There little to no combat or action, because this is only the first and partly second act of a complete film.I boycotted this film's release on principle: the first two films had uneventful segments, and if they boost that uneventfulness into one entire movie, I will be both bored and unsatisfied. While the film didn't quite bore me as much as I thought it might, it was as unsatisfying as I expected.Perhaps the best part of this film is the twisted dynamic between Katniss and Peeta. While it does not have the same power as Catching Fire's celebrity gossip themes, it is this film's greatest asset. Although I do have a soft spot for stories that literally corrupt heroes.The Capitol finally have fangs, and the film benefits tremendously from the late Philip Seymour Hoffman and newcomer Juiliane Moore, Jennfier Lawrence too maintains her multi-layered Katniss very well and there's a good sense of continuity with Catching Fire. But I refuse, I refuse to believe this is better as two parts. A screenwriter worth his or her salt could compress this into a single film, perhaps the longest film in the series but at least that's not the ridiculous cash grab that is two incomplete films.Each Lord of the Rings book was a single film!I went into Mockingjay Part 1 with cynicism, and unfortunately it didn't change my overall opinion enough. Sure, I fully admit I am too old for this series (if I were thirteen I'd be all over it, and completely smitten by Ms Lawrence) and if I were a fan I'd be chewing my own arm off to see the conclusion. But in terms of singular films, which this must be rated as, it is nothing spectacular.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games is a unscrupulous photocopy of the masterpiece BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM, and should be avoided, if not boycotted.Some will claim that The Hunger Games is a 'tribute' or a 'remake' of the BATTLE ROYALE. To them I ask one question: ""What kind of filmmakers make remakes of a movie when the original came out two years ago and has been selling DVDs very well internationally?"" It seems that this particular brand of Indian cinema has decided that it is quite content making money off of other people idea for free. And though it is impossible for the original filmmakers to sue the filmmakers of The Hunger Games (on the account that US copyright laws does not allow for such suit), The Hunger Games should be remembered as a true stain on the development of American Cinema.Because it has photocopied a great movie, The Hunger Games avoids being an absolute terror of a movie. However, this does not excuse Gary Ross and the section of 'Bollywood' that has involved itself in The Hunger Games's production. Because of the blatant plagiarism, and the The Hunger Games's makers absolutely refusing to apologize and reimburse the original filmmakers, I must say The Hunger Games deserves 1 star, if not 0.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and others (Natalie Dormer) from the obliterated District 12 go to the supposedly destroyed District 13 to hook up with President Coin (Julianne Moore) and her associates (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Mahershala Ali) where Katniss becomes the ""Mockingjay,"" the symbol of revolution for the oppressed districts of Panem. Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson are also on hand.I'm not a huge fan of The Hunger Games films, but I'll watch 'em. I gave the first one a 7/10. This second sequel is a natural extension, but there isn't a lot of action and the drama isn't very compelling, but it's okay. It comes across as drama for teenage girls, which shouldn't be surprising since that's the target audience of the books. Nevertheless, Jennifer's a likable protagonist and I appreciate the realistic air and overall ambiance, as well as the entire dystopian concept. It just needs more oomph, which I hope we'll get with the final film.Lorde's song during the credits is a highlight (""Yellow Flicker Beat"").The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Georgia, Germany and Utah (the lake where Katniss sings).GRADE: C+","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Mockingjay Part 1 has plenty going for it, but just as just as much working against it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3142822/?ref_=tt_urv","RyanCShowers","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19043679/?ref_=tt_urv","16 December 2014","The reason why ""The Hunger Games"" series always stood above other young adult novel-to- movie adaptations was that did it not yield to the demands ordered by the money-hungry movie studios. Instead, the ambitions behind ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" were rooted in the quality of the film rather than the box office bottom line. The film adaptations of Suzanne Collins' novels had the advantage of critical support over franchises such as ""Twilight"" and ""Divergent"" because making the best movie possible was always the predominant thought on the filmmakers' minds. This holiday season welcomes ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,"" an entry that makes the franchise feel less special.After she destroys the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescued by leaders of the rebellion and now resides in District 13, an underground society occupied by the members of the revolution. President Coin (veteran actress Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (acting mogul Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his final roles) ask Katniss to be the political face of the rebellion by encouraging the remaining Districts of Panem to join the revolt against the Capitol. Katniss agrees with the condition that District 13 will rescue Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and the other Hunger Games contestants being held captive by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol.As suggested in the title, the final book in Collins' series ""Mockingjay"" has been severed into two separate films. Why? ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" doubled their profits by separating the series' final book into two movie adaptations. (Heck, ""The Hobbit"" tripled their earnings). Why not sink another acclaimed series with the post-""Star Wars"" financial battle for box office cash?""The Hunger Games"" series has undergone many modifications since the last round of the fight-to-the-death, reality-TV critique in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."" The pacing has decelerated considerably, ""the games"" have been eliminated from the plot and replaced with commentary on propaganda, the majority story takes place in underground, and more focus is placed upon Katniss's emotional reactions to the putrid atmosphere of Panem's community rather than on the fan-favorite love triangle between her, Peeta, and Gale.The propaganda war between District 13 and the Capitol is the best component of the film. It is thoughtfully political and entertainingly clever. Also servicing the ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is Jennifer Lawrence, once again starring as Katniss. Lawrence's work is most notable for her natural ability in bringing an undeniable emotional intensity to this role with ease. Another success of this particular entry is the final shot of the movie. The first two films failed to impale the viewer with a meaningful and attractive closing frame, but ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" makes an arresting statement in the image with which it leaves you.Director Francis Laurence gambles most of the story aiming for ""poignant"" moments, scenes that are meant to study and affect the destruction of different areas of Panem directly caused by the government. There are the occasional scenes that dramatically succeed, but more often than not, the ""poignant"" moments are ineffective and sit slayed by miscalculation from the Laurence. In addition, the visual style lacks splendor and the technical elements are not as smooth and agile as the previous installments.""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" has plenty going for it, but it has just as much working against it. This installment will not move you as much as the original film, nor will it viscerally excite you like last year's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.""* * 1/2 out of * * * *Grade: B-","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Once there, she reluctantly agrees to become the mockingjay, and act as a symbol of the continued uprising against the Capitol. Sensing her growing influence among the people and vehemently refusing to give justification to their actions, President Snow responds by declaring it a treasonous activity for anyone to embrace the mockingjay. Although not as action-oriented as its predecessors, this bleak and riveting saga is still able to find a way to tell a captivating story with political overtones and tense character interactions, as well as plenty of close calls and startling scenes, anchored by a first-rate performance from Lawrence who believably conveys her character's various stages of anger, determination and vulnerability. ***","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Mockingjay Part 1 was still a decent sequel though not feeling complete it had a much dark and grimmer take compared to the two previous movies.Alright story mostly cuz it had some pacing inconsistncies and was divided into two parts.
But a bit more emotional and thematic compared to the last two movies. The characters have been developed well so far not to say that Katniss's PTSD and Peeta being a shell of his former self is good and all. I really would have wanted a bit more screentime for other characters such as Haymitch and Finnick since they felt pretty useless in this flim. Very good visuals, the choreography was well done and the camera work was stunning. The music was pretty good and the songs were decent. And lastly good acting and writing.Overall an enjoyable movie.Memoralbe: No Rewatchable: No","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Albatross being the character of Peeta, and the ridiculous focus on such a weakly written part which dragged this entire episode down, wasting a ton of surrounding talent in the process.It's difficult to complain about the actor when the part of Peeta (and especially invoking that character for anything more than a fleeting love interest of a momentarily distracted teenage girl while being caught up in something of much larger concern), the most weakly scripted and seriously undercast element of the whole series to begin with, was actually made the focus of this film. I can't even tell if Peeta was supposed to be the ""focus"" of the film or not, but there's no question that anything to do with this character was a major distraction throughout. By any good sense of scripting, he was (or certainly should have been) conveniently gone before this latest episode. But, no ....So we have at hand; Donald Sutherland, Jeffry Wright, Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and, oh yeah, Jennifer Lawrence in there too. But this whole episode had to play like a broken record around; Peeta. The fact that the producer/writer/director ""club of cluelessness"" had to rub it in our noses in the final scene didn't help at all.Is anybody else's forehead as sore as mine as result of banging into the table or desk at such a complete waste? If you're going to write such a weak part, then get try to get someone who has at least a slight chance of being a future Colin Farrel or Ewan McGregor or somebody like that to play the part, if you are involving all this other talent. It's not like any other characters or scenarios in this movie involved anything like 'great script writing.' It's just for entertainment, we know that to start with. But you just can't have a guy made for soap operas or teen movies trying to keep up with the others in this movie in this scenario, in this inappropriate role.Aside from the mis-casting, I just don't understand the author or script writers imposing this ""teen love"" aspect into the series beyond the first two episodes at all. There was nothing in the Catching Fire episode that convinced any audience there was any genuine 'love' from Katniss towards Peeta that was anything other than showing appreciation and taking pity. But now she's ready to drag down the entire revolution and its cause for sake of ... I don't know, you tell me.A guy who would do OK in soap operas and secondary roles in standard sitcoms.This ""teen love"" thing is just hard to explain, innit?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
