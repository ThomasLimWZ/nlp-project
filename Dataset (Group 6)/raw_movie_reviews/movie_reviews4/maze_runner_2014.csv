I went into the movie ""cold"", not having read the novel by James Dashner or knowing very much about the plot. For me, this was the type of film that I knew if I just went with the flow and didn't try and look for all the holes in the story and script that I'd be better off.The way the film was presented by first time director Wes Ball was top notch, as I felt I was right there in the maze with the main characters. The obvious set-up for a sequel at the end of the movie didn't bother me too much as it seems like every movie of this type ""has to"" have at least one.In summary, I found this movie to be very absorbing and kept my interest throughout.","88 out of 104 found this helpful.

The Maze Runner combines The Hunger Games (2012), Cube (1997), with Lord of the Flies (1990) into a rather fascinating mystery thriller for boys. For most of the movie, the consistency of theme and plot holds up well. The tension, the ever presence ominous sounds of the maze offers up a dread that is pervasively creepy. The stereotypical characters aren't usually overplayed and the over the top performances or plot points are mostly held back using instead more empathetic and humanistic portrayals.The ending seems like a cop out for a hoped for sequel unfortunately. And there a few moments that really do fall back into the stereotypical plot design. The humor however makes their appearances with to great effect though. This is more enjoyable movie than expected. It just misses out though being really innovative and can't quite break out of the mold of most of the other sci fi thrillers.","15 out of 16 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A tense, entertaining film with enough thrills and drama to cover up its narrative inadequacies.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3084639/?ref_=tt_urv","shawneofthedead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48490287/?ref_=tt_urv","11 September 2014","It's rare for a big movie studio to trust the future of a potential blockbuster franchise to a brand-new director. You'd imagine that there would be just too much at stake when it came to translating James Dashner's series of best-selling dystopian novels to the silver screen. But it's easy to see why Wes Ball got the job - with this one film, he graduates from short films to blockbuster movies with flair to spare. Indeed, The Maze Runner is such a cool, confident and thrilling blend of action beats and character work that it's hard to believe Ball has never before commandeered a full- length feature film. It's true that the narrative gets a little away from him by the end, making less sense as more secrets are revealed. But this is more a problem with the source material than Ball's own skills as a director.Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) finds himself thrust rudely into the world of the Glade: a community of boys who have figured out how to live while encircled by a giant, constantly changing maze, within which dwell giant, boy-eating monsters known only as Grievers. Many of the boys, including benevolent pioneer Alby (Aml Ameen) and champion of the old ways Gally (Will Poulter), are content with just surviving day to day. Thomas winds up unsettling the entire camp with his refusal to follow the rules and determination to ask questions: he wants to explore the Maze with designated runners like Minho (Ki Hong Lee), and figure out a way to get free. Life in the camp gets more complicated when, weeks before the next boy is due to be sent up to the Glade, a girl in the form of Theresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives instead.There's a lot of blockbuster potential to be squeezed out of this premise, and Ball does so quite wonderfully. The Maze encircling the Glade is a stonily grey, massive enclosure, and the Grievers - when the boys encounter them in increasingly close quarters - are odd marvels made as much of machine as flesh. Ball cuts scenes of great, heart-stopping tension together masterfully: whether it's Thomas running through walls that are fast closing in on him, or Thomas and Minho trying to outrun a Griever while burdened with an unconscious Alby.The film even finds some welcome dramatic depth in this strange little community of lost boys in the Glade - Thomas' growing antagonism with Gally is balanced against the mutual respect he and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) develop for each other, and the brotherly connection that he forges with the adorable Chuck (Blake Cooper). The politics of the situation is fascinating as well: as much as The Maze Runner is about, well, running for your life in a giant maze, it also raises big questions about identity and integrity. Is safety and security worth giving up your right to information and choice?What works less well is the secret around which the Glade is constructed. As viewers, we aren't given a whole lot of answers about why the Glade and the Maze exists, nor do we get many explanations as to why Thomas is so different and insatiably curious. But the ones we do get - all centred around the mysterious, severe figure of Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) in some kind of control centre - oddly render the film and its characters less, rather than more, interesting. It's a strangely deflating experience to have the film's rich ethical dilemmas and intense action sequences give way to an underlying dystopian narrative that isn't really all that compelling.Nevertheless, The Maze Runner remains quite an accomplishment. It's an assured, impressive debut for Ball, one with enough electric tension and moody drama to intrigue throughout its running time. His young cast is fully capable of carrying their own weight, with Poulter - morphing from comic sidekick in We're The Millers into hateful adversary here - the standout. Its story collapses a little into itself as it hurtles towards its climax, but Ball's work is quite enough to leave viewers excited by the prospect of the inevitable sequel.","209 out of 339 found this helpful.

Now I must say that I have seen some very good movies and series round this theme that may influence my judgment, for example The Cube (1 - 3), Persons Unknown, Saw, etc. all have a person or group of persons who don't know how they get there or how to get away. How is it possible that those movies, some dating from 1997, are so much better then a 2014 movie? And being almost 2 hours long, how come so little happens in those 2 hours? Some reviewers already mentioned the contradictory and illogical elements in this movie, and yes, this does this movie, with such much potential, not much good, it's just annoying to see them not try what is so logic.

And the acting is barebones, these are kids, not Cyrano De Bergerac or Mephistofele, but boy the film is well done.I mistakenly googled the film's name before it was over, and disappointed myself to learn that it's just the first of three parts, so it means waiting another 2-3 years for the other two films, but that means also that i have something to look forward to.Now, i normally like more ""profound"" films, but for once, i really enjoyed this sci-fi romp and no, it's nothing like Twilight. A couple of the characters (Gally, Chuck) are phoned in, but then again, how would you write this kind of plot without these characters getting thrown in?So the film is a very pleasant, well paced, well directed, reasonably well acted, decently scored, great .. well, nice CGI, entertaining film that will please just about every audience there is, without being horribly commercial, soppy and cliché.I haven't had this much fun in a long while - although i gotta say Edge OF Tomorrow was just as good.My final vote - a very solid 8/10, and I'm wishing for parts 2 and 3 ASAP.","158 out of 247 found this helpful.

Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about what to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days. I stay wait sequel with great interest.","51 out of 78 found this helpful.

His body, limp on the floor of a openly woven caged box, rises up to the sun and grass where he promptly meets a crowd of his peers, all male. Talking with them he discovers he is exactly like them, unknowingly in this location, his memory erased with only his name available to him, it is Thomas.He soon discovers the grassy area's perimeter is completely encapsulated by steeply high concrete walls, beyond which is a maze. The goal is to figure out the maze as it is the only way to freedom.The Maze Runner uses young up-and-comer actors and actresses rather than the obvious and nepotistic decision. Dylan O'Brien does a superb job as the newbie Thomas and Aml Ameen is especially captivating as the leader of the stranded survivors Alby. The primarily British young actors also do a splendid job of masking their native accents for a neutrally American vocal pattern.Further, Wes Ball's direction of The Maze Runner has a clear vision as it emulates a vastly PG-er Lord of the Flies vibe. The beauty of the film is its simplicity. Since the children and teens are locked in an experimental cage, there is no need for monotonous information delivery regarding the futuristic world. There's no futuristic dialect, class system, government changes or anything of the type.","37 out of 57 found this helpful.

He arrives at a primitive culture called The Glade with teenagers and boys, surrounded by huge walls, and he is welcomed by the leader Alby (Aml Ameen) that explains that his memory will return in a couple of days. Alby tells that all of them have passed by the same process and now they survive working in their own agriculture plus the supplies provided by the elevator once a month. Further, a new boy is always brought in the elevator. The teenager sees a breach on the wall and Alby explains that only runners succeed in crossing trying to find a means of escape since there is a maze around the walls and the dangerous Grievers that hunt them down. When Alby is stung by a Griver, he brings him back to the community. He is bullied by the strong Gally (Will Poulter) and they fight. He hits his head on the floor and recalls his name, Thomas.

Meanwhile a girl called Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives in the elevator with the note ""she is the last one ever"" and two syringes; further she knows him. Thomas decides to use one syringe in Alby and he recovers. However that night the breach on the wall is not closed and The Grivers invade The Glade killing the boys. Will Thomas and his friends survive? Will they find a way out from The Glade?

The big difference is that, where Cube was a brilliantly executed low-budget thriller with nail-biting tension and a thought provoking ambiguous climax, The Maze Runner is a mega-budget blockbuster that, for much of its running time, moves like molasses, and which ends leaving questions that we know will be answered, just so long as we shell out more cash to see the next couple of instalments.Obviously, at 47 I'm not exactly in the intended demographic for this film, but I do feel that this one missed the opportunity to be a hugely entertaining adventure for all ages. When the characters are in the maze, running for their lives from the grievers (metallic insectoid monsters), or dodging the changing architecture, the film is actually very enjoyable, but far too much time is spent in the relative safety of 'the glade', the idyllic green area at the centre of the maze where the boys first wake up. With my son currently reading the series of books, it's almost certain that I'll have to watch the sequels; I just hope that they make it a little more exciting next time around (and don't cut the film to reduce the UK rating to a 12 certificate. Grrrrrr!).5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.","20 out of 29 found this helpful.

For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called 'set pieces' were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but that's a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isn't overwhelmed by clichés like so many others are.It's led by a relatively unknown cast. Dylan O'Brien, from Teen Wolf fame, is thrown into a maze structure along with a few dozen other young men who soon find there is more to the maze than they were led to believe. Let me be the first to say I think O'Brien has some chops and definitely has a future in this business. The role doesn't require a ton of range, but I think he proved he can lead a huge action film, and not many actors can say that. The writing itself I thought could have been a little smarter and more mature. Will Poulter, who played a much different character in We're The Millers, was solid in the role that was given to him. But the writing had him doing some really stupid things and was full of forced dialogue I felt.With that being said, the mythology behind the story is pretty interesting. And they made the film into a more traditional monster film than I'm sure the book originally called for, but it really works. The horror element to the film was by far the most intriguing, and had the biggest payoff. The 'Greavers' also proved to be pretty terrifying, something I didn't think I would say about a film with a bunch of teenagers. So I really only watched this because I'm probably going to see the sequel this weekend, and i ended up enjoying the movie. Plus, having Littlefinger as the next villain gets me pretty excited.+Monster flick+Surprisingly well acted+Suspensful-Some stupid dialogue7.2/10","19 out of 29 found this helpful.

Nobody is allowed to leave, or cross the walls. One slip up from someone let's him know that they are in a maze, wild roaring is heard from beyond the walls. There are 'Maze runners' within the community that have spent three years trying to find a way out. Thomas has disturbing flashbacks, some kind of medical procedure. He gets trapped in the maze and begins to discover what's going on.I'm assuming that writer Noah Openheim was a bit of a fan of Lost, it feels a little like it, crossed with Lord of the Flies. It's quite an interesting concept I guess, it just doesn't feel very original or extraordinary. There is one serious amount of running around.A couple of jumps I suppose, not scary in the least, but there is a bit of action.

Comparable to The  Hunger Games and Twilight, it is in fairly good chances to be the next  big franchise. Here is what we thought of it;  Setting the tone immediately, lead star Dylan O'Brien awakens suddenly  in a very dark and eerie lift travelling from deep below the ground, it  becomes apparent that he now knows just as much as we do. The fear is  visual and quite real  and just like a young child on our first day of  school we are pushed into a new, confusing experience for the next two  hours.  Arriving atop the lift and unable to remember anything other than his  name, Thomas. He is told by a group of teenage boys that he is in a  field in the centre of a maze, called the 'Glade', where they all live.  Having attempted to find a way out many times, all they know is that  the maze is open during the day-time, and closed at night where it  periodically changes and is protected by fearsome creatures called  'grievers'. Anyone in there at that time has never returned.  Much like an episode of Lost meeting The Lord of the Flies meeting  Labyrinth, we understand narrative at the same time as Thomas, who is  eventually told that three years ago a young teenage boy first arrived  at the glade, and each month since one more arrives in the lift with  certain supplies to survive. Unknowing of why and unable to escape they  have become helplessly trapped there since. Similarly to The Lord of  the Flies, the group of boys, all probably aged 10-20 have creating a  living-area, created rules, swearwords and the imperative code to  'never go beyond those walls' - but as Thomas arrives at the glade all  seems to change for the worse, and many of the other 'Gladers' take  note.  Admittedly we had not read the book until after we had saw the film,  but from the very first paragraph we noted its book-to-screen accuracy.  Fans of the book will be more than satisfied with the minimal changes,  and any made are for the better.  The film, upheld by a ninety-nine percent teen cast, feels news and  many of the actors are in roles unseen before. Dylan O'Brien, From TV's  Teen-Wolf, provides an exceptional lead role as Thomas and carries the  film in both story and emotional trawls. Although new to the setting  and with the films entirety taking place over just a few days, he  comfortably fits in, although ruffling many traditions too. At one  point it is said 'I don't know if he is brave or stupid, but we need  more of him'.  Co-staring alongside Dylan O'Brien are equally exceptional performances  by; Will Poulter, in a dark tough-guy role, (and absolutely nothing  like his recent role as Kenny in We're The Millar's); Thomas  Brodie-Sangster stars as a fellow Glader; and Kaya Scodelario in a  surprise turn-up as the first female at the Glade - but also 'the last  one ever' to arrive. Although the narrative between them is conflicting  at times, the chemistry is smooth as if friends both on-and-off the  screen. Notably, we can confirm that the characters live-up the book  creations and are almost perfectly cast.  Evidentially former director/writer/editor/effects maestro, Wes Ball  uses skills from his previous work on this film and it shows and flows  evenly. Take note future producers, this is how to successfully make a  YA adaption, which surprisingly, is just as impressive as the book. Yet  unfortunately leaves us with far more questions than answers by the  end. Based on the trilogy by James Dashner expect more answers to  follow in sequel movies in the soon to be massive franchise. Or, you  know  you can read the books before hand? Ultimately, you do not have  to be a fan of the books, or even a YA to enjoy the film it, it has  something for almost everyone.

However, in my opinion, ""The Maze Runner"" is unable to get it to be thrilling.The film comes to an end without knowing the answer to several questions in order to make room for the second film.So I will be waiting for a new episode and news surprises from Wes Ball and T.S.

It (thankfully) doesn't begin with a voice-over narration, because indeed it's another high concept that designs a world as a mind-bending game. The film already faults for spilling too much rules and details, but when things starts actually moving, the action becomes marvelous, with large scaled, suspense driven set pieces that easily makes it worth the price admission. The worst of it however is when it finally unfolds all of the hidden secrets, compromising much of the potential of this ride. Still, it's pretty hard to deny the excitement of the experience alone. Treating it as another solid action film might be enough for a while.Things are stronger at the first act when the hero is just picking up information even though the people around him are basically just over-explaining stuff rather than developing their characters. But it's great when it keeps the plot moving from one place to another. Once they get into the maze, the momentum becomes a heartbeat. It works like a certain video game that has its heroes risk through various obstacles, brimmed by conspicuous fortitude. It is a great example of a real action film that relies more on the matter of life and death thrills, even if you're already surrounded by nice production and special effects. There's also an hint of social analogy to fit the genre's trend of playing with politics, except the one here seems simple and intriguing to figure out what it is trying to pinpoint. Everything else is just more scattered clues for the mystery.But all of those growth suddenly gets bogged down once it hits to their biggest answers. It's obviously setting up for another young adult franchise, but it also hurts to whatever it has put together. At this point, it feels like we're left hanging with more questions, except it's much nonsensical. To be fair after this large disappointment, we're still given a totally fun cinematic experience. The direction is so energetic at its tension, it almost seems to have inspiration some of the greatest horror movie aesthetics and tricks: the ooze, the meat, the traps, the dark walls, and the singular angled chase scenes with the enemy coming closer to the hero. Those are some of its remarkable, well-shot bits that you don't always see in this dull genre. The acting is also good for outweighing what's written for the characters. Dylan O'Brien looks like a hero to root for and he does a fine job for it. Will Poulter also shines as his reasonably arrogant opposite.The best thing The Maze Runner could offer is the maze itself, though those spectacle couldn't help us ignore the final minutes of the film, but it still overpowers the overall experience. Personally, I would rather look forward more on a video-game adaptation (if it's even possible) than the sequels, but I don't know. It's pretty hard to see where this story is going. It instantly compromises some larger picture beneath the surfaces.for the sake of being another million dollar franchise, but this one has a direction of its own, despite that their destiny seems to lack the freshness. The cleverly constructed action just adds the value, otherwise.","38 out of 71 found this helpful.

What is that? The word of the decade? I'd never even heard of this word before a few years ago and I'm not sure what it really means and I doubt most people who use it do either. Now I see it at least once a week. I'm still trying to figure out what 'post-apocalyptic' means. That was the popular word in the 80s and 90s for low-budget sci-fi flicks. Anyway, with the title and concept like 'The Maze Runner', the movie 'Logan's Run' quickly comes to mind. There are some similarities. Both movies are about a bunch of young people, stuck in a man-made environment, running to escape death. And in both films, there are people called runners.But this film reminds me more of the Twilight Zone episode where a group of people trapped in a large round room escapes only to find out they were just dolls thrown into a toy bin. Too bad this film is not quite as interesting. Sorry for the spoiler, but, in the end, the kids are indeed human, not action figures.You have to hand it to the filmmakers. They saw an over-crowded marketplace filled with trilogies based on popular teen books and had the nerve to say, ""Me too!"" And still they submitted something that offered few original ideas and resembled many of the films of this type that came before it recently. That took a lot of guts.This film isn't that bad. It just feels like it belongs on a Saturday morning along with the cartoons. I still think the Twilight Zone ending would've been better.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

The main character Thomas wakes up in a rusty elevator and has no memory. He is in a community full of strangers in a place known as ""The Glade"". The place is enclosed by a massive maze and there is no escape. Thomas and his crew face a lot of challenges but they learn the ins and outs of the maze and finally find an escape route. The movie is filled with great suspense and kept me entertained at all times.The story opens with Thomas who wakes up in an elevator which was filled with water for a couple of hours. He is rescued by a gang of unfamiliar teenagers in a place called ""The Glade"". Thomas is unable to remember anything about himself. Alby, the leader of the group tells Thomas the condition is normal and he should remember his name soon. Alby shows Thomas around and how the Glade works. Thomas wonders whats beyond the maze and whether there is a way to escape. But he is warned by Alby not to go in the maze. While learning about The Glade, he meets Chuck and they both become friends.In the night there is a celebration to welcome Thomas. Every month a new person arrives and supplies come. Newt, a second in command and gardener tells Thomas the maze keeps changing and the only way to escape is to go through the maze. The Runners are the only one that are allowed to enter the maze. They plan for an escape route in the day and return back before nightfall. One of the boys end up with a fight with another boy named Gally, during which Thomas remembers his name. The next morning when Thomas is gathering supplies in the woods he is attacked by Ben, who has been stung by grievers; deadly monsters that roam around the maze in the night. The boys decide to banish Ben and leave him in the maze to die. On the other hand, one of the boys Alby is stung and unconscious. Minho, drags Alby to the entrance gate of the maze but is unable to make it through. Seeing this Thomas runs inside the maze and helps. The three boys survive at night with Thomas successfully killing the griever, and they return the next day with Alby which kept the other boys astonished.A few days later a new girl arrives Teresa, with a note in her hand ""She is the final one"". On the other hand Thomas accompanies Minho to the maze and discovers an escape route. After finding an escape route, all the boys follow Thomas inside the maze.With lots of twists and turns towards in the end, the boys finally made it through and they find an escape route. They discover that they were living in the world with a fatal disease known as The Flare. I really liked the photography of the film. The best part of The Maze Runner is the maze itself. The way the maze is built in a 3D form with creepy noises and monsters living inside it. Another aspect which I really enjoyed was the action pack sequence. The action pack sequence shown in the film is great. Most of the times there are fighting scenes with Thomas defeating the griever which is very entertaining to watch. Most of the action scenes were amazing and it seemed the grievers were real. One of my favorite actors is Thomas; the main protagonist of the film did a great job. Although, he faced many obstacles on the way but he acted bravely and went through fear. He also put himself in danger to help his friend. I also really liked the suspense and action of the movie. The one thing I learned from this movie was how courage and bravery were shown. With an unfamiliar place with strangers, and the will to escape this prison with challenges. I learned that don't lose hope and be prepared to face any challenges that come across. This movie is mainly to the teenagers as of today many teens like to watch movies of suspense and action. I would not recommend this movie for children because there is a lot of fear and violence. A lot of dead bodies as most boys while were crushed and killed by the griever. In my opinion, I think this is a great and interesting movie filled with a lot of action and suspense. I would rate this movie a 5/5 because it kept be entertained from the beginning to the end. The photography and the visual effects were spectacular and eye-catching.","22 out of 40 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Runner is Not a Blunder, But Rather Vague","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3089471/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","20 September 2014","This weekend is a big weekend, with at least three blockbuster movies releasing in my neck of the woods. I start my reviews this weekend with perhaps the most anticipated of the bunch, the Maze Runner. Once again Hollywood has decided to take a book series and run with it, in hopes that it will be the next big series to change the world. Yet like always, the question remains: Is this another glorified mess from the trailers, or have they done a good job? Well with two of my good buddies, I headed to the theater to start my weekend of reviews. I've never read the books, but knowing general trends Maze Runner has some big shoes to live up to. The premise is quite simple, a boy gets sent up to a center of the maze with a handful of other boys, and no memories of where he was before. This familiar bout of amnesia, is apparently normal, and within seconds he is integrated into a culture reminiscent of Lord Of The Flies. Of course, like always, Thomas is the one who defies the normal rules, and starts the journey of change that starts the trilogy. While the story is nothing we haven't seen before, the Maze Runner has some suspense and unknown elements that keeps you latched into the film. Throughout the film, my mind worked to uncover and guess the twists they had at the end, knowing the general nature of the set-up, yet not quite able to figure out the specific details. It is this element, at least for a Maze Runner newbie like me, that kept me into the movie. Despite the underlying mystery though, there were some other elements in the mix that made the Maze Runner an interesting experience. For one thing the movie is well shot and edited together. The entire journey is captured well, each angle well suited to give you the greatest detail in as little transitions. The same techniques remain during the dramatic argument scenes, which, when combined with the audio of booming drums and blaring horns, brings out the emotion and tension the boys are feeling. Yet, the best part of the camera editing are the action scenes, especially concerning the maze. It is always nice to see a movie defy the trend of shaky camera work, forgoing the ""realistic"" first person perspective for actually showing us the scene at hand. Whether it be running or fighting, the camera is surprisingly stable and well focused on the matter at hand and brings some excitement to a rather slow plot line. Yes, unfortunately the story of the Maze Runner is a little drawn out and at points, rather vague and inconclusive. At first the ambiguity is fun, the multiple, unanswered questions keeping you wondering what path the movie will turn down next. These elements are integrated quite well with character developing moments, allowing more character buildup to help set the stage. However, for this reviewer it's nice to get some answers at points in the movie instead of more questions. Maze Runner for me provided vague solutions to the unknown, leaving more questions with that answer. Now this can be good if there is a nice wrap up to the madness, but for this movie that wasn't the case for me. I know, many are going to say that there are three books and answers come later, but this reviewer wanted a little more wrap up to at least some of the questions that developed over the two hours. To tell you the truth, I felt kind of gipped at the end of the movie, saying at the end, and I quote one of the characters, ""Really?""Despite the ambiguity though there are two other elements that help keep the movie going. First off the action is fun and relevant to the plot, the maze portions in particular being an intense fight for survival. Despite being a little savage and gruesome at parts, the evolutionary drive to remain alive is balanced with strategy, running, and fights with primitive tools. The action doesn't seem extra, but is built into the story quite well, spanning the fighting spectrum between the male rivalry to fighting the raging the Grievers. Of course the action is only as good as the acting as well, especially when it comes to interacting with CGI settings. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is the staple to the casting, surprising me with his performance of a male version of Catniss. Unlike the leading lady though, Thomas fought the culprits without being as whiney, a plus in my book for a leading character. O'Brien had a nice balance to his role, passionate and fiery, without crossing into an overacted, melodramatic mess. Lead Maze Runner Minho (Ki Hong Lee) was also a nice supporting character, bringing the wing man role to life and adding a little grounding to Thomas's flamboyant attitude. As for characters like Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Alby (Aml Ameen), Chuck (Blake Cooper), and Gally (Will Poulter), they were good too and each did a nice job playing their respective characters. Though with the exception of O'Brien, the real strength was the chemistry between all the group was the greatest quality of the acting and the community they formed. Overall the Maze Runner is a decent addition to the movie based on book library. There is a nice design to the movie, and a lot of good character building to set the stage in this morbid tale. Acting wise it is enjoyable, but in reality it's the action surrounding the story that got me the most. I still wished though that there was some better wrap up than what we got, despite the opening it provided. Overall a decent movie to watch this weekend, and has elements worth a visit to the theater. My scores are:Action/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0","24 out of 43 found this helpful.

Walking in to the theater I was fearing another angst-driven teen movie; like a cheap take on the ""Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"". Much to my surprise, however, ""The Maze Runner"" delivered. Fast paced, gritty, and supported by good characters and scripting, the movie went beyond just being entertaining; multiple scenes draw you in and immerse you. This was partially due to stunning effects that really emphasized the grand size of the maze, and partially due to the surprisingly dark nature of the film. It would have been easy here to 'gloss over' some of the nastier scenes much like other M-rated titles, but the film makers here decided to go for high impact and sometimes brutal imagery. While not gory by any standards, the dark tone of the film added atmosphere and made for quality viewing.For those who haven't read the books, the ending may have seemed abrupt, but you leave the cinema feeling like you've got your money's worth... and that's the main thing in this industry","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Its setup is interesting and builds adequate suspense to keep us watching with slightly interested eyes, but it falls apart with its repeated, clichéd, TV drama like dialogue. It serves to forward the plot, but often tends to show little of anything, really. And it happens a lot. Most of the film is spent talking, mostly about the maze as a sacred, untouchable thing that no one should go into under the consequence of death by the monsters that lurk within the maze. The action, when it happens, is fun, but it doesn't happen often enough.The film follows a boy named Thomas who is cast into a mini society put together by a group of boys that live in the center of a maze, in a place they call the Glade. Every month, an elevator comes out of the ground with food and a new boy. No one can remember anything before they came into the Glade, although Thomas has visions of symbols and people in his dreams. No one is allowed past the doors that mark the entrance to the Maze except the Runners, a designated group of kids who map the maze in order to attempt to find a way out. The doors close at night and open in the morning. Alby, the group leader, warns Thomas, ""No one survives a night in the maze."" Of course, Thomas is curious about the maze.The Maze Runner follows what I like to call ""The Avalanche Framework"". A person or event disrupts the quiet structure of a strict society, causing it to spiral out of control, inciting absolute panic and chaos within its ""walls"". Events snowball together into a massive avalanche that destroys everything that the people who created the society ever worked for. It is usually an enjoyable film to watch, and the endings are usually satisfying. The Maze Runner lacks a satisfying ending (It is random and senseless), but it is enjoyable to a certain, very small extent. It holds you by the tips of your toes, never gripping your eyes to the screen or pulling you to the edge of your seat. There is barely anything to make you want to keep watching.The Maze Runner is surprisingly dark. That is probably the best thing it has going for it. It is more gory and frightening than most teenage movies (although this may not be a good thing), and the helplessness of the whole situation is a feeling uncommon as well to these types of films.It is a reasonable film, bordering between good and bad. Me being me, I give it the benefit of the doubt.","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

There was never a dull moment in this mystery-driven movie. I enjoyed every second of it and I was hooked the moment it started. Could this be the next Resident Evil Franchise? I have very high hopes for this movie and believe that if done right, it has the potential to be one of the most successful movie franchises ever. Now I know four of 2014 movies are my most favorite: Edge of Tomorrow, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Need for Speed and The Maze Runner. Strongly recommended. Do not miss out on this one.","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

Special effects and the acting are really superb and the story is credible, even though there are some small flaws in the plot line. One of my personal favorites is the fact that the maze looks considerably older than the 3 years the cast has supposedly been imprisoned there. Blake Cooper who plays Chuck, really did an awesome job, with credible performances being logged by Dylan O'Brien, Aml Ammen, and Hi Hong Lee. This film is definitely designed for a sequel, but that's really not a big surprise, is it?Anyway, the wife and I really enjoyed it and we are looking forward to The Maze Runner 2! =D","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

In purgatory, there are two things present: the Kardashians and the movie Divergent. These insults to humanity exist on the bottom, most furthest realm regarding American cultural worth. Much higher on the spectrum we have Harry Potter and The Hobbit, which bored me to death due to banality and contrivance; though I appreciated the skill and casting that went into them They just weren't on the same plateau of The Lord of the Rings. And then there is the Hunger Games, a bit beneath Lord of the Rings, but nonetheless engaging, well made and most of all creative. Welcome to the genre known as the teenage Sci-Fi/Fantasy novel turned into existential film. On the one hand, teenage themes are endemic to the import of it all, and must be included in these kinds of films: First Loves, Bullies, Angst etc.—but the awesome films of the genre acknowledge the teen element while prioritizing the basic heart of the story, which is the mythological themes that are timeless among all cultures and time periods. They know the story is a backdrop for the unconscious energies at the guts of all human experience: death, isolation, meaninglessness and freedom. Percy Jackson, The Maze Runner isn't. The Maze Runner is on the level of Serenity, The Matrix and Firefly. You heard me right. This is the miracle I speak of. I fully expected Divergent (clearly, the worst movie ever made), but what I got was the diet cola of Raiders of the Lost Ark—s o don't get me wrong, I'm not saying The Maze is as good as Raiders, Firefly or Lord of the Rings. It isn't. I'm just saying it's at least in the same ballpark. Again, the miracle being the creative forces behind a book turned movie about teenagers satisfying all systems involved without succumbing to total CHEEZE: The producers who think only of marketing, the director who only thinks of his/her creative license, the cast who only think of their performance, all working together to understand and express the satisfaction of the perceived audience. In this light, within the constraints of money and profit, this is an awesome, awesome movie. Bravo. 9 stars. Except.why didn't the kids just build a wooden structure to get them to the top of the maze? They could have just ran to the edge.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's all about 'being chosen' and 'being special' which I think is very damaging to young children's personal development because that's not how life is. The white guy is the saviour of literally everyone. They all seem a bit too well adjusted for people who have been kidnapped, no insanity or OCD habits and ticks. As usual the monsters have this weird thing where they are extremely agile with lots of legs and extra tentacle-claws so theoretically they 'should' be able to catch and/or kill the people they're chasing fairly easily but movie logic ensures they can't. At least until the script requires it.Good points are that enough things happen to keep the viewer's attention and while it's not believable that there weren't more arguments, this actually made the film easier to watch because it's annoying when there is too much opposition. One bad guy is enough. The scary monsters were genuinely scary and I thought the twist(s) at the end were good.I'd watch a second film but this one is so unoriginal that I have to give it a 6.","27 out of 56 found this helpful.

Having never read any of James Dashner's books, I cannot tell with any certainty if the screenwriters were true to the novel, or if the book makes a better effort than the film to distinguish itself from the multitude of superior films it meekly attempts to imitate. What I know is that I left the theater laughing. And not in a good way.What should have been an exciting and visceral tale of survival and intrigue ended up stealing two hours of my life by conning me into thinking I would see something original. Instead of suspense and excitement, MAZE RUNNER laid out an entourage of familiar tropes, paper-thin characters, and contrived situations. The 'villainous' antagonist of the film was as one-dimensional and irrationally-plot serving as any character I've ever seen. The character was so silly and unbelievable I actually chuckled at him several times when the film begged me to be serious. The screenplay was a crash-course in heavy-handed exposition. It was jammed with stock lines: bland, insinuating lines that were supposed to put me on the edge of my seat but instead left me thinking, 'Okay, when are we going to get to the POINT of this movie?' We got to see the intimidating-jerk-who-doesn't-listen-to-reason character, the hardened-guy-who-will-later-be-reduced-to-a-weak-state-to-show-us how-shaken-up-the-best-of-us-can-get character, the arbitrary female (although, thankfully, fewer movies today are marginalizing women), the amnesiac/s, and the innocent-character-we-can-get-away-with-killing. The pacing of the film, if not the events, were completely predictable and the ending (which I came to the theater curious for in the first place) came off as stale and forced, like the rest of the ponderous placeholder scenes that served as a plot. If you've seen movies such as HUNGER GAMES, CABIN IN THE WOODS, or PANDORUM, you have already witnessed better characters, better reveals, and more assured examples of plot development.Hollywood has developed a very convenient formula to keep theaters full of impressionable teen audiences. We have an outsider who needs to find a part of the group to cling to. They meet a variety of similar sympathetic characters. They act impulsively, which is usually a good thing. They are almost always rebellious and independent by nature, but they need to avoid arousing the wrath of whatever all-powerful conglomerate is hell-bent on keeping them down. Until, of course, the time comes to overthrow them using the various talents that the group possesses. Along with a healthy dose of courage, resolve... and luck. Buckets of ludicrous, gratuitous, convenient, plot-serving luck.There is no reason that this film should have made the money it has. After six days, it has recouped its budget threefold. Every ticket you buy gives them more ammunition for a brain-numbing cookie-cutter sequel. I'm not saying the film is the worst I've ever seen. But for God's sake, we don't need any more movies like this. Here's to a better future.","296 out of 523 found this helpful.

He becomes fascinated by the immoral maze surrounding the village, eventually leading to him entering it against the warnings of the inhabitants of the village.Dylan O'Brien brings the character of Thomas to life and makes him likable. The other actors played their roles well.However, when Teresa appeared, the plot seemed to tumble downhill. Teresa does not contribute a great deal to the story. Plus considering the young men had been trapped together for years with not a single female in sight, they didn't seem to be that shocked when she showed up and I was expecting some of them to be throwing themselves on top of her. Additionally, the plot was predictable at times-everyone knew that Thomas would rebel and stride into the maze soon enough, and everyone knew that Thomas would be the one who ""changes the villagers' lives forever."" None-the-less, the story is interesting and the action was fast-paced as well as tense.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

He meets a handful of other young boys who also appear to have very little memory beyond than the lift. Thomas has to make a life living between the peaceful glade he finds himself in, and a maze which is full of cyborg ""Grievers"" who hunt anyone who goes into the maze. He learns that a new boy appears on the lift every couple of weeks - he isn't the first, and he wont be the last. It seems though that the maze is the only prospect of escape from the glade where they are trapped. As they start to get on with life everything is suddenly flipped on it's head when a young girl appears on the lift one day.Plenty of young stars who have been in a scattering of decent films already, and I'm sure they will be seen in other films too. This is a nice adventure film which often has bursts of high octane. Some questions are answered as the film advances, some are left covered up, building up for a definite sequel or two. Based on a book by James Dashner this is a decent film which will entertain and keep you hooked.Happy to give this 7 out 10. Hopefully the sequels are able to maintain the momentum in a time where teens vs adults/the world films seem to be in abundance.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Because of this I assumed the movie was going to be dull and only watched it to pacify a friend. After having watched it twice now I can say that I was very pleasantly surprised. I've been seeing other reviews stating that the movie wasn't that great so I'm not sure whether my great experience comes from knowing nothing about it or what; if so I would definitely recommend going that route when watching this. Granted, it's not a perfect movie. There are things that don't line up and not having read the books yet I'm not exactly sure what is plot holes and what is intentional but nevertheless I still really enjoyed it.This movie kept me glued to my seat the whole time. I had no idea what was going on or what the maze or grievers were and it left me hooked. Just as soon as the credits rolled everyone in the room looked around and was absolutely mind-blown. It was all we could talk about, to the point where we had to re-watch it with some more friends who had the same reaction as us. This movie gives you just enough to welcome you into the world and leave you craving more. Every single person I watched this with was researching where to get the books. It leaves you with so many questions (a good thing in my opinion) that you just have to go out and see what happens next. If I had to describe this in one word it would be ""Mindblown"". Absolutely amazing.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

After a brief glance over the plot I set my self to witness another Hunger Games movie but what I got was something more thrilling, gripping and a suspenseful experience. Being said that The Maze Runner is not a fresh approach to a plot or Sci Fi nature. And it is based on James Dashner's 2009 novel of the same name.There has being many mind boggling cinema on certain mazes (or traps true or imagery) and escaping from it including Cube (1997), Inception (2010) and Pans Labyrinth (2006) to name a few and each delivered a very powerful cinema experience. Standing against great movies like what I have mentioned earlier The Maze Runner is still has a long way to go being this is the first of a sequel of movies we are about to see in the coming years. But talking of this one alone it had done a pretty decent job. ­­­ Thomas our 16-year-old hero wakes up in a strange place without having any memory of his earlier life. He and another group of people who experienced the same are trapped in a glade surrounded by a giant concrete maze. Though finding the way out of the maze and getting back home sounds a good idea the maze comes with many lethal surprises. But it seems like Thomas has some answers and soon the gang realizes that he is different.For a dystopian sci fi thriller The Maze Runner has some gripping ground to start off with. And the movie steadily evolves within the first hour from nowhere to somewhere and the viewers get to feel the strange and mysterious presence of the maze. There is no scene that I can call as dragging or irrelevant thought they seems slow or not filled with enough action and suspense. But the movie quickly hit a phase of action and adventure and from there the game plan completely changes. What I really like about The Maze Runner is it's overall mood. As the viewer just like the people who are trapped in the maze are kept in dark so the same mysteries boggle in every ones minds. It's as if the viewers also has to find answers to the mysteries and we are left with no options but to try. And at times we are left to make tough choices.Equipped with strong acting and brilliant CG The Maze Runner is a movie that will keep the viewer engaged every second. And when it finished it opens up a whole lot of new questions while answering only few of the burning ones that was laid out at the start. I guess we have to wait another year to find out what happens next.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

Coming off the heels of hits like The Hunger Games and Divergent, The Maze Runner is the first story in the trilogy of novels by James Dashner. As such, I thought I would use this review space to compare this first film in the trilogy to another. The Maze Runner versus The Hunger Games (self-titled, not Catching Fire) sorry Divergent, I haven't seen you.DIRECTORS The Maze Runner's Wes Ball vs. The Hunger Games' Garry RossThe Maze Runner is Wes Balls first major motion picture, but you wouldn't know it because the visuals and pacing are fantastic.Garry Ross, on the other hand, directed both Pleasantville and Seabiscuit prior to The Hunger Games. Both great movies, however this slow thoughtful style I feel was not the best choice for the action-paced-with-thought story of the hunger games. Guess that's why he was replaced for Catching Fire, which is a superior film.Advantage: The Maze Runnerfor more, visit: http://sknr.net/2014/09/19/maze-runner/","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

You can't expect to see deep drama on screen when you chose a Movie such as this one.The Movie kept me on the edge. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen for even a second.

Maze Runner as I will call it really surprised me, I was expecting a sub-par action flick with annoying characters and teen drama, but to my surprise it had very little of that! It's a well acted and thrilling film with more upsides than down.Maze Runner itself if very reminiscent of Lord of the Flies, and just like the book, the characters are the main selling points. The characters are both beautifully written and acted, but the supporting characters are the real meat of the film. The characters make level-headed and surprisingly smart decisions, and when a struggle occurs it's not out of nowhere, you understand why the characters would make these decisions. But in my opinion, the best part of the film is the maze itself. The special effects and design of the maze is both beautiful and creative that disorientates you just as much as the characters.But, sadly this isn't a perfect film. The character of Thomas is under-developed and dry, the maze could have been utilized a bit more, and the character of Chuck is both annoying at times, and poorly acted. But honestly, it's still a really enjoyable film that has the potential to be a really great trilogy.","21 out of 43 found this helpful.

It has two sequels in its trilogy: ""The Scorch Trials"" and ""The Death Cure"". I haven't read the books yet, so I will just be judging the film as it is.The film starts with a boy who wakes up in a rapidly-rising elevator, which opened in a camp of teenage boys called the Glade. The boy eventually recalls that his name was Thomas, but nothing else from his past. being the main character, Thomas, of course, differed from the other boys. He was more curious about what lies beyond the Glade, and more determined to regain his freedom. The Glade was surrounded by a giant maze which the other boys had been trying to figure out for the three years that they have been there. However, the maze changes its configuration every night. Furthermore, there lives in the maze unseen deadly creatures called ""Grievers"". Why are these boys in the Glade? Will they ever get out of there? What does the arrival of a girl named Teresa in the Glade signify?The situation of the teenage boys trying to survive with each other in the Glade without any adult supervision is very much reminiscent of a much earlier young adult classic ""Lord of the Flies."" We also see here the usual ingredients in this genre: the enclosed arena, the stringent rules, the unknown outer limits, rebelling against establishment. This is one of those rare summer blockbuster films for which I did not know ANY of the actors by name. There may be familiar faces but they were not household names. The lead actor Dylan O'Brien does well in his role but it was really outstanding in any remarkable way. I was glad to see an Asian actor Ki Hong Lee in a major role as the original runner Minho. I just don't know if his book character was as non-proactive as it was portrayed on screen. I have to say though that the action sequences were done quite well. The running within the maze scenes were quite exciting and very entertaining to watch. For all the tension built up in the film though, the hanging ending could be quite a disappointment. Nothing really gets explained clearly. While this one will feel like an incomplete film, it makes the sequels must-sees for those who are interested enough to see the story through. However, honestly, after the excellence of the film version of ""The Hunger Games"", with a big star Jennifer Lawrence in the lead, all of these similar genre films that followed its lead already pale in comparison. For me, ""The Maze Runner"" just felt like another young adult dystopian film too many.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

It' a journey to discover what's all about, because, you, as the spectator, know as much as the characters. Everything is unknown, but it has a shocking and unexpected end.In this movie, we see the fight of a bunch of kids trying to survive and to the purpose of the labyrinth they're living in. They organize as any good civilization could do, they establish rules and track the maze in order to get a way out. The Maze Runner tries to be as good as science-fiction stories, like The Cube, The Hypercube and Lost, but instead we have a ""Hunger- Games-ish"" ending. This is not a spoiler, but at the end you'll agree with me. Although The Maze Runner didn't disappoint me, I thought the movie could be a lot better, because there are certain things that diminish the importance of the actions in the plot: the tiny an uncomfortable laughs; and it looks like a Disney movie, but it has really aggressive moments.In the end, the film is OK, just one of the bunch. Maybe if it had other director, one that can impose the sense of darkness and unknown, the Maze Runner could have a serious recognition.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Maze Runner tells the story of Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, who wakes up in a giant crate with no memory of his passed. He is taken to ""The Glade,"" a place full of boys who were taken and had their memories erased as well. Thomas soon learns that they are trapped in a giant maze, and once you're stuck inside, you never make it out alive. Everything begins to change when a girl is brought to the Glade and so Thomas decides it is time to face the maze and find the whole truth about the people who placed them there. But the truth they find might be even more horrible than the maze itself.I absolutely love this film. It is so intense and visually stunning. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made my heart race through the entire the film. Every time Thomas is inside the maze, I felt as if I was there with him, running for my life. But this isn't just an adrenaline packed adventure. The Maze Runner also moved me to tears and made me think about the way we can work together when we are truly faced with a challenge. The visuals are incredible as well. The maze is so complex and ever changing and it's so cool to be able to ""explore"" it in a sense and see all of the detail put into the CGI. The entire cast is incredible. All the characters are so unique and have their own personality and quirks, but they work together in such a seamless way. My favorite character is Thomas played by Dylan O'Brien. He is the main character in this film and really makes the whole thing come to life. The boys that live in the Glade have been there for three years and, of course, they have tried to find a way out. But, most of them have essentially decided that they will live out the rest of their days there. When Thomas shows up, he tests the system and refuses to accept his fate of being stuck in the maze. I admire his character because he thinks outside of the box and finds his own way. He looks past his fear and is a strong leader despite the doubts people may have in him.It's been very interesting seeing the theme of films that have been coming out recently. Hunger Games, Divergent, Enders Game, The Giver and now The Maze Runner all have something in common. They tell the story of young adults, children really, who have to group together and take on some very serious situations, sometimes things even adults can't handle. It shows youth questioning authority, standing up for what's right and making their own way. These strong themes send out a message of empowerment to the youth of our generation, but this can also be a bit overwhelming. I know it's difficult watching adults fight for their lives, kill and be killed, and have their worlds torn apart. But it's even more shocking to see children go through these trials.Because of this, I recommend The Maze Runner for ages 13+ because of the intense situations and violence. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made me hold my breath during the intense situations, and I love when a film gets me so involved, but that may be too much for some to handle. I give The Maze Runner 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait to see it again. Catch it in theaters near you now!Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The actual maze looks fantastic and because we are oblivious to what is lurking inside it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Combining high action and suspense with a very solid mystery theme to it, The Maze Runner managed to capture my attention and although it threatens to lose its steam towards the end, the movie never lost me, which is something I wasn't expecting.""Lost"" ""Lord of the Flies"" and many monster movies of the past, are elements that The Maze Runner takes on, and delivers in a very memorable experience!

Welcome to the Summer block buster of this season and every season for the last decade served with a side of explosions and a cake with not enough layers on it.In a society governed by people whose objective seems logical on a broader scale yet not ethical. But often there is something more selfish behind the what appears to be logical solutions where humans are treated as guinea pigs and the hero questions if the one live sacrificed (usually his love interest) is worth all that and usually ends up saving the girl friend and the world welcome to every dystopia film focused on an teenage audience who wants more something more than the traditional romance or the action flick. Something and I quote 'deeper' , hello call me a sci-fi nerd if you like because I saw all of the 100 million dollar budget sci-fi's with the pretty girl next door persona girls would you guess where oh yes the iMax.It reminds me of a scene from Black BooksBernard: You're going on holiday. You want trash. But you want different kinds of trash. (To female customer) You're a woman, you want social themes, believable characters. (To male customer) You, you want plots, suspense. This'll do you both. Female customer: Hmm... Bernard: (holds up another copy of the book) There's this temp, right? She's 29, she can't get a boyfriend, oh my god. Female customer: Sounds great! Male customer: No, no way. Bernard: And she's got 12 hours to stop nuclear war with China. Male customer: Great.This film is all that is written above and some things more. What I do like about the film is that it has less of a romance that you would expect from others of the same genre which makes it a bit better. Everything else is pretty much the same the chosen one who goes against the rules, breaks them and succeeds. Isn't popular with the older leaders but everyone loves them, because well he is giving them more than the typical good life that they were used to before. Now its exciting there is hope, drama and dead bodies.This group of young adults is stuck in a maze. Where they are there is food, shelter and all you need to survive but they are stuck in a maze run by they don't know who. Are they alien? Are they scientists? Does the world exist as they knew it who knows. Anyways so the maze opens its doors everyday and closes them at night if you don't make it by the night, you're dead what kills you is a mystery.There are different classes, the runners are the Alpha who run the maze memorize it and perhaps find a way out one day. In comes our rebel hero, sacrificing, charming, fast and all. The rest is no mystery.There are some twists and turns and yes they do leave that Chuky is still alive moment at the end. Since its not in cinemas anymore , you can watch it with some folks over if you want to test out the new big speaker that you just acquired.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

There's nothing wrong with this movie and I can't wait for the second to see what happens next.....just because you don't get something doesn't mean it's bad grow up and stop preventing others from seeing something that's good. That's why it got a 7 score. I watch countless movies including ones with ""real story lines"" and I can say that this doesn't disappoint at all in that section. I can't see the second one being as good or any better but I would still like to see what happens.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

The doors open to a grassy plane - The Glade - where he is surrounded by a group of mocking boys. We soon learn that they remember nothing of their past lives, except that they are all trapped here, surrounded by a gigantic labyrinth which they must navigate to (hopefully) find freedom. It's certainly an intriguing plot.Having never read the book, I didn't really know what to expect. And to that end, the mystery kept me interested throughout. However, I can't say that I felt much for any of the characters. Perhaps those who have read the book will feel differently, but there just didn't seem to be much depth to them. Even the lone girl in the movie seemed to be mostly a useless character, adding very little to the plot.I'd heard many compare it to The Hunger Games, which definitely shares many of the same elements. Both are fun movies, but the main fault of The Maze Runner is with the payoff at the end. Why are these boys trapped? By whom? You'll get answers, for sure, but I felt like they didn't make a whole lot of sense.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

(this is actually for those whiners who didn't have a clue) Besides I think that those changes makes the maze and the Grievers (a bio-mechanic monster) much more dangerous.Main Casts was actually great for me.

Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) though was new to me, I've heard that his from Teen Wolf which I don't watch, but I was actually surprise with his acting performance in this film, it actually pretty good. Another newcomer is Ki-Hong Lee plays Minho which until now I don't know whose famous scientist he was named from. The movie experience as a whole was incredible, it was heart- pumping and wicked!

See ""Cube"" (1997) for a much better treatment of the ""Strangers trapped together and they don't know why."" theme. Maze also follows the approach that viewer learns more along with the characters - which works pretty well for most of the film.The visual effects were well done throughout and the design of look and feel of the maze creatures was very well done. Unfortunately while the story starts out strong, the plot pretty much falls apart at the end, with a lot of things happening that don't seem to make a great deal of sense, and then they throw in a big hook for the sequel. Generally the acting is pretty good, other than the over the top stuff by the fellow playing Gally. Perhaps he was just upset because his character was badly written, but whether it was the acting or the way the character was written it doesn't work.I have not read the books on which Maze is based so there a number of unexplained or poorly explained plot points especially toward the end that I didn't get. Some folks have suggested that one ought to read the book to really get what's going on - I'm not going to do that, the screenwriter's job is to explain them or leave it out, and this movie wasn't good enough to sell me on the books.I think the most disappointing aspect of The Maze Runner is that I have the distinct impression it could have been a lot better if they had spent more time on adapting the story.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is dripping with teen angst and rebellion - you know? ""I can go in the maze if I wanna!

It undoubtedly helped that I'd thus already been initiated into the whole bleak post- apocalyptic vision-thing as yet again the focus is on a group of youngsters forced to deal with a seemingly no-win scenario imposed on them by adults which sees them out in the wilds confronted this time by a monster-maze which offers their only escape although it comes, naturally with its patrolling nightmarish killer-creatures the Grievers to provide the expected SFX fight sequences.Unlike ""The Hunger Games"" where the plot exposition is made clear from the start, the twist here is that the viewer is thrown into the middle of the action just like the initially amnesiac kids with the purpose of their task only explained at the very end, just handily in time to trail the inevitable part two (Erin tells me there are four books in the series so I'm guessing quadrilogy here).I understand the movie was pitched by its producers as ""Lord Of The Flies"" meets ""Lost"" which neatly sums up the plot. The young actors playing the leads are all unknown to me which I think helps with the credibility of the narrative. To me it seemed as if the delayed entrance of the young girl to the group seemed more like a device to broaden the movie's appeal across the sexes (there were no girls in ""Lord Of The Flies"") but even after she arrives she doesn't seem to contribute much but maybe she gets her ""Catniss"" awakening further down the line.I was perhaps most impressed with the maze structure itself, a massive hulking monumental construct full of dark foreboding and the child in me was naturally pleased when the gang finally got to the end, although not before the rather predictable leadership conflict in the group and various scrapes and scares with the marauding Grievers.Relatively unsentimental, action-packed and with just enough depth of character throughout, I again found myself quite happily sitting through another film I'd not normally have opted into. Whether I ever watch any others in the series will probably depend on my future availability as a ""baby-sitter"", although on the strength of this I might just volunteer my services when the opportunity arises.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

A bunch of teen boys awake without memory to find themselves prisoners in a small glade surrounded by gigantic walls. Beyond the walls lies a maze, and when the doors to the maze close at night, monsters come out of the wall to kill anyone who has remained in the maze. The boys believe there may be an escape in the maze, but are unable to find it as they search throughout the day. When a new kid (Dylan O'Brien) arrives, he is a bit braver than the rest and enters the maze at night, which ends up changing all the rules of the boys' society. This movie offers a bit of fun and excitement, for sure. There are more questions raised than answered, and there seem to me to be some fairly big plot holes. The characters aren't particularly well developed, and, as it moves towards its conclusion (as much as it has one - of course it's a series of novels), it kind of reveals itself to be much closer to The Hunger Games than you might have originally thought. But I did enjoy myself, and I'd recommend it if you like these kinds of movies. It'll play well enough on video.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, here it it and I've seen all I needed. The Maze Runner is adaptation of James Dashner's post apocalyptic bestseller about youngsters, who are imprisoned inside the mysterious maze and their struggle of living together, while trying to escape this nightmare. Movie opens with Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in the cage, that moves pretty fast upwards, right into iron doors. He is confused, he remembers nothing and does not understand how he got in here. When the cage reaches top, it suddenly stops and then he sees a very bright light and some young boys staring at him. Now, he is even more confused.If you are not a book reader, like me, you can be also confused, even though trailer told most of it. But not that much to lose interest how it goes. Because, you know, most of movie in this genre are well predictable stories, just with actors who we are delighted to see on a big screen and some sentiments also. As the plot starts to open up, Thomas starts remembering some small details, it get more interesting. Later, The Maze Runner also suggest whole load of action, chasing and good fantasy. Without going into the deep of story, it has pretty much predictable ending. I've never read the book, but I was absolutely sure where it would go. But here, let me explain things I liked.First of all, it's entertaining. Whatever we say, how stupid and ""yeah-I've-seen-this-before"" type movie it is, TMR makes us have fun, from Dylan O'Brien's abs (still, too much shirts) to well shot action scenes. There is nothing outrageously illogical, or stupid in this film, it just follows some well known plots of Animal Farm (George Orwell) and Cube. First is similar because it shows how people behave when they are locked up on their own, how they need to have a leader and other psychological. But film does not go too deep into Orwell's issues. It reminded me Cube because of idea, that there are some people out there who lock up absolute strangers in dangerous environment and then ""watch"" them suffering. Maybe the idea here is a little different, but the 90's classic still kept popping out in my mind.I liked the cast. Leaving alone my favorite Dylan, who I'll talk about later, it was nice to see some recognizable faces like Thomas Brodie-Sangster of Game of Thrones, Will Poulter of We're the Millers and Narnia. Both were definitely good and especially Poulter who played an conservative leader who more focused on staying there alive than going out of the maze. He had some good moments of anger and his eyebrows perfectly coped with it.Technically, movie was well done and paced. It kept motion and action all the time, especially in the second half of film. The Maze scenes were well shot, with some massive production design. Editing worked for me too, it's not masterful, but good enough to enjoy the almost two hour movie.What I did not get is the aliens, these boys were hiding from. In fact, they were robots, but hell looked like intruders from Alien. But in post apocalyptic world, everything is possible.Dylan O'Brien is good in here. He has not done anything other actor of the same appearance would not have done, but he was good. Right in the character. Basically, he was the reason I could not wait for the Maze Runner and as long as I had enough of him, I'm satisfied.All in all, The Maze Runner is good ""let's go, see and forget"" movie, that fails to deliver something very important or new, but definitely keeps you interested in future installments.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He has been sent via the mysterious ""box"" into a contained colony of boys called ""the glade"". Nobody knows why they are there, only that they cannot leave. Around the glade lies the maze where only the fastest and bravest among them, dubbed ""maze runners"", get to explore in the hopes of finding a way out. Thomas' arrival causes a schism among the boys and strange incidents start happening one after the other. As the perfect peaceful society of the Glade is slowly torn asunder, Thomas must unravel the secrets of the maze and confront the horrors within. Secrets, half-truths, and a sense that all is not what it seems. I have always loved a good sci if mystery. Our premise of a community of male teens isolated from the world is a premise many would be familiar with. The group rivalries, the competition for alpha male status, the unique lifestyle and forms of punishment; MAZE RUNNER takes advantage of its slow moving first half to build that world of lost boys. All the while, the constant mystery of the maze lingers. And just when things start to wind down, the writers throw more surprises into the mix which give the film a much needed sense of urgency. What are these surprises? No spoilers now. But rest assured, this movie has great pacing.MAZE RUNNER is how I always imagined a gritty blockbuster movie would look based on those printed mazes in activity books we used to trace with crayons when we were kids. The maze itself is marvelously designed, oozing with a sense of dread. The ominous walls combines an ancient monolithic look with pieces of worn out future tech peeking out the corners; just enough to give this uneasy sense of that something is not quite right. Couple all that with some truly spine chilling sound effects and the movie starts to cross into horror territory. It is to mazes kind of like what they did to a simple board game called Battleship. Unlike the battleship movie, MAZE RUNNER gives us some well rounded characters with believable motives and decent development. Yes you have some clichéd stereotypes in the benevolent but status quo upholding leader, the hot headed ""warrior chief"" alpha male edging for a fight, the conflicted second in command, and an adorable sidekick for the main character. Yet it is this sense of familiarity with the character archetypes and the isolated single gender community setting that let's one ease into the story without being alienated by the already alienating premise.Amazing as the movie is, MAZE RUNNER is not without some flaws. Main character Thomas suffers from the typical designated hero syndrome. He is not a kid who earns his heroism or the respect of the group. From the get go, everything important revolves around him, he is able to do startling things that no one else can. You know he is special and the plot does not hide that or let it develop naturally. Director Wes Ball crafts a decently paced narrative with top notch special effects, but the visuals tend to be marred by his obsession with out of focus shaky cameras in action scenes. Perhaps the biggest misstep is some poorly placed flashbacks that could have completely ruined the mystery element for audiences familiar with certain video games (hint: Portal). I admit to not having read the original book so I would not know how close it is to the source material. On its own, MAZE RUNNER is The grandchild of LORD OF THE FLIES and TV's LOST. It combines tried and true story beats sieved through an intriguing premise and a decent mystery (despite being almost undone by the ill advised flashbacks). It avoids many mistakes other adaptations of young adult novels make, like lingering on romance subplots, and leaves a decent sequel hook that leaves you wanting more.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","I've got the Conch now Piggy!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3096959/?ref_=tt_urv","Drive-in_Zeppelin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32428302/?ref_=tt_urv","2 October 2014","I had heard a lot of hype about The Maze Runner (2014), which is the latest young adult series to be adapted for the big screen, so naturally I was expecting the worst. The worst being something similar to Twilight or Divergent and more than likely including gratuitous amounts of scenes where the predominantly twenty- something-year-old male cast would be shirtless. I will not say that The Maze Runner was a landmark science fiction film or even in the top echelon of action-suspense films, but it was thoroughly entertaining. There is obviously a lot that was borrowed and clichéd about the film, but it didn't disappoint. To dumb the premise down to a young adult level, basically a group of 'teenage' boys wake up with no memory in a Central-Park-like grove that is surrounded by a giant maze. Naturally this Lord of the Flies-esque society wants to find a way out, but have managed in the meantime to create a harmonious society without killing their own version of Piggy. Long story short, the 'Neo' character of the story arrives to throw things into disarray because he wants to go run the maze and speed up their exit from the grove. Like I said, it's not the best plot in the world, but the inclusion of giant metal spider-like things definitely increases the tension. Directed by Wes ball, the movie stars mostly people you've probably never heard of and that kid from Love Actually, Thomas Brodie- Sangster. The film's protagonist who I was actually pleasantly surprised with is Mr. Dylan O'Brien, apparently known for taking his shirt off and being 'eye candy' for tweenage girls. Sorry ladies, there are no washboard abs featured in this movie, better stick with Magic Mike. Either way, I thought he actually did a pretty good job as Thomas. Though having never read the book, I can't speak one way or the other about what that should entail. All I can say is that, as the protagonist, I probably would have followed him to my almost certain death. In fact I couldn't help but thinking throughout the entire movie that if he hulked up a bit, he would make an excellent Commander Shepard if a Mass Effect adaptation were ever possible. At any rate that's essentially the movie. Some kids run around a maze trying to avoid spiders and find a way out. I was initially worried, though also intrigued, by how the story began to develop, as it paralleled the basic premise of Dark City (1998), what with the waking up with no memory and trying to figure things out in a place that's constantly changing gimmick. I actually read a number of reviews heralding The Maze Runner as a beautiful crossover between Dark City and Lord of the Flies. That gave me a good chuckle, but I have to dash your hopes at such a crossover as this story isn't remotely as engaging as watching John Murdoch elude the Strangers. The Bottom Line: It's on the good side of the Hunger Games – Divergent spectrum though it's an outlandishly silly premise. The visuals and acting are decent, the action engrossing, and you'll feel fairly entertained until the obligatory cliffhanger since its a series. Then if you're over the age of 16 you'll be faced with the dilemma of either buying a young adult book, or simply waiting at least a year to find out what happens next. My prediction would be to not get your hopes up and simply forget about the series until the next movie comes out. Repeat as needed for additional sequels.Read this and other reviews on DriveInZeppelin's website","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

An intriguing story, maze runner, is full of surprises. Great moments of action with a good story which is diminished through the characters.

As engaging of a concept this sounds, the execution is what mostly led it to having problems. The story itself is mostly predictable by mostly having simple and meta dialogue and some of the characters are pretty weak. Not to mention that it feels like it's made for a franchise.With those portions out of the way, let's get into the good things. The pacing is kept relatively quick for the action to be the center of attention, the visual effects and color scheme are amazing, the action scenes can keep this movie highly engaging, a lot of the characters have potential, the actors in this movie all did a great job, and it does present a lot of potential to be a possible Hunger Games challenger if such a thing is possible.If you like Teen Wolf and other teen flicks, this should be worth a watch. I'd even say this is for boys based on how they'll be turned on by the emphasis on tension and less cheezy romance. 7/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well directed action sequences and good special effects.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9161062/?ref_=tt_urv","fciocca","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62460576/?ref_=tt_urv","2 July 2023","""The Maze Runner"" is a decent action-adventure movie that got me intrigued. Thomas wakes up in a big glade and he does not have any memory. He will meet a group of teenage boys and they will try to escape the big maze just outside the big field. The director does a good job in keeping the mystery of who is behind this big construction, by revealing the truth only at the very end. Visual effects look really nice and they aged pretty well, considering that this film was released almost ten years ago. The Grievers design is amazing, I liked these giant spiders with mechanical parts. The fighting scenes are dynamic, engaging and at times pretty brutal. Wes Ball with his experience as a visual effect artist nailed the aesthetic part of the film. Unfortunately, it felt overly long. I get that screenwriters wanted to focus on the society that these teenagers managed to build from scratch, but I feel that there are many interactions that are completely pointless. They should have cut some scenes by bringing the length closer to one hour and a half. I think that there would be a less dispersive narration.The acting is mixed: I liked the performance of Will Poulter that portrayed wonderfully the part of the antihero, sabotaging every attempt of getting out of the maze. Dylan O' Brien here did not have much acting skills. He cannot display emotions very well. He is the umpteenth pretty face in a movie for teenagers, however he was good enough for the purposes of this film. Kaya Scodelario and Ki Hong Lee were completely inexpressive and they lacked any kind of emotion. Thankfully they did not have much screen time, but I am kinda worried that I eventually need to endure them more in the sequels. I spent a couple of enjoyable hours with this film and I suggest it to all the people that love the adventure genre. My final mark is 6.3 stars out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sure it's a bit generic and the latter books aren't as good, but these are just really fun and exciting reads overall. I was hopeful that this could match the quality of the book, and whilst it didn't quite get there it was still a good adaptation. Now again, the basic story is quite derivative of other YA films such as The Hunger Games/Divergent etc, as are a lot of the characters. There's definitely a formula for these films, but I tend to enjoy the products of the formula (Divergent Franchise is the exception) so I don't mind that. I also think Gally is way too annoying/over the top here compared to the book, and that some of the action is a bit too choppy.But I think it's just stories like these that intrigue me. Seeing people in these survival situations trying to find a way out is really enjoyable to me, and this is no different. The performances are solid, the effects are pretty good and I really liked the score for this one. The action is a bit too choppy, but it's still fun to watch. The ending dragged a touch, but I mostly really like it, and think it answered enough questions that I had but also left enough questions open for the sequel. I am kind of worried that the next two installments will be weaker, given that none of the books topped this one. But overall, this was fun, and I hope that the next two films are as enjoyable as this one.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main character Thomas was your cliché all-American teen lead. Sometimes I wish they'd just let a normal looking person be the hero.

As you probably guessed, the movie is about a maze. The movie starts off pretty intense. You are immediately thrust into the impending situation. It bodes well for the flow of the movie because you are experiencing everything as the main character, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), experiences it.The movie moves along at a nice pace and there was one particularly refreshing aspect. Most movies featuring a number of boys and teens have the typical issues: alpha male, the click, the outcasts, the new guy, et al. In this movie you saw these young men making a concerted effort to work together and put their egos to the side in order to survive. Thomas broke up the structure they had to some degree, but it wasn't without good cause.I liked the movie. It had a nice balance of intensity and mystery. The actors, and more importantly, the characters, were bearable. Not very often you see something like that.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He is well accompanied by a largely British cast to be with him in the three entries, and most of the secondary cast spent the week before production taking part in a survival training in the glade , such as : Kaya Scodelario, Ki Hong Lee, Will Poulter , Thomas Brodie-Sangster , Joe Adler , Aml Ameen , Blake Cooper, Dexter Darden , and special mention mention for the veteran Patricia Clarkson in a fundamental role as Ava Paige.The picture has a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Enrique Chediak. And a thrilling and rousing musical score by John Paesano. The flick was well directed by Wes Ball , who also made the sequels : Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015) and Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018) . Wes Ball originally met with 20th Century Fox Studios to shoot a feature length version of his short film 'Ruin' , but then they offered him the chance to direct this 'The Maze Runner' and he accepted with a budget 4 million and shot in just 44 days . Wes Ball is a good professional director who has got a big success with this fantastic trilogy . Rating : 6.5/10. Well worth watching.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's one of those increasingly rare movies that make excellent use of such quaint amenities as setting and atmosphere to instill a real sense of panic, courage, determination, and fear in even the most disaffected teenager. It's tightly paced, with few logical inconsistencies to nitpick, too.It all begins when Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find himself in a rapidly ascending elevator stocked with what appear to be provisions of some kind. When the elevator stops and the top is opened, he discovers that he's the latest arrival in an all-boys community that's at the center of a giant, ever-changing, complex stone maze. The boys, some of whom have been there for a long time, have established a pacifistic community that relies on those monthly provisions and their own hard work (building shelters, low-level farming) to survive.But that maze. It's enormous and inscrutable. There are specialists, called Runners, who enter the maze each morning in order to map it and to try to find a way out. But if they don't return by dusk, the maze's stone doors will close, leaving the hapless teens inside for the night. And no one has ever spent a night in the maze and survived.This is the ominous, bleak scenario with which young Thomas is presented. Alby (Aml Ameen), the leader of the crew, explains that there are only three rules in The Glade, that happy little faux-Paradise in which they all live: do your part, don't hurt another Glade resident, and don't feed them after midnight. Wait, sorry, that last one is from Gremlins. I meant that Gladers (uh huh) are forbidden to go into the maze. Well, unless they happen to be Runners.So, once a month they get new supplies and a new young dude. But once Thomas arrives, things start to be a little different in the Glade. A runner is stung by a Griever (they're nasty robotic creatures who lurk in the maze) in broad daylight. Stings aren't good - they incapacitate the stung person and imbue them with violent tendencies. As such, he who has been stung is necessarily banished from The Glade, for the safety of the rest of the clan.Thomas isn't like everyone else, as the somewhat-hotheaded Gally (Will Poulter, Chronicles of Narnia: The Dawn Treader) is quick to point out. Gally notices that things seem a little off since Thomas's arrival, and he blames the greenie for disrupting what felt like a little slice of heaven. But on Thomas's side are Alby, Alby's second in command Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and the most-recent new blood, a young boy named Chuck (Blake Cooper), who looks a lot like Chunk from The Goonies.Something has changed with Thomas's arrival; it seems that whoever or whatever is behind the maze's creation is changing the rules. For one thing, an unscheduled arrival of the elevator yields a new member for the group: a girl. The first one, in fact. It's Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), who appears to know Thomas from before their time in The Glade. Both Thomas and Theresa have dreams regarding their ""before time"" - again, unlike the others.Thomas is acutely aware that the existence of the group in The Glade is not necessarily permanent, as evidenced by the attacking Grievers and the various infighting of the Gladers. Thomas wishes to find out more, and Gally simply doesn't, content to keep things as they are. This is the crux of the movie's moral issue - is it better to keep what one has, even if one has little and under repressive conditions, or to strive to escape those conditions on the hope of finding a better life elsewhere? Leaving aside the morality of having teenagers battle robot-animal hybrids (goodness knows we've seen plenty of movies about kids killing enemies or each other lately), the eternal question of why the boys and Teresa are even in The Glade lingers over them all. It's just that Gally and his small band of followers don't want to know the answer, and Thomas and his desperately do.The action is fierce and creative. Even the battles with various Grievers are well shot (sometimes tough to do with robots, because with so much activity it can be difficult to discern what's what and who's who, particularly in a low-light setting), and the maze is something to behold - a real work of art, were it real. The acting is better than might be expected for a young-adult film, and O'Brien, Brodie-Sangster, and Poulter are each well cast.It's obvious that The Maze Runner is intended to be a franchise - if it enjoys box-office success, of course. If this turns out to be another Golden Compass, then this may be the only Maze Runner movie we see. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of dangling plot lines at the end. Even so, the movie is exciting and persuasive and doesn't try to dumb itself down for the sake of its audience.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The main characters perform a lot of questionable actions and decisions, the film is full of suspense clichés (Person 1: ""What's that"", Person 2: ""you'll see"") and the dialogue is cringe worthy. However, we can let the poor acting slide since the actors were all just teenagers. Plus, this dystopian film was amazing to watch while high.Dystopian movies are amazing to watch stoned because of all the new social concepts introduced into the film, in the case of 'The Maze Runner, a sense of leadership and societal roles had been formed by some of the earlier members to maintain order and control that allows for everyone to coexists and work together. Success of this governing model is most likely attributed to each person's fear of their unpredictable world. It's like being in a video game where you're playing as the main character, Thomas. The goal of the game is to escape the maze which sounds like a typical video game. Except in this game, Thomas is in control and there are monsters lurking within the escape route which feels like a real-life version of Temple Run. With the maze changing and characters constantly escaping by a hair, you're left with suspense as you explore the unknown parts of the maze.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Maze Runner is about a boy named Thomas who one day finds himself trapped in the center of wall in a small society surrounded by a maze made up of other boys. None of them remember their past, only their name, and when Thomas shows up he is determined to find a way out of the maze.I was really excited for this movie, the trailer was great, the cast was pretty good, and although I hadn't read the book I heard it was fantastic. I can tell you that the first 45 minutes of this movie are enthralling, suspenseful, and overall really, really impressive. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie isn't all that great. The first half of the movie leaves the audience excited and begging for answers to all the unknowns the brought up, but the problem is the answers aren't satisfying. I won't spoil anything, but the reason the boys are in the maze literally left me in awe at how ridiculous the reason was. And that's not the only answer that left me thinking,""Are you joking me right now?"". Now, the reason I said that anyone who read and liked the book should watch the movie is because they already know the answers to the questions in the movie, and they're already satisfied with those answers. Still, anyone who hasn't read the book might be, and in fact probably will be, pretty let down. The only other negative thing I have to say about the movie is the rushed and sloppy ending. The final events occur so quickly that there really isn't any time for the viewer to soak in what's happening. Despite my complaints The Maze Runner isn't a bad movie. Like I said the first half is absolutely amazing. In fact the first half of the movie is so good it might be worth watching just for that alone. And let me add that on top of the impeccable first half every actor does a fantastic job. The action scenes are well shot and suspenseful, and the fantastic score only adds to the excitement. And let me say the CGI maze as well as the grievers look fantastic! The Maze Runner definitely has it's problems, but the good portions of the movie are so good that I might consider it worth going and seeing in theaters. Thanks for reading! I hope this review was helpful!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

He has amnesia and surrounded by other kids. He remembers his name later but nothing else. A new boy arrives every 30 days with supplies. It's been 3 years since the first one. The forested field is surrounded by a giant maze. They sent out Runners to map out the maze and set up rules to only allow Runners into the maze. There are deadly Grievers in the maze during the night when the doors are closed. Thomas keeps disobeying the rules and run into the maze. He kills one of the Grievers and makes some discoveries. Then the only girl Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives on the elevator with a note ""Shes the last one EVER"".This is better than many of the new YA movies. Why? The first thing I noticed is that the movie doesn't open with a lot of explaining the dystopian world. I like it. The characters are just as clueless as the audience. We are essentially discovering the world together and I usually hate the homework these movies impose on us every time.The acting is pretty good led by Dylan O'Brien. The kids' society is a little bit of Lord of the Flies. I like most of the kids. The maze is good although I couldn't really figure out this place. It felt like there are some miscalculations about this dystopia. Something isn't adding up. When the final message happened, that didn't make sense either. And then there is the reveal which simply put a big question mark on everything. I haven't read the books. I'm willing to wait for the sequel to pass judgment on whether this all adds up. So it's a 7 for now, but if the sequel doesn't make better sense of this world, the rating may have to go down.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We then see a young man in a fearful state as he cautiously observes a metal cage he is in, which is being thrust upward. He emerges from the cage onto land, filled with other boys. He is in a complete state of hysteria and is unsure of where he is or what is happening. He cannot even remember his own name. This atmosphere sets the suspense caliber high for the film, right from the start, and this tension is felt prominently as the plot progresses. (Unless you've read the book.) If any of your friends or family members were rushing to see The Maze Runner, it is likely they are devout fans of the young adult novels by James Dashner, who has completed two sequels and one prequel in the Maze Runner Series. As expected, the theaters have been filled with his literary fan base and the intrigued gapers of the film's trailers and TV spots (include me here).Not knowing what to expect is what makes The Maze Runner such a deliriously exciting movie- going experience. For the book-readers, it is a chance to see the book come to life in an entirely vivid way. The film is an agitating mindbender, and it is one that gives clues very rarely. Here is what is known: A large group of boys have been surviving on a circular land, surrounded by immense gray walls. There is no form of escape. The boys call the land The Glade, and there is a mysterious maze that lies in the center of the land. Our protagonist learns the rules and manners of The Glade while inquiring greatly about entering the maze. This eventually escalates to a physical dispute with a boy named Gally, who does not believe he should be promoted to the highly selective team of maze runners who explore the maze. It is then that our protagonist remembers his name as his head hits the floor during the fight—Thomas. His name is Thomas, and all of his memories are gone, as are those of the other boys. The only memory they are allowed to keep is their names. Who is doing this to them?Maze Runner is much more dense than simply ""who."" It is also a film about hierarchy in an area with what appears to be supernatural behavior. There are numerous plot twists and character backgrounds that eventually come into light, creating a complete piece of intellectually stimulating and action-packed cinema. Yes, the film has its faults. The dialog, at times, is quite atrocious. The lines may be worded horridly or too simple-mindedly, throwing the flow of the film off-balance. But that gets into the script blaming, then book blaming, and that is a literary road leading nowhere—because regardless, it is a fantastic film.The Maze Runner is an enchantingly grim tale of deceit, rebellion, and power. This is largely thanks to the execution of its artistic and profoundly imaginative style, with brilliantly action- packed sequences starring Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, and an eclectic cast of testosterone- pumped young men. There is a sci-fi element in The Maze Runner as well, adding an entire dimension of lunacy and suspense to its already dystopian ambiance. It is a film that must be deciphered in terms of its supernatural aspects, sequential aspects, secretive aspects, and— okay, no more possible spoilers. Regardless of its faults, The Maze Runner is an impressive genre-bender that keeps you hooked from Thomas's first gasp in the dark at the film's beginning to its climactic and perilous finale.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A great suspenseful and thrilling first and second act, but a disappointing third act revelation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3087824/?ref_=tt_urv","YJLcool","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34627686/?ref_=tt_urv","17 September 2014","The Maze Runner is another Young-Adult book-to-film adaptation that offers a great deal of suspense, mystery and excitement with many lives are at stake. The film asks us which is the better choice – choosing to stay in our own personal comfort zone where we feel safe or we brave enough to take a leap of faith to face the unknown and search for a better path. It essentially encourages us to dare to be different in a world that wants us to conform...we should continue to expand and push ourselves to do more. Without knowing anything about the book, The Maze Runner does feels familiar in some ways and it gives the feeling that we have all seen this before (very similar to The Hunger Games, Divergent or The Giver).Based on the novel of the same name by James Dashner, The Maze Runner is about a group of young teenagers or kids who are trapped in a place called The Glade, the center of a giant maze, without any memories of their previous lives. Every month, each and every one of them wakes up in a caged elevator that comes with supplies. Some of them have been there for years and they've set up some ground rules that everyone must abide in order to live harmoniously and co-exist peacefully together. The Glade is surrounded by huge walls that only has one opening that leads to the giant maze and it closes every night. In order to escape, they send out runners to explore the maze in order to find a way out. However, there are mysterious, dangerous creatures called the ""Grievers"" that come out at night to hunt for food and the runners must ensure that they're back before the maze closes every night. The runners have been doing that for years, but still unable to find a way out, until Thomas appears.As with many other Young-Adult protagonists (similar to Katniss in The Hunger Games, Tris in Divergent, Jonas in The Giver), Thomas is different from the rest. He's curious, questioning everything around him and willing to do whatever it takes to seek and find answers. Not to mention, he's brave enough to lead the Gladers to conquer the maze. We're also introduced to Gally, another similar antagonist that doesn't like change, who wants everyone to strictly abide by the rules so that everyone can co-exist peacefully.The first act of the movie is incredibly promising, compelling and suspenseful enough to keep viewers interested, with enough drama, mystery and tension building up in the second act. However, everything goes downhill as soon as the third act begins. The revelation in the third act is considered a huge letdown considering the thrilling, suspenseful set-up earlier in the film. Who is Thomas? Why he's the most 'promising' of them all? Who sent him here? Why 'they' sent Thomas and Teresa? What is The Maze? Why they're all trapped in the Maze? What are the ""Grievers"" actually? How on earth that guy (I won't spoil it for you) managed to escape and meet them at the end? The explanations are vague...the film doesn't provide clear answers for many of the questions poised earlier in the film at its conclusion and relies on the next sequel to answer them instead (some of them I highly doubt so).Furthermore, the film never takes the time to explore its characters further and makes you care about them. The actors were convincing in their roles by providing decent performances but none of them were outstanding enough to make a deep impression. The friendship and camaraderie between the Gladers are shown throughout the film, but less profound. The only girl in the Glade, Teresa, lacks screen time and she serves no purpose for being in the film. You won't feel anything missing if she's completely removed from the story, because her role doesn't seemed to affect the overall plot of the film (there's enough suspense in the connection between Thomas and Teresa but that's not fully answered at the end of the film, so the only way to explain her inclusion in the film is probably that she's an important character in future instalments). The development of the characters felt rushed and truth be told, I didn't feel any emotional connection to the characters at all.Moreover, there are no memorable moments or impressive action in the entire film. As soon as the ""Grievers"" appear on-screen, all you see are just a bunch of closeups, fast cuts and blurred, shaky action. For me, it is hard to tell what is going on most of the time. Overall, The Maze Runner is suspenseful and exciting at the beginning, but it fails to deliver a dramatic and satisfying pay-off to the audience after all the patient waiting in hope to finally see everything comes together in the end.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-maze-runner.html Rating: 6.5/10","5 out of 20 found this helpful.

The acting was mostly exceptional and the CGI was incorporated resourcefully enough to avoid encroaching upon the vicarious experience the film tries to convey. My only veritable beef with the film resides with the gaping plot holes and scenes that struck me as though they were hastily thrown in by the writers out of obligation (most notably a scene preceding the ending, which was an absolutely flagrant attempt at implementing a regurgitated Hollywood cliché rivaling the intrusiveness of the Wilhelm Scream), everything else sufficed by my standards. If you're interested in viewing a dystopian thriller, I'd opine The Mazer Runner to be a fantastic candidate.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thomas wakes up in an elevator with a few supplies and no memory of how he got there. He gets deposited in a field where there are a group of boys consisting of, Alby(Aml Ameen), Minho(Ki Hong Lee), Chuck(Blake Cooper), Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Gally(Will Poulter) & several others. Soon, Thomas realizes that the boys are surrounded by a maze, that has dangerous things lurking within. He develops a sense of curiosity as to who put the boys there and tries to find a way to escape from the maze. He seeks the help of a maze runner named Minho. Together, Thomas & Minho look for a way out of the maze before it's too late. The Maze Runner is a brilliant film. Right from the first scene the mystery surrounding the main character & what the point of the maze is, has the viewer intrigued. The maze is ominous & creepy. The action & running scenes in the maze are exciting. The only flaw in the movie is the creatures in the maze, known as Grievers. The makers of the movie should have made them a lot scarier. Dylan O'Brien is outstanding as Thomas. Aml Ameen is effective as Alby. Ki Hong Lee is great as Minho. Blake Cooper is brilliant as Chuck. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is excellent as Newt. Will Poulter is amazing as Gally. Dexter Darden is impressive as Frypan. Kaya Scodelario is awesome as Teresa. The supporting characters are brilliant as well. The Maze Runner is a must watch. Go for it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This maze is an ominous, foreboding presence that perforates the entire movie and overshadows all other elements of a genuinely stock standard scenario of hero's arising from the ashes of despair.With a cookie cutter assembling of characters we've seen a million times before, from the reluctant hero Thomas played by the not overly annoying Dylan O'Brien, the lovable fat kid Chuck, through to the token bully/bad boy Gally played by an overacting Will Poulter from Son of Rambow fame, this collection of rag tag teenage boys is anything but original, but against all odds the film remains intriguing from its impressively abrupt beginning through to its slightly overblown yet relatively ripe ending. Maze Runner's ability to keep you entertained, often against your better cinematic judgement stems from the films often bleak and gritty tone but largely the films biggest ace up its sleeve is the as mentioned maze, a work of concrete beauty that harbors much narrative potential.The maze constructed here is a character all to itself. What exactly lurks the narrow corridors of this behemoth at night? Who and what has designed it? How will the ""runners"" unlock its mysteries? There questions that are quickly raised by you as tribe leader Alby describes the maze to our ""greeny"" Thomas. Ball does a solid job of directing around this central aspect and if all else fails around it, there's little doubting that the viewer will endure if not only to see what lays hidden within this large enigma, an idea perfectly tapping into our lust to discover the unknown and mentally uncover the mystery before someone else does.A whole lot more enjoyable than the Hunger Games and its weaker cousin Divergent, The Maze Runner is by no means stand out movie making but it's a solid and often heart pounding engaging thriller that features some thankfully un-annoying teenage performances, a great production design and a central plot device that will hopefully be expanded upon in its upcoming sequels. Out of all current teen book adaptations, this is a series that possess the most potential based on this first outing.3 perfectly constructed maze reproductions out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Better than most YA movies adapted from books. A few expected clichés but, for the most part, it's a smart movie that doesn't lower itself to pander to an audience expecting more of the same they get from similar films. Perhaps most shockingly for a YA movie, there's no central romance. I am unaware of the books and the relationship between the main guy here and the girl introduced later in the film could very well lead to that in a sequel. But here romance is left out of things, which I found refreshing simply because of how tired and predictable that had become with these sorts of films. It's an entertaining movie with good performances and nice direction. I wish it could have been reworked into a complete story rather than stretched out into a series but I understand how the business works with these things. Still, that feeling of being cheated out of an ending so I'm forced to come back for part 2 is enough of a negative to drop my score some.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If 20th Century Fox have their way, we can expect at least two more entries, especially since a sequel is already in pre-production. The pitch is that a group of boys are stuck on a small slab of land (the Glade) surrounded by a large maze that, at night, closes and plays host to creatures known as Grievers. Enter Thomas, our protagonist and the latest in a monthly addition to said group. Unlike his more settled companions, Thomas immediately repels the idea of confinement and urges his newfound neighbors to take initiative in discovering a way out. One can't help approaching The Maze Runner with an air of trepidation, given the number of similarly styled movies we've seen a sudden influx of. There are only so many times younglings can be subjected before we feel we've had our fill. The film does have its competencies, but the chances of captivation and anticipation for the apparently-confirmed sequel are simply far-fetched. The Maze Runner's greatest facet is its overall intrigue--the mystery it initially presents for us to pick at. While the use of momentary flashbacks is disenchanting, viewers can expect a light mental stretch from their first viewing. Another commendable aspect is how the themes are implemented. They aren't subtle, but we're at least spared the disservice of being drilled by overwrought messages and symbolism. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise, however, is the consistency of acting. O'Brien does an adequate job as the curious protagonist with a drive to do something, yet Will Poulter stands tallest as Gally, the stubborn voice of suspicion. In that, the chemistry is also worth touching on, but you're not going to experience the same level of connection as Harry Potter or even The Hunger Games. This is where the unlikelihood of The Maze Runner's overall resonance stems from. Most of what's presented works for the sake of adequacy, but finding anything of superb quality is almost as frivolous as making sense of the ending. For most of the runtime, The Maze Runner moves at a steady, methodical pace. Then those last five minutes pull the rug out and leave the film to slip and crumble oh so comically. About the only reason to feel indifferent to this coy play is the probable lack of total investment, which is to say (and confirm) that if you remain detached throughout the whole affair, then you may be better off than those who are more impressionable.www.theretailjudge.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

At the top, he finds himself stuck in the middle of a grassy plain, surrounded by trees, and giant metal walls beyond. Beyond the walls is some kind of massive labyrinth, which closes itself off every night, and there are deadly cybernetic creatures that come out to slay anybody who's stuck inside. This kid finds himself among a small society of other kids who have been stuck in this place for years, and could never find their way out of the maze...until now! If nothing else, I think The Maze Runner starts off with a really cool concept and it remains enthralling all the way to its end. Even if it does fall into the typical tropes, clichés, and formula set up by other adaptations of YA fiction novels (especially The Hunger Games), the film is very consistently thrilling. It's not just the action scenes, of which there are plenty and they're never really overdone - it's the plot and the methodical way it unravels that captivated me the most. It starts off so enigmatically, the film kept me glued to the action to see what the heck is going on and what the secret is behind the maze. The maze lends itself easily to building suspense, as the characters have to maneuver through its winding corridors and evade death at every turn. Outside of the maze, the film keeps the tension high thanks to an overarching sociological struggle that forces the characters to question whether they should risk their lives to escape or remain alive in their well-organized mini-society. At times, this takes the characters to darker and savage territory. The film can be pretty violent and nasty when it needs to be; it's not too distastefully graphic, but it is definitely not all that fluffy either.The plot runs pretty evenly with minimal drag, thanks to the plethora of conflicts that emerge among the different characters and the events that unfold. That being said, it's still not a perfect story; I personally found it odd that all it takes place in the course of three days (were it not for the dialogue, I would have assumed that months had passed). There are moments in the film where you could question why certain things weren't tried to accomplished before the main character's timely arrival. I found most plot holes easy enough to dismiss, but the film's success in the long run may depend on how the sequels do (and yes, the movie does end with a huge infodump that leaves more questions unanswered, and offers a lead-in for the next movie). I found most of the characters likable, except for one major antagonist, who may be one of the most unreasonably jerky characters I've seen in a while. I wanted to slap that Gally upside the head. The story seems to dig up some very interesting sociological themes, thanks to its focus on the group, the system they built, and their ongoing struggle through the maze. I have no idea how this movie compares to the original book, but it certainly has me interested enough to read it sometime.The film looks mostly-good. Photography is great in many scenes, but a few of the action scenes tend to be jittery and erratic at times. Editing is decent. I felt the cast was good, especially considering that so many of these actors are children. Writing gets the job done; there is a lot of exposition, some of which dumps a lot of new terms on the audience, but it keeps things rolling well. This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is okay.This film is a bit like what you get if you take the death-match scenes from The Hunger Games and crossed it with The Lord of the Flies. It may look like just another YA adaptation, but I think The Maze Runner is decent sci-fi and it could be the start of a cool new film franchise.Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

THE MAZE RUNNER is unique in its claustrophobic single-location setting (considerably slims down the budget, an estimated $34 million set side by side with $85 million of DIVERGENT), 90% of time the youngsters (boys exclusively) are entrapped in a glade (so they are called gladers) with the only exit is a giant maze with jumbo cybernetic arthropods named Grievers preying them.One asset of the film is that it is utterly engrossing ever since the first scene, there is no conventional post-apocalyptic pretext. Audiences are catapulted to the strange place with our protagonist Thomas (O'Brien), whose memory is erased as those precedent gladers. Save that Thomas intermittently recollects some fragments of his memory with blurry and glitchy flashback sequences, the narrative closely clings to how he adapts a game-changer identity among the group with his agile movability, gallant actions and sharp judgment. Thankfully, it is not a lone hero scenario, the story rightfully homes in on the collective collaboration, with discordance looming around, and a ruthless body count which declares that some key members have no chance returning for the sequel.The action set pieces are not so frequent, but director Wes Ball consistently cashes in the mysterious surroundings to elevate an atmosphere approximate to an edge-of-the-seat thriller, although we are certain they will find a way out, nevertheless the curiosity is resided in the final revelation, who is the heartless mastermind behind-the-scene and why on earth these boys are treated like guinea pigs in a laboratory, for what purpose? The ending only moderately justifies our questions, and leaves a glaring plot-hole (how come Gally finds the way and the password to enter the lab anyway) which necessitates an explanation in the sequel.The young cast has done a crack job, O'Brien, Lee (as Minho), Brodie-Sangster (as Newt), Poulter (as Gally) and Cooper (as Chuck) are all sparklingly prominent in the male-bonding- or-clashing coterie, the only girl Teresa (Scodelario), is an awkward addition, rashly introduced in the middle stream, it is a blessing there is no romance lead to distract our attention, anyway, in a three-day span, it is plausible there is no room for that cliché, but it is a sure thing the chemistry is bubbling under between Teresa and Thomas, and luckily we will wait for it in the second chapter.The movie fully taps into its formidable production design and as a whole it is neat and compelling without any eye-rolling bells and whistles (no nudity, mawkish love story or tangential ego-boosting blah-blah), a 2D version is a satisfactory pick for a Saturday matinée and I will say yes to the next chapter in 2015.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I read the book and I did not know how the movie was going to do at the box office or with the fans of the book and critics.The first film in the series is based on a series of books by James Dashner and it is an entertaining film, but it's not flawless.The story follows Thomas, a boy who wakes up in a moving elevator going up called The Box. Once he arrives, he discovers a grassy area called The Glade and the people that live there called Gladers. Not being able to remember anything, Thomas discovers an opening in the wall near the glade and is warned not to enter it as it leads to a massive maze.After Thomas learns about the monsters that wander the maze at night, he realizes that the maze may hold the key to getting out. When a young girl, Teresa arrives in the box, Thomas's memory starts to come back and he realizes what is really going on and sets out to try and find a way out.I wasn't totally against the movie, I was very interested to see how this movie would turn out, so my sister went out one night and bought a couple of movies from RedBox and she bought this movie. My sisters, Ricardo and my mother Tiffany actually saw this film. I literally did not see this movie until long after I read the book and until it came out on DVD.This movie is OK. But it is not without it's flaws. This is a throwback to teenage thriller movies as it features an entire young cast of teens who present themselves well on the large movie screen.The idea with the film is fun and it is designed to give us an adrenaline pumping story. That is a major flaw, it is supposed to be a film based on an young adult novel.The creatures in the maze are called ""Grievers"", they look really cool and amazing, but they also look like cyborg-like scorpions that bare a striking resemblance to the bugs in ""Starship Troopers"" and that is just crazy.Another problem is the Grievers, we don't see much of them until one of them is killed in the second act of the film. This sequence becomes the drive to finish the story and that's all we get because we don't know a lot about and they attempt to play an important role in the film and this creates a major plot hole.The one major problem that these young adult movies keep having is that in every teenage movie, there has to be an antagonist and this goes to Will Poulter as Gally and he plays the role like an idiot and he does not make me feel sympathy for him at all.Why you put a stupid-ass character in the movie? That's just bad writing, but this is THE MAZE RUNNER , so, no hard feelings.There are some cool scenes in the film. When Thomas goes into the maze after dark and is chased by the ""Grievers"", it's a cat and mouse sequence that keeps you going. The last sequence is when they try to get out of the maze and they attack in numbers and that is kinda cool.The third act in the film is just stupid and typical, but also good. You can see what the ending is going to be and it is no exception. The sequence at the end makes no sense and you should see this to know what I am talking about and it involves one of the characters.The ending is when they get out of the maze and they go into another maze. That is bullcrap! Is that supposed to set up a sequel because if it is, I'm paying to see it on DVD! The acting is good and bad, the supporting cast is out there and makes a lot of effort to put on good performances, but the only two that really shines out is Dylan O'Brien and Kaya Scodelario and they have great chemistry.Overall, I enjoy THE MAZE RUNNER. I don't think it's a perfect film by far and it is not as good as Hunger Games, Twilight or Divergent, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse and I DO MEAN WORSE.The film tells us a story that we already know, but it is amazingly well-directed and really fresh. Sure, it has it's major flaws, a stupid character and a very confusing ending setting up a sequel, titled ""THE SCORCH TRIALS"", for a September release this year and I can't wait, it is still watchable.I give THE MAZE RUNNER a 6.5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It sucks you in for the most part into the characters mission of escaping from the maze/maze camp. It achieves this despite none of the characters themselves doing anything to make you interested their well-being. I mean you care about them insofar as they are human and seem to generally be nice people but none are particularly likable and all are fairly bland (a result of poor duologue and poor acting). The blandness of the characters doesn't detract from your absorption in the movie toooo much, I'm guessing partly because it is part of the premise of the movie that the characters are thrown into the maze camp without any self-knowledge (can't remember what they were like before they woke up in maze-land). The movie is at its weakest when it tries to develop the characters and make you more emotionally involved. These scenes (for example a scene where the Chuck is talking about wanting to get home to his parents) are completely ineffective and generally laughable. The story that is built around their attempt to escape keeps you interested. The maze itself looks cool and is believable. The ends a bit of dud. It's predictable and doesn't really add any substance to the overall movieOverall there is enough in this movie to keep you interested and provide a bit of excitement but you won't walk away with anything besides that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Captures the intriguing premise and spirit of the book despite missing character depth","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3097816/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","3 October 2014","Young adult sci-fi adaptations have run rampant since ""The Hunger Games,"" and ""The Maze Runner"" is the latest attempt to copy that model and hook the same audience. James Dashner's tale of young boys trapped in a glade surrounded by a giant maze is much simpler than ""Hunger Games,"" so while it can't achieve anywhere near the kind of character depth, it certainly has a chance to be as entertaining.Viewers are advised to look to ""Maze Runner"" for a fun, sci-fi themed, mystery-driven movie. Director Wes Ball gets the most out of it in this sense; he knows how to use the camera to add intensity to a story. He will undoubtedly go on to make more good action movies. As for building the emotional connection, however, it's almost entirely absent, though a lot of this can be attributed to the script, which favors plot points over character-building moments.To be fair, there's a lot of explaining required in ""Maze Runner"" as with much of the futuristic sci-fi bestsellers. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) awakens in an elevator shaft that takes him to the Glade, where he's greeted by an entire village of boys who live surrounded by a mysterious maze. All of them arrived just as he did, with no knowledge of anything that happened to them before they got there, but they believe they need to find a way out. Especially curious, Thomas starts a chain reaction of events that lead to some answers.Although Thomas spends a lot of screen time with each of the boys he meets in the Glade – including Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster of ""Game of Thrones""), Gally (Will Poulter), Alby (Aml Ameen), Chuck (Blake Cooper), Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and eventually a girl, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), whose arrival really shakes things up – they mostly talk about the plot together, or explain things to the audience about the maze or any of the mysteries surrounding it. The few character-building moments are really wedged in. O'Brien is perfectly likable as Thomas, as are most of the others, but ""Maze Runner"" clearly leans on its premise and entertainment value.That's okay, because it has enough of an intriguing mystery, enough creative art direction and enough of a dark and creepy factor to pass muster with folks over the age of 18. Those who haven't read the entire series will likely find a less-than-satisfying ending, but these stories are written in threes these days (with the third part split in half, of course). Fans of the books will be a bit surprised by some of the changes, but ultimately should feel the story stays true to the spirit of Dashner's books.Thanks for reading!

Their acting made the movie very convincing, the best dialogue was when Thomas decided to get out of the Maze with his friends to find out why they were there in the first place. The movie also has some bad points, there wasn't any love story between Thomas and Teresa, a lot of people died for the same reasons, and they all died because of the flares and grievers.

What I expected was another formulaic, open ended movie designed only for making money. I can gladly say this hypothesis was wrong.We're delivered a tense thriller, most impressively, through a fairly young and unknown cast. This is a character driven film for sure, and one of the main characters is the four giant walls surrounding the trapped group of individuals. I jest, but they really do add an ominous feel to the intrigue of their entrapment.Let me voice my pleasure with the few issues I had. The so called forest that lies within the 'glade' however, which seemed to be displayed with varying degrees of size depending if one was inside or outside of it. Although not to it's detriment, there was a large number of the cast there for the sole purpose of numbers. To me, the unnamed characters that don't receive much of a part in this sort of film generally come across as the fodder, and this case it is fair to say they were nothing but.I did not care for the hierarchy of the group and find some of the behaviour (apart from the lead character) and adherence to simple rules a little unbelievable when all the while we must remember they are trapped.The premise chugs along nicely, although I must say the end suffered heavily from being the first of a potential franchise, with the finale as predictable as ever.These aspects are not to deter you from watching this film however, as they are relatively minor negatives. Overall I was very pleased with the end product.I think one of the highlights of this film working is the camera direction, never venturing beyond the maze walls for the majority of the film's duration, a master stroke surely.Boasting some great visuals, the monsters are little more than a plot device but they serve their purpose well enough. With a quality direction and a well-rounded young cast who maintain the viewer's belief in their peril this could be an exciting taste of things to come.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In fact, the outcome is a rather plain story for teens with laying stress on ""nice"" values, such as need for teamwork, trust, friendship, courage, etc., where the leading character/actor is less interesting than his co-stars, and the ending is confusing and scattered due to the sequel already planned. But as this movie and Hunger Games series have enjoyed enormous popularity and box office, then such creations probably fill some kind of gap in the line of new movies. There are a few thrilling and unexpected moments, but all in all - just another shallow entertainment, but hopefully a stepping stone for young actors who could be more selective in picking roles (at least for Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poultier).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A lot more better, but still not flawless.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3312820/?ref_=tt_urv","joshuadrake-91275","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62431316/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2015","I had to say, my expectations for THE MAZE RUNNER were very low before the film's release. I read the book and I did not know how the movie was going to do at the box office or with the fans of the book and critics.The first film in the series is based on a series of books by James Dashner and it is an entertaining film, but it's not flawless.The story follows Thomas, a boy who wakes up in a moving elevator going up called The Box. Once he arrives, he discovers a grassy area called The Glade and the people that live there called Gladers. Not being able to remember anything, Thomas discovers an opening in the wall near the glade and is warned not to enter it as it leads to a massive maze.After Thomas learns about the monsters that wander the maze at night, he realizes that the maze may hold the key to getting out. When a young girl, Teresa arrives in the box, Thomas's memory starts to come back and he realizes what is really going on and sets out to try and find a way out.I wasn't totally against the movie, I was very interested to see how this movie would turn out, so my sister went out one night and bought a couple of movies from RedBox and she bought this movie. My sisters, Ricardo and my mother Tiffany actually saw this film. I literally did not see this movie until long after I read the book and until it came out on DVD.This movie is OK. But it is not without it's flaws. This is a throwback to teenage thriller movies as it features an entire young cast of teens who present themselves well on the large movie screen.The idea with the film is fun and it is designed to give us an adrenaline pumping story. That is a major flaw, it is supposed to be a film based on an young adult novel.The creatures in the maze are called ""Grievers"", they look really cool and amazing, but they also look like cyborg-like scorpions that bare a striking resemblance to the bugs in ""Starship Troopers"" and that is just crazy.Another problem is the Grievers, we don't see much of them until one of them is killed in the second act of the film. This sequence becomes the drive to finish the story and that's all we get because we don't know a lot about and they attempt to play an important role in the film and this creates a major plot hole.The one major problem that these young adult movies keep having is that in every teenage movie, there has to be an antagonist and this goes to Will Poulter as Gally and he plays the role like an idiot and he does not make me feel sympathy for him at all.Why you put a stupid-ass character in the movie? That's just bad writing, but this is THE MAZE RUNNER , so, no hard feelings.There are some cool scenes in the film. When Thomas goes into the maze after dark and is chased by the ""Grievers"", it's a cat and mouse sequence that keeps you going. The last sequence is when they try to get out of the maze and they attack in numbers and that is kinda cool.The third act in the film is just stupid and typical, but also good. You can see what the ending is going to be and it is no exception. The sequence at the end makes no sense and you should see this to know what I am talking about and it involves one of the characters.The ending is when they get out of the maze and they go into another maze. That is bullcrap! Is that supposed to set up a sequel because if it is, I'm paying to see it on DVD! The acting is good and bad, the supporting cast is out there and makes a lot of effort to put on good performances, but the only two that really shines out is Dylan O'Brien and Kaya Scodelario and they have great chemistry.Overall, I enjoy THE MAZE RUNNER. I don't think it's a perfect film by far and it is not as good as Hunger Games, Twilight or Divergent, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse and I DO MEAN WORSE.The film tells us a story that we already know, but it is amazingly well-directed and really fresh. Sure, it has it's major flaws, a stupid character and a very confusing ending setting up a sequel, titled ""THE SCORCH TRIALS"", for a September release this year and I can't wait, it is still watchable.I give THE MAZE RUNNER a 8.5/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I would start by saying that it's one of those 'teen sci-fi romance' films. Ever since 'Twilight' came along – where the basic premise is that you take a supernatural (or science fiction in some cases) event then add a teenage love story and you have a highly successful (and therefore profitable) franchise. I was going to say that, as when it started it certainly felt like one. Only it had an 'all male' cast (yeah, you could add a bit of romance to that, but you'd have to be one brave screen writer).Anyway, 'The Maze Runner' is about a bunch of young lads, all of which have been captured and imprisoned in a field, surrounded by a maze. Why? We don't know, but obviously we'll find out. And, when a new guy arrives in a box (that's how 'new arrivals' get there, apparently) he decides that they should do more than just farm, eat crops and get eaten by giant cyborg spiders. Did I mention those? There are a load of giant robot spiders living in the surrounding maze who have a tendency to eat the kids if they stray too far.Okay, so it's a reasonably simple premise – kids have to find a way out and work out why they were put there to begin with. However, it's far from perfect. Its problems are simply that there are too many plot holes everywhere. Seriously... you just can't actually allow your brain to think about anything for too long. Because, if you do, you'll realise that most of it doesn't make sense.Then I realised why it felt like a 'teen romance.' A girl arrives in a box. Guess what... she falls for the main guy. But I still enjoyed it. Even though the maze (and everything in it) is heavily computer-generated, but I overlooked that.I guess my brain was obviously tired and I wasn't thinking about all the negative elements contained inside it. Then there's the ending. Obviously I can't go into that in too much detail without giving away things. My advice... the film is about an hour and fifty minutes long. After an hour and FORTY minutes, just turn it off – you don't need the ending. It really is the worst bit.So, if you have kids, they'll probably enjoy it. The romance element isn't too central, so I suppose it must be for younger boys than girls. Plus people like me who can allow themselves to dumb down enough to appreciate the action scenes and general atmosphere may get something out of it. As much as I know I should hate it, I just don't. And I can't really say why.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was a struggle to see it through to the end, I did hoping it would start to make sense at some point but it never did. There are so many plot holes as to make you wonder if anyone had actually read the script before they turned up on set to film it? Technically the CGI looked good and the camera work moved the thin storyline along and that helped me to stay awake, but why oh why must Hollywood always have actors that look like they just came from an audition for one direction or some such? Surely even in a dystopian future there must be someone with even an ounce of character? A lot of money really doesn't equate to a lot of quality these days.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

We're plummeted in a funpark ride and have to lunge from this or that menacing contraption. More likely this incarnation is through Lost, the same funpark only now we had much deeper architecture in the ride, together with the notion that shady forces in the real world control it. Anyone who approached Lost mythology as anything more than excuse to build walls might as well be harping on about the deep insights about the role of science in Jurassic.A few Hunger Games later we arrive at this set of contraptions. A funpark engineered for the usual thrills, teenagers placed squarely in the middle but now the whole world of the film is a contraption controlled by cruel adults to some inscrutable purpose. The whole film is the same simple contraption controlled by the adult makers of the film, with teenagers enticed into the four walls of the cinema so various gears can whir and move. Tied to ideas about freedom from oppression, it's now the youthful struggle thus reduced to a funpark ride of dodging walls and critters, a cynical thing.And even something so inanely simple can create interest to the point where a second film is in the works, because of the architecture of the experience. In Jaws it was simple; something lurks below this sheet of water and can be conjured anywhere at any moment. Lost was more intricate, it's the same idea as we find here. Somewhere beyond these walls must exist pattern and purpose that explain everything. The answers are of course cringe worthy when we get them but they were always a tool for immersion.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

While it doesn't achieve the heights of 'The Hunger Games', the film is a riveting introduction to this new YA series.The film opens inside a freight elevator, as it delivers Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) to the Glade. The beautiful meadow is home to a community of boys, who are looking for a way out of the mysterious maze that surrounds and has trapped them for three years. Thomas has no memory of who he is, where he came from, and what his purpose is - it had been the same for every person that came before him.There are runners, who go out each morning to try and find a way out. But there lies the catch. Every night, the towering walls of the maze close in around the Glade to prevent terrifying 'Grievers' from entering and attacking the Gladers. The mechanics of the maze shift and rearrange the walls, preparing a new maze for the runners to solve the next morning. But, since Thomas' arrival, things are beginning to change. The fabric of their society begins to tear, and circumstances finally force the Gladers to find a way out once and for all.These Grievers - part mechanical, part animal - are genuinely threatening and inject pure tension into their scenes. They are a treat for fans of the book; it's everything you imagined, and the film will have you on the edge of your seat.Wes Ball treats us to beautiful scenes and gripping action, but never at the cost of the characters. The ensemble cast is refreshingly multicultural and do their best to hook us for the rest of the series. Dylan O'Brien has proved himself as a capable lead, after supporting roles in popular series 'Teen Wolf' and 'The Internship'.I won't reveal the reasons for the Maze's existence and boys entrapment; the film merely gives a taste of what is to come. The film (ironically) races to tell its story within the 113 minute run-time, especially in the final act. Any unanswered questions will have to wait for a sequel - which is already in pre-production.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The lift contains provisions , animals and every month a boy with no memory of his past. Every day the walls open up to a maze, at dusk the maze is closed off.

Thomas is soon drawn to the maze, but as it turn out only runners are allowed to enter and explore it. The coming of Thomas and the events he sets in motion are likely to divide the glade community in those who want to stay in the relative safety of the glade and the ones that want answers and unrestricted freedom.The movie is entertaining in its way but lacks depth and subtlety. Maybe that was not a necessity for the target audience, but it would have made a much better movie.

"9","/10","Hunger Games Meets Lord of the Flies: A Solid SF-Action Film with Interesting Characters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3223341/?ref_=tt_urv","classicalsteve","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7383416/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2015","In most films of the SF-Action variety, there's typically good action sequences and effects at the expense of good character development and convincing acting. ""The Matrix"", ""2012"", and ""Man of Steel"" come to mind. Or, the reverse: the film has good characters via solid acting, but the pace can't keep up with a snail so the action sequences are comprised and the story doesn't move along at a brisk enough pace. ""Interstellar"", ""Prometheus"", and ""Oblivion"" are ones which come to mind in this category. Few films achieve both ends, such as ""Star Wars IV and V"", the original ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", and more recently ""The Hunger Games"". Amazingly (no pun intended), ""Maze Runner"" has a terrific balance of character and action. In fact, the whole film would have failed miserably if there weren't fine acting inside the skins of compelling and believable characters. And there has to be enough action for the audience to understand the dilemma of the characters. ""Maze Runner"" equalizes both quite nicely, seemingly effortlessly.Thomas, who doesn't know who he is because his memory has been wiped clean, is transported via a lift into a self-contained village within a small glade surrounded by huge walls on all sides. On one side, the walls have large doors which periodically open and close into a maze. The village-society is comprised of a few dozen males from age 12 to 27 but there are no ""adults"" over 30 and no females. They have structured their society such that different people engage in different tasks by day and then have ceremonial feasts and games by night. Supplies are also periodically provided through the same lift in which newcomers to the village arrive. However most of them have a sense they need to escape the glade through the maze, but not all the members have signed on to this idea.A selected group of athletic villagers are ""maze runners"" who explore the maze and report back to the village with their findings before the doors close towards the end of the day. However, there are two challenges to the maze. First, while its doors are closed, the maze shifts every night, and second, there are ""grievers"", horrid creatures which are a cross between ALIEN and former Vice President Dick Cheney, which stalk humans inside the maze. If the maze is the way out, they have to make their escape before being swallowed and/or stung by the grievers. The villagers also wonder who created the maze and why, and why are the grievers there? As the story progresses, some of the maze runner realize there are hidden clues about escaping the maze.The political structure is led by Alby, an African-American who is the wise leader of the village, and the first to arrive in the glade three years before the events of the story. Gally is a kind of second-in-command determined to take the leadership after Alby is incapacitated in the wake of having been stung by a griever. Newt is the leader of the maze runners, and Minho is one of the best runners. When Thomas, a ""greenie"" (a.k.a. a newcomer), becomes enthralled with exploring the maze when he's not officially a runner, Gally becomes enraged and desires the society punish Thomas and prohibit him from further running in the maze. What works well is not only the dilemma posed by the maze itself but also the power struggle between Thomas, who represents new hope in conquering the maze, and Gally, who represents the status-quo which may or may not wish to leave the village-glade. Then an unexpected ""greenie"" arrives to further shake up the delicate structure of the village.Overall a very satisfying and interesting film. The character conflicts and action sequences are juggled well. At every moment, the viewer is pulled into the story without a shred of insight into what will transpire next. A few unexpected twists and turns occur which in retrospect make the story work on all levels. This is the goal of most action-SF films: to keep the viewer wanting to know what will happen next without being certain what will transpire while simultaneously caring about what happens to the characters involved. Weakness on either end can result in a mediocre experience, but luckily ""Maze Runner"" delivers on both fronts. Well done.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

We've had a lot of these since 2008.And it must be said that The Maze Runner is one of the better ones out there. Mainly because it doesn't try that hard to be the next Hunger Games. Sure, it's in the same genre, but it has its own ideas and plots that it sets out to explore.So the central plot is that a group of kids are trapped in a glade. A nice little plot of land where they have been able to build a home for themselves. Unfortunately they're surrounded on all sides by enormous walls, hiding behind them a deadly maze full of hunters and deadly traps. Only a few brave souls enter the maze each day in order to map it. But they have to hurry because you don't want to be in the maze when the night falls. Hence the title.Evocative imagery and an intriguing setting. All the main actors and characters are also likable, although I do have to admit that Dylan O'Brien as Thomas, the protagonist, is perhaps just on the wrong side of bland.If you've watched The Hunger Games and are looking for more, I'd say this is a very good film to watch next.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie starts with Tomas(Dylan o'brien)waking up in a box which leads up to the glade.The glade is surrounded by huge stone walls.The walls open every morning and closes at sundown.There are runners who goes in the maze and try to find a way out. when Tomas shows up everything begins to change.The cast is great,if you have read the book,than you would know that it's pretty accurate.The acting is another plus.But the movie seem to drag for a little and the last 10 minutes seem to be weak.To much setup for the next one. overall it's a fun,good movie to watch. It may be a little too much for little kids. 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Quite enjoyable ""young adult"" movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3188754/?ref_=tt_urv","p-jonsson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23949705/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2015","One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a ""young adult"" movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.In my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.I did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way? Sometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.Bottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Originally when reading the book, the first thing that came to mind was that it's story would be much better told through the medium of film. After seeing the film, I still stand by my original thoughts. Action-packed, quick-paced, and full of suspense, this film does a nice job of covering up the cheesy dialogue and lack of character development. In adventure stories such as this one, we -- the viewers -- expect to see the characters go through some kind of transformation throughout the film. Unfortunately, in the case of the main character, Thomas, this does not happen. He remains the same throughout the entirety of the film -- bland. The characters are all incredibly cheesy and contradictory to the plot of the film. However, I did find this film somewhat enjoyable because of the quick pace, special effects, and high amounts of action that leave you gripping the edge of your seat at times. The plot is so enormous that it covers up the fact that the characters are pretty weak. Overall, I found this film to be entertaining, however I would like to see some kind of transformation and development of the characters if there are films to come -- which, seeing as this looks like it's going to be the biggest new franchise in the dystopian genre of film, I'm sure there will be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You just got another one. Fortunately though, this is more ""The Hunger Games"" than ""Divergent"" in terms of quality. Don't get me wrong, there is a maze...and there is lots of running...a film that I still think, to this day, Tom Cruise would be more than suitable for. Yet, the central mystery and intrigue is what brings you into the story. Mysteriously trapped in what looks like an endless maze, Thomas must figure out why he has been brought to the maze where his survival skills are put to the test. Aside from the sci-fi traits, this strongly reminded me of William Golding's classic novel ""Lord of the Flies"". In fact, the atmosphere and interactions within 'The Glade' are the most compelling scenes. A struggle for power and authority, the creation of a civilised environment by employing rules that the 'Gladers' abide to and dictating the roles of each individual from agriculture to the more dangerous job of being a ""Runner"". The way the narrative establishes the characters and their roles may be slightly uninspired but for what it's worth, it works. Dylan O'Brien, in a more physical role, controls the film and is surprisingly engaging (considering his lack of previous lead roles). But it's Will Poulter who yet again shines. His lust for power consumes him and conveys him as the antagonist, however there is more to his character that evokes a sense of sympathy. Confident and commanding. Thomas Brodie-Sangster was also good, but Kaya Scodelario...I still find her wooden and monotonous. She really didn't do much here. The plot is fuelled by conveniences, where one convenient plot device leads to another convenient answer and the mystery continues like that. For its target audience, it's functional. I was onboard and intrigued, so I can't say I was ever bored. I did find it was too focused on building a sequel. This becomes apparent during the rushed expositional conclusion. A fun film that caught me off guard.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This first movie follows a very young man who awakes in an elevator that transports him to a group of male youths that is living in a restricted natural environment surrounded by a gigantic maze. This society calls itself the Gladers. The young man doesn't remember his past and only recalls his name after a few hours of confusion: Thomas. He soon realizes that the other boys and men share his fate. They have established some basic rules to live together in peace and harmony as everybody has specific tasks to do. The most important group of people are the athletic runners who go inside the maze when it opens up in the morning and return late at night before the gates close again. The runners are trying to solve the maze to find a way out. However, there are mechanical creatures called grievers who live in the maze which can attack, kill or sting their human victims in a way that makes them go berserk. Thomas is a curious individual who doesn't like following rules and his appearance soon devides the group of youths. Some people support him as they believe he can help them solve the maze while others have gotten used to their lives in a restricted environment and consider him a nuisance. Things take a more dramatic turn when a last human being is sent up the elevator: a girl named Teresa who seems to know Thomas from the past.There are several elements that make The Maze Runner stand out positively. The idea to live the story through the eyes of the charismatic Thomas who gradually tries to find out what is going on around him makes the film captivating, mysterious and suspenseful. The fact that the film takes place in a restricted environment soon leads to quite intense relationships which help the story move forwarde. Most viewers will identify with one character or another. If compared to similar dystopian films, this movie doesn't seem to overuse special effects which gives it a more authentic atmosphere. The final half hour is quite tense and violent and leads to a bittersweet finale. On one side, one finally gets some important background information that explains most of that happened in the first ninety minutes but on the other side, the new answers lead to even more questions as the movie ends on a cliffhanger which almost makes it mandatory to watch the second instalment as well. If you're not planning on watching a trilogy, don't watch this movie in the first place.The story also has a couple of flaws. The background story seems surprisingly basic and is lacking many details. Some events in the story are illogical or simply left unexplained such as the Glader who got stung outside the maze which is never fully explained. The story obviously also has some similarities to other dystopian movies, especially concerning the bleak future of our planet and the basic main protagonists and antagonists. The movie's middle section is somewhat plodding and the movie could have been shortened by about ten minutes without leaving out anything essential.In the end, you will like this film if you're a fan of other dystopian science-fiction movies with a set of young characters like The Hunger Games or The Divergent Series. The unique setting and the mysterious plot certainly make this movie stand out. If you are looking for a creative and unique experience, you might find the movie somewhat boring and predictable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So you could say that I was rather going through a check sheet than watching the movie. It is completely different to the book. Yes they have picked up the basics from the book but the narration, details and execution are all totally different.I can't blame Dylan o' Brien for anything firstly because owing to my crush and secondly he was playing a character that in itself was a confusing one in the original book itself. If you have read the book, you will be confused as to what exactly the character of ""Thomas ""is and considering that I would say Dylan has actually brought some life and credibility to the character and has given his best with the limited resources he had.What was pricking me through the whole movie was the casting. Everybody almost seemed to be casted in the wrong roles. For example Thomas Sangster was kind of out of place as Newt and looked more perfect for the role of chuck. Similarly Will Poulter who played the role of Gally, looked more apt for the character of Newt or Alby . Aml Ameen would have suited the description and role of Gally much more than the character of Alby that he played. So half of the time I was finding it difficult to place these actors according to the book description. For me, it was like watching wrong faces in wrong body. But while at it I would say Dylan was convincing as Thomas and Will Poulter though given a wrong character brought out the best in the movie and is definitely one who manages to stand out in the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Delivers Potential from the Intricate Path of the YA Genre","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3090944/?ref_=tt_urv","valen060","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5052414/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2014","When it comes to young adult (or YA) books-turned-films, I usually tend to ignore such when they release into movie theaters and try to rent it on DVD when it's available. However, upon reading several positive reviews from a few notable top movie critics regarding the genre's latest movie adaptation 'The Maze Runner,' I decided to give it a shot to see if their reviews live up to what they had seen on screen. By the time I walked out of the theater I remained puzzled, yet my expectations were met and I was growing eager on what lies ahead for the main characters.The story about an amnesiac youth named Thomas is sent into a giant maze surrounded by other trapped boys calling themselves the Glade. Although he tries to regain his lost memories as well as figuring out why he and his fellow captives are there to begin with, he finds out that for the past three years, the Glade routinely sends out Runners to find a way out of the difficult labyrinth. To solve this mystery, they must work together (along with a girl who seems to have ties with Thomas) and escape the perilous, constantly-shifting path waiting before them, or be forever trapped like rats in a maze.Unlike the previous abundance of YA (female dominated) book-turned-films that proved unappealing and leaning mostly towards predictability (with the exception of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Hunger Games'), I best describe this movie adaptation of James Dashner's famed book series as an intricately dark premise, yet engaging in content. It's one of those YA rarities that actually turn up as successful to both critics and audiences, but seems to now have its aim toward the male half among the large abundance of female audiences. Lead star Dylan O'Brien (of MTV's Teen Wolf) delivered such a believable and interesting performance as memory-impaired Thomas as he tries to discover his true purpose by stepping up and proving his worth among his fellow captives. Actor Will Poulter also created quite a game changer in this role compared to his previous films ('Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader,' 'We're the Millers') as tough guy Gally. While the only female lead Kaya Scodelario balanced out the seriousness and the sensitivity among the Glade members as Teresa. As a whole, it seems to have the dystopian, thrilling elements of 'The Hunger Games' crossed with the male-driven survival themes of 'Lord of the Flies' with ominous tones of NBC's 'Revolution.' Since it's basically composed of an almost entirely male cast of characters (save for the only female lead), there are moments I've noticed where some scenes still remain unclear and need to be re-watched to understand it carefully. The tension and adrenaline just kept building up as more uncertainties within the bewildering labyrinth are explored, from encountering ferocious creatures called Grievers to the frequently-shifting walls that form new pathways to different sections, and a mysterious organization called W.C.K.D. With all these elements, including a strong cast and story, it has the potential to reach the ranks of the few significant others in the pool of YA film adaptations. Can't wait to see what the movie's sequel has to offer. It definitely follows the trail left behind by 'The Hunger Games.' Needless to say, the trials have barely just begun.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nothing too fancy, nothing too bad.
I completely agree with the reviewers pointing out the shortcomings, I just don't know what you'd expect. If you told me this thing got a few Oscars I'd be stunned but knowing this is a mediocre sci-fi that attempts to create an somewhat original reality - I'm fine with it.
Sure, highly dosed suspencion of disbelief is needed and the acting isn't amazing either.
So I guess my final verdict is this: If you have to pay more than 1-2$ to see it it's probably not worth your money. But if you get a cheap deal or just wanna have fun - it won't kill you.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Nada! Nothing! Not in the slightest. To make matters worse, the ending was nothing more then prepping the audience for a sequel! It was so in your face it was insulting. You mean the audience won't have a clue as to why all those innocent people died unless you come back and waste another 12 dollars! Wow! I will be avoiding any future sequel like the plague! The Maze Runner also reflects the sterile and chaste expectations of the American movie going audience. For starters, you have young men living together as a colony for up to as long as three years and they all have perfect haircuts! Give me a break! I couldn't believe how well groomed they all were. Did they have a hair stylist pop in from in from another dimension on a regular basis? And how could they all be so clean shaven? Did they bring razors and shaving cream with them? None of these men have delayed puberty problems that I could tell. LOL! Some of them must have developed facial hair after years of being stranded. But what bothered me most was what great shape their clothes were in. These are young men in there late teens and early 20's. Did they bring a seamstress and a washing machine with them, too!? They are supposed to be living like Robinson Crusoe, not like George Jetson! In this entire awful film there was only one single moment of humor. Even worse it has zero sexuality. Here's all these incredibly good looking and physically fit young men and we don't see a single one of them with their shirt off for a second! Why is non-stop violence, intense screaming and even murder OK, but not showing off the male body? Why have we become such a warped and sterile society where death and violence doesn't offend in the slightest, but God forbid you show a single male nipple or hairy armpit?","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

I never knew that this was based on a book either and if this lives up to the usual routine of books typically being better than their movie adaptations then it must be a cracker of a read.It may not be the most original idea for a story i.e. the human ""rats in a maze"" experiment, but at least it's a film that concentrates on putting together a good plot rather than just being self-reliant on visual & special effects. Sometimes it just seems that too many movies these days rely heavily on visual & special effects to dazzle the audience while forgetting about the story (Pacific Rim, for example). Thankfully that's not the case here. Don't get me wrong...the visuals are amazing and they definitely help bring the film to life. It's just that the effects are more of a very nicely added bonus to a well written plot.With these elements combined, the film delivers a very nice amount of action, tension & suspense....the majority of which come from within the maze obviously. The maze itself is VERY imposing, and when you throw in the Grievers as well (sort of guardians of the maze), it's a place where you definitely wouldn't want to be.Another area that wasn't ignored was the choices for the individual members of the cast, who all played their parts really well, and, thankfully, it wasn't a stereotypical cast of all young buff, good looking guys who couldn't act to save themselves (such as Twilight). They were all ""normal"" looking actors and they all played their parts with a decent amount of believability.The Maze Runner is not an absolute classic by any means, but it is well filmed, well acted, well told, and is definitely a very enjoyable film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The maze aspect of it was very cool and unique, however apart from that, the whole dystopian world was pretty much cliché.The acting was pretty OK, it was a bit static and felt a bit overacted at times. O'Brien does a pretty good job but I did not like the fact that his character became in the lead so fast after just emergingit did not seem that plausible. Ki Hong Lee, I've known from YouTube and maybe its because I know how he's actually like, so didn't feel that anything was wrong with his acting until my friend said he was a bit awkward. The addition of Chuck was a good detail; Blake Cooper did a great job with his character and managed to get the audience on his side. He also added a bit of a comical element to the film.The effects were pretty cool and helped to establish the complexity of the maze. However, I feel that they didn't play around with the maze as much as they could have. The running/action scenes was about the same every time they ran, a bit repetitive. And I did not get the deal with 'The Grievers', that seemed a bit too sci-fi for this movie. (Wait, is this actually supposed to be a sci-fi dystopian movie? Doesn't seem like it though, that's why the 'grievers' felt out of place.)And don't even get me started on the female character. ONE girl and she does about absolutely nothing. Why do they do this to me. It's like they want me to keep pointing out how sexist films/books are. No doubt she and Thomas will get together in the next film (or they already have in the books, I don't know I haven't (not going to) read them).Read more of my reviews at championangels.wordpress.com","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There were countless ones: ""The Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"", ""The Giver"", ""Ender's Game"", etc. After ""The Hunger Games"" paved the way with huge success, we are now in the middle of the phase where all those books are being made into movies. ""The Maze Runner"" is an addition to that phase. Based on the novel by James Dashner, ""The Maze Runner"" is a film about a young man who suddenly wakes up in a strange place with no feasible mode of escape and no memory of who he is and how he got there. He gradually discovers more and more of the suspicious place he is forced to live in and the people he is forced to live with, and what chance he has of escaping the Maze with his life.Dylan O'Brien takes on the role of Thomas, our protagonist and a person who is about as average as you can get. O'Brien wasn't given much of a character to work with at the start, but he put little extra into this role which honestly made him rather boring to watch. Practically all the other characters in this film played the same way. Will Poulter's performance is by far the most noteworthy and Blake Cooper's character of Chuck was the most interesting character in the screenplay, but every character was hard to get attached to. That may be mostly on the screenwriters, but when it comes to personality a lot of weight is put on the shoulders of the actors. And here, they just didn't deliver.Ultimately, I think character development could have been the best choice to make this movie stand out. The story is set up where a large number of young men are thrown together, forced to live in an enclosed area. Freedom is not initially an option, so they have to learn to create a society and work together to survive. What I loved about this story is that this happened; they did work together and had peace before they tried to have freedom. This is an incredibly unique choice, so I wish it had been a major focus of the story. In order for that many young, hormone raging, teenage men to create such a society, many mature decisions had to be made by these characters, and we never got to see that happen. The Maze is cool, the action and killing giant robotic spiders was cool, but the coolest thing was these strong characters that were hidden behind the curtain for the whole movie. Clearly, a choice by director Wes Ball was made about what his focus would be. After he decided to make the recipe young adult action flick instead of this ""Lord of the Flies"" type story, he needed to make some changes from the story in the book. A book can succeed in having two such different types of stories survive, but a movie is sadly not capable of such a feat. His changes needed to be on what he wanted to do with his characters, specifically Will Poulter's Gally and Kaya Scoledario's Teresa. Teresa's purpose in the film was entirely unclear to me, and whether or not Gally was going to be a villain or the unlikely hero was a mystery to me until the final five minutes of the movie. Poulter really gave a good performance in this film, and Ball's poor character choices made that completely irrelevant. Had some decisions been made about what to do with the people on screen, the movie could have been much, much better.Perhaps the most impressive work done in this film was by Artistic Director Douglas Cumming. His visualization of the Maze and especially the Glade were superb and made the film both beautiful and mesmerizing. An intense score provided by John Paesano accompanied the film, which added to the awesomeness of the film's appearance. Some may suggest that Cumming's work was unoriginal, with many scenes appearing like other films. The film's main villains, robotic spiderlike creatures called Grievers, had an uncanny resemblance to the spider Shelob in ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" However, with similarly choreographed chase scenes and shots identical to ""The Return of the King,"" I think the responsibility falls more again on director Wes Ball. The end of the film also provides us with an escape almost identical to 2005's ""The Island,"" along with other unoriginal frames.Overall, ""The Maze Runner"" was enjoyable. It had cool action scenes and was a really good idea for a story. As a young adult action flick, it meets the quota. It definitely doesn't go anywhere past that though. I just had a hard time getting into it because I didn't have reason to care about any of the characters. So as I walked out of the theater, I was ready for bed.I give ""The Maze Runner"" a 7.5/10.""The Maze Runner"" is now showing at the Vermillion Coyote Twin.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Because this film ends with a cliffhanger-which is a legitimate finish---I need to see the next installment in order to fully evaluate the first one. That said, if you don't like cliffhangers, avoid this film.The story, as many others have pointed out, is something of a cross between ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Hunger Games"". A group of teens must fend for themselves against harrowing odds. And they have no understanding of the situation in which they find themselves: surrounded by towering walls on all four sides. From the beginning it is clear that they must learn to live within those walls or they must try to escape their boundaries.The acting is mostly good. The visual effects are impressive. The narrative is okay for a first installment. One problem with a story about unseen agents or undiscovered motives is that there is no clearly defined villain or antagonist, so the viewer cannot fully invest in the struggle; he must constrain his emotional commitment (and opposition) until more is revealed. Hopefully the next film will reveal enough to overcome that limitation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I feel as if though it's the rampant young adult novel adaptations are the ones that inherently work really well on a cinematic level.There's a lot to admire in the Maze Runner that YA fiction really excels at. It helps capture the angst, identity crises, the sense of desperation and claustrophobia. This manifests itself to awaken the characters survivalist instincts. The premise is rock solid, the performances surprisingly come off well, the atmospheric direction is suitably dower, the initial world building is absolutely convincing. The establishment of the characters and their relationships towards one and other are what I thought worked on a meaningful level, it's something that isn't done nearly often enough. There are a few developments and moments where the film agonizingly let's itself down though and on more than a few occasions. It does this before it can properly cement itself as a solid piece of work.I couldn't help but notice the outright dialogue over dubbing especially in relation to the character of Newt. Every line he delivered I could tell was so clearly recorded in a studio and not the natural environment of the movie. There are a couple of times especially towards the end where the movie has some twists and turns that do demean the compelling narrative the film had built for itself. It's a shame considering how much I had significantly enjoyed proceedings up until those one or two moments.The good outweighs the disappointing ultimately. It's not world changing but it does make a fine companion piece to the Hunger Games which is a significantly more striking set of YA novels and adaptations.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm glad that I was wrong. Although the story is changed slightly it stays true to the original and is fun to watch. I realise that I was being a bit unfair by being angry that they changed some parts of the story when it's hard to recreate it perfectly. All the actors played their roles well and brought the characters to life. It kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I had an idea of what was going to happen. After watching it once, I went back a few days later with my brother to watch it again and it was still great. All in all this film is worth watching and I would definitely watch it again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Initially the story seemed intriguing, dark and clever, a group of boys forced to thrive inside a community known as the glade with no memories of their previous life. The glade is encircled by a deadly maze where man eating creatures, known as Grievers, dwell. The film began well as we were immediately plunged with Thomas into the ambiguity of the glade, tension between boys immediately started to rise, the unknown was exciting and the potential for the rest of the film seemed high. The overall cinematography throughout I thought was a real highlight to the film, after reading the books the maze was captured perfectly as the enormity of it portrayed it as a threat in itself even without the grievers. I also thought the design of the Grievers were effectively scary and very different. However the plot slowly unravels and becomes extremely vague leaving you very unsatisfied as many of the big questions aren't addressed until the end and are somewhat rushed and not particularly compelling. The lack of character development also annoyed me hugely, compared to similar recent films in this genre such as The Hunger Games or Divergent where the characters were complex, you loved some, hated others and felt empathy for them, I found myself lacking any emotional connection to any of the characters within The Maze Runner. The hero, Thomas, is your traditional good looking Hollywood teen hero who's actions were boring and predictable much like many of the others. The introduction of Teresa was very unnecessary, the typical arbitrary female who maintained perfect hair and makeup throughout and seemingly offered nothing to the plot. Although the film was action packed I felt the pace was all wrong for character development and key concepts from the book were missed out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the process of trying to build a franchise, most of these types of films feel narratively incomplete, as they try to arc a thin story over a series of films - but The Maze Runner feels like it can stand on its own, even if the end is completely botched. The cast is decent enough and it's refreshing to see grime and dirt on actors in an appropriate setting, instead of perfect hair and makeup. The film wastes no time, as the first scene drops our lead character Thomas into this small community of youngsters, which is surrounded by a giant, deadly maze. The maze is an interesting visual effect and the inside is a good combination of sets and vfx. The maze is far more interesting than most of dialogue that takes place outside of it. The first 45 minutes or so are interesting as we try to figure out the why's and what's, but the young adult subgenre insistence of giving silly names to everything can come across hokey. ""We call them Grievers"" ""We call this The Glade."" Even with the worst incidences of of expository dialogue, the cast is skilled enough for the film to keep its dignity. The last few minutes of the film fall apart, as an inevitable sequel is set up and whether this ending is true to its source material or not, it simply doesn't work on screen. It's an eye rolling ending for sure, but it doesn't sour everything that came before it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everyone had chemistry and I loved how this felt like the filmmakers actually read the book. I'm hoping this becomes a trend with book to film adaptations. The only thing I didn't like, was some important details in the book being left out. The films premise is ""Lord of the Flies"" meets ""Lost."" Despite the 2 hour run time, it feels much shorter; but that's because it's an exciting thrill ride from beginning to end. .

So I suppose the reel question is will The Maze Runner catch fire or just diverge(nt)? I feel like it's almost unfair to compare The Maze Runner to any of the other movies that are around this genre because it is so wildly different to them, it's true they have similarities but it has similarities to The Hangover in the respect that it has 3 men in central roles, that doesn't mean they should be categorised together, no. That would be a travesty to a film that tries hard to be separate.What we should compare the film to is Lord Of The Flies or even Stand By Me, because that's what the tone matches, it is morose and brooding. Unlike the other movies around it The Maze Runner is set up so there is no reason to box up emotions or feelings, the characters are free to express themselves however they see fit. Frequently this means spats of violence, but that isn't a bad thing. The entire tone of the film underpins its deepening reasoning for story. From the very opening we are presented with a simple set up, there is a society that consists of only males, living in a large open field and wooded area who have formed a society for themselves.For me the best parts of The Maze Runner was while they are still in the Glade, that feeling of unending imprisonment was one that fascinated me, and how the boys interacted really worked strongly. That they have a leader and a higherarcy was something I personally wanted to explore more, but I understand the film has to move itself forward into more prosperous places to set up the future movies. The movie plays its tension well and when the final moment of the final act arrives, it has power and weight to it. It is a sequence that both upsets and astounds us, this is how I know that The Maze Runner had won. That I felt an emotion at the end of the film meant that it's magic had worked on me and I ultimately cared about what happened to these people. The Maze Runner feels like it should do, as if it has a perpetual swing constantly building momentum until it reaches it's crescendo and we receive the pay off. This is clever film making at it's best. It's also nice to see a film that isn't scared to kill of main characters in the first outing, and isn't frightened to show us some truly horrific monsters and sequences. To say that the cast are impressive in The Maze Runner is a great understatement, this entire film is carried on two actors shoulders; Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who gets more impressive every time I see him and the incredibly talented Will Poulter, who is starting to show such strong promise I'm beginning to watch movies just because he is featured. Mr Poulter is one of the most talented and underrated actors in the world.The Maze Runner is a film that took a gamble and made a more adult themed movie for a younger audience crowd. The gamble pays off, The Maze Runner is a movie that dares to be different in a world full of the same.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Since all of us were hoping for yet another young adult novel to be adapted to the big screen, we have The Maze Runner. Apparently this is the new trend in Hollywood since Harry Potter and Twilight have exploded. This film film is directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brien (Teen Wolf), Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster among others. It's a pretty well directed movie with a very good lead performance by Dylan O'Brien, who is excellent. Will Poulter (We're the Millers) is also particularly good and his adversary relationship with O'brien's character ad something to the movie. The Maze sequences are very impressive and suspenseful. The creatures are good even if the cgi is not the best we've seen this year and a little obvious from time to time. I liked the tone of the movie as wherever you look 360° is just a big wall, a confine feeling is settling very quickly, a feeling that these guys are really cut off from the outside world. We don't know where they are. Who put them in this maze? Was it human? Was it Alien? Why? All you see is this field in the middle of the maze that's where I feel really isolated and I loved that because that's what you are supposed to feel like. As I said before there are few intense chase scene and in a movie called like this: I want to see that kind of things. That's what the movie delivers. However very quickly you kind of know where the movie is going though, it doesn't keep the intrigue alive too long and ""it's in the book!"" as friends said to me is not an excuse. Because certain aspects are not working on the screen, keep in mind it's an adaptation. Plus the ending is once again a disappointment. I think I'm doomed to bad endings in young adult novels adaptation. It's one of those endings the more you are thinking about it on the way home the worst it gets. It completely deconstructed the whole movie and make it irrelevant in some way. It does not make sense because the movie does such a good job isolating you, it was all about the environment. This lead me, finally, to the obvious sequel announcement. It's so obvious that when a character said his line I actually laughed. There's going to be another one guys *winky face*. Overall The Maze Runner I liked the movie, it does look good, there are some really good running/chasing sequences, the main actors were very good but the end is a little bit disappointing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Maze Runner, as most can tell, is nothing like that. This movie has sort of a Lord of the Flies and Lost combo to it, making it a real breath of fresh air to the YA genre. The thing that made Lost so interesting was the questions the show posed. This film gives the same feeling to the audience members. Despite a bit of a lackluster ending and somewhat predictable plot, The Maze Runner combines strong acting, breathtaking CGI effects, and a refreshingly darker approach to the YA genre, to give the audience an wildly entertaining thrill ride for the whole film. I know a lot of people are huge fans of the book, but I have not read the book and therefore will not judge the movie with any comparisons relating to the original source material. From what I heard though, the film cuts out some scenes from the book, but still stays along the same line. All of the people that read the book that I have talked to, say they very much enjoyed the movie and cannot wait for the sequel.What I am mean by predictable plot is the common features that The Maze Runner's storyline shares with other films. The constant adversity he must overcome to be accepted as part of the group is the main one, but that is probably how it would happen so it is hard to judge that factor. The main problem that most people had with the film was the rushed ending where everything seemed to be happening too fast. The movie is obviously just setting up for a sequel. Still, it should not have to cram in so much information in the last eight minutes to do so. The film still keeps the Lost sort of feeling and leaves us still thinking towards the end which I tend to like, but others may not.When I was watching some of the action sequences in the film, I said to myself ""Thank God they didn't make the action so lame so that it would be suitable for six year old to watch."" I really stress when I say young-adult because the action was actually a lot darker and more gruesome than I thought it would be so I would advise you not to take your little kids to the movie. The action was actually something I appreciated because it was not afraid to hold back on the fighting. The action sequences were simply awesome. The CGI was also very well done. The amount of imagination that must have been put forth to achieve the look of the ""never- ending"" maze was astounding. They really had you going. It seemed like everything that was happening in the film was really taking place and that is the goal for all CGI. Another thing I was impressed with was the great acting across the board in the movie. Dylan O'Brien, who plays the curious and courageous Thomas, delivers a strong lead performance and easily the best performance of his career. Will Poulter, who plays the tough and kind of mean guy Gally, really showed that he is not a one-sided kind of character and possesses a lot of acting ability. I was skeptical of Will Poulter being the right man for The Maze Runner after seeing him play the goofy kid in We're the Millers. To my surprise, he managed to show he can play more than just one type of character. The rest of the cast were all well-casted in their roles and all did a fantastic job. As I said before, this is not the type of movie for little kids to watch. If you are age appropriate though, I recommend you see The Maze Runner while it is still in theaters.

I still really enjoyed it, its nice to put an actual memory base on the books I fell in love with in High School.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I went in this movie knowing absolutely nothing, as usual, and came out totally amazed at how much it actually managed to deliver. My expectations weren't the best from the buzz I had heard and this probably contributed to a very good time at the theater.There were lots and lots of elements in the movie that I was surprised to see executed in such a caring and detailed way. Firstly, visually the movie is pretty exciting. I'm not talking about Seamus-McGarvey-standard cinematography, even though the film actually is shot really well, but about set-pieces and world building. They all had an incredible coherence to them and served the movie perfectly. The whole maze was just amazing to look at. The visual impact of the movie also contributed to some really relentless tension scenes that had me genuinely on the edge of my seat. This movie truly had some stunning suspense in it and delivered it in every single scene it wanted to. The mystery story was also very involving and had me continuously trying to guess what was going on, plus it managed not to fall in some genre clichés and pull off a couple of interesting twists.Yet, as much as it managed to stay away from some major clichés it fell into others and by doing this it contributed to the emotional detachment the movie has. Indeed it is thrilling for the majority, but on a character involvement level it didn't really do anything special. The major negative I have with the movie has to do with the resolution of the whole mystery, even though there is a final twist I enjoyed the whole resolution really seemed weak to me. There are also some minor incoherences and shortcuts both in story development and how characters interact and talk, but they weren't too bothering. I could also have done with some better acting from the whole cast, but all in all nobody stuck out as a weak link.To sum it up I would definitely recommend this movie as theater viewing, It was really a great time and I am more than curious to see how the story goes on.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and really innovative. The storyline was well-written, well-explained and it wasn't really simple. The characters were very interesting, but most of them weren't well-developed and there weren't any flashback stories about each one of them. The filming location of the movie was mainly, into a small forest in the middle of a huge maze. The casting was just nice and their acting was descent. It was a very intense movie, action-filled, adventurous and full of epic fight scenes inside the maze. Also, the creatures appearance was really creepy and kinda terrifying. The opening scene was definitely unpredictable and really promising. The ending scene was definitely unexpected, shocking and kinda emotional. Overall, it was an enjoyable action movie, full of epic fight scenes and I would probably recommend it to my friends.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Finally a popular franchise without the cliché love triangle! Would definitely recommend this film to the vast majority of people, especially if you're into the Young Adult genre. The cast are all fantastic and are a perfect match for the roles they play (my personal favorite is Newt played by Thomas Sangster), the set looks incredible. It's amazing how realistic they've made the maze look even though half of it is CGI! The Glade seems like the peaceful and harm-free place it should be (even though at the actual set they had a ton of snakes, mostly poisonous). James Dashner is awesome to have thought of this incredible plot line and Wes Ball is brilliant to have brought this to life in the way he did.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film tells the story of a sixteen-year-old boy who wakes up in the center of a maze, inhabited by other teenage boys, and is surrounded by viscous mechanical monsters. It was directed by first-time feature filmmaker Wes Ball and written by first-time feature film writers Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin. The movie stars Dylan O'Brien (of TV's 'TEEN WOLF' fame), Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Aml Ameen, Blake Cooper, Kaya Scodelario and Will Poulter. I found it to be pretty entertaining, and well-made, for a YA movie! O'Brien plays Thomas; a sixteen-year-old kid who wakes up in an old elevator, in the middle of a grassy clearing, surrounded by other teenage boys. He has no memory of who he is, or how he got there, but he does remember his name, after getting in a fight with another boy (Poulter), the first night. He soon learns that all of the other boys awoke in a similar fashion and they've built a community there, which they call the Glade. He also finds out that 'the Glade' is at the center of a deadly maze, surrounded by vicious monsters. No one has ever made it out of there alive but designated 'runners' investigate the constantly changing maze everyday, before it's doors close at night. With the arrival of Thomas things start to change, for the better and worse, for the first time.The film is a little like a cross between 'LORD OF THE FLIES' and 'LOST'. It's of course not nearly as interesting, or thrilling, as either of those cult classics but it is kind of like a YA merging of them. For a movie based on a popular teen book it is pretty dark and suspenseful. The premise is engaging and the acting is all decent enough. The film is definitely not nearly as good as the best YA movies (like 'THE HUNGER GAMES' or 'DIVERGENT') but it is better than most. Hopefully the sequels (with bigger budgets) will be even better. I'll be there.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But when Thomas does the inconceivable and the lives of all The Gladers are now in peril, Thomas and his friends must escape from the Maze before it is too late.I enjoyed the tale of young people in a situation, and how they overcome this, and the movie definitely ups a gear when principal character Thomas does the unthinkable and the consequences of this and furthermore the first girl enters the Glade - Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), whom has a mysterious link to Thomas' past. But I found the climax to the movie when all was explained disappointing and a bit contrived, which if this wasn't true might have made this an excellent movie. Also I felt that it took a little time for the plot of the motion picture to get going. Still, because the movie was largely well made, I give this film three stars. I will watch the sequel (Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Hence is the reason why I have been putting off watching it until now in 2021. So why finally watch it? Well, because I was recommended to watch the trilogy by one of my friends. So I sat down to watch the first movie.And I wasn't impressed. Sure, the 2014 movie ""The Maze Runner"" was watchable, but the entire concept upon which the story is built is just way too far out there to be plausible in any manner. The movie proved to be entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, and it was watchable, yes, but this was by no means a particularly impressive movie, nor was it one that puts the intellect of the audience to any test.Visually then ""The Maze Runner"" was good. While the maze itself was just hardly utilized, I will say that the creatures in the movie were nice to look at. They didn't make any sense in why they exist or what they were, but they looked cool.The acting in the movie was good, taking into consideration the limitations of the script and the premise of the entire story. Mind you, this is a movie for the late teen audience, so you should take that into consideration when you sit down to watch this.I managed to sit through the movie, and I just switched off my mind and enjoyed the action. But this was by no means a movie that provided me with much of any satisfaction, nor is it a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time.My rating of the 2014 movie adaptation of the young adult novel of the same name lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The premise was interesting and kept my attention. I wasn't able to guess what was going to happen. I found myself questioning the entire time. There were a lot of novel ideas and new situations that keep the plot moving along. The most interesting feature of the movie was the dark cinematography, especially on the faces of the characters. I think it adds to the darkness of the situation and their loss of hope. It also speaks to the fact that all the characters are essentially ""in the dark"" about what is going on. At times the darkness was actually a strain on the eyes while watching and trying to figure out what is going on. In a way it puts the viewer a little more in the story because it is an obstacle to overcome like the many faced by the characters. Personally, I do not enjoy this feature, but I get its purpose.

He cant dare to watch his suffer from death like this he just send himself to the maze. He help the Glader a lot. This movie can compare to Hunger Game because it like they want to test people IQ how long can they remember something. I recommend you guys to watch Hunger Game.

Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find out he is stuck inside a huge maze with other young males, who have built a community on a ""field"" surrounded by massive walls in the center of the said maze.With his memory erased, he has to figure out who he really is, what a mysterious organization named W.C.K.D. has to do what all of that and, of course, a way to escape.This film is full of surprises, some are great, some are horrible. The cast is the first good surprise with some amazing performances from pretty much everyone. Dylan O'Brien leads this movie surprisingly well, I did not expect such a high-level display from him since I was also not expecting such a fantastic start to the film. I just thought it was another book-to-movie adaptation to grab some undeserved money.O'Brien really embodies his character and makes his major share of the screentime worthwhile with some emotional scenes adding substance to the action sequences. Thomas is the type of character that instantly connects with the viewers because he is also in the dark regarding his situation and what the future holds for him and the other guys.Will Poulter (Gally) also achieves an outstanding performance by interpreting a more aggressive character who actually has pretty good reasons to act like he does. Kaya Scodelario is quite good as Teresa, but her character serves more as a plot device to develop Thomas and to advance the story than a real girl who ends up in the maze. Thomas Sangster (Newt), Aml Ameen (Alby) and Black Cooper (Chuck) also deliver some great performances, being Cooper the standout of the three.The Maze Runner is very well-directed by Wes Ball. The action scenes through the maze are suspenseful and tense, even though the scorpion-like creatures are too CGI on some occasions. The editing is clean and the isolated setting provides a claustrophobic vibe that elevates the overall beautiful cinematography. It certainly is a good-looking film, with some well-balanced tone and pacing, despite some unnecessary scenes.This movie offers an unconventional journey: for the first hour and a half, I was genuinely stunned with how captivated I was with the intriguing story. The film's premise is massively engaging due to the mystery in regards to the existence of the maze and to why are the kids there. The exposition scenes throughout the first two acts are incredibly well-executed and besides some nonsense lines here and there from any character, I thought this movie was going to be truly astonishing, but then the third act arrived.The ending completely shatters all of the film's logic. I mean, it is got to be one of the senseless endings to a movie I've seen in a long, long time. Being this the first installment of a trilogy, I knew I was not going to have all of the answers and that the screenplay was not going to have a definite end. However, I did not expect that a horrible exposition scene would finish the film by creating several plot holes that I do not think the next movies are going to address.The screenplay starts as a truly interesting and mysterious story and ends with Patricia Clarkson (Ava Paige) destroying any logic the film possessed. I am so disappointed that I am still trying to decide whether I give this movie a positive review or not. Honestly, even knowing a big part of the movie just does not fit correctly with its ending (which, by the way, is very predictable), I was entertained throughout almost all of the runtime and I don't think such a talented cast deserves to go down with the story.All in all, The Maze Runner self-destructs with the only horrible exposition scene of the whole film by throwing away all of its screenplay's logic. Some characters' script contains nonsense lines, but overall they are all well-developed through really well-directed dialogue scenes. Wes Ball uses the beautiful cinematography to elevate the claustrophobic setting and also achieves some cool chasing sequences with some sharp editing. The first two acts are worth watching and the movie's premise is super intriguing, but the last act, unfortunately, brings the whole thing down.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I will say that I haven't read the books yet but I now intend to buy the box set after watching this movie just to read them and I'm not a huge reader at all. I loved the acting all the actors did Superb jobs especially ""Dylan O' Brian. The action was top-notch from start to finish and the visuals were Awesome. The movie I felt was just the perfect amount of time and although some people complain about the ending I felt the ending fit perfectly with what is to come in the sequel and it had me asking a ton of questions which I don't mind doing at all.

The ratings were decent (when it came out), so I thought ""What the hey? I got nothing better to do"". I was actually surprised to find it very interesting. The idea, first of all, is cool. The maze, the glade, the fact that there are only teenage boys, surviving together in a massive cube. It's different, and different is good in today's world of cinema. The creatures, known as Grievers, are very well designed and unique, despite not being the most attractive in monster history, they're different. And once again, different is good. The characters are all fine and dandy. Sure, they aren't delved into as completely as they could have been, but that's why we need a sequel right? To make it feel like an actual story that takes place over a long period of time, over something quickly and sloppily put together and then farted out into theaters in the hopes of making a bit of cash during the opening weekend. It feels like the story is going to keep going, which brings me to my next point...The ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the Maze Runner sets itself up for a sequel. Unlike movies based off book series (like The Giver) that hastily solve the main conflict at the end and explain everything because they know that their movie sucks but that they'll make money on hype anyways, the Maze Runner is confident that it'll be a series that will continue, and thus keeps the viewer in suspense at the end, having only revealed a bit more about the mystery surrounding the maze, but still ending with a cliffhanger that leaves you confused but eager to see more. Overall The Maze Runner is a solid addition to the children-killing- each-other-for-the-benefit-of-some-weird-twisted-adults genre that has become more popular today. It's probably the best of this genre (thus far, at least), in my opinion. Other series, like the Hunger Games, just weren't interesting and lacked the mystery and intensity that the Maze Runner captures so well. I can certainly see the Scorch Trials coming out in the near future (it already has, and I've seen it), and am certainly interested in it. If your looking to start an intriguing movie series, then look no further then the Maze Runner.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nowlin seizes situations from other works, such as ""The Lord of the Flies"" and the series ""The Prisoner"", to create a narrative that, even by leaps and bounds, involves the audience. The end result works because of the suspense created about the nature of the Glade, the Labyrinth, the reason for the boys trapped there and the connection of all this with the appearance of Thomas and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), the first captive girl of the place - and, at least in this first act, there are no big love triangles that end up hindering the advance of the central story - which is a relief. The script does not seek to explain exactly why everyone is there or why the labyrinth and creatures exist, but provides a cathartic and visceral subjectivity of its protagonists in relation to survival and its insertion within a chaotic scenario. Unlike other dystopias, Maze Runner is interesting when looking for realism within the impossible, to the detriment of the creation of a mythology of its own, which, for the narrative scope in question, would prove to be unnecessary and unusable.As much as some of the characters are schematic (the mysterious newcomer, the leader, the lovable little boy, the best friend, the rival ...) the roles they occupy in the general mystery are more important than their individual ones. In this case, Alby (Aml Ameen), the leader, has to present Thomas (and the public) with the rules of the Glade and the structure of the youth society created there, with different castes and functions, taking advantage of each one's talents and needs. of the collectivity. After its narrative function is exhausted, it is promptly removed from the scene until it is useful again. But it is Thomas's rival, Gally (Will Pouter) who best exemplifies this, precisely because he occupies in the plot the function of the one chained in Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"", of one who is so attached to the system around him that he will do anything for keep it, even if it means staying stuck.Despite apparently having many similarities with The Hunger Games or Divergent: futuristic, apocalyptic, utopian, a chosen one appears to face the system, the context behind it is quite different. In terms of quality, it is just between the two films mentioned, with good action sequences and good chemistry between the characters. But the most important thing is that the film captures the viewer's attention throughout the session. Contrary to what happens in the recent Ender's Game, here the public does not disconnect from the plot, always being interested in what lies ahead. This, by the way, already leaves a feeling of wanting more in the face of a slightly open ending.There is a clear narrative problem in the book that was carried over to the film. Thomas, the main character played by actor Dylan O'Brien (Teen Wolf), remains in the dark for much of the tape as well as the viewer. The many questions surrounding his arrival at the clearing, what is that place, what is in the labyrinth, among others, are vaguely answered or left in the air for the public to discover along the plot ... or not. With that, the story gets a little dragged and the events end up piling on top of each other without further explanation. Nor do the other characters have any idea what is going on and this whole collective ""memory loss"" can be a little irritating. Wrapping the story up until the last few minutes does not work in the book and certainly would not work in the film.Of course, the plot narrative always ends up finding the overlay on top of any aspect. In this respect, the point of this adaptation is positive in any respect. The lack of memory, the construction of the 0, the coexistence and the intrigues created with the arrival of the protagonist call a lot of attention. In the meantime, the direction knows exactly the way forward, including when the changes that happened from the book to the film are identified. Fidelity still manages to maintain itself very well, makes everything flow more easily, but the title is finding difficulties in its technical aspects when the labyrinth comes into question. The effects of compositions are great, but it is the photography of the production directed by Wes Ball that leaves something to be desired. The action scenes themselves, which should be the main attraction, are below expectations. The visual effects are lost in the darkness of the labyrinth at night and director Wes Ball is unable to stage anything beyond a few meters from the camera: seen from the inside, the labyrinth is neither claustrophobic nor colossal, and the rushing moments are more like shots. shorter than harrowing pursuits. The truth is that at certain times it is even difficult to see the characters and details that could be interesting within the main location of the production. It is in the labyrinth, not in the community, that tension takes over the film.But in general, the director in his first feature as a director, is safe in building a dynamic film, even more if we take into account the limitations imposed by the script. However, in some moments it is evident that the director embraced more than he could bear and this reflects at the end of the plot where the grace of the film lies mainly in the sequences made in computer graphics, that is, the labyrinth. Because of the tape's relatively small budget, the art direction appears to be adequately minimalist. The clearing and other buildings were too primitive, running away from what was described in the book and also disagreeing with what is presented near the end of the film.The feature is about science fiction, but at the same time it plunges into a much more intimate and unexpected sphere that is based on human survival in the face of external and uncontrollable forces. We can even draw parallels here with man's various tour-de-force against nature, but these comparisons also bring their limits, which makes it almost difficult to define what this film really reveres - at least for much of its almost two hours long. However, one thing is certain: although it occupies the same post-apocalyptic level as other series of resounding success, such as The Hunger Games and the Divergent saga (which even hit theaters a few months before the feature in question), this new adaptation has its own brilliance and that should be taken into account, even if the slips become apparent as the narrative comes to a conclusion.The choice of the cast was happy and the young people gathered, with different ethnicities, accents and ages, create a harmony in the scene that is consistent with that presented in the work. With some familiar faces, others not so much, the actors develop in terms of acting only the minimum necessary to make the film work, nothing more than that. Dylan O'Brien, who until then was best known for being the best friend of the wolf boy from Teen Wolf (2011), practically carries the film on his back, doing well in the task. Skinny, he leaves aside any fragility when assuming a strong and energetic posture. Will Poulter, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Kaya Scodelario, Aml Ameen and Ki Hong Lee are also part of the young cast of the production. The five actors are doing well, although Poulter has a time or another when he is too cartoonish as the ""villain"" of the situation. Known for her work on Skins, Kaya takes on the responsibility of being the only girl in the place and fulfills the role of looking beautiful and at the same time available to take action. Veteran Patricia Clarkson closes the list in the shoes of scientist Ava Paige, in a role that should be better explained in the sequels.Unfortunately, the film does not remain at its peak all the time and ends up yielding to the formulas of the genre with the turn to the third act. After the incredible and well-choreographed action scenes, the characters end up finding a scientific facility completely destroyed and that even goes back to the scenic constructions of franchises like Resident Evil and then begin to understand the real reason for being there. The weak resolution leaves something to be desired, but perhaps it is the final minutes that return to a tip of hope for the long-awaited continuation. And perhaps one of the things that draws the most attention is the script, not because of the brilliance of its dialogues - especially because they can be predicted since the beginning of history -, but because it does not worry about depriving itself of sacrifices for evolution. of the characters' arches and even for building bonds with the public. The first iteration of this new dystopian franchise is interesting and satisfying. It is clear that the saturation of works of the narrative strands in question shows itself to be increasingly emerging within the film industry, which leads us to doubt the creative capacity of current artists; however, his dark and tense perspective is something to take into account, even for his continuations.During two thirds of his action Maze Runner develops in an intriguing and questioning way, placing the viewer beside his characters, with much more doubts than justifications. It is a curious position, but one that proves to be valid because it captures the audience's attention, which goes through the same afflicted and twisted ones as those in the fictional sphere. However, it is a film dedicated to a large audience, the beginning of a franchise that, if it works, should generate continuations in the coming years - completing the literary saga written by James Dashner. Thus, any risk must be as or more calculated than seen on the screen. What explains, for example, the happy absence of a romantic subplot - which, it is feared, should be reviewed in the following chapters. In short, this is why the ending, while intriguing, wastes time trying to clarify points that would be better off if they remained fuzzy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The computer generated effect and montage is so great. It look just like the real world. The sound is something to not be forget and it rock just like the rest of the cg part of the movie. For the music, we could have got better but I guess it sound enough for a public movie. The actors are great and make this movie live like for real. Than goes the story that could interest fan of sci-fi and adventure like it was shown in the trailer. The sub story or event of the movie make the movie sound real and emotional. A bunch of normal people making a story for normal people. Because it's good to note that despite all its greatness, the movie contain mistake that can be clearly see on first view and non sense that could make some people leave the sale. In my case I have decided to watch it completely and see how good it get on the story. Was not a deception. Did I forgot about the damn nice job of the shooters! A modern piece of great work.I bet it could easily reach the 8 for some people!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although everything changes when a newcomer motivate them to try to escape from this.I liked this movie and I found it really interesting mainly because of the plot. This movie has a lot of action scenes and much of suspense which is something that makes it even more entertaining. The direction which made by Wes Ball was very good who combined the story plot with action scenes without making this movie boring. In addition to this it has to be mentioned that it was not boring because of the very good twists which was included in the script. I liked the interpretations of Ki Hong Lee who played as Minho and Dylan O'Brien who played as Thomas.Finally I have to say that ""The Maze Runner"" is an interesting movie to watch because you will not be bored. Also if you want to watch a movie in your spare time then this is the movie the you have to do.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

CRAP! Finally got my tickets and then found out that all these teenagers were going to see the new Step Up movie. YES!!! I had heard about the movie and when I found out that it was going to appear at WonderCon this year, I got a copy of the book. I only got about 100 pages or so in – not to any fault of the books! – and then just never picked it up again.I really, really enjoyed this movie. I had heard a lot of criticism that this was just another Hunger Games. I actually found it to be more like Lord of the Flies than Hunger Games.If you couldn't tell from the trailers or the advertising, this story pretty much revolves around Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and starts straight from the beginning of his time in 'The Glade'.The Glade is very well done, it looks like it has been built by humans with very little equipment and not made unrealistic by CGI. The Maze is also very well done, simple, built for it's purpose and looks real and doesn't try to be over creative.If anyone is going to make it out of Teen Wolf and succeed, it's going to be O'Brien. I have stopped watching the show but his character of 'Stiles' is what got me watching the show in the beginning and is what kept me watching as long as I did! The character of Stiles is, more often than not, the comedy relief of the show, with his uncoordinated movements but the character of Thomas is essentially quite the opposite.The cast was pretty awesome, not a lot of them are well known but doesn't show in this movie and while Thomas may be the headliner, the heart of the movie, even though with a smaller role would definitely have to be Chuck, played by Blake Cooper.There seems to be an inkling of a possible future romance between Thomas and Teresa, the only female sent to The Maze, but I didn't feel any chemistry between the two other than a brother/sister relationship.This movie is based on a book series and while it wraps up 'The Maze Runner' chapter, it does leave some aspects and story lines open for the future films.There better be future films!I really enjoyed this film more than I thought I would and will more than likely go see it again, probably even buy it on blu-ray when it's released.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was not about the story-well mainly though I did have problems with it-but the writing style and the main characters portrayal. However, it did not change the fact that this was one of my few anticipated movie this year, mostly because I wanted to know how it would be brought to the big screen. So called me biased, I thought the movie did not change my opinion of The Maze Runner. I gave it 6 out of ten, an average at best, but it did has a few surprises.Surprisingly, the directing style, the scores, the visual effect, and the editing were blended together nicely. I have a very low expectations for YA adaptations now, but this one was handled quite well. Good job, filmmakers.Despite that, I did have complains. I thought all the characters are miscast, and their acting did not change my mind. I did like O'Bryan as Thomas, and I actually hate book-Thomas, but his acting was average at best.The made minor change on the story, some which actually worked. The pace was not rushed or significantly slow. I did get bored, but I blamed it on the story. The girl (Teresa) role in this movie was clearly minimized, I was sure it's because of the time limit. But, this was a wrong move. Teresa was the one making the movie more thrilling. It sparked my curiosity. I had all kings of predictions. Who is this girl? What's her connection? They were making her seemed important. But, they blew the candle. And if that's not enough, her portrayal is all wrong. She's useless, more of a cameo really, an eye candy. Who want to watch all boys movie now, hmmm? I know she will make more appearances on the next movie. But, we're not talking about the sequel, are we? All in all, this one is not worth my money. If this movie had not been in my anticipated list, I would have waited until it was available on rent.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has enough thrills and twists to keep you intrigued and on-the-edge till the end. The cast, which is almost entirely filled with teenagers, has done quite a commendable job and help making the dystopian scenario quite believable.The plot may seem like one of those stories you've heard time and again, but it does have new and interesting things to offer. Since there are so many characters, their development is quite limited. Few of the answers regarding the plot are answered towards the end; maybe, the remaining answers are left for the sequels.I would have no issues if this becomes a big movie franchise like 'The Hunger Games' simply because it's much better than other big movie franchises of the past, like The Twilight Series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As a fun Summer popcorn flick, The Maze Runner effectively kept me engaged throughout. The main protagonist, Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, is easy to root for as he struggles to uncover the secrets of the Maze. O'Brien's performance is compelling yet not over the top; often these post-apocalyptic films can suffer from protagonists that are far too melodramatic. Ki Hong Lee, as Minho, was probably the most refreshing character out of the bunch. It's obvious when you're watching the film that the filmmakers want you to notice Minho, but the film does a very good job with slowly introducing him, balancing out a level of mystique and curiosity in regards to who Minho is and what he already knows about the Maze. In addition to the two main leads, Aml Ameen and Will Poulter, who respectively portrays Alby and Gally, offers interesting personality dichotomies which further enhances the difficult obstacles that Thomas, our main protagonist, must face head-on as he uncovers the awful secrets of the Maze. Lastly one of the most intimidating and menacing characters in this film is the Maze itself. The filmmakers have done a excellent job giving life to this inanimate killing machine, constantly leaving me wondering what new and sadistic traps lied ahead for the seemingly helpless runners. If character development is one of Maze Runners strongest suits than the actual plot is likely the Achilles heel. That being said, the plot isn't a complete mess, however, there were moments that left me scratching my head, releasing me from the world of the Maze, which was disappointing since the world itself was utterly captivating. While I watched the film I couldn't help myself to draw comparisons to the Lord of the Flies and the Hunger Games. The community within the Maze will probably draw heavy comparisons to the characters and dilemmas that were portrayed in the Lord of the Flies novel. As for the Hunger Games comparisons, The Maze Runner affectionately tries to replicate it's bigger brother's tone and mood, and possibly it's success, by shooting the film in a similar style, i.e. film grains, shaky camera, and etc. But overall neither of these comparisons hurt the film at all, actually it perpetuated my fondness for the film since I'm a fan of both source materials. When it comes down to it, the Maze Runner plays it safe, following the typical Hollywood clichés that have succeeded within the genre, at the same time effectively giving me as a viewer something new. This film is far from revolutionary, but expect to see a growing franchise that will hopefully learn from some of it's initial mistakes and expand upon it's own source material, and maybe challenge the likes of the Hunger Games franchise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I read the book and quite liked it. It had a lot of elements I thought would look good in a movie, such as the griever and the maze, duh. And it did. It was awesome!Fastened Pace - A Positive ChangePerhaps I shouldn't, but I will start right away with the changes because this affects the plot and pacing - which I'd like to talk about now - and most of the things big time. There were a lot of changes made, which usually I don't say as a compliment. However, this time it enhanced the quality of the movie (unlike in many other cases. Khm...I'm looking at you Divergent and City of Bones). Because this time, it wasn't for the sake of difference and it wasn't simply (awesome) scenes cut out. These were all well thought-out, important, meaningful changes. For the most part, they were to fasten the pacing. In the first half of the book, we get to know a copious amount of information and then goes the action. It works out fairly well in a book, but in a movie less so. Hence they inserted more action scenes (read: a LOT more action scenes) and what we needed to be informed about, we got meanwhile. I was not bored for a second!The Cast - Pure PerfectionI don't know when I had the luck to see such an excellent cast last time. When an actor gets the role of a book character - especially if the book in question is one of my favorites - I have doubts. Serious ones. I care about my books and since there is a fat chance after the movie the image of the character in my head will morph into the actor/actress they're played by, I want the actor/actress to be very good. This time, however, I didn't feel anything like that. And post-movie, my opinion is untouched. All of them were perfect for the role as for their appearance and acting skills.It's Alive! - About Grievers and the MazeThe Grievers are supposed to be scare-the-sh#t-out-of-you scary, according to both the book and the movie. They had never been defeated before after all. And they were grandiose and spiky. But in the book all I got was how ugly they were. Like, I wasn't freaked out of my mind by far. Also, they descriptions of them were a bit fuzzy even though that I could understand. When they were around it was never really time to take them under inspection. The point is, I was more than thrilled to finally see how they looked on the big screen. In fact, I went fangirly so much, I got all squealy in the middle of the movie hall and my friend I'd gone to see it with was like ""It's okay. Calm down."" I think she thought I saw scared. :D Not even close; I was super-huper excited. (I still am, look at that ridiculous made up word. LOL) Anyway, they were incredible! They were all spiky and grimy and monstrous and yes. Scary! A little like in Alien and absolutely cool. I am perfectly content with the outcome.The maze were nothing less. It was as if it was alive when it moved and were fighting with the grievers for the first place monster award. They changed the code and the relating things a bit, the code was only a sequence of numbers for instance, which I thought took away a bit of the excitement of figuring it out, but I could overlook it after so many goodies.Minus the ParanormalWhen I first heard they would take away Thomas and Teresa's mind speaking, I wasn't sure how much I would miss it. Now I can answer that question; a bit, but I got used to it quickly. But I can understand why they did it. It was a nice mystery in the book, but it just wasn't necessary in the movie. I would go as far as saying it would have been strange if suddenly there would have been disembodied voices flying around. Furthermore, the movie already had enough action without it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But know that I think of this film, it's a mix between the March 2014 Sci-Fi Divergent and the 1998 Jim Carrey Comedy, The Truman Show. I will explain the similarities soon in this review. BTW, I've never read the books, but when I watched it, it felt like I didn't need to.In the story, a teen stumbles upon other teens around him all trapped in an area with walls surrounding it (See, the Truman show similarity?). Everyone in the area called the Glade has no memory of why they are there, but they try use this electronic maze to get out, which included 3 years of failed attempts. Its like putting the characters of Divergent in a Truman show like environment. Actually, it's an enjoyable film with the good execution and it's even thought provoking. But one plot hole is this: The Glade has some trees in it, yet the people there never tried building a ladder to bypass the wall (it isn't a dome, unlike the Truman show). Not a single one of the Teens figures this out. Isn't that just moronic? But even with that, it also has some twists, like a condition where a person would go insane and will have to be killed in the maze, and the condition is caused by a ""Sting"". So overall, things do get a little creative here, even with similarities to other films, but it does have some issues like that plot hole.The special effects are very effective I should say. Get it? But seriously, for 32 million dollar budget, it looks amazing. The technology in the film like the maze, the grievers, and more don't look cheap. The effects look artistic and look like very special effects. Get it? Okay, enough with the puns. But still, don't expect awful CGI creatures that look like Jar Jar Binks or that lazy CGI dog from the 2002 Scooby Doo.The characters in the film. Ah, not so great. The protagonist Thomas seems to be like the confused Teenager that is actually be very helpful, but he's treated badly in the Glade like an idiot. I think that he's a pretty good character, actually. Other than a few exceptions, the rest of the teens in the glade aren't very smart. Like I said earlier, they never figured out about a ladder ever and are huge jerks to Thomas. Plus, they are pretty bland. BTW, I can't tell you about more important characters because they will spoil the movie, who actually are pretty interesting. So overall, some characters are good, others, not so much.So overall, The Maze Runner has an enjoyable plot, Great Special effects, but not so great characters. Oh, and FYI, I can review the Truman show and Divergent soon to share my thoughts on those.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I believe it has great potential and is at war with The Hunger Games.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It really is that bad and how this has a 7/10 rating on IMDb is beyond my understanding. You might get a sliver of value out of this if you turn your brain off before you start watching. It's not worth the time it takes to watch it. This is really all I want or need to say about this turd of a movie, but IMDb wants me to say more so I can post my review. Seriously, you shouldn't read any further because you are wasting time and brain cells if you are still considering watching this movie!If you really want the rest of the review, read on:The movie tries to be a combination of many popular movies and just ends up with a incoherent mash up of unrealistic yet predictable characters, innumerable plot holes, and overused tropes. The production value was surprisingly good, although wasted on this dud of a film. Special effects and camera-work were good. The sound effects and surround mixing were exceptional. Even the actors were not horrible despite the comically bad script and plot. If and when they make the sequel to this, count me out.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Based on the popular dystopian book of the same name, The Maze Runner tells of a boy named Thomas who wakes up one day with all his memories gone, save his name. Together with a group of other teenage boys, he has been placed in the Glade, at the centre of a maze filled with dangerous creatures known as Grievers. The boys have organised themselves with Alby as leader, and everyone having designated roles and following a set of rules. The Runners among them have been mapping out the maze for the past two years, but are nowhere near finding an escape. Soon after Thomas' arrival, the chief runner Minho struggles to bring an injured Alby back into the Glade before the doors close at sunset and they are stuck outside to face almost certain death. Thomas rushes out to help, but winds up stuck in the maze with them. With Minho fighting alongside Thomas manages to kill a Griever by trapping it. The next day, they retrieve something of importance and find a way out. For the first time, a girl is delivered to the Glade, accompanied by a note saying ""She's the last one ever"". Another boy, Gally, assumes leadership. Wanting to maintain the status quo, Gally opposes Thomas and his plans for escape.Although I only read the Wiki synopsis of the book, I suspect that the film is a better - tighter but with all the essential elements of the story intact. The action scenes were great - suspenseful and convincing - and the maze was just how I imagined it. The Maze Runner ended on a promising note of deeper mysteries to be uncovered, but how this film is judged will ultimately depend on what happens in the sequels.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A group of teenagers find themselves deposited one by one in a mysterious glade enclosed by a huge maze. In the three years that they have been there, the have learned that escape is impossible, and entering the maze at night means certain death. Then Thomas arrives, and challenges all their carefully constructed rules, some of which have taken on sacred value for some members. Very few iterations of Lord of the Flies get it right, but the young actors in Maze Runner are plausible, and the running, jumping and rolling between closing walls and crashing edifices is tense and thrilling. There is good balance between action scenes and character-conflict scenes, with judicious dashes of comedy. Sure there are some plot holes, but nothing that has you throwing popcorn at the screen. It even gets away with a moment that is usually unforgivable, an ending that shamelessly sets up the sequel. Good fun for teenagers of all ages.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It just looked cool, like some kind of a mix between the The Hunger Games and The Lost. I did not even know it was based on a book.The movie is thrilling, nerve wrenching and very enjoyable by itself. I highly appreciated the new, fresh cast of ""unknown"" actors. The main characters did a great job of being close to their book counter-parts. The flow of the movie is another great thing about it. It simply glues you to your seat till the very end. The whole movie is intense from start to end. All of the surrounding are very well made and close to the books as well which is very appreciated.Now you may ask how can I even compare the book and the movie while I did not even know that there was a book in the first place. Its quite simple really, the movie made me really want to read the book and its sequels. Which is a great credit to the movie! So I read the book and I was amazed even more by The Maze Runner Movie. It stays close to the book representations of the Maze, the Glade and the dangers that lurk within the Maze. However, the movie also takes upon itself to explain some things completely differently, therefore presenting a new somewhat fresh experience for those who read the books beforehand. But in the end it all comes in the same result, the book and the movie.I really appreciated the approach that the director of The Maze Runner movie and I wish more directors of movies based on books would take this method. The Maze Runner perfectly balances authenticity to the book and taking its own course and it is simply perfect. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie (and the books as well)!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm unfamiliar with this series of books, but thought the trailer looked amazing and had an interesting concept; so I decided to take a chance. Trailers often let you down, so I didn't get my hopes up. But I was stunned as to how well made this movie was. It tense from start to finish and thoroughly engaging throughout. I can't recall a single cheesy line or unnecessary moment; every line of dialogue further develops the characters, every scene slows builds the tension and every revelation moves the story forward and piqued my interested. The soundtrack goes a long way in creating a sense of danger at just about every turn and the special effects for the maze (and it's inhabitants) make it very ominous and at times, terrifying.Unlikely Divergent, the performances of this young cast are very convincing and draw you into the film; one of the best youth ensembles I've ever seen. The tension builds and builds to a thrilling climax and a fairly unexpected twist (or two). The ending does leave you with some probing questions about the central premise, but I didn't take away too much from the film overall. I think this sets up nicely for the remaining films and given how good this first film is, I'm definitely going to see them. I think this is a better opening film than The Hunger Games in my opinion and if the sequel is half as good as Catching Fire, we'll have a great series on our hands. The critics haven't given this film it's due, it's one of best movies (and theatre experiences) of the year. Get out and see this, you won't regret it. Was my review not horrible? Great!

Here, our protagonist Thomas finds himself in a pre-industrial community called The Glade with no memory of a time prior to finding himself there. The Glade's population consists of teenage boys just like him who have no idea of their identity or why they have been put there. Escape appears impossible though as the field is surrounded by mazes where huge creepy-crawlies lurk.The esoteric tone of the film- characters not understanding how or why there are there- as well as the obstacles which prevent them from escaping borrow hugely from Lost. Character arcs follow similar trajectories too with some desperate to leave and others less so. Themes similar as Lost's The Dharma Initiative- a mysterious organisation that loves to stick its logo on things- are utilised heavily as well.The film retains viewers' interest throughout as you wait for The Glade to give up some of its secrets. Will Poulter in particular is great playing a character that the closest thing this film has to a villain. It certainly does not have the political depth of the Hunger Games which made that series stand out though this is only the first film. That said, it does an amenable job holding your interest and at least giving its sequel a chance.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Rarely do the terms ""provocative"" and ""teen entertainment"" fit in the same sentence with these movies. Maze Runner, however, with its Lord of the Flies inspired world and its ""Lost"" like mystery, overcomes its own muted tone and tired genre to be a surprisingly engaging outing. Would it be better if it had a more experienced and assured auteur behind the wheel? Absolutely, but the unique premise and twisting plot make for highly enjoyable fall movie-going. The film opens in fantastically bleak fashion, with our hero unknowingly stuck in a mysterious elevator which takes him to a land of other abandoned teenage boys, all enclosed by a giant dangerous maze. As he begins to learn what kind of world he is in, so do we, with the mystery and plot endlessly twisting and turning. Through some overly melodramatic but otherwise good performances, the movie takes us and our hero on a journey through scifi genres: the chosen one, zombie lore, Indiana Jones like action. It all culminates in some intense set-pieces and surprising story choices, which is more than we often get in this type of adolescent adventure. My affection for this film could be from my soft-spot for any scifi film that, at the very least, tries to be unique and surprising. The world is complete and well-realized, there is a believable premise, some cool insect-robot monsters, and even cool questions about the essence of identity. So even though much of the actual filmmaking is a bit by-the-numbers, the unraveling plot is a bunch of fun.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Dare to say I was not in a good mood either. But the film did not let me down alas, which was a good thing.First of all, I really like the approach of ""The Maze Runner"". It was direct, intriguing and straight up to the point. However I did find it a bit confused at first when everything was displayed in front of my eyes without much explanation about the context behind it all. All truth to be told, the I-have-a-set-of-rules-which-you- probably-gonna-break-anyway thing was getting a bit too tiresome and unconvincing, since we were not left with the impression that those rules were made to last. But the film did manage to pull out some pretty touching moments as well as some small twists, which in my opinion were quite appreciating. Overall I did enjoy the plot, though I still could point out dozens of holes in it.Next, talking about the cast. I really did not enjoy the 2 main actors and actresses. They acted very forced as if they already knew what was going to happen next. But the supporting casts did quite a plausible job. Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt played a believable character whom seemed to be smart and encouraging. And the young Blake Cooper really gave quite an impression though the playtime of his was not so long. Last but not least, Kee Hong Lee as Minho also did his part very well in term of being a leader of the Runner team. Since the film does not possess a real villain aside from Mr. Nice Guy Will Poulter, I can safely assume that this guy could not, I repeat, COULD NOT play a bad guy. Even being a confusing one at that. To come to a conclusion, let's just say that this film is good enough for me to start picking up the books and see what happens next to the characters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","In the end, The Maze Runner is A Lord of the Flies type inspired dystopian movie that feels like it's could have came out during the 80's and that's not a bad thing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3107364/?ref_=tt_urv","alexcomputerkid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44939296/?ref_=tt_urv","19 October 2014","Every aspect of a persons life can be defined in one way or another. Something like high school days, college days or marriage years are obvious categories. But for me being the pop culture/nerd and sport fanatic that I am, my years will be most remembered by this stuff. Today, iPhones by Apple are the most popular phones and social media could not be bigger. I sadly had to watch Lebron James make it to four straight NBA finals appearances and the biggest trend in films now seems to be dystopian society themes with kids living on their own, kids facing conflict, kids fighting kids and kids killing kids. It can be a very interesting subject matter.There are many reasons why this subject matter in movies is interesting and makes money. First, all of these movies are based off books. These books have a fan base and have sequels attached to them. If the movie has a nice box office run, the studios are surely going to want to do some sequels. Second, the source material has already been put together before the movie is made so the filmmakers do not have to invent a plot.What seems forgotten about this certain genre of film is it very dark. This involves kids living an adult life and often with some criminal intent. In real life, these kids are not of the proper age to be doing these types of things but that seems to be thrown out the window in these movies.In The Maze Runner, Thomas (Dyaln O'Brien) wakes up inside an elevator with no idea of his name or identity and he is eventually taken into a society in what seems to be the near future. The society is led by teenagers and the physical boundaries of this society are marked by a giant maze. The maze has many mysterious things about it and some could ultimately be be the key to getting out back into the real world or it could be the death to all of them.In terms of the characters and the depiction of the society, The Maze Runner is all over the place. The acting is not a problem and considering the young cast, this makes it even better with some fresh faces. We know none of where these characters come from, their background or why this society has no woman in it. I would compare it to the The Host, another young adult novel based film that is also set in a dystopian world and has the same flaw. How in the world does a society like this survive? How are these kids getting food? Where is there waste being disposed? That said, the movie does provide an original ending that shapes this film into being sort of creepy but still leaves the story wide open.Obviously, the biggest thing to this film is the maze itself but this is really also what slows down the film. The maze sets up the atmosphere of the film throughout and it's the maze is what keeps us thinking and pondering how it will shape the characters and their society. Once the characters do get inside the maze though, close to nothing happens in substance but the action scenes are still intense and special effects here are pretty effective. Still, I wish there was a better payoff once inside the maze. I bet the payoff will be bigger once the inevitable sequel comes along which has been announced for next September.Surely I would have loved more details about The Maze Runner and also wished it wasn't so up and down but the movie does have more positive then negative parts to it. Comparing it to the other trend films of this genre like Hunger Games to Divergent, The Maze Runner will no doubt be the least remembered. The film also really needs a sequel to give us answers to some of the questions raised near the end of the movie and this would also make this first installment better. In the end, The Maze Runner is A Lord of the Flies type inspired dystopian movie that feels like it's could have came out during the 80's and that's not a bad thing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Better Than Average YA Film...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3107830/?ref_=tt_urv","ccponds","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48165343/?ref_=tt_urv","20 October 2014","As I have said/complained many times over the past few years, making a YA book into a film can be very repetitive. The movie may honestly be very well made, but it can also suffer from a seeming lack of creativity. The best example I can think of this year would be ""The Giver."" Thankfully, ""The Maze Runner"" was an above average YA film, for the most part. I thought the beginning was very good, the middle was good, and the ending was a little flat. I guess I would say that for everything that was awesome in this movie, there was sometimes was another element that would bring it down slightly.Right off the bat I want to say that the special effects in this film are very good. They are not so great that they stand out above everything else this year, but they certainly fit the film and the film's tone perfectly. From the way the maze is designed to the vicious creatures that lurk within, the effects will keep a viewer's attention. However, the very best effects were definitely applied to the creatures in the Maze. These monsters could have easily been the next ""Alien."" They are a perfect combination of awesome, fear, and disgust all blended into one nightmare. My one complaint about them would be that they give away the mystery surrounding them a little too early. I think they should have kept them a mystery for a bit longer than they did.Tying into the Maze's creatures, the best element of this film was undoubtedly the genre it played off of; the thriller genre. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and it kept the audience guessing as to what the purpose of the maze was. This thriller element is helped in a big way by the actors' performances throughout the film. There really was not a bad performance from any of the male characters, but there is a reason I have emphasized ""male characters."" I emphasize this point because unfortunately, the lead female role (one of about two females in the entire film) is really poor in her performance. Her character comes into the movie about halfway through, and really does not add much to the story, and she really did not offer much in terms of character skills. My sisters actually compared her to Bella from the Twilight series. As I stated earlier, I really did enjoy the beginning and middle portion of the film. Even the first part of the third act is fun, but the very, very end has been hated by many critics. I am personally on the fence with this ending myself. Half of me agrees with the critics in that ending was a very cheap way to end the film; it was predictable, lazy, and brought the movie down. However, my other half is telling me not to hate the ending because this film is based off of a book that is the first in a trilogy. Honestly, if you know this going into the movie, the ending will not be as bad as it has been made out to be. It is still annoying for sure, but it does not ruin the entire film just part of it.All in all, ""The Maze Runner"" is actually much better than I expected it to be. While it does have some key moments and elements that hold it back from being fantastic, it is still worth seeing. If you have not seen this film already, I would advise seeing it, preferably at a matinée showing. The cheaper you can get ticket for this movie the better, but it is still worth seeing on the big screen.I give ""The Maze Runner"" an 8.25/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The characters find themselves in a huge labyrinth and try to figure out why this mysterious structure exists and how they can escape. This intriguing subject immediately draws the viewer in. Additionally, the visual effects and action scenes in the movie are quite impressive. The struggles with dangerous creatures in the labyrinth increase the tension and make the audience hold their breath. The cast also deserves great praise. Dylan O'Brien gives an excellent performance as Thomas and reflects the emotional evolution of the character incredibly. Additionally, other actors in the film portray their roles successfully. While the film frequently pumps adrenaline with its scenes full of action and mystery, it also deals with deep themes such as character development and questioning of human nature. This balance makes the film appealing not only to action lovers, but also to viewers looking for depth. All in all, ""The Labyrinth: Deadly Escape"" is a visually striking, exciting and thought-provoking film. For me, this remains one of the most successful examples of modern science fiction cinema and provides great pleasure for viewers.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's kind of ironic because the trailers for the film got me to pick up the book in the first place. I enjoyed it so much that it took me less than 24h to finish it. Based on the trailer I was already inclined to like the casting choices for the characters and was really excited to finally see the film. And then ended up spending half the film battling with an overwhelming sense of frustration.I've started noticing that the ""book adaptation"" scripts I often have issues with, are the ones that were not done/written by the book's author. (as is the case with this film) The part that frustrated me the most was the sense that the director was ""dumbing down"" the story. Part of the appeal of the book is that they feel just like those boys while reading it - clueless, guessing, emotionally invested, with very little to go on in terms of understanding why they are there and what is going on. Trust the movie version to hand it to the audience on a platter way too early.The book did resemble Lord of the Flies in many ways - it is not just about the mystery and adventure, it also takes a closer look at human nature and what lies underneath when you take away societal norms and distractions of ""normal"" life. Characters were insufficiently developed making it harder for audience to connect to them on an emotional level. I'd recommend this movie only to those who haven't read the book yet, who are usually drawn to this genre and are only looking for a bit of mindless cinematic distraction that will not leave any sort of major impact on their mind or life. Kind of a waste of a great cast in my humble opinion.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Throughout the entire movie I was on the edge of my seat just thinking WTF. The entire movie is shrouded in mystery and unfortunately even after the movie is over and get somewhat of an explanation you will still be wondering what the heck is going on, but they set the movie up that way on purpose to uphold the mystery for the future movies... but I am hoping for some major explanations. I wouldn't consider this movie one of those mindless action packed movies that Hollywood just loves to pump out. Although the movie didn't explain too much, there is so much to be revealed in the future and that gets me pumped. It's gonna make me come back for more.The dialogue is very cheesy at times but luckily everything else in the movie makes up for it. During the movie I was so wrapped up in trying to figure out what was going on I didn't think of any plot holes or flaws but they were there. Like how could you damage half metal beasts with a wooden pike? With vines leading to the top of the maze around every corner why not just climb up them to see the maze, seems a lot more efficient than running aimlessly. What's the point of even mapping the maze if it changes every day? How do teenage boys that haven't seen a woman in three years not try to lust after her (although I like that the movie wasn't sexualized at all this did seem very out of place)? Although I would have enjoyed at least some sexual tension between the guys ;) I guess if I read the book it'd hopefully answer some of these logical fallacies. But at the end of the day when I was watching this movie I was captivated and that is exactly what a movie is supposed to do. I am looking forward to the sequels but I'm seeking a lot of explanations in the future and hopefully the creators try using logic a bit more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Your only eight years old with no cell phone; so how did you pass the time? You played with that paper placemat that every restaurant that was family orientated had. Some had that easy word search that hid easy messages like ""fries"" and gumball"" and some had an unfunny cartoon that was printed with the hope that the child would laugh anyway. What most had was the classic maze.I myself have a couple of memories of holding a free crayon offered by the waitress and tracing my way though an uneven pattern that would lead me to the exit. These were easy, but I had fun solving them, giving me a sense of accomplishment before I dived into a hot dog. What makes the maze puzzle so unique is that I think this may be the first example of a virtual game. Despite only using a pen to guide the way, you were thrown into network where your only goal was to get out. Solve the maze and you feel like you could take on another to prove that you were such a master. Let's see you solve the death trap that is in The Maze Runner. Sixteen-year-old Thomas (played by Dylan O'Brian) wakes up to find himself in an ascending cage which opens to a lush field and several other boys around his age. They collect the other boxes that came with him and the second in command Newt (played by Thomas Brodie- Sangster) tells Thomas about the way of life and their positions. Most of the boys farm and gather but a few select venture into a large maze that surround them. They are called the runners.As Thomas begins to accept the community way of life, he accidentally gets left out in the maze when trying to save the others (the maze closes it's gates at night as monsters fill the track). He manages to survive the nightfall and save his friends life. This grants him status as a runner, to the dismay of the group's leader Gally (played by Will Poulter). As Thomas starts to learn about mapping the maze, a girl arrives in the cage along with a note that reads ""the last one ever"". This puts more pressure to find a way through the treacherous puzzle before they run out of food and time. The Maze Runner is another young adult novel getting it's turn at a movie adaptation. What certainly separates this from the others is that this one is more boy orientated. Sort of a cross between the lost boys of Peter Pan and The Prisoner TV series, The Maze Runner was a lot better then I thought it could have been. The situation is more interesting and easier to follow then this year's Divergent and it's cast of young men shape it to be a better performance piece.Exceptthere's only one problem with the characters and it's a major one; the main character. Thomas is really bland and forgettable and is just the generic nice hero. I don't know if the actor Dylan is the issue as he does have a regular role on MTV's Teen Wolf (I can't justify this as I've never seen the show); but you know it's a problem if the side characters are more memorable. As is, Thomas Brodie-Sangster makes for a good sidekick (so much so that I wish he were the focus) and Will Poulter is starting to show more acting skills (proven before in We're the Millers).I'll give this seven hard mazes out of ten. The Maze Runner could have been as good as The Hunger Games had it casted a better performer or simply had a better character to put the focus on, but for a fun Friday night at the movies, I'll take it for entertainment's sake. This could have been worse.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a spoiler free review. The Maze Runner is directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brian, Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. The Maze Runner is based off of James Dashner's novel by the same name. The movie is about a boy named Thomas that wakes up in an elevator. Thomas's memory has been erased and the only thing he can remember is his name. Thomas wakes up in what is known by the local populace as The Glade. In The Glade the boys that live there (called Gladers) have created a home for themselves with structural rules and where everyone does their part to help out. The main people are the runners, these people are the ones that run out into the maze and try to find an escape route and attempt to map it out. But they soon begin to realize its more than a maze. The first two acts of this film were absolutely amazing, Wes Ball really knows how to bring tension into this film especially in the chase and Griever sequences were you feel a lot of awe and suspense as you watch the characters run in and around corners from the Grievers and the maze itself. The biggest problem about this film however is the last act, the last act was just absolutely terrible and totally ruined the experience for the entire movie. Another problem was all of the cliché's and predictability throughout the movie which took me out of the experience constantly. There are some really nice action scenes in this movie with great camera angles that truly capture the suspense and excel the experience, there is also unfortunately 3 scenes i noticed with shaky cam though which again took me out of the experience. Most of the actors are generally unknown but the acting was alright with no one really pulling an amazing performance or even something noteworthy, however Kaya Scodelario's character has this Kirsten Stewart look to her which was kinda annoying. The main character played by Dylan O'Brian was alright however in some parts of the film his acting became more like Shia LaBeouf's in transformers. Will Poulter's performance was probably the only good one in the entire movie as i truly felt that he portrayed his character really well. The VFX teams deserve some recognition for their work on capturing the shear size and terror of not only the giant walls but also the terrifying scary grievers. The walls are massive, frightening, unpredictable and scary. The grievers on the other hand are better left not talked about believe me the less you know the better. I would recommend you go see this film, its actually quite good maybe even a bit underrated. Its a fun and enjoyable film to watch but under the surface its an okay film with a high predictability/cliché rate. I'd recommend you see this film with a bunch of friends to possibly enjoy the experience more because when you look at it from an entertainment point of view this film defiantly delivers, but when you look at it from a critique point of view you'll slightly less enjoy the film for what it is. My score 7.5/10 or ★★★","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies.

I've watched trailers for them over the years but then I learnt about this film and it actually sounded interesting; I haven't read the book so this review is going off just what I saw in the movie.To start off, the storyline, it's about a guy who finds himself in a large field surrounded by a giant maze, and he's not the first to appear there, there is a whole community that has been built by these young adults who have also had their memories wiped and are in this field. This film certainly gave you the feeling of isolation, the CGI was pretty good for the most part so the walls and the maze looked awesome, the plot had few good twists, although maybe some were a little predictable, and for at least the first two acts it was a solid movie, it had tense chase scenes, strong characters and I enjoyed it. Some of the dialogue was a little hard to swallow, nobody could seem to answer questions straight forward, it was always a vague command or statement.Of course there has to be a resolution to all this and that becomes the last 20 minutes or so. Without going into spoilers, I was a little surprised how after the revelation the entire tone of the movie changed; some people are going to hate it, I'm on the fence currently but it just seemed odd; especially the fact that they were almost to the point of looking at the audience and saying ""Please let there be a sequel!"". Apart from that though I enjoyed The Maze Runner's mystery and thrilling dark moments and the I couldn't really fault the special effects.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They really are very similar looking.I actually do wish I'd watched it sooner though, because I really enjoyed it.Yes, you could call it 'Lord Of The Flies' in a maze or a simpler version of 'The Hunger Games' and it obviously bears many similarities to that franchise as well as the ""Gents"" series (Insurgent, etc), but personally, I think that it's better than the ""Gents"", but not as good as 'The Hunger Games'.It does have enough differences to stand on its own and it's made well, with a good cast. None of them shine out or have really big names to drag consumers to the cinema, but they don't need to.This is a story I would be happy to watch or read and I'm sure the books reveal a lot more. There are probably die-hard fans out there that would say it's been made wrong based on the book, but having not read it yet, I can say that I didn't need any more information and this interpretation was an enjoyable watch.It's got action, a little bit of humour and potential romance, but with the focus on the maze and there are no obvious ""Neville On The Broom"" bad CGI moments.Usually I would wrap up by saying that I'm looking forward to the next in the series, but I've already seen it, so look out for my review of that one too.706.81/1000.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The whole feel of this film was kind of Lord of The Flies meets The Hunger Games. A group of boys have been placed in 'the glade' in the centre of a maze. Their community has been added to gradually over time and they have evolved their own rules and each person has their own job to perform. Some of the boys are runners, tasked with running into the maze every day to find a way out. This film was very intense from the outset and I spent the whole time trying to work out why they were there. Another adaptation from a book, which I haven't read, but a very watchable film. I'm not sure it will be as successful as The Hunger Games but worth seeing in it's own right. Look out for Thomas Brodie-Sangster, you will remember him as the cute kid from Love Actually who learned to play the drums to win the girl........well he's all grown up now!!!!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main characters in the movie are Daniel O'Brien as Thomas, Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt, Ki Hong Lee as Minho, Kaya Scodelario as Teresa, Will Poulter as Gally, Aml Ameen as Alby and Blake Cooper as Chuck Wes Ball has released this movie The Maze Runner as an adaptation of the novel by James Dashner written in 2009. The movie is about a teenage boy named Thomas. He awakens in an elevator, clueless about how he ended up here he is put into a world with around 35 – 40 teenage boys that also have no memories of their past. They are trapped in world surrounded by a maze. Thomas is forced to follow a set of rules and learn how to survive in this enclosed world. With a new boy being sent every thirty days with new supplies the group of people in ""the glade"" had been there for three years, searching for a way out through the maze. The maze is surrounded by cyborg creatures known as Grievers. The entrance would close and the maze would reshape every night, blocking some passages and creating new ones. When the boys had finally started giving up trying to find a way out of the maze a very surprising incident occurs dividing the group into two factions, those willing to risk their lives and fight their way through the maze and those who aren't willing to lose what they have already and just survive as they had been doing over three years. At the start of the movie Thomas is in disbelief and refuses to build friendship with the other Gladers. As we went through the movie Thomas became more attached to the environment and the other Gladers. Chuck was the only one he could call his friend and share his thoughts with. Further through the movie, Thomas had become the most heroic figure in The Glade. He had survived a whole night inside the maze itself which was never done before. Near the end of the movie, Thomas had led a group of Gladers out of the maze and known as a brave leader. Thomas gotten braver and courageous as he went through his journey to finally escape the maze. The Maze Runner is a young adult post-apocalyptic science fiction movie that contains violence, sci-fi and thrill making it a PG13 movie aimed at teenagers and young adults. The director did a terrible job of copying the book since about half of the information and scenes from the book were left out in the movie. For example, in the book Thomas could talk to Teresa telepathically, this is a major part of the story in the book but in the movie, this trait is not included or mentioned. The film didn't give the audience who are unfamiliar with the other characters, enough information about them. The actors in the movie are chosen or customized based on the characters from the book. The actors are excellent for their roles since each of them show the same characteristics as the characters from the book. The costumes that the actors wear in the movie are briefly based from the book. The costumes stay the same for each character throughout the whole movie. The costumes can tell us more about what's going on in the story if we pay close attention to it. For example, the first scene of the movie shows Thomas inside a dark, metal elevator rising to enter the Glade. When the elevator comes to a halt, Gally opens the elevator, exposing Thomas to the bright light and exposing the Gladers and the audience to Thomas. In this scene, his shirt is soaking wet and his hair is drenched with sweat giving us the idea that he had been in the elevator for a very long time. The Gladers all wear long sleeve shirts and long pants suggesting that the Glade is a cold place. The lighting used in The Maze Runner is carefully placed by the filmmakers to tell us more about the story without using dialogues. Lighting can set the mood and draw attention to certain people or things. A red light starts flashing on top of Thomas when he is in the elevator suggesting danger or telling him that he has finally reached the end of the lift. This leaves a slight suspense to the audience who start wondering where Thomas will end up. When he is released into the community there is a wide shot of the Glade with Thomas standing exactly in the middle. The camera is angled so Thomas looks like a minor ant in front of the walls that surround him. The beautiful greenery and blue sky of the Glade is revealed to the audience. On the other hand, the filmmakers had made the walls of the maze surrounding the Glade dark and dull clearly pointing out that it's a much different place compared to the Glade. Sound was used throughout the movie for mood. An example of this in The Maze Runner is when Thomas is in the elevator. When Thomas sees the flashing red light the music starts increasing and doesn't stop till the elevator crashes into the trapdoor. Another example is when Thomas is being chased by the Grievers in the maze. The mechanical sound effects given to the Grievers gives it more thrill. The screams and crashes that the Grievers make the audience go on the edge of their seats. Although, there are some significant differences between the movie to the book, the book has more detail and is easy to understand, but for some, the movie might be astonishing due to its terrific visuals, great acting and amazing use of sound and lighting. For these reasons I give this movie:By – Raunak Koirala","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

From what I was told, they did leave out certain aspects of the book, and slightly altered the ending, and I believe that these book aspects were unnecessary anyway, as they made a film which told an exciting story anyway, regardless of the story the book told.My criticisms of the movie are that the ending wasn't very original. Knowing nothing of the books, I was surprised because I didn't know that there would be a series out of this, and it wasn't just a stand alone film. This definitely helped me appreciate the ending more than others, but now that I know, I can look back and realize that the set up for the sequel was just awful. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that they could easily have made it more subtle, and it would have improved it quite significantly. My other concern is that it predicable to a certain degree, and when they find out why they are in the maze, it seems like a situation that is being overused these days.Having said all that however, the film did manage to excite me for the sequel, which I didn't even know was going to happen. The CGI was pretty good, there were some iffy moments, but overall I was impressed. The story also managed to remain interesting while setting up for the climax, with incredible action sequences, and one really tough to watch scene about how they deal with a deadly infection. This scene was emotional, and hard to watch, but it brilliantly illustrated how desperate and helpless the boys in the movie are. The films highlight was the acting. There was not a single moment where the acting was bland, which was a nice surprise to me, considering the youth in the cast. Kaya Scodelario did have a few moments where you could tell she was struggling to fight her British accent, but her acting was still well done. The three highlights of the cast were Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, and Will Poulter especially, who was fantastic. These three actors more than anyone were great in every scene they were in.Overall, I give The Maze Runner an 8/10, because the story, effects, and acting were great, while the ending could have been better","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Dylan O'brien breaks out of his somewhat small acting career, and is the male version of Shailene Woodley, who I love personally. This is comparable to Divergent more than anything, and also reminds me of The Lord of the Flies. Books were better, but this was great.

From the trailer, I expected a generic young-adult film that would still entertain me. Its premise seemed interesting though so I was glad to see this screening. Coming out, I can say that it was a fun 2 hours that was worth the time. However, several issues really bring it down and keep it from standing out.Again, The Maze Runner did successfully entertain me (and the rest of the full theater from what I saw). It was action-packed and intense, definitely an enjoyable experience if you're looking for an exciting movie to watch. The visuals were great, and interpreted very nicely according to my friend who has read the books. The maze's design brings in a lot of different elements/influences from cultures around the world to make the environment appropriately interesting and incredible at times, in no small amount due to the visual effects. The film started out smoothly, very quickly introducing its characters and setting up the plot (or at least what we know for now), throwing you into the action. However, as it progressed, a few things began to bother me. The writing in specific situations is a bit shaky, and ultimately it doesn't succeed well in separating itself from other generic, clichéd action films. A lot of the characters, their personalities/actions, are predictable, and that takes away from their development, at least for me. They essentially played into roles and did not establish their own personal and emotional connections to the audience, so there wasn't much weight to consequence that occur. In terms of the general story and background, I find that it takes a large amount of suspension of disbelief, and a lot of the things that happen or how they happen are expected to just be accepted. Regarding the characters themselves, Dylan O'Brien pleasantly surprised me. I think he did quite well in his role and I am excited to see more of him. Aml Ameen as Alby also performed decently. However, that is the extent of my compliments for the actors unfortunately. No other character really stood out from the actors' performances, and some of them are unconvincing at times. Gally, as the ""villain"", was a weak character I find, and he didn't really have logical motivations for his actions. However, my friend who has read the book has told me that the characters are better fleshed out in the books. Overall, I would have to place The Maze Runner with a 7, but verging on the lower side of that. It's definitely entertaining and I don't regret the watch. The writing and acting holds it back, but it has still set up a nice world and I am quite interested in seeing what they make of it next. Hopefully they will improve upon the issues found here. RATING: [6.5/10]","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Any kind of romantic element was conspicuously absent, as it was in the book, and the actors were not all stereotypical hot models that would have probably brought in a much wider young adult female audience. From what I could tell, the directors really wanted to keep this as close to the original story as possible, and everything from the CGI'd maze, to the glade, to the actor portrayals showed that they really cared about making this gritty, and enjoyable to watch. Other young adult movie adaptations of books have been very heavy handed with the romance between the boy and girl, and have dumbed-down both the language and context to give children something to enjoy. This was refreshingly different! This was a REAL movie that to me was the same caliber as any great blockbuster to come out this year. Please keep doing what you're doing!

Few plot holes, but all in all, decent entertainment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Oh look! Another dystopian teen film has been created","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3148906/?ref_=tt_urv","InMyHonestOpinion","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57390014/?ref_=tt_urv","26 December 2014","I'm going to begin this review with a personal rant. Sorry in advance It would seem Hollywood has completely run out of ideas, nothing original is getting through anymore, just the same thing over and over again personally I find it a little ridiculous. With all the new ideas out there, new screen writers surely they can come up with something different to what is being released currently Once again another dystopian society, living off what the planet can sustain, in a place where new laws have been created and everyone pitches in to do their bit. Sound familiar at all??? A young man who early on has no name wakes up in an old rusty elevator, once it stops he finds himself surrounded by a group of boys all about his age of 16 or younger, he soon discovers that he has been trapped in a place the boys have called ""the Glades"". In his new society the nameless teen learns that the leader of the group keeps things running by having placed rules amongst the group. Rules though are meant to be broken, having a curious mind the young teen wants to know all he can especially about what surrounds the Glades. Surrounding the Glades are four very big cement walls and during the daylight hours one of the walls opens and leads to very large maze. Everyday a few of the boys who have been given the job of title of ""runners"" take to the maze and try to find the exit. At night the doors close and whoever is left still inside the maze is never heard from again due to the ""Grievers"" creatures of the night whose only instinct is to poison the young group which in turns them full of angst and eventually death. This has been going on for 3 years now and the society that the boys have set up works well that is until the elevator arrives again with a new arrival this time a girl and note stating she is the last.. The Maze Runner has a little glint of freshness about it but not enough to make it something new and wonderful; it is exactly what you think it will be a cross between Lord of the Flies and every other dystopian film that has been released in the past 3 years hence my little rant earlier. Now I'm not saying that's a bad thing because The Maze Runner does have its finer points. The actors were all very good in their roles, some more than others, but good enough none the less. The world created was quite visually appealing, sure apart from the green grass of the Glades all there was, was cement as high as the eye could see but for what it was it worked. There were a few very nice twists towards the end and I can guarantee if you're anything like me you will be trying to work out what the big secret is from the very beginning. I'd still say don't waste your time at the cinemas with this one wait for the DVD to be released and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. May not be for the kiddies this one either.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Fairly unoriginal, but it's still a pretty decent watch","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3293541/?ref_=tt_urv","jimbo-53-186511","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26154754/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2015","With this film essentially being sort of cross between Cube and The Truman Show it was never going to win any prizes for being original. However, despite this The Maze Runner still manages to be reasonably enjoyable.The start of the film is shrouded in mystery; who are all these people? Why are they there? How are they going to escape? It's a very easy spectacle to get swept along with and a lot of this is down to the likability of the majority of the characters and the fact that the majority of them are forced to work as a team to solve problems. The film begins slowly and is what I'd like to call a 'slow burner', but it never felt padded out or unnecessarily long and essentially just starts off by developing a few of the key characters. There are many exciting set-pieces (the first one in the Maze with the griever was great fun to watch). The performances from the principal cast vary, but O'Brien was the stand-out performer with Poulter also being very good as well (it may just be me, but I thought he had a bit of a look of River Phoenix here). As much as I found this generally fun to watch and relatively exciting there were some issues with the film....Most of the problems I had with this film related to the concept of the maze and its opening times; OK, we learn that it opens at certain times of the day and is open for a certain amount of time, but when watching the film we see runners going in and out of the maze and timing their exits from the Maze to perfection. This made me think that at some point someone must have had to have worked out how long The Maze opened and closed for, but unless you sat there staring at the opening with a stopwatch there's no way you could accurately know how long the walls opened for? I didn't see any evidence of anyone having watches or mobile phones in order to time the opening of the gates so I doubt anyone had a stopwatch. This, to me, was quite a serious flaw, but thankfully it didn't affect my overall enjoyment of the film so much.Despite the aforementioned issue the mystery, intrigue, excitement and sense of fun that the film offers does help to cover up some of the weaknesses in the writing. It's certainly no masterpiece and it's not terribly original, but if you're looking for a reasonably exciting and intriguing film then you could do a lot worse than The Maze Runner.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A few moments of fabulous acting were seen only during some great action scenes. CGI was used at its best, 10 stars to that, if not for the first half this could have been an unmissable movie. Another good aspect was the diversification of cast from different cultural backgrounds. We rarely get to see a good mix of ethnicity in movies. I personally feel that Kaya Scodelario's role in the move wasn't justified well enough, she could have been omitted. We don't always need a female actor in a male movie, or vice versa. I give it a 7, and you need to watch this if you are up for some good CGI action. If not for the first half this could have been an unmissable movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its kind of Lord of the Flies take didn't really do it for me either . The characters were not what I was expecting either. The movie felt like it was more of a set up for the next one in the franchise. There were some nice moments but it just wasn't great.

In the interest of keeping the seats lined, I would like to correct some of these critiques. While the plot is relatively predictable, it certainly does not leave audiences feel as though it is lacking credibility and captivation. The back story is not essential to this movie, which I might add is the first of three, and will surly come in later films, until then the lack of details is one of the strongest things keeping audiences on the edges of their seats. The screenplay is phenomenally written, as can be expected from the Harvard magna cum laude graduate Noah Oppenheim, however in agreement with other reviews, the acting is a little forced and appears to be improbable at some key decisions which can be attributed to the novice director Wes Ball. Suggesting not to see The Maze Runner for its minor problems is just as critiquing The Godfather for Sonny's magically repairing windscreen. Overall the plot is intriguing and the film is one that keeps you coming back for the next installment, try to get out to see it on the big screen, highly recommended.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well done!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3090558/?ref_=tt_urv","StrayFeral","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5191301/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2014","I must admit I really missed the kind of movie where a bunch of kids go for an adventure and here it is, The Maze Runner. Well not really that the kids want to be there, they are put there. However still the movie satisfies me.To be precise, this is an adventure post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller (at least I would define it as such). And unlike Hunger Games, this one lacks all the political stuff (at least in this episode!) and instead focuses on the action and character development.The movie clearly points out in the end that there would be a sequel, but that's all. Everything the end teases with is that the next episode will focus on putting the kids into another big trouble and that's it. So no spoilers really.I will try to keep this out of any spoilers too, so will instead focus on only what the trailer suggests. And as the trailer shows, this movie is about a group of kids put into the centre of a maze which they have to explore and survive and meanwhile have to solve their own conflicts. None of the kids remembers anything, except in few days after they are put into the maze they remember just their name. From this point on starts the adventure. This is everything you will see in the trailer. Based on this alone, the movie flashed three things inside me immediately - ""Labyrinth"" (1986, David Bowie) - The Maze Runner is written in 2007, but who does not remembers ""The Labyrinth""? That was such a huge movie from my childhood. I still own it on blu-ray and the soundtrack on original CD and listen to it often. And I am not the only one, I am sure. And I am sure James Dashner, the author of the Maze Runner books was heavily been inspired by this movie, just he decided to make it darker. Nothing wrong really.Yes, the movie is based on books, but I never read them. If you just watch the movie you will experience one well narrated story, enough dose of unknown to make you puzzled and wait for the answers to appear, nice effects and not bad music.The most disappointing for me was the absence of a teaser after the credits. But I can live with it. After all I really enjoyed the movie.Now as I said, the movie flashed three things inside me and ""Labyrinth"" (1986) was the first one. Okay, the difference was that in ""Labyrinth"" they put Jennifer Connelly in the outskirts of the maze, while here they put the kids in the centre. The other two things however were the kids themselves.The main actor, Dylan O'Brien looks exactly like a very young version of Jean-Claude Van Damme. I am sure he can't do the Van Damme split, but he really does look like him. Maybe a version of Van Damme before ""Breakin"" (Yes, Van Damme does appear in ""Breakin"" too).The other thing is, this movie really flashes back a resemblance to ""The Goonies"" (1985) to me, because of Blake Cooper. This kid really resembles Chunk from the Goonies (Jeff Cohen). I don't know why, but he is one of the most memorable characters to be from The Maze Runner. Maybe because he is so different from the others.As I said, I really enjoyed the movie. What I miss is just a little more character development, which I hope to see in the next episode. And I really want somehow Blake Cooper back in the team!!My final verdict - a very enjoyable teen movie!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It generally has ambitious production values, is well-edited, briskly paced, decently acted, action packed, and features a thumping score. More importantly, it's a fairly faithful adaptation of James Dashner's brilliantly conceived, grim novel (the first in a trilogy if you exclude the prequel that was penned later), succinctly weaved together to satiate ardent fans of the series while being coherent enough to entertain viewers with no prior knowledge of Dashner's post- apocalyptic books.The minor deviations from the source material, taken in the name of creative liberty and with a commitment to manage cinematic time constraints do not detract from the story, and instead churn a refreshing spin on proceedings for those already familiar with the story. Ultimately, ""The Maze Runner"" turns out to be a thrilling sci-fi adventure with great energy and considerable style.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I thought this film would be a big let down like the Giver, but I was proved very wrong!The Maze runner starts off intense and will get anyone hooked in the first five minutes. The film has much mystery and suspense; that even I was curious on how it was going to go. The performances by the cast were okay. None stood out, but none were bad.The Action/ running sequences are very intense with the help of the decent soundtrack. The Visuals were pretty good but the one thing that stood out for me in this film was the sound effects. The sounds of the Grievers were terrifying and so well made that I still think of the roars at night.The Ending to this film will surely disappoint those that have not read the book, But I do believe they will explain everything in the sequel (That I hope comes out)The ending will be irrelevant at first, but it is explained in the possible sequel.As a reader, I enjoyed this adaptation greatly. There are new and left out scenes from the book (None that are important. Things are changed, but as a big fan of the book I still enjoyed the changed scenes.) Go see this film. it surely has brought the box office alive, along with pleasing me with a respectful YA Adaptation from the novel. Fans of the book will like it, and want more. People that haven't read it, should be pleased well enough to go see the sequel.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's about a boy who wakes up surrounded by a colony of teenagers who have built a world for themselves in the middle of nowhere. The only thing that they can see is this massive maze which no one dares to enter because it shuts after a while. The only people who do go inside the maze are the maze runners who are trying to find a way out. I understood the movie up to that point but when they started to explain why these teenagers were put there, I got lost. I'm sure that it will all come to light when they bring out the sequel, which is obviously bound to happen because of the ending but I hope that they will introduce some interesting characters which will make the movie much better. Apart from that, there are some decent elements to the movie like the big spiders and the fact that Thomas put them all there in the first place and I liked some of the intense moments like when they were trying to go through the maze the first time but it wasn't anything that aMAZING. Watchable!Round-Up: There's obviously a deep story behind this movie which will explain why they shipped these kids to the middle of nowhere, but were yet to see it. The director touched the matter near the end of the film but it still didn't explain why these spiders were killing people and what the girl and Thomas were actually doing before they got to this mysterious island. There are a few familiar faces in the movie like Will Poulter from Son Of Ranbow and We're The Millers and Thomas Brodick-Sangstar from the Game Of Thrones and Love Actually but it wasn't there best performance. I also recognised the guy who played Alby (Aml Ameen) from the Bill, which used to be a cop drama in the UK but I haven't seen the guy who played the lead (Dylan O'Brien) in anything else. The mysterious girl (Kaya Scodelario) is also from the UK and she had a brief role in Moon and also starred in Clash Of The Titans but I doubt that her part in this movie has really been revealed yet. Anyway, it's a watchable movie that has some intense moments and a good concept but I honestly don't think that we have seen the best from this franchise yet.Budget: $34milion Worldwide Gross: $341millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their mysterious/adventures about a colony of teenagers who have been put in the middle of nowhere with a maze as there only escape. 5/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Was fantastic, great written, and the action was amazing. This movie is based on the book, and I am disappointed over this movie. I will compare the book to the movie, bad and good sides and if you should watch it. The Maze Runner had a big mistake in the movie. They kind of changed everything. The story timeline didn't go chronologically as in the book, everything went to fast, compared to the book, were you got to wait, and the action was building up. Here in the movie, we got just everything at the same time. The most similar thing that was with the book and movie, was that they had the same concept and key scenes from the book, even if they of course changed it in their way. Thomas is the main character, and in the book, he get friends. One of his best friends was Chuck. Chuck was a big role in the book, but in the movie, Chuck feeled like a background character. That annoyed me a lot, and like everything in the movie. Beside that they changed the book, the rest of the movie was a waste, too. The actors didn't play well, the movie went to fast, nothing seemed so important, beside their main escape, and I don't know, just most of the movie was bad. It had some good sides, like good music score and great scenography, but beside that, nothing good. If you loved The Maze Runner book like me, and doesn't want to make it worse for yourself, you should not watch Maze Runner. If you like action and Sci-fi, this may be the movie for you, but like I mentioned, beside music and scenography, it was nothing good, and if you want to see people run, it is not a movie for you, because they're not running a lot. So overall, this movie is a waste.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

None of the teenagers present in the glade have any memory of their past and they have been trying to find the way out of this maze for two years-since the first boy was sent into the maze. Of course, it's easy to predict that Thomas will be the best maze runner ever who finds a way out.Even though the first half is extremely well done and quite engrossing, the movie loses its pace in the second half. There are a few plot holes because of the lazy script-writing done.There are numerous occasions which don't have any resemblance to their description shown in the novel. As difficult as getting out of the maze seems in the beginning, there is absolutely no thrill factor in the climax sequence. The reason as to why they were put in the maze doesn't seem plausible at all, while the reason given in the novel is easily believable.The direction, sound effects and cinematography are top-notch. The scenes were well enacted by casts.The movie is worth watching at least once for its thrilling action sequences and authenticity of the locations(and grievers) as they were described in the book.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","The potential was there, but the payoff was unfortunately not.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6674810/?ref_=tt_urv","Seb_3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114664628/?ref_=tt_urv","8 March 2021","I truly believe that this could been a great movie, with some serious impact for the adventure seeking audience, though the greatness is held back by the script, performances and use of time management.Like we have seen so many times before, trying to cram too much story and character development in a small amount of time, in this movies case, under 2 hours. It ended up feeling filled to the brim with a story that could easily have been spread out over 2 hours and 30 minutes, or more - It's cut short though, both with the actual runtime, but also the amount of time which the movie spans across - 3 or 4 days, just seems unrealistic in every sense-able way.
All we needed was more time to get to know the characters and actually feel for them, so the impacting moments and rivalries would have an actual payoff in the end.Though it was pretty straight forward I thought that the last act stepped up its game, with some pretty alright surprises which kept me engaged even if most of the movie was pretty mediocre.
I think one of the main reasons I didn't quite connect with the characters was that some of the performances felt cheese, with the characters reactions to their surroundings didn't match their performances.
The script didn't help the actors and actresses on this department either, as it felt straight up dumb at times, as the audience wasn't allowed to think for themselves, as everything had to be told through dialogue and not the visuals on the screen.
At times it even felt like the concept was ripped straight out of a high school movie, about the bully and the ""weird"" kid stepping up to fill his shoes.Despite the movie not succeeding in my opinion, I think the book will. I might give this one a read, and focus on that experience instead of the movie, as I honestly liked the premise of the story and environment, just not the execution.5/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The protagonist is Thomas, a 16-year boy who wakes up inside an underground service elevator which stops at the surface, a large grassy area (The Glade) enclosed by tall, stone walls (The Maze). Thomas has no memory of his identity and through his perspective we discover that the group of male youths who inhabit the Glade have formed a rudimentary society with each boy assuming a specialized task. The 'maze runners' are tasked with exploring and mapping the surrounding labyrinthine structure with the purpose of finding not only a way of escape but also a reason for their predicament. The movie has echoes of Vincenzo Natali's SF horror film The Cube with the Maze's moving walls and has a similar level of prolonged tension and resolution. I was genuinely gripped by the well-paced narrative and the film held my attention to the very end with glimpses of a post-apocalyptic world. An excellent addition to the genre.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This first movie leaves you with sooo many questions that might be considered by many as plot holes, but in my opinion you get these questions answered in the later movies.

More importantly, the story makes little to no sense--why couldn't the adults running the ""experiment"" just put the boys in computer simulated tests?! There's absolutely no good reason for the boys--and one girl--to have to actually endure all the terrifying nightmare violence and horrific deaths of their fellow captives. The explanation by the Director for why the boys were in the Glade and Maze is just so completely illogical and silly and stupid. Some kids will love this movie if they're the sort that doesn't question movies--or things--too deeply or if they're easily entertained by shallow, visually stimulating spectacles. Personally, I prefer a more intelligent, better thought out story, and I think a lot of kids do, too.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I watch Teen Wolf, have seen bits of Skins and Game of Thrones, so I was familiar with a few of the actors. Dylan kills it in Teen Wolf, and showed his dramatic/intense acting abilities in season three. A lot of the actors in this movie have shown a lot of promising abilities, so I was hopeful going into it. I purposefully kept myself from reading the book because I love having surprises and tension when I see a movie for the first time. And man, am I glad I did. This movie is so much better when you learn everything alongside Thomas. There is no bullshit romance, which I appreciate. They stayed focused on what was happening, and did it right. There was a great balance of tension. There would be an incredibly intense and stressful scene, but not too much of it and not too little. And the stressful scenes were done right. They didn't shy away from having characters die, showing some violence and a little gore. The entire situation and many scenes were so shockingly dark, which was also oddly refreshing. They focused on the relationships between the characters, the action/mystery, and not to mention that the affects were great. The maze, the grievers, I loved it all. Considering how small the budget was, and how little time they had to shoot it, it all comes together surprisingly well. Usually I dislike the main character. They are too whiny, too needy, too much focus on them, and other characters don't get the attention they deserve. However, I actually liked Thomas a lot. I tried my best to put my love for Dylan O'Brien aside, but I can't help but be so extremely proud and happy for him. He managed to portray this main character in a way that draws the audience him. Thomas takes a little while to get settled in (understandably) but once he does, he is awesome. He portrayed really great leadership qualities; for once, I actually felt that this character deserved the ""leadership"" and really earned it. There were quite a few heavy scenes, and he pulled them off with conviction and genuine emotions that made my throat swell and my eyes water. Will Poulter also was amazing. Basically everyone was amazing. There are definitely mixed reviews, and I find it such a shame. Seeing as The Hunger Games was released first, every YA adaptation is now immediately compared to it and seen as a ""wannabe."" But watching Maze Runner, it is definitely it's own film. Of course there are book fans who may be disappointed in changes that were made, but if they had stuck to the book 100%, there would be even more complaints about the ""repeated YA clichés"". It must have been so hard to try to create a movie, and balance it between it's YA components and also trying to make it different at the same time. I appreciate the work they did, and while there are plenty of clichés in the book, somehow they are pulled off in a very refreshing way. I would suggest that in order to really enjoy this film, don't go into it thinking ""Great, another YA adaptation."" Just go into it thinking of it as it's own movie, like any other movie you go see at the theaters. Go into it and just enjoy the ride. Above all else, this movie is an amazing adventure/thrilling story. The pacing, the claustrophobia of it all, the acting, the affects, it's all pulled off in a very surprisingly entertaining way. Go watch it, if you are willing, go see it in IMAX! I definitely wish I had seen it in IMAX the first time because it is one of those films that would be worth it. Overall, there are definitely some weaknesses to the movie that critics will be all over, but the strengths definitely override them and make it a movie worth seeing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Following in the wake of the ""Harry Potter"" films, other series were quickly put into production to see if they could be the next billion dollar franchises. Some, such as the ""Golden Compass"" simply fizzled whereas ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"" hit pay dirt. In light of these big bucks, it's not surprising that ""Maze Runner"" would make it to the screen, since it's just the first of three books--three books which seem strongly inspired by ""The Hunger Games""...only a bit gloomier. And, given that it's already earned about three times its cost just here in the States, it's not surprising that the sequel is due to be released next September.So is the film any good? Well, it looks nice. Other than that, no. It's violent and nihilistic without the interesting social commentary or originality that you get from the ""Hunger Games"" films. Instead, it's just ultra-violent and nasty--with scores of teens being killed for our entertainment. Plus, in the ""The Hunger Games"" films you have plucky and likable characters with some depth, but in ""The Maze Runner"" they seem much more flat and ill-defined. In other words, they're mostly just there to be killed or survive but little else.

It had some thrilling 'heart in the mouth' scenes and it left me excited to watch the next in the series. It boasted a talented cast as well as encouraging bravery scenes as well as a terrifying monster. I would highly recommend particularly if you are a fan of dystopian novels/ films such as the hunger games and lord of the flies. I see many have just called it a hunger games spin off however I feel it differed in many ways and was just as good.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The protagonist is Thomas, a 16-year boy who wakes up inside an underground service elevator which stops at the surface, a large grassy area (The Glade) enclosed by tall, stone walls (The Maze). Thomas has no memory of his identity and through his perspective we discover that the group of male youths who inhabit the Glade have formed a rudimentary society with each boy assuming a specialised task. The 'maze runners' are tasked with exploring and mapping the surrounding labyrinthine structure with the purpose of finding not only a way of escape but also a reason for their predicament. The movie has echoes of Vincenzo Natali's SF horror film The Cube with the Maze's moving walls and has a similar level of prolonged tension and resolution. I was genuinely gripped by the well-paced narrative and the film held my attention to the very end with glimpses of a post-apocalyptic world. An excellent addition to the genre and I will definitely be watching the sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm also aware of the clichés and monotony often present in the plot. But none of that bothers me.This movie gives me the opportunity to watch a high-budget dystopian derivative of 'Lord of the Flies'. Our young ones are trapped within a labyrinth. It's made me curious about where this is going, how it will unfold, and why.The actors are playing their roles very tastefully, in my opinion.

An educated viewer can't shake the awareness of censorship.For example, during the more harried sequences (mostly involving a battle or pursuit via 'grievers') the filmmakers use the shadowy quick-edits to obscure the violence.Luckily the CGI monsters are shown in full.The 'grievers' are buffalo-sized mechanical beetles. As far as creatures go, they're truly outstanding, original and horrific.The only problem stems from a false hint at the surreal.If you pay close attention, The Maze Runner is an astounding allegory for entering adulthood. This is in keeping with the summer trend of allegorical science fiction, with Snowpiercer (which I do recommend) and The Zero Theorem (which I don't).The plot develops lightning fast. This in turn can lead to confusion.Or maybe I'm just too old for this sort of thriller.So, yes, an elevator shaft is reminiscent of the birth canal.Yes, a labyrinth is a classic metaphor for life.Yes, the supporting characters resemble archetypes.But the mind-bending portion of this thrill ride's a red herring.Because, no, the plot doesn't take place inside the protagonist's head. The viewer need not be concerned with how individual events fit into the self-contained metaphor.Consider the sequence of obstacles Thomas (played by Dylan O'Brien) must overcome while fleeing the first griever. Think about the ways he adapts to the physical environment, the increasing risk and differing tasks required to move forward.A few notes on the acting.The girl, Kaya Scodelario, turns in a solid performance as Teresa. As does Blake Cooper playing Chuck, the protagonist's younger buddy.Thomas Brodie-Sangster (of Game of Thrones fame) plays Newt, punching the thespian clock with efficiency.Will Poulter from We're the Millers plays a bit of a one-note character but executes the role proficiently. I like this guy; he's going places.Patricia Clarkson plays Ava Paige, a mash-up of Glenn Close's Nova Prime in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jodie Foster's Secretary Delacourt in Elysium. Much like Teresa, we learn very little about Ava.The mix of action, suspense and adequate special effects add up to a compelling thriller and a strong entry into the YA novel-turned-film catalogue.See it in IMAX - this is one you won't want to miss.Things aren't looking good for the Ender's Game franchise.However, according to Wikipedia, ""Two weeks prior to (The Maze Runner's) release 20th Century Fox decided to move ahead with the sequel and pre-production began in early September 2014 in New Mexico.""Whether or not the box office earnings compensate for the $34 million budget, it seems like we'll be seeing a follow-up.If anyone's looking, I'll be in my tent, eagerly awaiting The Scorch Trials.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Its not per say a BAD movie, however, its not something that you would run to tell your friend about. Also, if you read the book- the story seemed rushed in the film.

In some scenes, this movie almost allows us to see inside the minds of those figures, as well as the minds of personages.Other thing that, particularly, I liked about the movie is the director clearly explain what is happening. And the thing that have viewers thought-provoking on the movie, is how the personages will get out the labyrinth .The movie personages have many boys and only one girl, but I think for this reason is better.

Good cast and characters, excellent effects, and the director Wes Ball does a great job with the action and with keeping the tension high and the characters engaged. Casting the great Patricia Clarkson, star of many of my favorite indie films, is the cherry on top.The fun of a story like this is seeing how different personalities deal with the situation and with each other, and imagining how you'd react in their shoes. Normally I'm not into movies with almost no female characters, and the arrival of Teresa made me queasy with worry for her, but fortunately this movie is not like real life so she was only threatened by the deadly mechs. I appreciated that there was no attempt at ""humor"" via the boys leering at or harassing her.I'm worried the intrigue will fade in the sequels (as it did for me the longer Lost went on and we knew more about who set up that particular devious game), but I'll definitely check out the next movie in the series because this was a fun watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The actors did a great job portraying their roles and Wes Ball did a great job making this movie the best it could be. The story was gripping and there were definitely some suspenseful scenes but they were executed very well. I was a little worried how they were going to do the ending because it's very emotional but it was really well done. The cinematography was very cool as it provided the viewer a real experience of the maze. I said this before but I was really interested how they were going to present the maze itself and after I saw the movie I think that was one of my favorite parts because it was just so cool and forbidding with it's ivy covered walls and gritty texture. Lastly, I have read the first book and was quite excited for the movie. The movie certainly didn't disappoint and stayed true to the book for the most part.

I saw this movie with little expectation owing to the fact that movies with youngsters as a focus of recent memory has most of the time had dull predictable teeny soapy influences with some crappy action scenes at the end to please a few audiences.This movie doesn't waste time with those staffs, never gets dull, keeps to the thrill through out the entire duration. The effects were top notched making the action scenes fantastic. Characters were interesting to see and the overall shooting of the movie was awesome.Now, I am not saying this movie is perfect. It has its fair share of problems, however this movie really demands recommendation. For once we have a movie that's willing not to follow the clichés laid out by these teeny movies out there. With that said, I was so relieved that no big fuss was made among the boys with the arrival of the girl. Like I said before its only action business.I was asking myself many questions during during the last quarter of the movie. But at the end I realized that it was a trilogy, I think most of the questions would be answered in the subsequent series. I don't understand why some people would criticize the movie in this regard when it has been made clear that there would be a follow up.If you, like me are tired of the cliché ridden dull, soapy, teeny dramas we are being fed to of late, then you should certainly check this out, I am sure you wouldn't be disappointed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Or how can you put it...Hollywood is again using very young actors, and the plot or theme is,sigh,again about a group of people competing in order to survive. And the sub- theme about society is dividing people into a few class. Just mention The ""Harry Potter"",""Hunger Games"" series, plus ""Divergent"",""Ender's Game"",TV-series ""The 100"",""The Giver"" etc. etc. Of course there are differences of those movies/series. But the overall big picture is quite easy to see that Hollywood is into the ""youth competing for their life""-kind of genre these years. Plus the placement is very often a society who put the citizen into a few classes right from birth or given when they are teens.I was close to give this movie only 2 stars because I'm getting tired of seeing the same theme repeating over and over again from different movies. But I gave it a 3 star because of the good special effects. And the kids gave an okay performance despite an mediocre manuscript. I know the story should be a big thing as a book. I don't know about that, but I can't just give my review of the movie.Don't give me wrong. I don't mind young actors. But they should be giving characters that seems plausible to the story. Plus in most cases, the older actors with more experience, will, In my mind, just act better than preteen/teen/tweens etc. Fx I like ""Lord of the flies"" because the actors where very good. But besides that, the movie had a good story and manuscript. Plus at that time the movies plot was original. Making a movie like that one or two times a year, and the originality quickly fades out.To go into the detail of ""The Maze runner"" it was quickly to me, it had some things that could make it a better movie. From the start of the movie, there's a lot of secrecy about why the main character (Thomas) can't get out of the area they are put and go into the maze. Thats quite obvious that's just put in there in the movie, to give the audience some mystery. But for me, that already broke down my ""4th wall"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall), or the realism of the movie got broken there. For me, if it should be more realistic, it would be more realistic if the people who was put there in the maze, to right away give warnings to newcomers about how dangerous it would be to step into.The ""greenies"" or newcomers to the maze, are quickly told, they have to work for the community. That also seemed a bit odd to me. They get the food served on (metal)plate each month, so what is there to be done more really? But I guess that was another odd thing that was placed there just to give a bit of false drama.Despite all those things, the rest of the movie was okay because you got curious what the maze had to offer. But it was rather predictable. Okay. No spoilers from me. But you can watch it one Sunday if you feel bored. But I would recommend ""Rollerball"" (1975),""The running Man"" (1987) and ""The lord of the flies"" (1990) instead if you want a bit similar themes.Tommo Boy","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The transition from page to screen, while poised for a sequel, might have felt slightly underdeveloped, yet the film's first chapter masterfully explores its complex and nuanced world, even as it courts occasional critique.The narrative plunges us into an enigmatic environment characterized by three distinct settings: an intricately designed maze, a sprawling desert, and the urban decay of buildings and a city. This journey begins shrouded in mystery, as characters find themselves in an alien place, stripped of their memories and understanding of their purpose. This foundation of uncertainty adds a compelling unpredictability to the storyline, focusing on the characters' battle with the maze. By prioritizing the collective struggle over individual backstories and personalities, the film cleverly maintains a tight grip on the audience's engagement, navigating through an overwhelmingly alien setting with a singular goal: escape.A notable aspect of 'The Maze Runner' is its dedication to realism, particularly in depicting life within the Glade. The cast's pre-production survival training in an empty lot, followed by a night spent on set, greatly enhances the authenticity of their portrayal, imbuing the film with a tangible sense of survivalist camaraderie and desperation.Dylan O'Brien's performance as the lead, previously seen in a markedly different role in 'The Internship,' showcases his versatility as an actor. His transformation is so complete that he becomes unrecognizable, embodying his character's journey with a depth that anchors the film's expansive and fantastical world.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie followed the books very nicely, with few edits that made it even more interesting.I think this movie really does do an incredible job of portraying the book and storyline, and the action scenes got your heart speeding up and praying for the charecters.Newt and Thomas's chemistry was flawless, their jokes and parent-son relationship was very nicely portrayed.The past link between Thomas and Teresa was also incredible. They're both confused about who they are, but you can almsot see the link, You can just tell they knew eachother before the Glade.Gally was portrayed by one heck of an actor. Will Poulter has the bully charecter down to the stance. Kudos to him.Minho also was cast perfectly. Ki Hong Lee has the sass, the seriousness, and the attitude all required for his charecter, making him entertaining to watch as he slowly comes to accept Thomas as an impressive figure.Hope this helps, I HIGHLY reccomened.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They don't know why they are here and they don't know the purpose of all of this.Director Wes Ball brilliantly intertwines the science-fiction and the triller in this film with a crescendo of suspense that creates dramatic tension.I like this movie because the famous actors of the cast like Dylan O'brian have very well played their roles of teenagers lost in a dystopian world. They plunged us into this post apocalyptic world with them. We were disconnected from real life and bewitched by this wonderful story. However, I had a little trouble getting attached to a few characters like Teressa and Gally.The work of the art direction is impressive with the various special effects and the monsters giving us goosebumps.I recommend this movie which is a perfect balance between action, dialogue and thrills with a lot of mystery, suspense, questioning throughout the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I won't write-up the plot, since it's been written elsewhere and on other reviews; straight into the review we go.""The Maze Runner"" is a surprisingly fantastic sci-fi thriller that succeeds by having superb acting, fantastic visual effects with a stellar production design, a pulse-pounding musical score, focused direction and a well-written script that, while does have clichés, works with them in a very good and fresh way. I personally was impressed with the acting a great deal, especially Dylan O'Brien and Aml Ameen. The visual effects were awesome and never looked cheesy or under-valued, which is even cooler since the film is fairly low- budgeted compared to most blockbusters, taking the ""District 9""- route. Wes Ball's direction was outstanding, the way he captured the dark, haunting atmosphere, that sense of a looming evil and how the unknown was the biggest enemy, not just the terrifying Grievers (which were actually creepy). The script, too, was outstanding, but seemed to lack the full force the film required to be an absolute SF classic. It's here one can draw many comparisons, but even so, it was still well-written and didn't slip up once, playing into its clichés by placing them in spots you don't see coming until they happen, leaving you with the ""Ah, i should have seen that coming!""- moment.""The Maze Runner"" is a great beginning to a new series of films that will probably extend outside a trilogy, with a prequel having been written and another on the way next year. Hopefully ""The Scorch Trials"" step up the atmosphere and writing, and with original cast members attached and Wes Ball directing still, i have high hopes.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I have seen that some of the people I follow for book reviews have read it, and it got mixed reviews. However, sometimes even bad books can be made into good movies or TV shows. Recently The 100 comes into mind, which was like this. It probably also occurred to me, because it has similar themes. Teens trying to survive in a world they don't know much of after an apocalypse.This movie is very action packed. The pacing is good for the most part, however, the ending was a bit abrupt. As if they were shooting, looked at what they had, and realised that they spent too much time on the stuff so far, so they had to finish it already. The story itself isn't typical current YA. Mercifully, no romance! There could be in the future, but not right now. The beginning made me think of Lord of the Flies. While there are moments when it could go that way, it doesn't. Perhaps the makers had enough faith in humanity to think that when a bunch of boys get together, they don't necessarily go for the ""kill 'em all"" scenario. Even though there are indications that there were more violent days, they could establish peace.There aren't any movies this one specifically reminds me of. That could just be that other than superhero movies, I rarely watch stories with this level of testosterone. Or it could just be that most of it was really vague, and the answers weren't forthcoming. I could liken it to The Hunger Games. However, while it does happen in an enclosed space, there isn't that sense of Big Brother, since the boys don't know where they are, or why. It is obvious that someone is watching, and that some aspects of the environment are controlled, but not to that extent. The people trapped are also victims of some system, but it's not the overarching sense. I even considered that like in another movie that I saw about a futuristic prison that people escape, only to find out that there is no one else out there, and everything was running on automation all along. This idea was actually reinforced by the look of the maze. It had a lot of rust and decay, more than 3 years of the alleged use of the place would indicate in my opinion. So while some details of the story are similar to some other stories I've seen, they only came into my mind afterwards.The characters are a bit clichéd, but it could just be that the action was favoured instead of the character building. The action was really good, had my heart pounding at times, so I didn't mind. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is the main character. It is his appearance that kick starts the changes in the camp. While this could be a flaw in the story, there are indications that this isn't a coincidence, and after a while that can become obvious. There were also some things about the events surrounding him that left me with questions. I hope they will be answered in the next movies. Though if I know myself, I won't stand it that long, and soon enough you will be seeing book reviews of this series, so watch this space. Thomas is the boy who acts, and isn't content to let the bigger, stronger boys lead him. He becomes a leader himself. Thomas' character takes the adventurous character of Stiles to a new level. He is the kind of guy that sees a mountain, and wants to know what's behind it. He also runs towards danger, so he's a kind of hero. I'm not sure if I actually like him, but I often agree with him. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the leader in the camp. He is a good leader, though one of his decisions is strange, because he seems to usually delegate, but then he doesn't. That part felt a bit out of character, but could be better grounded in the book, or not there at all. Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is Thomas' ally. They have a regular bromance from the start. It may come from Newt's generally relaxed nature, but they have a connection. In this story the actor's British accent felt weird. Everyone sounded American, and then he opened his mouth. I wonder if that was for the character, or an oversight, or he just had a hard time getting rid of it and they left it like that. In spite of this, I soon forgot about his accent, as he formed a really likable character. Gally (Will Poulter) is the evil guy. He is a bit of a cliché from the very start. The bully. The guy who never agrees with Thomas. The guy you just know will end up doing something horrible. He is also the opposite of Thomas in that if he sees a mountain, he just sees the peaks, and then looks around and feels content with what he has. In a way, like a lot of bullies, he's scared of change, of anything different from what he knows. I almost felt sorry for him.The ending was kind of a surprise. Though frankly, I didn't know what to expect. In fact, the end brought up more questions than answers. Why I'm sure the series will be on many new reading lists, and sales will increase. People generally aren't that good at waiting for answers.Overall, an exciting movie, and a baffling one. I kind of hoped to decide just how much I liked it in the course of writing this review. I'm still not sure, thus the 3 stars. I do recommend it though, if not for anything but the exciting action, and the interesting mystery. Don't expect to leave the theatre fully satisfied though. Frustrated would be more like it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

That is not how you critic a film.You should critic it as a sole movie and how much it entertained you and potentially book referencing but to me that's not important. Who cares if it has been done before or a same idea has been produced. If you don't like the idea don't watch it.I personally loved this film. So much so that I have watched it 3 times now and I actually want to watch it again. It has everything you want form a dystopian nightmare action film. Unreal visuals, good audio mastering and the acting is great.Also don't watch this on a mincy 24 inch tv with no audio system and expect the same experience. I have shown this to a few friends on my 100 inch screen with a banging sound system and they all completely changed their minds about it after the experience. Some movies are meant for the big screen and this is definitely one of them (along with Mad max) Don't watch that movie without a decent sub)I gave it a 9 out of 10 for how the film entertained me and its value for me coming back.

Outside of ""Mortal Instruments"", all of them have been hugely successful at the Box Office, with ""The Hunger Games"" getting the most critical praise, and deservedly so in my opinion. Like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"", ""The Maze Runner"" seems to take part in a Dystopian future. I read the first book, on which ""The Maze Runner"" movie is based, after I saw the first trailer. While not into the book as much as ""The Hunger Games"" Books and the first ""Divergent"" Book (Haven't read the others yet), I still liked it. The movie adaption mirrors my feelings for the most part on the book. The movie was not great, but it was alright, and at the end – You want to know what happens next. The movie opens with a teenage boy, played by Dylan O'Brien, ascending upward in a freight elevator. The elevator opens to a bunch of teenage boys. O'Brien's character does not remember his name, nor his past. He is told all of the boys went through this, and he will remember his name in a day or two – and this comes to pass, eventually remembering his name is Thomas. The boys are all living in a community, with a grassy square, they have named ""The Glade"", surrounded on all sides by giant concrete walls, one of which opens to a Maze. The oldest boy dates back 3 years being there, with a new boy a coming up in the elevator every month, along with supplies. Some of the boys, named ""The Runners"" explore the Maze during the day, in hopes of finding a way out, but must return to ""The Glade"" at night, before the doors close, and creatures they call ""The Grievers"", who they haven't seen, but heard, come out in the Maze. Anyone who has not made it back before the doors closed has been killed by ""The Grievers"". For those who read the book, there are some changes, but the narrative is generally followed. The young actors all do pretty well. As I said the movie was alright. Sometimes I though additional parts were needed or parts needed to be elongated to make it a great film. But in terms of setting the table for the series (I admit presumably – I will be starting the 2nd book soon), and in wanting to know what happens next – Mission Accomplished. 3 out of 4 Stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Believability low. Cringe moments aplenty. Overacting not scarce. Hero comes and thinks up obvious solution that somehow evades remaining characters' mind the whole time they were there.Some movies excel at amazing you in how great the hero is for doing/coming up with something. This one makes mindless supporting characters just so you can have your hero look smart in comparison. I don't remember old movies like ""Back to the Future"" or ""Last Action Hero"" being this bad in this department despite being made over 2 decades ago and despite being marketed towards the same audience, so forgive me if I don't accept the ""but it's for kids/teenagers"" excuse.Characters aren't interesting enough to pull you into the story, and story isn't interesting enough (except the ending) to make you care about the characters. Scodelario and Brodie-Sangster are shining lights in an otherwise bleak cast that can't wait to take their turn in overacting. These are young actors that don't have a lot of experience, so I don't think they're the ones to blame. If anything it probably says more about the direction than the actors.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I rated this ""teenage movie"" this high because it moved me from the very first scenes - the elevator going up, out of control, the person inside not remembering anything about himself, not even his name. He comes up and he is bewildered, terrified, overwhelmed. And what does he find? That he is caged in a big concrete box, with no escape but through an incredibly dangerous and intricate maze that closes at night fall and changes every night and then opens up again every morning. And there was this sense, from the beginning - there is some hidden meaning behind all this, that he chose this life even if he does not remember doing so. Is this a test? Is this a trial? Are the beings who sent those kids here benevolent, do they care at all, or is this just entertainment to them, like watching ants? To me, layers and layers of deep symbolic meaning permeated the whole action of the film. It resonated, disturbed me and moved me as very few movies do. This movie will soon be forgotten, as it is nothing really special. But the story it tells is universal as long as people continue being born. And it manages to capture this story with rare precision and force.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After seeing both franchises, I feel that it is terribly difficult not to give in to the temptation to compare the ""Maze Runner"" and ""Hunger Games"" films because they are extraordinarily similar, although ""Maze Runner"", for several reasons, is much more adult and raises even deeper moral questions.In ""Hunger Games"", we saw a dystopian future in a kind of new Roman Empire where a dictator, in a centralist megalopolis called, simply, Capital, throws young couples into an arena to fight to the death, as if they were gladiators. Well, this film gives us almost the same thing, with slight changes: the arena is a maze, we don't know what puts the kids in there, and we don't know what's outside the maze, but it doesn't seem like anything good. However, the point where the film actually gains an important advantage is the mystery factor: like Thomas, we, the audience, do not know anything of what is happening, and we will have to follow the boys to find out. Another thing that I found interesting is the way in which the film is concerned with showing and developing young people's relationships with each other: we have suspicion, admiration, conflicts and, after a certain moment, crossed love interests.The film features a number of young actors, but almost all are safe bets and have already proven their talent in other works. This is the case of Dylan O'Brian, the protagonist, and the actors Aml Ameen, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. The cast's performance is quite good, and they are very committed to their characters. I really liked the work of O'Brian, Lee and Will Poulter, I think they are the strongest actors in the film. Scodelario is an interesting actress, but I think that in this film she didn't have much to do besides being the love interest of almost the entire cast.The film has excellent production values and there is a lot of money tied up in high quality CGI that makes the maze look like an amazing death machine, made by someone who can only be mad. The biomechanical creatures that inhabit the maze are equally extraordinary and intimidating. The film has excellent cinematography, is visually magnificent and makes the most of light and colors. The soundtrack also deserves a mention. Composed by John Paesano, whom I did not know, it is an intense soundtrack, with an epic and deep sense.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can't think what made me watch this last night, but I know if I don't review it right now, it will fade completely from my memory (not a bad thing), as it has, quite simply, not a single thing to recommend it (it's not even so bad it's good)... I only hope I remember not to watch the next instalment (yes, as has been mentioned by other reviewers, this is the first in a trilogy-Hollywood's latest ploy in parting you from as much money as possible-subdividing stories that have simple plots that could be dealt with quickly and efficiently, into several movies that contain mainly filler, irrelevant subplots, and, especially in this case, pages of utterly inane and pointless dialogue)...This is obviously taking advantage of the success of the 'Mockingjay' series, but has none of the quality of cast, spectacle, decent effects, nor dark, serious back-plot of those films... Bad as they were, they were all infinitely better than this...Every actor was awful (where did they find them), even the usually reliable Patricia Clarkson, who makes a brief appearance at the end, and whom I re-saw recently in 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'-she should be ashamed of herself for 'phoning in her performance, but it at least illustrates the point that the blame for this travesty should lie squarely on the shoulders of the director, Wes Ball. Most of his work has been in TV, and I suggest he returns there, where he can do less damage... The SFX were so-so, some of them shown on such a dark screen it was difficult to make anything out... In an age of CGI, it's hard to make a mess of this aspect of film-making, and yet this crew succeeded...But the 'plot', that's my main gripe-it just made no sense whatsoever-riddles with holes and illogicities-too many to list here-a group of boys, in an isolated community, would not simply turn to farming the land and following rules set down arbitrarily by one of their number-they would constantly squabble, argue and fight for supremacy and their own point of view-form gangs and alliances, question anybody's right to command, lie, steal and cheat-remember 'Lord of the Flies', or the feral tribe of children in 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'?.. Or even, dare I mention it the Hunger Games themselves?.. They smacked of the truth-this is just a modern-day piece of PC propaganda (let's get along and love each other-only not in the physical sense, because...)-I know it was written for the teenage/young adult market, but it's just so out of kilter, it felt awkward-or did for some of the time, because I fell asleep for 20 mins., woke up, and realized I hadn't missed a single thing... Says it all.really...So, rather than watch this steaming pile of ordure, or either of its sequels, turn off the TV and watch some paint drying instead-you'll find it more entertaining and less frustrating, and you can thank me later...Wasn't so short after all...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Maze Runner Review: A Thrilling Adventure with a Dash of Mystery","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8922982/?ref_=tt_urv","antonioaustin-39311","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163241968/?ref_=tt_urv","12 March 2023","The Maze Runner is a 2014 American dystopian science fiction film directed by Wes Ball, based on the novel of the same name by James Dashner. The movie follows a group of teenage boys who are trapped in a maze, and their struggle to find a way out while uncovering the dark secrets of their imprisonment. Here's my 8/10 review of the movie.Firstly, the acting in Maze Runner is top-notch. Dylan O'Brien, who plays the protagonist Thomas, delivers a convincing performance as a young man who is brave, curious, and determined to find answers. His chemistry with the other actors is also remarkable, especially with Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who portrays Newt. The supporting cast, including Will Poulter and Kaya Scodelario, also shines in their respective roles. Their performances add depth to the movie, making it more than just a mindless action film.The film's visual effects are also noteworthy. The maze itself is impressive, with its towering walls and intricate design. The Grievers, the menacing creatures that lurk within the maze, are terrifying and well-designed, adding an extra layer of suspense to the story. The cinematography is equally impressive, with breathtaking landscapes and thrilling chase sequences that keep the audience on the edge of their seats.One of the things that make Maze Runner stand out is its pacing. The film moves at a brisk pace, never slowing down long enough for the audience to get bored. Every scene feels essential, propelling the story forward and building suspense. The balance between action and mystery is well-maintained, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.The movie's soundtrack is another standout element. The music, composed by John Paesano, perfectly captures the mood of the film, adding an extra layer of tension and emotion. The score enhances the visuals, making the audience feel as if they are part of the movie's world.However, despite its many strengths, Maze Runner is not without its flaws. The movie's plot is at times convoluted, with some elements feeling underdeveloped or rushed. The ending, in particular, may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied, as it raises more questions than it answers.Another issue with the movie is its lack of diversity. The cast is predominantly male and white, with only a few female and non-white characters. This lack of representation may be off-putting to some viewers and detracts from the movie's potential impact.In conclusion, Maze Runner is a thrilling adventure that delivers on action, suspense, and mystery. The film's impressive acting, visual effects, pacing, and soundtrack make it a must-watch for fans of the sci-fi genre. However, the movie's plot may be too convoluted for some, and its lack of diversity is a notable drawback. Despite these flaws, Maze Runner is a solid movie that's sure to entertain audiences. I would give it an 8/10 rating.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This post-apocalyptic film is based off a book series written by James Dashner. And I honestly believe it's one of the best dystopian film adapted from a novel. This is the first film of the series, and I do believe it is the most insteresting one of all three. From start to finish, it was very entertaning.The scenario is well developed and it is out of the ordinary. The characters are weel played by an incredible cast to carry out the script. The actors all do their job perfectly. I think that Dylan O'brien really outdid himself by playing the role of Thomas, the main characters.It is simply astonishing how this film is able to intertwines with suspens, actions but also emotions. I can tell you I was completly overwhelmed at the end of the movie.It is one of the fiew movies that I enjoyed every second of. I wish I could watch it for the first time again. This is definitly a must watch. I would 100% recommend it. I haven't read the books yet, but I am looking forward to reading them.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have never read the books and didn't even really know the full synopsis either. I figured the movie would be decent at best. Much to my surprise, I was wrong. This movie was so awesome it really blew me away. The special effects and monsters in the movie are freaking awesome. If you have any second thoughts about watching this, put them to the side and get ready for one heck of a thrill ride. You won't regret it. I will say that, I didn't much care for the boy who played off of we're the millers. His character was a bit lame. The plot was really cool and intriguing. Again, me not knowing anything about the movie helped me grow to like it. I have heard that those who have read the book didn't really care for the movie, but I would say it's a nice little gem. They're already filming part 2 as well, so hop on the train while it's fresh and enjoy your viewing.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong I quite like this genre Hunger games is a big favourite but i just got the impression this would be a bad copy but how wrong i was it was excellent. The start was a little slow but once the Maze became came into play it got exciting. Very brave to start with no main female characters but even that panned out quite well. All the action scenes in and out of the dome were believable and the acting for such a young team was impressive. It had a real feel of 100 about it which was interesting. The ending left you wanting more. Will defo see the sequel","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Forget this Movie, its just a waste of time! I will not Watch this Movie again thats for sure. The actors are OK i guess. But i for one, wonder why they did not just make some ladders, they have been in the maze for 3 years and still not found the end of it. Just make some ladders and then they would see the whole maze and don't have to fight monsters to learn more. Simple and easy. But no, nobody there is smart enough to Think of that idea.

The maze runner is a type of mystery, action, science-fiction movie. The movie starts and ends with the mystery, but it likely show us many clues to know what the mysteries are . Thomas is my favorite character in the movie. Thomas(main character) is a new comer of the glade. He is a curious man who wants to know the way to get out the glade ( is like a prison ). Even he met many obstacles while He was in the glade , he never gives up on finding the way to get out. Galley is one of Thomas obstacle. He always rejects Thomas's ideas and doesn't allow Thomase to be a runner and He wants to punish Thomas. But anyway, Thomas didn't give up and continued to find the way put until he got success. I have never meet this situation but it seems a bit real for me if we compare it to my real education life. It makes me to won't give up on anything. The mystery scenes are the scenes which are written particular well and all parts that have mystery scenes are my favorite parts. The movie makes me feel engaged with it. Even I have many positive points of this movie but it also has one point that make me feel dislike of it. The maze runner makes me feel so hard to care about the main the character because the grievers run more quickly than him. So i worry that how can he escape form the monsters. The movie definitely grip me to watch it again and again. I recommend this movie to all fan of mystery movie ans sci-fiction movie.

"4","/10","Intriguing concept, but terrible writing and execution","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3200554/?ref_=tt_urv","addeisdead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9695013/?ref_=tt_urv","12 March 2015","My wife wanted to watch this because she liked the Hunger Games and was hoping this would be at least half as good. I had already heard plenty about the book series and even read a few chapters, so my expectations were much lower. What you get here is a series of action sequences strung together with ridiculous exposition and a back story that is so contrived it makes the Hunger Games sound like historical fiction. Not that it really matters - ultimately the film is just these kids in a maze for 105 minutes with some unexpected and convenient stuff happening in the last 10. Any form of metaphor, theme or meaning within this is basic and shallow at best. Don't go in looking for any kind of relevant social commentary. And a lot of this could be overlooked if there were at least some interesting characters, but instead we're treated to the usual tropes, who go about their duties with little development or charm. They're convincing at least, but bland as a Dodge Avenger.Anyway, I know a lot of the 14-25 crowd will disagree with my review, but that's okay. They are who this movie was made for. It's a competently made film with enough action to entertain you for a while, but it's not remarkable or exceptional in any facet.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The climax and end game are senseless and goofy.Don't go into this expecting to learn what's going on. You'll know as much 15 minutes into the show as you will at the end. This is an obvious multi-parter that leaves one with no reason or desire to see further parts.The body count is excessive and without conceptual reason. The ""grievers"" have no apparent role except to kill and destroy-- and that role makes no sense in context of the story.This will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat the entire time, then make us wonder why we spent another couple hours of our life involved with such drivel. In the end, the question that will be on everyone's mind is, ""What was that nonsense there?""

The first one to pop up in my mind while watching this at the theater was The Lord of the Flies by William Golding. The all male group trying to survive on their own made me go back to the grandiose classic book. There is also The Hunger Games and Divergent both of them being adaptation of books like this movie The Maze Runner. However, the bigger comparison can be made in the idea of teenagers attempting to save a world that is corrupt and destroyed. In my opinion, each movie I listed above is original in its own way and The Maze Runner is here to compete with them. The idea is not new but the way the idea is conveyed in the movie is authentic. You feel every bit of action like you're there while watching this movie. The acting is also undeniable great. Hollywood definitely hit the spot with these entertaining sci-fi movies. So this movie is definitely a yes from me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, the film falls short in its execution, primarily due to its lackluster main character.Thomas, portrayed by Dylan O'Brien, is the central figure in this post-apocalyptic tale. Unfortunately, Thomas fails to captivate and leaves much to be desired. From the beginning, his characterization lacks depth, rendering him a one-dimensional and unremarkable protagonist. Throughout the film, Thomas often acts as an observer, merely reacting to the situations around him rather than actively driving the plot forward.One of the major flaws of Thomas's character is his lack of emotional development. Despite the challenges he faces within the maze, his reactions remain remarkably consistent, whether confronted with danger or camaraderie. This absence of emotional range makes it difficult for the audience to connect with Thomas on a deeper level, leaving us detached and disinterested in his journey.Additionally, Thomas's decisions throughout the film are often questionable and lacking in logic. Instead of displaying intelligence or resourcefulness, he tends to stumble upon solutions through sheer luck or the help of other characters. This undermines his role as the protagonist, as he becomes a mere pawn in the larger narrative, lacking agency and the ability to make meaningful choices.Furthermore, Thomas's relationships with the other characters are underdeveloped, hindering the potential for emotional investment. Despite forming alliances with his fellow ""runners,"" there is a noticeable lack of chemistry and camaraderie. These relationships never reach a level of depth or authenticity that would allow for genuine empathy towards the characters' struggles.The film also fails to explore Thomas's background and motivations adequately. We are left with a vague understanding of his past, limiting our ability to empathize with his experiences and comprehend his actions. As a result, Thomas remains an enigma throughout the film, leaving us disconnected and disengaged from his journey.In conclusion, ""The Maze Runner"" falls short in its portrayal of the main character, Thomas. His lack of emotional development, questionable decision-making, and underdeveloped relationships hinder the film's ability to engage the audience. While the movie presents an intriguing concept and an atmospheric setting, these elements are not enough to compensate for the shortcomings of its central protagonist. Ultimately, ""The Maze Runner"" fails to deliver a captivating and memorable experience due to its weak characterization of Thomas.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The trailer had looked interesting. I asked my brother if he wanted to see it and he said, ""I am boycotting all young adult movies and books."" And you know I kind of feel the same way. It seems as though it has been all vampire, zombies, and romance. And to be perfectly honest the Hungers Games movies have not really drawn me.So when when my wife and I decided to go see Maze Runner it was with a certain amount of hesitation. My hope was that it would be at least as good as Ender's Game (which was not a great movie but okay). I was not disappointed. This movie is far better than Ender's Game. Actually, I would say it is the best movie I have seen all year. The story itself was gripping in that during the entire time we know only as much as the main character, Thomas. The special effects were great, but not overpowering. And the acting, this is perhaps the best acting I have seen all year! All of these teenagers played their parts well.If you are looking for a gripping movie, then go see the Maze Runner. I would only warn you that there is a lot of violence, but it is not gory. It is rather like the violence presented in the Dark Knight. The imagination does most of the work.I would definitely see this one in theaters again.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a mixture of fantasy and adventure, very vividly filmed and the plot is only gaining momentum all the time.A young guy finds himself in an unusual place, similar at the same time to a community and a summer camp, other guys already live here - the same young people or teenagers. Each of them did not come here of their own free will, and you can only get out of here by going through a huge labyrinth.I really liked the unusual idea. Stunning scenery of the labyrinth, something must have been built, something drawn on a computer, but everything is as realistic as the real thing. The dimensions and structure of the labyrinth are striking - walls ten times higher than a person's height and many unexpected surprises that await inside.The film runs for almost two hours, but it is not at all boring, something happens all the time, new unexpected facts and circumstances emerge that the heroes of the film have to deal with. All of them are completely different in character, race and appearance, which is a huge plus for me, because sometimes there is confusion if the actors are similar in appearance. Here, everyone was picked up so that it is simply impossible to mistake one for the other.There are no particularly creepy scenes, but there is a struggle in which there will be victims. But I would not say that it is very scary, although you have to worry about the heroes.Most of the actors are young people, none of them are known to me personally, but it does not matter, they played wonderfully, managed to interest the viewer.I think it's a great movie!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Maze Runner is another one of those, except it's a new breed as it's instead set in a post-apocalyptic world, rather than a dystopian future.What gives this film such intrigue is its confusing and mysterious nature throughout the film. It has you asking questions from the beginning, as things occur on their own merit without explanation. You will scratch your head at times, while at the same time wait patiently to see what is actually going on.VERDICT: A new spin on the teeny dystopia craze, with an enthralling and captivating mysterious plot that will have you hooked till the very end.Overall Rating: 8.5/10Full review by me here: http://www.mediahype101.com/2014/09/the-maze-runner-2014- film-review.html","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film has elements of horror, suspenseful and a bit futuristic and a thriller.The people of the Glade are trapped in the Maze and have been trying to find a way out for three years. Then the actor Dylan O'Brian comes in and saves the day and helps them find a way out! There occurred a couple of deaths but they eventually got over it.I personally like when actor Dylan O'Brian and Min Ho go into the Maze and kill a Griever and find a way out and go back to gather everybody, just because it was so suspenseful. Even though I have seen the film quite a lot of times it is still my favourite part.My least favourite part is when they find a way out and find a lab and one of the actors dies, because they were one of my favourite characters and the ending was a bit too quick, and a bit boring in my opinion. I feel like I didn't have much time to understand what was happening.In my opinion the style of the film is that it was quite dark and weird at the beginning, it kind of felt like you were in there with them. I like how they made the Grievers half flesh and half mechanical, it was just so interesting. I personally like how they made the sound effects on the Grievers. This part really made the film just a tad bit better.I personally like how they made the sound effects on the Grievers.At the end of this film it leaves you on a bit of a cliffhanger, so I would recommend the other two films 'The Scorch Trials' and 'The Death Cure'. I would definitely recommend this film because of the graphics and it is just a film that I think most people would like.The main characters think they are free but when you watch it, you almost just know that they might not be safe or free just yet. I learnt that just because you find a way out doesn't mean that you are necessarily free...!!(Review by Bea N. - 12 yrs.)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After binge reading the book over two days (mostly out of boredom) and being pleasantly surprised, I decided to watch the movie on HBOGo. To say that was a mistake is like saying Hitler was misguided, The movie, aside from not being remotely similar to the book, didn't captivate at all, contained almost no plot, and seemingly ripped off Lord Of The Flies more than its namesake, though I apologize for even putting it in the same sentence as such a classic. If you are in the mood be angered and gouge your own eyes out, please enjoy this sorry excuse for a blockbuster.

The casting was pretty near perfect and Dylan O'Brian gave an outstanding performance. The actor who played chuck was the only one who fell a little flat for me and didn't quite connect the way he should have, other wise it was a very well casted movie. The visuals were phenomenal and ,I'm sure, met the expectations for anyone who imagined the maze ,as i did, while reading the book. Even if you haven read the book i would highly suggest this movie, it truly breaks off from that whole ""young adult novel"" theme and really conveys some deeper concepts such as freedom vs security and a very ""lord of the flies"" take on how society forms among a large group of young boys.I would HIGHLY recommend ,if you can, seeing this movie in a Cinemax theater with Barco's new three screen projection system, its only available in five theaters in America and ""The Maze Runner"" is the first movie to be commercially seen through this format. It's honestly one of the most visually stunning concepts I've seen used in a film since ""Avatar"". The three screen panoramic style make you feel like you are in the maze with the characters and is especially effective in the opening scene, truly no other movie would have suited this style better than ""The Maze Runner"". Seen With the Barco experience i would rate this movie 10/10 purely for just how immersive the whole experience was and how well it fit into the working of this story. This new system and the compelling twists of the movie will make your heart beat right out of your chest and i hope to see this technology used in several more movie in the future. Basically GO SEE THIS MOVIE","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the setup, and the blunt ground rules of the world itself (we're surrounded by a giant labyrinth that seals itself and shifts mechanically every sundown - don't get caught inside when it does), but the cast is perilously dry and boring, so naturally we spend way too much time getting to know them. Dylan O'Brien is particularly bad as Thomas, a savior who pushes the complacent society to break out of their strongholds and pursue a method of escape. His is a special kind of anti-charisma, blank and wooden and static... stupid handsome, like an underwear model. Occasional jaunts into the maze itself are the real draw of this film, and clearly the most entertaining bits, but they're bafflingly few and far between. Why revel in the atmosphere when instead you could be setting up sequels with a set of fatally-flawed characters, I guess? Not that the plot is all that competent, either. Think too hard and you'll surely slip into one of the broad holes scattering its landscape. It's a middling effort in every sense of the word. Outside of the maze itself, which is a nice (if brief) breath of clear air, the rest of this film's concepts and ideas have already been done many times before, by more complete rivals. Even the CG-heavy monsters don't trigger a reaction - I think I recognized them from the lower levels of hell in Doom 2, circa 1994","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I had seen the trailers and I knew what to expect. The movie was no revelation on any level. I fell asleep in the film-twice. I thought the set work was worthy of an adult science fiction movie but an adult science fiction movie this was not-it was made by young people for young people.I think that younger persons don't deserve to be in charge of such a large project. The story line was kiddish and was not up to the level of the sets it took place on. Kind of like seeing a sixteen year old driving around in a Rolls Royce or a Ferrari. It just comes off wrong. The film would have been a lot better if they hadn't relied on heavy handed creature special effects that were in scenes that were so loud I thought my eardrums were going to burst. The creature special effects were definitely not subtle and appeared to be a combination of creature special effects borrowed from the newer Riddick film & the Resident Evil film series. Pretty boring fair-even for teens, I think. And it was loud. Way loud. Loud does't make uninspired & dull sequences work better.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The targeted audience is probably from 8 to 18 years so if you are not in this range or close to it you shouldn't waste your time on this movie. The movie should be shorter because the plot is not that complex and the story could be finished in shorter time. The concept of maze has a lot more to offer than this movie, the maze itself is mysterious enough but the movie didn't do well in giving it more mystique content. The movie is completely forgettable and viewers are not left any felling of sensation after film. I was very disappointed with the end of the movie that has noting to offer. And it should.

Or how can you put it...Hollywood is again using very young actors, and the plot or theme is,sigh,again about a group of people competing in order to survive. And the sub- theme about society is dividing people into a few class. Just mention The ""Harry Potter"",""Hunger Games"" series, plus ""Divergent"",""Ender's Game"",TV-series ""The 100"",""The Giver"" etc. etc. Of course there are differences of those movies/series. But the overall big picture is quite easy to see that Hollywood is into the ""youth competing for their life""-kind of genre these years. Plus the placement is very often a society who put the citizen into a few classes right from birth or given when they are teens.I was close to give this movie only 3 stars because I'm getting tired of seeing the same theme repeating over and over again from different movies. But I gave it a 4 star because of the good special effects. And the kids gave an okay performance despite an mediocre manuscript. I know the story should be a big thing as a book. I don't know about that, but I can't just give my review of the movie.Don't give me wrong. I don't mind young actors. But they should be giving characters that seems plausible to the story. Plus in most cases, the older actors with more experience, will, In my mind, just act better than preteen/teen/tween etc. Fx I like ""Lord of the flies"" because the actors where very good. But besides that, the movie had a good story and manuscript. Plus at that time the movies plot was original. Making a movie like that one or two times a year, and the originality quickly fades out.To go into the detail of ""The Maze runner"" it was quickly to me, it had some things that could make it a better movie. From the start of the movie, there's a lot of secrecy about why the main character (Thomas) can't get out of the area they are put and go into the maze. Thats quite obvious that's just put in there in the movie, to give the audience some mystery. But for me, that already broke down my ""4th wall"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall), or the realism of the movie got broken there. For me, if it should be more realistic, it would be more realistic if the people who was put there in the maze, to right away give warnings to newcomers about how dangerous it would be to step into.The ""greenies"" or newcomers to the maze, are quickly told, they have to work for the community. That also seemed a bit odd to me. They get the food served on (metal)plate each month, so what is there to be done more really? But I guess that was another odd thing that was placed there just to give a bit of false drama.Despite all those things, the rest of the movie was okay because you got curious what the maze had to offer. But it was rather predictable. Okay. No spoilers from me. But you can watch it one Sunday if you feel bored. But I would recommend ""Rollerball"" (1975),""The running Man"" (1987) and ""The lord of the flies"" (1990) instead if you want a bit similar themes.Tommo Boy","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Go read the book, you will enjoy it, DO NOT watch this movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

You can read the book very quickly and the story and characters are built from a much better base than the lightweight characters portrayed in the film. The story is modified, to it's detriment, and leaves the viewer feeling lost and nowhere near as involved and committed to the characters. The whole film is rushed and hugely disappointing.Personally I feel like the casting of Alby and Newt was poor, with that said the vast majority of the rest of cast were a great fit despite some rather questionable hairstyles...In comparison, The Hunger Games movies are incredible and rival the books, unfortunately the same cannot be said for The Maze Runner.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Then go see the movie knowing that it's changed some things around and is an overall lesser experience. If you HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE RIGHT NOW, then give the book a whirl if you don't absolutely hate the movie.If you read the book, you'll probably be a bit disappointed. The more I think about it, the more things I remember were left out. I'd say that overall the movie kept about 55% of the content from the book. A lot of stuff was either compressed or completely cut. A lot of things were changed around too. Characters act and/or look different, some key elements from the plot are shortened or absent, etc. The movie isn't an incoherent, awful mess like Eragon was, but it isn't as faithful an adaption as the Harry Potter movies were. To give some examples without spoiling anything:But as I said, not a disaster. Visually, the movie looks pretty decent. The CGI isn't bad and the sets for the Glade, Maze, etc were cool. The acting was all on point, especially Dylan O'Brien and whoever did Chuck and Newt. I remember seeing the Newt dude in Doctor Who a while back. Hopefully they move on to bigger and better things, especially Dylan. the dude's the one bright spot in Teen Wolf and he was also the person who brought this movie up from a 4/10 to a 5. Guy's a good actor. And yea I'll admit, I went into this movie already a fan of his.ANYWAYI'm a bit torn on how I feel about all the changes made.... on the one hand, it grinds my gears a bit because I feel like the book's version of events is better. On the other hand, it keeps things fresh for people who have already read the book. But you know what, if you go to see a movie based on a book you've read, you aren't going for a new experience. You're going to see the story that you read on paper and acted out in your head played out on the big screen. So in that regard, the movie fails.Go into the theater knowing the experience will be different, and you might not hate it. You might even enjoy it a little bit.But on its own, it's a 'meh' movie, and as an adaption, it doesn't do the best job. So if I had to sum up my feelings about this movie in one sentence, it would be:Not the worst thing ever.How's that for advertising. Stick it on the posters and trailers.THE MAZE RUNNER Not the worst thing ever. - blackbriar246","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

If I had seen the film in any other context, I would have been seriously upset with myself. But as it turned out, there was enough to catch the eye to forget the inane plot. In fact, given the impaired storyline, the acting, cinematography and film editing were really quite good - in fact, one of the supporting actors, I think, won an award for best young British talent. I won't bore you with the plot - you can read it in 100 places on this site. Suffice to say, it's hard to go 5 minutes without laughing at its ridiculousness. This is sci-fi on the cheap, story-wise. Thank god for the producers, there are enough kids of a certain age (and their parents) out there. You won't lose any sleep if you miss it.

Pretty much Lord of the Flies meets Starship Troopers, though far less gritty. Basic plot, conventional direction. Has its moments of genuine intrigue and tension, but those are few and far between.Only surprising thing about this movie is that it doesn't star Shailene Woodley and/or Miles Teller...Then, worst of all, it doesn't really end - the whole thing is set- up for sequel.

Bold. Mysterious. Smartly written. Knowingly silly. Imperfect but unique. Well, The Maze Runner is nothing like that, except for the imperfections. Remember, also, M Night Shyamalan's last (almost) great movie, The Village? Something of that film's central conceit is at work here – albeit emptied of any intelligence or detectable allegory or any semblance of a distinctive style.Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars as Thomas, who wakes up just as he's being deposited in an enormous prison called the Glade. He can remember nothing of his former life. Nor can the other young male denizens of the Glade, who've been ritually plonked there on a monthly basis, and have been mapping the surrounding maze ever since. Problem is, the maze keeps shifting shape, and after dark it is occupied by menacing Grievers: arachnid guardians made of guts and steel. Thomas wants to find a way to freedom, but Gally (Will Poulter) reckons they should stay put, where it's safe. Shouting ensues, while the Gladers ask endless, unanswered questions about what the Glade is, what the maze is, what the Grievers are, when the film's going to end This is the worst kind of mystery setup. A Lost-esque cloak envelopes everyone and everything, giving all the power to the filmmakers and leaving none of the fun to us. In a TV show this would hold us to the next ad break. Here, it's meant to hold our attention into the next movie (already announced), despite the fact that the first instalment barely crawls to 113 minutes. The whole concept just doesn't hold water. At least The Hunger Games has a flamboyance of design to distract us from its barely credible dystopia. But The Maze Runner is way too serious for that. Spoiler alert (although is it a spoiler when it's this predictable?): We're told that the kids are being put through some sort of Darwinian test to establish their suitability in a post-apocalyptic world. The conspiratorial nature of this boring beast means we can't take this explanation at face-value. But then, I've nothing else to go on, and I'm certainly not compelled to read the books – so let's go with what we've got, which is eye-narrowingly contrived nonsense.The script is deathly dull. It starts with a cavalcade of exposition, setting up the rules etc, and descends into mindless arguing, without ever daring to explore, say, the sexual politics of having a girl thrown into this hyper-masculine teenage mix. The amnesia thing is the oldest cheat in the screen writing book, and causes a crippling lack of character. Our hero is running on some kind of instinct but he's still basically a Nice Young Man. No moral grey areas here. The dearth of character is consistent with the video game level of narrative: Choose your player based solely on appearance (also the casting process here, it seems).Another homogenous hero, then. And sub-par performances abound. The only player to really engage is Game of Thrones' Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt; the only character to imply any kind of internal conflict. I concede that Will Poulter puts in solid work, too. But generally the cast is directed with bland efficiency. The action scenes are all bluster and no invention and the CGI is as weightless as it comes. Who said Hollywood was a world of talented hacks? I'm not sure, but I'm saying it now. It's a pity because John Paesano's score evokes John Williams – he deserved Spielberg for his work.The film drills standard YA anxieties about identity, victimhood, and entitlement; about not being 'special' (or divergent or whatever) and slipping anonymously into the crowd. Worst of all, there's absolutely no chance of getting any phone signal in the Glade. The horror! Against the classy Orwellian operatics of The Hunger Games, here's a wannabe without substance, style, or, ironically, identity.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not in one single scene is the acting remotely close to believable. I never care about any of the characters. It's obvious from the first scene who will live and who will die during the film. I never worry about Thomas, nor Newt or Minho. The only interesting thing in the film are the Greivers, that you unfortunately barely see and that they don't develop further. Just like the illness or W.C.K.D are left in the dark, so seems most of the script. It all seems rushed. The film have a few decent looking actions scenes, but nothing worth watching the rest of it. If you want to see kids fighting some obscure monsters, you can watch the last ten minutes of the film. If you are looking for something with more substance, you pick something different to watch.

The premise is kind of interesting and the young cast does a pretty good job of selling the whole thing. The problem with this movie is that we'll never know how good it might have been because it exists purely as a desperate attempt to play catch up with the wildly successful 'Hunger Games' franchise and therefore lacks even the hint of any genuine creative spark, vision, or passion behind it.By playing follow-the-leader and clinging so desperately to the whole 'Hunger Games' template/play book, 'The Maze Runner' is dead on arrival and never even seems to be trying to carve out an identity or vision of its' own. After the first few minutes, your eyes just kind of glaze over as you realize with dread that you're getting a pale imitation of a movie that wasn't very good to begin with. (NOTE: I haven't read either 'The Hunger Games' or 'Maze Runner' books, so I can't comment on either as adaptations, just going by the films here). And please keep in mind, 'The Hunger Games' is pretty much a rip-off of the much better Japanese cult gem, 'Battle Royale,' but at least Hunger Games took that idea and did its own thing with it, giving the property a distinctive feel and vibe by successfully aiming it at the young adult 'Twilight' crowd. Even though I'm not a fan of the movies, I can appreciate that and give 'Hunger Games' at least some credit for pulling it off.'The Maze Runner' isn't even ambitious or interesting enough to try to do that in any way, shape, or form. It's just very obviously going through the motions and I really believe that a viewer would find the movie totally bland and uninspired because of this, even if they had never seen or heard of 'The Hunger Games.' They just wouldn't know why.The studio executives and creative teams behind movies like ""The Maze Runner,"" ""Divergent,"" and God-only-knows whatever other 'Hunger Games' facsimiles are coming down the pipe line really need to read up on their Ralph Waldo Emerson, because he said it best: ""Imitation is suicide.""","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And the writing of the story, the lines and details on each characters reaction (especially the main character) to what's happening is just plain, shallow and sometimes stupid. I really don't understand how such a movie got above 7 on IMDb. It is nowhere close to any other 7 plus movies.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I personally feel quite bothered when seemingly logical questions are posed or implied, but discarded right away for no obvious reason. Second, the characters are among the most one-dimensional to grace the big screen in recent years. None are seemingly more important to the plot than others, save through chance (plot devices, if you so will).All in all, your decent action/adventure/chosen young one movie, with all the regular flaws that come with them nowadays. 5/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A movie can't develop characters like a book, and it doesn't dive deep into what the characters are thinking and feeling. Time also inhibits the amount of details that can be included. Still some movies manage to capture books on film very well. The entire Hunger Games series (2012-15) has been an excellent telling of the book series. A movie like ""The Shining"" (1980) has an alternate ending from Stephen King's book, but capture the essence of the novel. ""Angels & Demons"" (2009) left out a lot of details from Dan Brown's novel, but kept the general plot line. This movie fails on all accounts. After reading the book I was looking forward to seeing this movie. There were a lot of parts I was curious to see depicted on screen. So many details were changed, and the plot line was completely altered. I was disappointed on all accounts. In both we have a world where adolescent boys are taken, wiped of all of their previous memories. They live in a walled region known as The Glade, outside of which lies a mysterious moving maze. At night, the doors that lead to the maze shut. In the book, these doors are massive wall which shut defying all laws of physics. In the movie they show a perfectly plausible gear system only made slightly implausible by the character saying ""How is that even possible?"" In the book it never rains--in the movie it rains. The meaning of the maze is completely different in the two. The grievers, the creatures in the maze, are an utter disappointment. It's hard for me to tell if I would've enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the book more. The amount of death and violence is high for a very young audience, but the plot has been watered down so much it's hard to imagine it's intended for a more sophisticated viewer. If you're interested in The Maze Runner, watch the movie first and then read the book, or skip the movie entirely. Doing it in the order I did will prove utterly disappointing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The plot is woeful, with a lack of cohesion - looks like it was written on the back of a fag packet after a few too many wines by some duff without much imagination, then turned into a film by others who have little respect for audience. Just throw together a few good looking folks and a few stereotypical sci-fi monsters, have a few high energy chase and fight scenes, and there you go, that's a movie. No need to worry about plot, character development or things making any kind of sense. There just doesn't seem to be any good reason for so many things that happen. The entire premise of the film lacks clarity, such that someone has to appear late on and explain the whole premise in a little monologue, which is always a bad sign, as if the writers are admitting they don't know how to tell a coherent story through the medium of cinema. While that tactic works fine to tie up any loose ends in an episode of Scooby-doo, here it just raises more unanswered questions and does little to help make sense of this movie or understand its purpose. I very seldom give such low scores but I don't feel I can justify going above 2 in this case.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It seems a little college freshman 101 English for a kid) and yet they display no obsession with the lack of women? Did the wiping of their memories also give them an interest in gardening to the extent that they are reluctant to try to solve the ridiculous cement maze that surrounds them? In real life, the lack of female companionship would have meant more boys would be volunteering as maze runners than hanging around building lean-to's as occurs in the film. Teresa's arrival - the first woman many had seen in 3 years - might have started an out and out civil war. Putting the sexual (or lack thereof) politics aside, the movie presents a fairly book-y device of a government in crisis using scarce resources to build a massive climate-controlled, cyborg filled intelligence test which takes 3 years to produce results. Couldn't they just have administered the Wechsler and saved themselves 2 years, 11 months, 3 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours and a billion dollars? Applying a fair amount of disbelief the story itself is a relatively straightforward one of group problem solving under adverse conditions. The twists at the end are dopey but do serve to set up a half billion dollar sequel. The characters and their characterization leave the audience whispering: ""who's he again?"" Only Will Poulter's ""Gally"" distinguishes himself as the voice of conservatism against the more charismatic, liberal Gladers. His views are compelling and one assumes had the grievers not mounted a mass attack, he probably would still be the Glades's democratically elected leader. How he shows up at the end of the film makes no sense within the story's own logic - remember the giant metal blades shut beyond the group? In short, a not un-entertaining also-ran among the ""Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"", dystopian future subgenre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Despite me falling into that category this movie failed to amaze me. I have not read the books though. The themes of the movie are similar to our recent hunger games,divergent series where our mighty youngsters need to survive in difficult environment. Here their mental,physical and emotional limits get tested leading to a result which we already now. I would prefer both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent' over this one any time as they had better performances, story and direction. 'The Maze Runner' has many problems, the main one being keeping the audience in the dark till the last second. The ending does no justice to the questions raised in it. All it says is see you next year, where your doubts will be cleared in the sequel.The plot involves a group of youngsters put in an environment surround by a maze. Who put them there? Why they are put there? for getting those answers you will have sit through patiently. To get out of there they need to solve and get out of the maze. Wont go too deep into the premise as its the most interesting thing in the whole movie. In first half an hour we get introduced to their lives with the help forced dialogues and then follows not so unpredictable action in the maze.Thomas played by Dylan O'Brien is actually the lead character put the script fails to do justice with that respect. Also acting front everyone is just average except Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt. Really liked his acting in Game of Thrones. Even if there are some tense running sequence through the maze which are portrayed with neat CGI, the script fails to put forward the objective of the characters properly. Also many concepts in the film are quite illogical even in sci-fi front. All the while the suspense is built on why there is the maze?, why this guys put in there? but the narrative fails to hold onto it consistently that at the end I wasn't quite bothered with assumption that it all is going on in the mind of some character. Adding to it the end reveal was quite lame and the cliffhanger rather than making me excited towards the sequel and franchise it made me realize it wont be worth the time. Still its not terrible, there are some engaging action sequences but the script is weak. I would give it a high 2 out of 5, which will be somewhere between below average and average.RATING: [2/5]","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The book is packed with plot and character moments that are important and I can understand that adapting this book would be a real challenge but they lose too many of the moments that help build character and mystery. I find the premise falls flat after the great opening. The mystery seems to evaporate and it never gains ground as the plot is simplified just that little bit too much. The scenes go by without enough breath between them and it never quite builds in terms of character and mystery. Teresa is a good example of a character who has been made less important and interesting thanks to the plot and mystery becoming thinner. The direction is strong enough to deliver tension during the scenes in the maze but when it comes to the story telling it loses it way with too little. The movie to me should have bee 2 hours plus with events following the book more closely. Particularly with Teresa who in the film doesn't do much for the plot or story. In the book, her and Thomas can telepathically communicate making the connection between the characters stronger and making the mystery deeper and more complex. There are moments in the film where I can see brilliance but the story didn't do enough to help make them more powerful. Overall, the script over simplified a complex story. I hope the next one doesn't suffer from the same troubles.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the beginning of the movie we see Thomas waking up while getting lift up by an elevator. When the elevator stops he sees that he is surrounded by a group of young guys. They are all standing in a circle of a forest like landscape, but this place is surrounded by a maze. To escape from the maze they send out these 'runners'. By day the runners go in to the maze and try to memorize the maze so they can find a way out. the guys don't send runners out by night because the maze closes then and there are these grievers. of course Thomas wants to be a runner and so the story starts. I have some questions about this movie that made the movie just stupid, so let me get them out of the way. First question( and probably the most asked one): Why didn' they climb on the vines? I know that Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster) said that the vines didn't reached to the top, but you could clearly see that they did. Or they could have at least build a ladder or something. My second question is maybe a bit dull but still, How do they get their hair gell? I even read on the trivia that Dylan O'Brien almost didn't get the roll just for his hairstyle, because there was to much gell in it. So why bother Dylan but let the rest of the guys keep their gell? My third question: How could they have mapped the maze if it changes every night? And now my biggest complaint: The ending!. It was just to much set up for the next movie and it didn't make sense, they also let someone die. The makers hope that you care about the person that dies but you really don't. I also have some move problems with this movie, but they are just small problems so I don't bother telling you.Now the directing. The directing of the movie was overall not to bad. Only the scene where Thomas gets attacked by one of the grievers for the first time you couldn't really see what was going on. This was due to the dark and by the shaky cam. This wasn't very tense, to not say it wasn't at all, because you just knew that Thomas would survive a night in the maze. But the fight scene between Thomas and Gally (Will Poulter) was well directed and tense. but this was one of the only tense moments of the movie. The special effects were good at times (the maze) but also bad (the grievers) and sometimes you could just see that they were standing in front of a green screen. the script of this movie wasn't that good it was just a bit dull, there were some good parts. This is why you just didn't care about the characters and why I didn't feel sad when someone was killed of. Due to the bad writing the jokes didn't also really work. But the overall plot was OK, just the ending. The acting was surprisingly good. Dylan O'Brien was likable as Thomas. And Will Poulter surprised me as Gally. Gally was this leader of the group guys before Thomas came. And Thomas didn't really follow the rules of Gally, which gave some chemistry between the characters. There was also this character Chuck, played by Blake Cooper. I didn't like his character at all. He was supposed to be the comic relieve. But he wasn't funny and I was annoyed by it. Blake Coopers acting wasn't so convincing. But overall the acting was good and I think that that was the best part of the movie.This movie isn't a total disaster and you won't get mad about it, just about the ending. I get why some people liked it and some people don't so go watch it and decide by yourself.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But the movie unfortunately was nothing but a huge disappointment. I have watched plenty of books-to-movies, and sure, there's things changed here and there, but so much was either changed or left out from the book to movie that the movie was left, empty. It felt rushed, and confusing, as if they were trying to make it exciting and visually compelling instead of keeping to the story. It's a sci-fi book, but the movie turned out less sci-fi then expected. I believe many would have enjoyed it more if it was kept as interesting as the book, more character development and the different types of technology used in the books. I highly recommend the books! You will find yourself pulled into the story's mystery this way! :)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So overall I'd give it 4 stars, but considering the end I had to downgrade. If you like to watch this movie, keep one thing in mind: Throughout the whole thing don't ask yourself why stuff happens and what the greater storyline is supposed to lead to. If you follow these guidelines, which are probably applicable for more titles than only this one, you can have an enjoying 1,5 hours. In case you find yourself having trouble doing so, choose another movie or maybe even grab a good book.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film's universe is not explained well as the film draws to a close and that conclusion was bad. The film had some good actors, but sub- par others. The characters were not very well written as was some of the dialog. This movie tries its best to stay close to the source material but ultimately fails. What the film was trying to say and its views have been done before. This was a fairly entertaining movie, though it just falls flat and with unnecessary and some poorly executed sequences, this film could have been a lot better. But it just squanders any originality and takes a possibly fantastic idea and series into just another YA film adaption and series. Not worth your time, though I do suggest reading the excellent novel and its sequels by James Dashner.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's absolutely NOTHING like the books we all loved and enjoyed. They changed EVERYTHING, and I don't mean a few important things like they did in The Hunger Games or Divergent or even the ever so absolutely beyond horrible movie adaptation of Twilight. I mean they changed EVERYTHING. From the very beginning you notice what they've changed. The movie on it's own is good, but compared to the books, which by the way it's suppose to be because it's based off of them, it SUCKED. I went into the movie theater knowing they changed things, like every book to movie adaptation, but here, they didn't just change a little, they changed a lot. And to me, a HUGE fan of the books, it's not okay and it will never be okay. I honestly could punch the director, then punch the screen writer, then punch James Dasher because he knew what they did and didn't say a thing. It's just. no. I can't. I honestly can't.I love Dylan O'Brien, I've loved him since day one of Teen Wolf and I love him as Thomas, because when I read the books, I can see him as Thomas. Hell, the whole reason I got into the books was because I heard he got the part as Thomas and I read the summery of what the movie was about and I went out and bought the book and read it in a day. I expected a lot out of this movie because of the fact that it was suppose to come out on Valentines day but they pushed the date back to September to work on the film. I understand that they only had a small budget compared to other movies but come on! The only thing that was the same from the book to the movie was the name and the names of the Gladers.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They were more innocent times, really.So, the king of these films (really, the queen) was The Hunger Games a good series of 4 (should have been 3) films based on a young adult dystopian novel series. Soon, everyone in Hollywood was doing what they always do, mimicking the recent success. The Maze Runner came out of that time.A young man, Thomas, wakes up in a dingy elevator rising to the surface. He finds himself in a green space at the center of a square of walls hundreds of feet high with only a few dozen other boys already there. What surrounds the little idyll is the Maze, a series of shifting passageways that opens up at the beginning of the day, closes as night approaches, and contains nasty beasts at night. Well, being this kind of movie, of course Thomas is going to become the guy who leads them through the Maze somehow. It's not really a surprise.And therein lies the movies failing. Its utter predictability. Of course Thomas is the ""chosen one"". Of course he's going to do things that people who've been there for three years never tried or succeeded at. Of course he's going to cause a paradigm shift in the society. Of course he's going to lead them out.The other failing is the incredible shallowness of characters. They're little more than archetypes that exist to fill rolls. The largest problem is with the ""antagonist"" Gally. He's angry and paranoid, and little else. I feel like he was placed there because the movie, without him, essentially has no antagonist except the Maze itself. He's there to stir things up and make life just a little more difficult for Thomas, but the situation around them is enough of an antagonist. Thomas' presence changes the rules of the situation in certain ways that the painfully expository dialogue makes very clear. Gally is just extra, and feels it.But still, the movie's slickly produced so it has some surface level appeal. The movie was obviously made on the cheap side of blockbusters, but it uses its limited budget well. The maze looks good. The monsters look good. The action scenes engage on a purely sensory level. The acting is also pretty good, even if it is split across too many characters.I didn't hate the experience. It was an okay way to spend 100 minutes of my evening. The promise of more of the world is intriguing enough to get me sort of interested. All around, meh.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is not enough running, not enough of the maze, and even when it gets there: the maze running isn't that good. What is good? The acting surprisingly! Which means the directing isn't that bad. All characters really sell their respective parts, and the casting could be much worse. But the script is terrible. As interesting as the opening is, and it is only kinda intriguing, the story unfolds in a series of predictable and cliché turns... until the end. The conclusion includes the impossible, as in an actual impossible encounter (anyone else notice?)... then an open ending that (as far as I can tell) is not foreshadowed in any meaningful way. While not overly violent - there is an astonishing amount of death, but almost none of it carries any weight, except when the cliché death must occur... and it is predictably not a very good moment in the film. I only recommend this film to media addicts like myself, who will get something from this movie - fresh faced youngsters giving it their all. With a better pen and typewriter this could have been a solid film, but it is only slightly better than trash - and it's current rating around 7 is not earned - it is stolen by use of pandering to the masses.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Perhaps I went into it with high expectations considering it had a 63% rating according to critics on Rottentomatoes. I thought it was pretty high considering that this genre is getting tiresome, so I expected it would be a breathe of fresh air, but I was wrong because it follows basically the same conventions as all the other YA adaptations (a teen who doesn't seem to fit into the role that society has put him in and ultimately becomes some sort of savior against a repressive system that seems to place them in a particular set of groups). These novels seem to repeat the same message: being different is good. I don't have anything against these films (I actually am a fan of the Harry Potter and The Hunger Games franchises), but I feel like beginning new franchises with pretty similar premises is a major letdown. The Maze Runner tries to introduce an interesting and different premise, but the novelty wears down quickly and it ultimately becomes clichéd. Most of the film is predictable despite trying to create new concepts, but the more you think about the plot the more holes you find. There are so many things about The Maze Runner that don't make much sense and I just felt it tries to raise a lot of questions without giving us believable answers. The ending is the weakest part of this film and what ultimately brings it down. It basically unravels and deconstructs all the interesting premises (like having all these young characters isolated from the rest of the world) it set up at the beginning. I really can't find anything appealing to the inevitable sequel, but will probably end up watching it anyway.For a film that centers on a young and unfamiliar cast the performances work well. The special teen this time around is played by Dylan O'Brien and we know his character is going to be the chosen one from the get go. YA adaptations have become such a formula that you just can't help it, you know he is going to be the savior. He still pulls off the role as the lead character delivering a solid and engaging performance. Will Poulter, who we saw in a comedic role in We're the Millers, shows his range playing the antagonist, Gally. Other memorable characters in this film were Alby (Aml Ameen), Newt (Thomas Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Chuck (Blake Cooper), and the only female character in the Maze: Teresa (Kaya Scodelario). The rest were all simply included to be disposed with like most of the films in the genre do and there is very little recollection of any of them. The main cast in the film is solid and so are the special effects. The set design of the maze itself looks really cool and of course it is very symbolic of how teens feel at times trapped in maze without knowing what direction to head to next. I know a lot of people liked the monsters in this film (the grievers), but they didn't really do anything for me. The Maze Runner tries to stand out from other YA adaptations, but it ends up being basically the same allegory of teens trapped in a restrictive system where the only way to survive is following the rules and playing your role in society. The few things I actually did enjoy about this film ended up being brought down by the unsatisfactory ending.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

While the whole premise is kind of silly and senseless; compared to the ladder problem, the other giant logical holes just kind of fade into the background. I have trouble really caring about any of the characters, as without actually being trapped, they're just kind of camping in a really dangerous place. If they get hurt,it was their own decision to put themselves at risk. Not that the reason they were put in there makes any sense; the plot doesn't work regardless. However, there's no real reason to analyze further when the ladder issue just sucks all the life out of it right from the start.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm not saying that it is a BAD movie. The movie doesn't make the ultimate sin filmmakers can do, which is to make a movie boring. The special effects are pretty good, and the cast comes across as a talented number of youths. So what goes wrong with this movie? It's hard to say. It may be that the movie isn't totally original - there are elements of ""Cube"", ""Welcome To Blood City"", and other movies here. It may be that there are clear signs that the original cut of the movie ran a lot longer but was edited down to a more reasonable running time, since there are some minor plot elements that don't get enough explanation or none at all. It may be because while the end of the movie gives us some explanation as to what was going on, the ending is also leaves the audience hanging on some important details, no doubt to get people to come for the upcoming sequel. Whatever the reason(s) may be, the end results, while not terrible, are somewhat frustrating.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Okay, that's not a big deal, but the story had a few loopholes, and felt like it was recycled material from classic sci-fi I grew up with in the 60s and 70s.What to say. The acting is good, the sets and locations and SFX are top notch. Everything but the plot, is good. And since this is a franchise builder, the plot is incomplete at the present time.What I wanted, what I hoped for, was an introspective film with some moments of action, but a lot of ""oohs"" and ""ahh"" moments of truly impressive visuals. This was not the case.Instead we get cyborg spiders that look like they were recycled from DOOM and DOOM2, some pretty basic tropes of character interaction, and a lot of story that goes absolutely no where, and will have to wait until the sequel to get resolved.Much of Hollywood is scraping to recapture teenage dollars for their product, not realizing that their target market is all but destroyed for the kind of fare they're putting out to their customers. I say that because there's little in the way of profundity in this film. It's pretty basic, and in that vein, dumbed down several shades to keep said teenage audience interested.Plot holes abound. How come the characters don't come up with a defensive plan? With a tech base that is existent, how come there aren't more believable explanations for how things got to where they are? And, would you really waste a lot of resources on a gigantic maze given the other issues in the film's world?For all of its mid-brow sci-fi intellectualism, it was an engaging film. I do have to admit that here and now. However, if I had shot it, I would have used mixed age actors (unless the source material, I'm assuming a sci-fi book, required otherwise). I would use a different monster, a different set of dangers, and slow the film some to give the characters time to reflect and come up with solutions of their own. I would address the obvious technology discrepancy, and lay out the world's problems from frame one.There just isn't a whole lot here thematically. And what isn't explained, but hinted at, you can pretty much puzzle out and guess what might be included in a sequel.The characters are somewhat likable (again, I would have preferred fully adult males and females), the setup is interesting, and the premise might otherwise have been intriguing if not for some story shortcomings.Given the massive army of production personnel required to make this thing, I'd be hard pressed to see any producer live up to flipping the bill for a second installment.It's not a film I would dismiss, nor a film I would highly recommend, but it is a film that I would say each person should watch on their own and decide for themselves. It's got that kind of quality to it. Technically healthy, but somewhat lacking in deeper story meaning.Give it a shot if you need some sci-fi action on your TV or computer screen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Where have I seen this movie before??","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3163488/?ref_=tt_urv","erik_ross","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4668197/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2015","I liked this movie better the first time I saw it when it was called Hunger Games. This is why I hate that the movie industry is going after illegal downloaders instead of tackling the real problem that is over priced repetitive garbage. There have maybe been 5 original movies in the last ten years, yet they charge $40 for a Bluray (I'm not even talking about those god awful reboots, Robocop, Total Recall, Karate Kid, Spiderman's (ad nauseam) etc.). Netflix has done a great job of proving that this garbage at a reasonable price is working, but ""big Hollywood"" wants to put the brakes on it because they aren't milking us for enough money from that system. Yet another great film based on another original premise, good for you.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Chix Chat on Film review: aMAZEing Adventure","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3090089/?ref_=tt_urv","EmmaDinkins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27203490/?ref_=tt_urv","21 September 2014","The future of the teen to twenties continues to have a consistent tone in science fiction and fantasy. Either grow up and be responsible or die! I know that is a bit harsh but The Maze Runner and others like the Hunger Games paints a bleak picture in general in which the adults in charge build a world in which the only objective for its youth is survival. The star of this thrill 'run', Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) has been on my radar for the past few years as I must admit Teen Wolf is one of my television viewing guilty pleasures. The past few seasons he has emerged as an amazing talent and really showcased his emotional range when possessed by the Nogitsune in season 3. He is quite convincing in this role. I knew I would see this film but hadn't decided upon IMAX until the day of, and I have to say it was worth it to experience it in the biggest and boldest format for a feature film. As someone who had not read the book, I came in with no preconceived notions about the fundamentals, like WTF a giant maze, really!?! Yes, the trailer does give an indication that it is a test of some sort, but still. So I was contemplating how long would it take for the story to divulge what's behind it all, but I wasn't bored nor was I left feeling neglected by being unfamiliar. The mystery of what was taking place was part of my fascination with this film, working things out along with Thomas. My excitement continued to ebb as I ventured into the maze with him and Minho (Ki Hong Lee) as did my trepidation. This was a good movie, not saying it was great, but I enjoyed it for its entertainment value. I'm usually big on the special effects which has a significant baring on whether I see a film on the big screen or wait for it to come to video, but in this case the effects were not the star, the actors were, which is how it should be done.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
