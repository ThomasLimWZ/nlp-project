The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling.","47 out of 59 found this helpful.

Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better.","63 out of 86 found this helpful.

It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.","82 out of 118 found this helpful.

Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book.","368 out of 599 found this helpful.

I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....I first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn't turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn't like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?I immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.To finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn't put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn't imagine Rue as a werewolf).I now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after 'The Hunger Games' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation.","94 out of 104 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Predictable but Dark. Starts Terrifically.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5031568/?ref_=tt_urv","tobyjames03","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89922726/?ref_=tt_urv","31 July 2019","An unfortunate catalyst that propelled the trend of teenage protagonist led book adaptations, of dystopian futures. Divergent and Maze Runner followed, both failing to complete their respective stories. Perhaps that has tainted the memory of a satisfactory film, undefinable by genre.It's easy to forget that way back in 2012 this was fresh and new, tonally dark cinema, aiming for the teenage demographic. Perhaps that's a large reason for the success of the franchise, it was new and interesting, everything since has just been a rehash, located in a different world.Refreshingly dark and mature, visually graphic, The Hunger Games has a lot going for it, as a visual spectacle, not so much as an immersive and compelling story. Narratively it meanders, without intent, there's a station to arrive at but not the train track to get there. Tonally gloomy at times, balance is hard to find. Switches in mood make the texture of the atmosphere uneven, because changes are jarring and misplaced. The edit failed to maximise the potential seeping throughout. Scenes are drawn out and end on odd notes, something that could've been tightened up in post-production. Additionally more cuts to and through between the Games and the world at present would've helped to increase tension while the story pondered, the scale and public reaction isn't documented anywhere near enough, if at all. Personally I feel the editing really trips this film up, it's quite easily 10-15 minutes too long, feeling even longer due to the fact of how much sitting around there is.Stretched so far it's see through, the ending is blatant from the get go, meaning there's not much to keep you interested after the half hour mark.Gary Ross shows wonderful craft and delicacy when concerning the dark themes of oppressed society, life without choice and just how bleak living in a dictatorship is. In the first act he manages to craft a tone and atmosphere that reeks of desperation, fear, the empty void of hopelessness and life without control. Yet he lifts the mood with the slightest and smallest of scenes between Kat and Gale, serving as a reminder of humanity's ability to dream and aspire for a better world. Each shot set in District 12 is delightful, sombre chills run through every vein as you are enraptured in fear and anxiety. The build up to and throughout the reaping is tense and nauseating, interactions with Kat and her sister are filmed so preciously. Sound is well utilised through the overdrawn run-time, music is allowed to overrun and dominate, drowning out the world perfectly and symbolically. An example that comes to mind concerning the sound is when Kat offers herself up, her screaming juxtaposed against the silence sets her out from the rest, nailing her on as the protagonist we will all route for. Selfless.This was Jennifer Lawrence's big break in the public eye, she left a good impression. Portrayed with care, Katniss is delicately played when is necessary but can easily surge with passion when needed. Reminiscent of an indie film portrayal, Jennifer showcases her range and hits all the marks, and you, in all the right places.Hunger Games starts off brilliantly, it's exhilarating and tense, filled with subtlety. Has a terrific lead performance that powers you through. It's weighed down by an underwhelming narrative, that's evened out with an enjoyable character arc. Sadly it gets wrapped up in it itself, losing its awareness of how sick a situation this is, and rather than point it out, chooses to accept the societal issues, it so cleverly addressed in the beginning. We then drift and chunder toward the inevitable ending.Nevertheless I'd quite happily re-watch the first act, but would have no qualms with skipping the rest.It's a solid piece of film-making.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A true game-changer for movies aimed at teens.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2583723/?ref_=tt_urv","GlimmerBunny","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13633965/?ref_=tt_urv","19 March 2012","Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the ""The Hunger Games"" book series by Suzanne Collins. I've read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.""The Hunger Games"" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn't imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.I've never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I'll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven't read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too ""hot"" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it's supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they're inexperienced.Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it's still there. People will feel the tributes' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn't gory until you've left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn't distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It's almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can't say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope ""The Hunger Games"" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what's to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight's league.","691 out of 1,149 found this helpful.

"","","Two Words: Battle Royale","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2784184/?ref_=tt_urv","nfunkymonkey8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42778596/?ref_=tt_urv","18 April 2013","Seeing the ""Hunger Games"" series gain so much recognition is difficult to fathom; especially when it's more or less a blatant copy of ""Battle Royale"", a Japanese novel (1996), movie (2000), and manga (2000-2005). I've read the entire series of ""Hunger Games"" (2008), and not only is the writing style bland, but the plot is exceedingly unoriginal and not 'unique' like many of you are claiming it to be. Like the ""Battle Royale"" manga, ""Hunger Games"" includes love triangles, a group of teenagers randomly chosen (BR: by class HG: by district), plans to overthrow authority, teens given weapons and forced into a death match, a pair working together to undermine the game with the help of an older mentor who had previously won the game, both female and male main leads, a corrupted government, signal fires and bird calls, a reality TV show program (which IS in the English adaption of the manga (2006) for the series unlike many of you have known), and the list goes on and on. Evidence of these unconcealed similarities can be found on various Internet articles (whose writers I sincerely thank). I urge you to go right now and read the manga or novel of Battle Royale online so that you can compare the two series. The author of ""Hunger Games"" blatantly claimed (*cough* lied *cough) that she supposedly never even knew of ""Battle Royale"", so you can't use 'inspiration' as an excuse anymore. Instead, she blurted out nonsense about Roman mythology and the Iraq war since she doesn't want to admit her source of inspiration is a contemporary. How convenient for her own success since ""Battle Royale"" is a Japanese series that isn't well known in North America. She basically made an American-version of the series that contains less gruesome content and involves districts in place of school classes. Even if she truly did not know about ""Battle Royale"" or mysteriously forgot about it in the back of her mind, it is still part of an author's job to confirm the originality of his or her own to-be published works through researching. I'm posting this all of over the web so that ""Battle Royale"" can at least receive some acknowledgment that the ""Hunger Games"" author denied. Sure enough, both series also share resemblances with ""The Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Running Man"". However, unlike the HR author, the BR author has not denied this inspiration. Moreover, the ""Hunger Games"" is more like a rip-off of ""Battle Royale"" than an inspiration since the majority of the plot elements are nearly identical. There's a fine line between the words 'inspiration' and 'copy', and ""Hunger Games"" has extended far past it. There are also many popular American series that were inspired by Japanese series such as ""The Matrix"" from ""Ghost in the Shell"", however they rightfully gave credit for the 'original' series unlike a certain someone. I sincerely apologize if I seem rash with my word choice, but it's so aggravating that Suzanne Collins had dare stated that she wasn't inspired by ""Battle Royale"" when she clearly was. What's more contemptible is that she's getting not only famous from her rip-off, but she's also obtaining vast amounts of money from it. But hey, that's how reality works, right? Therefore, I don't care if this is marked as spam or hauled with negative comments from ""Hunger Game"" fanatics. As long as it reveals to some people the credit ""Battle Royale"" genuinely deserves, then I'm satisfied. Nonetheless, the movie's portrayal of ""Hunger Games"" is quite exceptional in comparison to other movies adapted from books, which is why I am rating this 2/10 instead of 1/10.","34 out of 55 found this helpful.

First of all, kudos to the actors - each does a marvelous job with their roles. Harrelson, Lawrence, Hutchinson, Tucci, Banks and the rest of the cast - they all nail their characters and do them honor.The heart of the story is intact, unfortunately there are many significant elements from the novel entirely missing, or changed to the point they lose the depth of meaning they were intended to have. Unlike some of the sub-plot and story elements left out of the Potter and LOTR series, these missing and adulterated items matter greatly, and lessen the quality of the movie. I will give the producers credit for building Seneca Crane's role in an effective way that answers many questions for those that have not read the books.Finally - production values. You will suffer significant eyestrain after 2.5 hours of glaring close-ups. All of the action is shot so close and is so muddled it is almost impossible to determine what is happening. The chariot display is shown either to close or too far away, and in both cases so fast that the impact of the glorious entrance and introduction of the tributes is lost. The CG shots (thankfully there are few of them) look like leftovers from a Syfy channel production. This may be the worst big-budget production to hit the big screen in years. Although Ross worked well with the actors, he did not handle the action epic elements well at all. The cinematography is atrocious and the whole production looks cheap.You will enjoy the movie, but you will also wish for the grand and respectful care-taking that was given the Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises.","21 out of 36 found this helpful.

"","","Surprisingly safe and sanitised – lacks the horror, satire and commentary it could and should have had","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2668339/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","3 September 2012","There was a great deal of hype and fuss when The Hunger Games came out as a film and perhaps I should have known I was not target audience because up till then I had never heard of the book series (or indeed that a film was being made). Although with the usual hoopla that goes with any large film, quite a few critics I respect gave it surprisingly good reviews and I decided I would check it out at some point as it seemed to offer more than just a copy of Battle Royale for American teenagers. With all the fuss (and teenage audience) I was very happy to let it go by in the cinemas and instead I waited for the DVD.The film offers a lot of potential and this potential is evident from the start because it sets out its stall to be many things. Firstly there is plenty of room for satire by virtue of this exaggerated futuristic world where this annual murder is presented as both entertainment and also as a way of punishing the masses and keeping them in their place while those with the power enjoy the best of life. Secondly there is the opportunity to draw the audience into being a viewer of this very thing and then confronting us with the horror of what it really means so that there is at least a part of us questioning what we're finding entertaining. I wasn't looking for this to be some incredibly dark film that spits out an audience full of self-loathing and introspection, but I did expect it to be intelligent and impacting on some level to make it stand out from being just a teen-friendly adventure story.The film itself surprised me by falling far short of what it could have been and squandering or ignoring most of the things of the potential it had. In terms of the satire, it never convinced me of the world it had created – it seemed unnecessarily excessive and didn't have enough truth to it to make me believe. I got the impression that it wasn't particularly interested in making the world function as a real place either – just that it was on screen was enough. As a place for commentary or digs at real things, it wasn't that it picked easy targets or easy shots, it was more a matter of it not really having much interest in saying anything beyond a few very basic things. This is a problem not only because it wasted potential but also because the first hour or so of this film is entirely in this world.The second hour is within the games itself and as such it does have dramatic moments as one would expect (it is after all, an expensive Hollywood thriller), however these are fewer than I would have liked and also a lot less impacting – I watched most of it with a removal that I shouldn't have had. The delivery of children violently murdering other is only horrifying in regards how sanitised and unhorrific it is. I wasn't looking for it to be really gory or to revel in the blood, but it certainly should not have been something that I watch without any reaction. This lack of horror (even just emotional horror) leaves the game as a rather hollow affair which eventually turns into a standard thriller where we root for the ""good"" kids over the ""bad"" kids, even though it would have been stronger to have not drawn that very easy line.The performances are mostly solid even though the majority have little to work with. Lawrence is a good actress and she adds a weight to her character tat doesn't seem to come from anywhere but her. I liked her throughout – even terrible ""fire"" special effects seemed unable to make her look bad. The supporting cast aren't able to bring as much as her to the table – even though there are plenty of big names here. The majority of the other children are carefully cast and given exits from the story that befits the easy-road approach to the plot.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I was surprised to find that the words sanitised, safe and standard were the ones that kept going through my mind considering I was watching a globally successful satire that uses the murder of children by other children as its core plot. As it is The Hunger Games comes off as a lot of ideas that have been done better elsewhere and any teeth it may have had are all smoothed down and buffed into a consumer friendly product that will undoubtedly become a smash franchise – my only hope is that the next film can deliver some of its promise and not just churn out something as safe, generic and frankly unmemorable as this one.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course). Better drama, story and acting than Twilight, hopefully it stays that way and won't dwindle down the road ...","22 out of 41 found this helpful.

I was so impressed with this film that I created an account just so I could review it. I'm from Hawaii and I managed to catch a early screening of the movie. First off let me start by saying that I have read all three books, and I must admit that the trailer made me a bit hesitant. I mean in the trailer they didn't get the little details right (for instance Katniss's backpack is suppose to be orange and it isn't) but that didn't stop me from seeing the movie, and it SHOULD NOT stop you either! The movie followed the books as closely as a ""PG-13"" rating would allow, and the things they did change didn't distract from the overall movie. I don't want to say too much, but this movie is a magnificent start to what I hope will be an epic trilogy. The actors/actresses are wonderfully cast and their performances are extremely convincing. Not to mention that there is plenty of suspense and action to keep you glued to the screen (even if you've already read the books!) Now I now it's difficult to watch a movie when you've already read the books. People already have preconceived notions about who the actors/actresses should have been, what the setting should look like, or how the plot should unfold. But I promise you, the movie does the book PLENTY of justice. My advice would be to enter the theatre with a big bag of popcorn and an open mind...just make sure it's ready to be blown!","335 out of 636 found this helpful.

Perhaps never before has that hole been as large as the abyss left by the HARRY POTTER series, given the rapid release schedule of those films. It's 2012, and there's no new POTTER. Some might argue that the TWILIGHT series fills the void, yet not only is that franchise little more than a punchline to all but the hardcore fans, it too is set to (hopefully) wrap up this year. Enter THE HUNGER GAMES, seemingly a sure thing based on the POTTER formula: hugely successful series of young adult novels? Check. Talented cast of young leads and respected character actors as support? Naturally. Large scale production and, crucially, marketing budget? You bet. So is THE HUNGER GAMES worthy of taking up the POTTER mantle?Amazingly, it might be even better.While no-one would suggest that THE HUNGER GAMES is the most original new property coming from the Hollywood machine, Lionsgate and director Gary Ross adapt Suzanne Collins' source material in just the right ways, jettisoning un-cinematic elements and focusing on the meat of the story right from the opening frame. Rather than build the world of Panem through tedious exposition and backstory, Ross instead drops us directly into the grim life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her journey to the Hunger Games, a perverse spectacle inflicted annually on 24 unfortunate teens. While the POTTER series certainly headed in a darker direction as it went on, THE HUNGER GAMES is horrifically bleak right from the get go, and Ross' decision to show instead of tell, through the use of wonderfully expressive, fluid camera-work, paints an ugly picture indeed. There are so many refreshing elements at work here, with an active, independent, and strong female protagonist and a startling absence of overblown CGI, but it's the nastiness that makes this film unique. Delivering a family appropriate experience while retaining the majority of the violence and unpleasantness of the novel is a delicate proposition which Ross mostly pulls off, but one can't help wondering about the potential for a much harder, R-rated cut of the film. It's an understandable issue to be sure, but an issue nonetheless.Where THE HUNGER GAMES perhaps doesn't fare so well is in the internal strife faced by Katniss, particularly in regards to potential love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Collins' novel has much more freedom to explore, and even dwell on, Katniss' emotional state through inner monologue, but given the nature of film, particularly a mainstream blockbuster such as this, much less room is left for introspection, and some of the character dynamics and relationships suffer in comparison. Katniss' independence is unfortunately undercut by the franchise building mentality of the film, setting up an inevitable love triangle to be explored in two potential sequels. That said, she's still a much more positive, appropriate female role model than TWILIGHT's limp and passive Bella Swan, or indeed any young female character in recent memory. THE HUNGER GAMES is an important film at many levels, one which heralds the birth of the next big Hollywood franchise, and if the quality of the first installment is maintained then the sequels can't come soon enough.tinribs27.wordpress.com","21 out of 33 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both played parts excellently and I think it is one of best performances for both Jennifer and Josh, the other stars in the film also play well and give a superb finish to the cast.

However what most reviews missed, including the esteemed Ebert, was the I hope Zenith of what David Bordwell calls intensified continuity, a narrative trend towards quick cuts, hand-held cameras, and camera movement. A great example would be the third Bourne movie where there were reports of people throwing up in the theaters, with an average shot length of under 3s.The Hunger Games lacks the clarity of the Bourne film in terms of framing though. As I said, expected the story to have trouble with fidelity, but I was always hopeful that at the very least I would be able to SEE a beloved series in live action.Instead, all I can really remember were a few master shots, some blurry trees and Jennifer Laurence's face. They make up 90% of the 2,500 plus shots in the film. All the action, probably for PG-13 rating, is so closely framed and quickly cut that any comprehension of who is actually doing what to who is retarded. I hear Ross is on for Part 2, so I just rented Battle Royale, and hopefully that can salvage my disappointment. I will say I thought the Trailer was really cool, and the few times you do see Panem, the costumes and make up were spot on. No real complaints with the actors either, they did the best with the screen time they had, even if most of their emotions are unjustifiable without having read the book because the film makes no effort to explain or validate whats going on.","39 out of 88 found this helpful.

Also, the message of persevering through something so tragic, and being the spark of hope that eventually surpasses fear, is a great message for kids -- as well as, good verses evil. If you talk to your children about life and how cruel people can be, and to try and be a good role model for compassion, they will understand this movie. As the old cliché goes ""the book is better than the movie."" -- not so in all cases, but in this, it's true. I have to say, they did a good job with this one -- being that it was written in a first person narration, it was pretty close to the novel, and truly captured the essence of the tragic tale. As usual, with every novel that has been adapted into a screenplay, there will be some changes and some things left out in the making of the film. But, overall I was pleased with this movie. Before anyone critiques it, they should see it, as well as read the books. This movie has been criticized for its violent content -- but, kids today are actually exposed to much worse through TV, movies, video games, music, etc...as well as the DAMAGING doses of sex being slipped into every form of entertainment we're exposed to in our society. We should educate our children with the knowledge of how blessed they are to be living in a free nation such as ours -- instead of places like the Sudan, where people are suppressed, terrorized, starved, and slaughtered, everyday. There is a huge difference in trying to keep your child's innocence intact, compared with keeping them naive to the cruelties of mankind. Also, if you've ever read the famous works of The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and other greats, you'll know that many stories written have exposed children to such good and evil of this world...providing many with a moral to the story. Movies such as Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc...have their share of battles that contain a measure of violence as well -- as so with The Hunger Games, they too, were forced to fight what was evil. I believe, if at all possible, in taking the negative and turning into a positive. The heroin in this story, was able to do that -- as she's a much better role model than most kids have on TV. Also, there are those who're comparing The Hunger Games to a 1999 Japanese novel, Battle Royale. Both novels are great reads in their own right -- don't knock either one of them until you read them both. The stories are completely different as with the characters. The only similarity is the tragic tale of kids being forced to fight to the death with only one survivor aloud to live -- all for the totalitarian purpose of terrorizing and suppressing the nation's populous with its life threatening methods of control, fear-mongering, and propaganda. In Battle Royale: The kids are all of the same age (9Th grade), they are gassed on a bus during a school field trip, kidnapped, and then taken to an island ""School"" as part of a military research project called the ""Program"". These students, from a single class, are isolated and are required to fight the other members from their class to the death, allowing only one survivor to live. In The Hunger Games: The Dictator, President Snow, demands a National ""Reaping"" of two kids, one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18, taken from their home districts to the Capital and calling them ""Tributes"", then forcing them to fight to the death in an unknown arena with only one survivor aloud to live. Two completely different plots, but two very good reads. I could go further into detail about each book, but I'm sure you get the gist of it. I highly recommend that both are read with an open mind, especially for those who are so critical without reading them first.","50 out of 89 found this helpful.

And by that I don't mean just The Hunger Games, but both books and films in overall. With that as my background, I can say I've seen awful a lot of movies and read just as many books. Good and bad. I guess it's also worth mentioning, that I've read all The Hunger Games books as well. Actually, I'm working in a library and therefore can say I've witnessed the sudden ""The Hunger Games"" hype probably from closer than most.It's true that some of the most violent and disturbing parts of the book have taken a friendlier approach in the film. Is that absolutely a bad thing? If putting children to fight each other to death isn't horrible enough without showing bloody killing scenes and battles, there might be something wrong in your own perspective. What happened to you, book readers? Don't you have imagination at all to fill the missing spots or blank spaces?Personally, I liked the book and I liked the movie. I liked the rest of the books as well. Suzanne Collins way of writing is very descriptive. She fills the book with detail, especially about how people act, react and feel. I find it funny when people complain that the actors aren't believable enough in such a situation. How on earth could you know how human being would actually react under such a circumstances? People express emotions differently. Of course the movie wasn't perfect either. It is a faithful adaption from the book, with some flaws here and there. But most importantly it managed to capture the feeling of the book, the emotions, despair and hope, love and hate between the characters. Towards each other and the Capitol.Shooting, setting and music was excellent. Jennifer as Katniss was wonderful, Josh as Peeta was believable and Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley and especially Stanley Tucci were absolutely amazing. This is definitely not a teen movie, nor are the books. I personally feel there was a marketing flaw that prevented The Hunger Games from being an masterpiece it could've been. Either as a book or a film. And that is not because of a friendlier approach on a horrible subject. It's because of the prejudice that ""a teen movie"" or ""a teen book"" can not be intelligent or tackle powerful subjects. In my personal opinion The Hunger Games have a similar feel to one of the best books ever written: George Orwell's 1984. Especially the last book of the series. It's one of those books that leaves you wondering for a long.A tip for all movie goers. If you're going to see movie looking flaws, you're not gonna see anything else at all. Finding flaws from an imperfect creation doesn't make you clever or witty. Go open minded and don't get stuck on details. Look for emotions and let your imagination fill the rest. Trust me, you'll be enjoying movies a lot more often.Despite the differences with the book, I think the film deserves a solid or excellent rating. I gave 10 just to tackle the unfair 1-3 ratings that this movie by no yardstick could deserve.","60 out of 110 found this helpful.

The director and others took major key plot points/characters out of the book. For instance the Avox girl who in the books plays a pivotal part with Katness and the capital. Also they took out how Katness really got the Mockingjay pin and why the capital and President Snow are so evil. I also didn't like how they made this feel like the next teenage girl twilight movie trilogy. The Twilight movies sucked too and now since twilight series is ending Hollywood has gone and ruined a great book so they can bring in the crazed teenage girls to watch a movie that probably some have not even read.

Which is still pretty good. First things first, Hunger games. I haven't read the books and tried to not let myself get ""captured"" by the hype, as it mostly works negatively rather than positively imo. But the basic premise of the story, already dampened my anxiety. Drop people in a cage and the sole survivor wins. Battle royal anyone?? Don't know why no one made this comparison, because it's exactly the same...OK, I'll admit that this movie has more depth... but you can't deny that the killin' in battle was more awesome. Anywho, it's been done before basically. Also, the feeling of oppression, the underdog, the poor ghetto districts vs the rich and famous,... almost everything felt really familiar. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't good either. Another thing was the shaky camera in the beginning...Don't know the meaning of this, because normally you start a scene with a wide shot and then, you do the close-up etc. You don't shake your way through everything, hoping the audience feels like it's 'into' the movie more. The entire beginning up until the reaping was just one long headache to me. What I did like was the heartfelt acting involved. Have to give it up for the casting department here, because (almost) everyone was perfect. My only casting criticism was our president snow or what's he called? Mr. Donald Sutherland. Very fine actor, but what was he doing in here?? Looked like he was about the fall asleep. Which saddens me, because he got a good surrounding cast to work with. Give it up for Jennifer Lawrence who gives the performance of a lifetime. My favorite movie moment was a certain burial scene when the games are well on their way, and afterwards she gives their district's salute to the entire world, and by doing so, give the nudge to her people to fight for their own. Wow, I was just mesmerized by that. OK, the guys involved..Hutchersons, Ludwig and Hemsworth are also very fine actors and hold their own. I was even fine with Woody Harrelson, and that's saying something!!I hope that this movie get's the praise it deserves, as it is soooo much better than a certain other book/movie franchise that's going around, intended for the same age group....Here's hoping for 2 more movies and here's looking at Jennifer Lawrence!Raf","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Having not read the books, and not really knowing what the hell it was about, i dragged my man along and we both thought it was a great movie, me more than him I guess, but he still watched it with me again recently when it came out on DVD.I read all 3 books after I first saw it, and yes there are some plot holes and unexplained things when looking back at the movie, but so what. You cannot possibly put everything from the book in the movie, it would end up being 5 hours long. The only thing that could have been done differently to fill some of the plot holes is made Katniss the narrator, but even after never having read the books before the movie I honestly didn't really get confused. The only thing that could have been explained a bit better was why Gales name was put in 42 times, and Prim's once. The character of Katniss was perfectly cast. Which is just as well because her character was in almost every scene and it was essential that they found the right girl to play her. The haunted look in her eyes, I really believed every emotion she was feeling, and felt so sorry for her. I felt sorry for all the kids. What a horrible world where this is what provides entertainment to the rich folk. Kids killing kids, all for the joy and amusement of others. When they first went into the arena I thought it was going to be a small field and it would be all over in five minutes.All of the actors were great though. I loved Josh Hutcherson is Bridge to Terabithia, but when he popped up on screen in the Hunger Games he was all grown up and a bit of a hottie. And after reading the books, he portrays Peeta perfectly.I hated the characters from Districts 1 and 2, what horrible kids, did they realise only one person could survive in the end, they were acting like they were going to emerge as the final four.Did anyone else think Prim looked like a young, blonde Winona Ryder?Anyway, fantastic movie, and the camera jumping around didn't bother me in the slightest.","21 out of 34 found this helpful.

In the center of the country is the wealthy Capitol, inhabited by lavish-clothed citizens. Surrounding the rich Capitol is twelve outlying districts, each having a different industry and supplying materials for the Capitol. Some of the districts are wealthy (District 1: Luxury, District 2: Masonry, District 4: Fishing), while some are dead-poor (District 11: Agriculture, District 12: Coal mining).Before the film begins, the 13 districts fought with the Capitol, resulting in catastrophe, but eventually the Capitol won. The aftermath: the 12 districts were forced to annually give in a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Games; the participants are called ""tributes"". The 13th District was, unfortunately, obliterated by the Capitol (sort of).Our heroine is sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen who comes from the poor District 12. She's received tesserae to meet the needs of her suffering family, in exchange for getting her name added additional times for the ""Reaping"" (the time when the names of the participants are randomly picked). When her sister's, Primrose Everdeen, name is unexpectedly drawn during the reaping (despite the fact that her name was only there for once), Katniss volunteers to take her place and enter the Hunger Games, a TV show which forces 24 ""tributes"" to fight to the death as a reminder to the rebellion 74 years ago.The heart of Panem, the Capitol is where the ""tributes"" undergo training (Katniss and Peeta have drunken Haymitch) and several interviews. Here, everything looks different from District 12. ""The showers are different"" (as Peeta says), the buildings are more colorful and the people there are lavishly-clothed. The citizens of the Capitol don't join the Games but they do are responsible for giving sponsors: some sort of gift received by the ""tribute"" during the Games. The sponsors depend on their opinions and these opinions usually depend on the ""tributes'"" scores given by the Gamemakers; each of the ""tributes"" are evaluated by the Gamemakers based on their skills and the higher the scores, the more likely chance they're going to get sponsors. After the evaluation, we get the interviews hosted by the eccentric Caesar Flickerman, and the Games begin in 3 ... 2 ... 1.The 24 ""tributes"" run at once in different directions, some to the tempting backpacks filled with valuable items, some clashing to kill some ""tributes"", some escaping to the wild.Pushing the PG-13 rating to its fullest, the Games do involve blood and some deadly kills. While Katniss and Peeta are relatively quiet, some of the Careers (""tributes"" who spent their entire lives practicing for the Games) are very brutal especially Cato of District 2. The Careers form a pack to kill the other ""tributes"" first before they kill each other until only one remains. ""The Hunger Games"" is often compared to the ""Twilight"" films. They may have a similarity (a love triangle which places Katniss in the middle of Gale and Peeta), but the main focus of the film is not the love triangle. Katniss originally loved Gale but because of the ""Reaping"", Katniss allied with Peeta Mellark. That's basically what the love triangle covers. The love triangle is only a piece in a larger plot set in the dystopian future surrounding the Hunger Games. The film has an excellent cast. Putting Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine Katniss Everdeen is nothing but perfect. Coming off from an Oscar nomination two years ago, she's one to rise into super stardom. Her performance here is very convincing and very powerful that she deserves an Oscar right there on the spot. Her ability to show rage, nervousness, fear, determination, sadness, is just very spellbinding. John Hutcherson is also one not to be missed. His portrayal of Peeta Mellark is convincing also, being able to display nervousness, and fear. The others were also excellent: Alexander Ludwig plays Cato viciously, and brutally; Woody Harrelson plays the drunk Haymitch perfectly; Stanley Tucci portrays Caesar Flickman with charisma and style; Elizabeth Banks depicts Effie Trinket with meticulous details. The action is another thing the movie excels in. Although there might have not been a lot of intense explosions or ""Kabooms!"", the moments that take place in the Arena are thrilling likewise. The fight is not about action but more about hunting and survival skills. Katniss is relatively quiet, unlike the Careers who are more excited about getting into a fight where they are able to snap people's necks. The film is based on a novel, a novel I enjoyed immensely. With the author Suzanne Collins also playing a part in writing the screenplay, the movie is faithful to the book's contents. Although there are slight alterations, there are no major alterations that might change the course of the plot (such as ""Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief""). Anyone who has read the books will be pleased with how Gary Ross transformed the book into this film. Not a fan of the books, no problem, you can still enjoy this film. In other words, anyone can enjoy the film. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""The Hunger Games"" is an action-packed drama that lives up to its massive hype and can be enjoyed by anyone.","36 out of 63 found this helpful.

A fascist government led by President Snow ( Donald Sutherland) has forged a program for teens , broadcasting live like a reality television movie . In this fictional universe, some teenagers are randomly selected and sent into forests during various days to participate in The Hunger Games . Teens are given an only chance , all they have to do is survive an on going battle with especially trained young assassins in the woods .

The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch . When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim (Shields), is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place . She and her male counterpart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives (the nasty Alexander Ludwig) who have trained for this their whole lives. This exciting film contains dramatic events , action , thrills, suspense , blood and is plenty of graphical violence .

"","","Sponsored","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2662060/?ref_=tt_urv","chaos-rampant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17699578/?ref_=tt_urv","18 August 2012","I am using a somewhat popular blogging platform (not google's) for workspace on a project I'm running on cinematic abstraction. I am not into the social aspect of it, though I have developed contacts. It just offers appealing options in the code. Now and then, as a kind of smoke break, I switch from personal work on my dashboard to the general stream of published content. I mostly filter for cinema, so suppose I am blocking out a lot of junk, but still, being able to tune in that channel of youthful stream-of-consciousness allows for some pretty cool observations.The age of average user in that place seems to be below twenty. They blog and reblog like crazy, with new posts arriving every minute. The level is several notches above Twitter, and predominantly visual. It goes beyond 'liking' something, to putting together some attractive personality. Items that get a lot of traction, within what is filtered by me, include fashion, urban nightscape photography, Sofia Coppola, everything tagged Dali and surrealism. There is the occasional Walt Whitman quote followed by pictures of waffles or movie stars.So, spending quite a bit of time with (partially) the target-group for this film, I have to report: a sizable portion of our youth is not dumb and desensitized, it seems to me, they may be melodramatic (youth seldom isn't), but they are curious, alert, visual creatures. They are looking for art that teases the imagination. In ten years time, some of them are going to be commendable artists. So, if I'm being honest, I would be much, much more accepting of something like this, if it was a spontaneous, say collaborative project generated by teenagers from that community. The focus would have been largely the same, I'm sure: stifled passions, cruel , dystopic adult world. But the personality?What we have here is that adults in the high corporate levels have made many of the same remarks, and here is the shrewd business plan: nicely package teenage dynamics inside the visual culture that consumes and defines them. It's a smart move, and this is the most acutely aware of the recent crop, so much so it makes (the first) Twilight seem naive and old Hollywood.What does this mean? The film is made from a lot of spare parts, as though reblogged (Battle Royale is only the most recent and obvious). It is shot as a fast-moving stream of visual snippets that is not at all the Bourne effect: the idea here is less the first-person character experience, and more of a comfortable cognitive map for a young audience growing up on internet and instant interconnectivity. It takes place in a world that venerates spectacle and celebrity, with the Gamers paraded around 'tinseltown' like the hottest new MTV stars. The battleground arena is filmed by hundreds of cameras that instantly connect everywhere, including the skies.So far so good, an effectively aligned version of contemporary pop culture. The action once it kicks in is formulaic, but that is because the guys running this have no imagination: you can observe the director of the Games and his team of assistants, every decision they make to affect the gameflow, instead of perhaps intelligently structuring the situation is absolutely contrived and geared for special-effects: most of all, nondescript monsters to speed-up the finale. The artistic personality, since every decision is of an artistic nature, is simply unappealing.But, here's the catch that entirely sinks this: like a bunch of smarmy, Victorian-era schoolteachers, adults responsible for this - the 'sponsors' for the event - couldn't resist imposing on the teenage playground fun with a combination of finger-wagging, 1984-style fearmongering about the future, and sensationalized movie-treatment of suffering.The film was designed in the vein of, hinges its entire appeal, and probably used every channel of that visual culture to access an audience, then turns around and claims that culture is decadent, exploits and degrades. Moreover, it attempts, this multimillion dollar product, to remind us that outside of the comfortably-numb limits of reality TV and the internet, in the real world out there persists hunger, inequality, and poverty. The lead is played by a girl who two years ago in Winter's Bone had to eke out a miserable existence in southern Missouri, another clue of short-sighted imagination, casting her because she was good there. The downbeat scenario is replicated whole here, including the killing of squirrels for food.In other words: ""sit down in the multiplex to have fun with this thing you have seen advertised on TV and across the internet, while we lecture with important statements on the state of the world.""If I was sixteen now, maybe I wouldn't know it, but I believe that younger self would deserve much better. So if you are that age and looking for something that nourishes with rejection, I would turn you over to something like Godard's Breathless or Harmony Korine's Gummo: rebellious films made by young filmmakers in the effort to capture a little something of what it means to live in the world. Breathless (conventionally) popularized the jump-cut that is the main device here, but was using it as a breach with established ways of seeing. It was radical in its time, and you deserve something radical in yours.This is the 'sponsored' version, where adults take your money while pretending to educate.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

In many cases, I have no idea where the book and film differ and my expectations were quite different from my daughter--who has read the series. However, one this that DID bother me is that despite the film's title, no one appeared to be all that hungry in the film and the way food was used to manipulate and control the masses was not explained well. The only way I knew this was that my daughter sat next to me and explained this (and it helps that we both know sign language). But apart from that and the god-awful 'shaky cam"" (one of the WORST inventions in the history of filmmaking), the film was enjoyable and engrossing throughout. As I said, though, the shakiness of the film (especially at the beginning) was a problem--and I felt motion sick just watching the movie! The plot and movie have already been discussed in a bazillion reviews. The film has already been out about 45 days when I saw it tonight, so I don't want to give a lengthy review. Instead, I'll talk about what I liked. Foremost, the acting was really, really nice. I cared about the characters I was supposed to care about and it tore my guts out when one of them was killed in the film--showing what a nice job they did and how well the director elicited the performances. I liked the story a lot--especially since I love dystopian sci-fi films. In many ways it was like combining the original ""Rollerball"" and, perhaps, ""Gladiator""! It was truly original and kept me riveted. All in all, a terrific film--well worth your time provided you don't mind the violence necessary to convey the story. However, despite the books being very popular with kids, I would think twice about bringing any kids younger than about 12 or 13.]","20 out of 35 found this helpful.

The world of the film fascinated me, the story was great, the characters as well, especially because of the great actors portraying them. Good special effects, OK action and good times at the movies.What I hated though, was the cinematography. The hand-held camera, the shaky-cam irritated me so much, I couldn't enjoy many parts of the film because of it. The fast-paced editing didn't help either! Sometimes things got so confusing, I couldn't tell what was going on on the screen. And the camera never stopped! It would've been great to let our eyes have some rest between poorly coordinated action scenes, but the darn camera just kept on moving! This has to stop. This style of shooting isn't good. Stop it. Please.Other than this unfortunate error, I enjoyed the movie. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how good the adaptation was, but I think the screenwriter(s) did a terrific job. There were a couple things I didn't like about the story though: the ending, which I found predictable, and someone's death, which I think was overemphasized. The love story seemed forced to me too, but maybe it was better written in the book. I also missed the twists. All the major plot points were in the trailer, so there weren't any surprises. I loved Stanley Tucci in the film and Jennifer Lawrence was a perfect action star.Another thing I didn't like was the PG-13 rating. Some scenes could've been so awesome, but the editors took away the sound, added some heart-braking music to the shakily shot scenes, making them hard to enjoy. The film could've had so much potential if the studio didn't want to stick to the lower rating. Blood and gore is fun! Especially when the theme of the movie is so brutal. People expect to see more, than just quick, shaky images that only imply the action, rather than show it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's almost unwatchable, it's such a mess. They changed key factors for the movie, like where the mockingjay pin came from, and the meaning of it. They cut out all of the violence and nudity, as well as key scenes that developed the characters and their relationships, making this movie feel incomplete and jumbled together. I mean there was no back story for Haymitch, Gale,or any of the Tributes, other than a few lines. Imagine reading a book and stopping in the middle of a sentence and skipping every other line, and sometimes entire chapters! The movie feels completely rushed with no direction and horribly edited. The director should be shot. I've seen better direction on an episode of Jersey Shore! Though the actors do a great job with what pieces of the script weren't cut out. The entire movie I kept waiting for commercials to come on, like I was watching network TV. I'm not sure where the $78,000,000 went!

The people is delighted watching on TV a bloody, morbid and perverse competition, where innocent children are forced to kill each other, to survive just one of them. The children reflect very well on their faces, own innocence of a child and the panic of knowing what is going to happen. I guess to direct a film where getting children to convey the panic on their faces, or the pleasure of being the winner of a bloodily competence, killing another, should at least have caused some bad dream to the director","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Its Twilight all over again I thought.However The Hunger Games features youngsters in a dystopian future where in the name of peace an annual event is held where selected kids between the ages of 12 to 18 years of age have to fight to the death until the last one standing is declared the victor.Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss who takes the place of her younger sister. Woody Harrelson is the former winner from her sector who teaches her and the male participant from the same sector, Peeta. Harrelson seems not to care and is a drunk but as the film goes on shows perceptive insights as he lobbies on behalf of both the participants as well as training them on how to survive.The film is a mish mash of various themed films such as Battle Royale, Rollerball, The Running Man, Westworld, The Truman Show.Its entertaining but in a daft way. The young actors give it their all, Lawrence shows why she is one of the best young actors out there. However what kind of society which televises this tribute called The Hunger Games thinks its fair that a 12 year old can go up against a 18 year old? Never mind that the viewing public has such a blood lust to watch televised murder on screen when its clear during the selection process that the public are not happy that their children could be selected to participate in the games.The film is also overlong, it is sanitized enough to keep its teen audience happy without the violence being too visceral. Its surprisingly enjoyable but adults are likely to be more discerning than a younger audience.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The actors are competent, a mile better than that twilight rubbish - decent cast; but the implementation of the filming and the way the story is portrayed is poor. Most people will have read the books, if not - do, the film is a poor reflection. Not enough focus on the circumstance the people have been forced to live under, nice scenes up until the hero's get to district 1, but pre-arena and in the arena the story changes from telling the story to a number of poorly imagined variations of the set pieces in the book, to such an extent that it gets embarrassing to watch. Each 'major' scene is trimmed to its absolute minimal essence and does not link well chronologically. Suddenly Katniss finds some random blood and voilà, there is Peter? I'm sorry - but cake decorating and being Leonardo DaVinci in body painting, with no links or explaining material? Absolute rot, and just accepting on one or two arrow shots that Katniss is ""Herne the Hunter"" reborn does not scan well, and without the books support its a bit of a head nod ""Yeah right"" for too much of her exploits.I saw Pirates on the same day, which blew me away, creative, good characters and story and compared to a poorly told story with a huge budget; I would take it any day of the week.Imagine ""The Golden Compass"" but a better story and acting; i.e. it still sucks like a kid on a MacDonalds milkshake; but you don't feel 'quite' as bad for the production crew...Also, almost nobody has mentioned how its a blatant rip-off of The Running Man - only with teenagers, The Running Man is superior in so may respects, but this film has the advertisers buck and a lot of money men rubbing their hands. Lets hope this overrated debacle improves in the second and (groan) third parts.Don't get me wrong, the film with such a small amount of change in the direction and a few better linking scenes could have been excellent, but as it stands it simply isn't a good film. One of the main bugbears is the lack of involvement from the outside world when the combatants are in the arena; a few poorly chosen scenes and some weird sky-dome CG - nothing of Haymitch's efforts on the outside, crowd reactions to internal events, sponsors gifts etc... (I'm sorry - but the soup scene after so much focus on this aspect in the books, is simply poor storytelling) just random unjustified huge escalations in the social situations, which also does not bear out the book. i.e. the populace has been watching this show for 74 years, yet all of a sudden one of the contestant dies (The young herb girl, uh-huh) yet now they are so peeved they revolt violently. 5-6 out of 10 is fair, but for the money they spent and the advertising overdrive 4 is more accurate.If you haven't read the books, you'll wonder what all the fuss is about, and if you did read the books - you will moreso.Wait for the DVD; or better still don't watch it - suckers to the advertisers one and all :-(","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Truman Show meets Battle Royale? I had hoped so.Disclaimer: I had read the novel before watching the movie. As a result, comparisons to the book are inevitable. I have also watched The Truman Show and Battle Royale, which this movie remixed and gurgled out, inadequately.What's good: The novel was the first that I had been able to read cover to cover within 24 hours, in a really long time. While the concept of children killing each other in a scenario of complete societal breakdown is not new (Lord of the Flies), Collins did manage to put a decent spin on it and make it an interesting read. Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist, is a strong character and an ace archer and when she volunteers to take her little sister's place in the morbid contest, its hard to not root for her.Played by the gorgeous and fast-rising Jennifer Lawrence, Katniss genuinely comes across as a do-gooder and one who doesn't take things lying down. She is assisted in her conquest by the other tribute from District 12 -Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who for me was one of the better actors in the movie.Stanley Tucci as the MC was entertaining. The only stand-out performer for me was Woody Harrelson who plays the District 12 mentor.What's not: Okay so I really did not enjoy the movie. Several reasons. The screenplay was highly unimaginative. With a fine crop of actors, I could not understand how the director managed to get such wooden performances out of everyone! In spite of its $100 million budget, the special effects looked shoddy and very 90s. The camera work was appalling – it was always too dark or too shaky. When you film two people going for each other's throat, you must film from a distance, not from 2 feet away! The editing was very off – several scenes just did not flow from the previous one.But the worst part was, the setting just could not match the imagery of Panem that I had in mind. It didn't even come close. But I guess, very few movies can do justice to the book. I hated the Harry Potter movies as well (No Emma Watson, I still do love you!).I think this movie just didn't know what it's target audience was. You want 2 dozen kids' throats to be brutally slit and you want to get a PG rating for the movie?! Even Harry Potter was much more adventurous in spite of its audience being 11-year olds.Verdict: The script may come across as inventive to people. Heck, I think a lot of people will actually really love this movie. But then I recommend watching The Truman Show and Battle Royale and reconsider your rating for this movie.My rating: 6/10","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games are based on a book and here things already go wrong. It is loosely based on the book. I just will refer to the dogs at the end of this flick, here they are created by the masters of the game. In the book they are the dead that resurrect into dogs. A big difference and also one of the reasons that shows that it was made for the youngsters among us. While the books have a lot of blood and gore the flick doesn't show us anything of that. But is it all that bad, no, there are a few good actions taking place and it never bored me but it failed by choosing for a flick that fits for whole the family. By saying that it brings me back to another trilogy I doesn't like, Twilight. The way the lover birds are talking does take you back to Twilight. I was more into the brutal Immortals (2012) a flick that failed for others but worked out fine for me. If you like The hunger Games but would prefer it a bit rougher then I should recommend Battle Royale (2000) but let's wait for the remake of Battle Royale coming out in 2015 if it will be like the original one.Effects and acting was okay but it's a trilogy I wont follow any more.

""The Hunger Games"" presents a similar compelling premise. In the world of Panem, there is one Capitol and 12 districts. Before the events of the story, there were 13 districts which eventually rose up in rebellion, led by District 13. The Capitol was able to put down the rebellion, and District 13 was razed to the ground. However, the rebellion was not the end of the story, and the current dictator of Panem upholds a yearly tradition to remind the remaining districts of their violent past, called ""the Dark Days"".As punishment for the rebellion and as a reminder of who's ""in charge"", the Capitol hosts a violent pageant every year. Twenty-four young people of pre-college age are chosen by lottery to participate in the pageant; one boy and one girl from each district. The plot is a dark take on reality television contests: the pageant, called ""The Hunger Games"", requires the 24 tributes (they're not called contestants) engage in a fight-to-the-death contest in a wilderness-like arena controlled by unseen technicians in a war room of sorts. Only one tribute can be declared the winner at the end of the games, essentially requiring the other 23 tributes to perish. The games are broadcast on large screens so members of each district can watch the fates of their representatives. The event is hosted by a television game-show host/MC, Claudius Templesmith (Stanley Tucci), who makes Richard Dawson (of Family Feud fame) seem like a high-cultured gentleman. ""And may the odds be ever in your favor!"" is the motto of the Games.Of the 12 remaining districts, District 12 is the poorest, made up of primarily miners and other blood-and-sweat workers. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a teen girl who has self-taught herself to use the bow to hunt for game and sell in the town. On Tribute Day, all the youth from age 12 to 18 are brought to the town square where Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a resident of the Capitol who, like many of her colleagues, enjoys wearing garish and flamboyant outfits, hosts the lottery ceremony. She picks Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields), Katniss' sister to participate. Katniss, stunned, offers to volunteer for the Games in her sister's stead. Since this is the first time someone has ever volunteered, the proposition is accepted by the State. The other tribute from District 9 is Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson).Katniss and Peeta are chaperoned by Effie Trinket to the Capitol on a bullet train. There they meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a winner of the Hunger Games many years previously. He is there to help train and instruct Katniss and Peeta, but his highest priority seems to be drinking and snoozing. Eventually, Katniss and Peeta with interesting finesse convince Abernathy that they are worth helping.Once at the Capitol, they are paraded in front of the elite residents who cheer and decide which tributes they wish to root for. The tributes are then brought to a training facility, being told not to ""hurt"" any of the other tributes. They say there will be plenty of time for violent engagement relatively soon! They are treated like celebrities about to embark on a fashion pageant, being given beautiful outfits to wear during interviews. Of course, everyone knows the outcome of the pageant means 23 of the 24 tributes will not survive. Eventually, on the fateful day, the 24 tributes are transported to the arena-wilderness area where food and weapons are strewn about which can be used to better someone's chances. We also learn that the game is also ""rigged"". The control room doesn't just monitor the tributes but has power to influence situations. There are also ""sponsors"", Capitol residents, who can aid tributes they like. This story has become more relevant with the rise of ""fake news"" and distrust of television journalism with distorted media.Overall, a well-done and impassioned view of a bleak future which rings of Orwell's ""1984"" and the 1970's cult classic ""Roller Ball"". In ""Roller Ball"" two teams donning skates battle each other on a rink. In the final game, players can only leave the game if they're killed, which is essentially the same idea as ""The Hunger Games"". The film finds a good balance between the heartlessness of the competition (if competition it can be called) and the emotions of the characters. At one point, Katniss befriends a young African-American girl, Rue (Amandla Stenberg), who is obviously too young to be part of the games. They become allies to help each other defend against another ""gang"" who desires to kill them. One of the most touching and poignant moments of the film is their friendship and Rue's fate.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

If you have seen it, you will see this movie as a bit of a lesser version of basically the same concept but if you haven't, you'll probably be taken by this movie and it's daring and unusual concept.Personally, I had seen ""Battle Royale"" and it's actually one of my favorite movies as well. So no, I'm not overpraising this movie for its originality but I also had some more general problems with it as well, which prevented me from seeing this movie as an absolutely perfect, or a must-see- for everyone.Nothing wrong with its concept or overall story really but the storytelling was still a bit lacking at times. It doesn't always have a right balance of action, social commentary or drama in it, to make an effective enough impact with any of it. The first half of the movie is actually quite slow once you start thinking back about it and it takes a bit too long with its buildup. You could all 'blame' this really on the fact that this movie got based on a popular novel, by Suzanne Collins. Certain storytelling techniques make this apparent and it are little things like this that cause the movie too slow down a bit too much at times.But obviously it didn't bother me all too much, since I still could enjoy the movie. I never really saw this movie as a deep or provoking one but it was one that was very entertaining to watch. It's a real good thing that lots of money get pumped into this movie, since it truly lifts it to greater heights. It uses good looking special effects (it's also a science-fiction movie after all) and some spectacular action.You might be surprised at how violent this movie can be to watch at times. You might not expect this coming from a movie that features a couple of teens, as the movie its leads but that's actually what the whole movie is all about, with some bit more depth behind it but not all too much really. It doesn't ever delves deep enough into things or explains everything properly. You could complain about this, or you could simply take it and sit back and enjoy the ride, just as I did. The movie also does a good job at creating a certain atmosphere. It's set in the future but not a too distant future. So basically that means that this isn't really a too futuristic looking movie and is easy to place yourself into. The look and settings do feel a bit odd at times but never in a too overdone or not realistic enough type of way.It's certainly watchable as entertainment but I wouldn't exactly call it the movie of the year.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

That actually might explains why the movie made no sense at all to me.The characters are the most shallow I have seen in years. The story is nothing original and looks like it could fit on a post-it. Filming is lackluster and special effects (if any) are no better than a standard TV show. Action is nearing zero and the ending is just plain ridiculous, even as a (non-)cliffhanger for further movies.Apparently, A LOT of context was left out of the movie from the books, which is hardly excusable as the movie is long and slooowwww, so it can only be described as support material for the books, not as a standalone movie of any value.Bottom line: If you didn't read the books, don't even consider going to see this ""thing"".","23 out of 60 found this helpful.

"8","/10","An excellent stand-alone film that doesn't belong in a series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2589429/?ref_=tt_urv","jburtroald95","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20744367/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2012","After last year's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 famously hammered the nail in the coffin of the beloved Potter franchise, many avid teenage readers and moviegoers searched frantically for another dependably exciting adventure series to fill the aching, gaping hole that was left after the worldwide heartbreak. The fact that many of them believe that they've found it with Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games will, it seems, mitigate the power of what is really an inspired, intelligent, brilliantly crafted fable and provide egoistic film critics with the perfect ammunition to blast away the threat to their vain conservatism. This should never have really been a series, because it works on the same level as other eerie futuristic pieces such as George Orwell's fascinating 1984 or Ridley Scott's rickety but well-intentioned Blade Runner (1982). Books or films belonging to a pre-mediated fantasy or science fiction series usually end quite inconclusively and mysteriously, with a neat explanation being provided in the final instalment. This perfectly packaged ending is made possible by the disconnect from the real world, but The Hunger Games is very much focused on harsh realities and palpable, relatable ambiguities, or at least it was until the sequel Catching Fire was published in 2009. The main premise of the story might have been typical of teenage entertainment – yet nevertheless exciting – but the insightful earlier and later passages are what set it apart from mainstream blockbuster entertainment.As most people know, the story centres on young Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who struggles to support her family and to cope personally in a brutal dystopian future. She lives in the last of twelve strictly separated districts that get progressively poorer, although each has been oppressed severely by the Capitol, particularly after the great insurrection that occurred several decades before Katniss' birth. This is where one of the story's most unique aspects comes in, in that the violent and passionate rebellion that usually takes centre stage in these stories has come and gone unsuccessfully, and has had adverse effects on the later generations. Now, every year, the Capitol draws names out of a ballot and takes a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18, gives them a brief bit of training and places them all in an arena in a gruelling fight to the death that becomes a twisted reality television show for the entire population. Katniss volunteers as a tribute after her fragile, 12-year-old sister is called up, along with the humble and kindly Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who is just as convinced that he will lose because of his useless fighting skills as he is that Katniss will win because of her determination and hunting experience, and is eager for them to pose as ""star-crossed lovers"" in order to gain publicity and extra assistance from sponsors.What follows is their navigation of a perilous moral, philosophical, physical and emotional minefield whilst they try to find a balance between staying true to themselves and their personal beliefs, even if it means defying the Capitol, and being strategic and adaptable enough to survive. It would be a very laborious task to describe the many details of these rich plot developments, but due mention must go to a few of the most intriguing characters, and the actors that so impressively embody them. Liam Hemsworth effectively plays the supporting character of Gale, Katniss' best friend, who always optimistically insists that they should flee to the forest to live as nature intended and be free of the Capitol. He is just as likable as Peeta, and both are naïve and coldly realistic in their own way. 12- year-old newcomer Amandla Stenberg beautifully captures the innocence and cheekiness of Rue, a gentle but elusive young tribute who is incredibly adept at climbing. Jack Quaid, another newcomer, somehow manages to mask his natural warmth in order to play an insufferably pompous yet undeniably tough and dangerous competitor from the wealthier area of district 1, where tributes are fiercely trained from a young age and volunteer with pleasure to slaughter the poorer citizens. As for Katniss herself, the still unsteady Jennifer Lawrence has proved to be the perfect casting choice. Our heroine is very similar to her Oscar- nominated role in Winter's Bone (2010) and no doubt she's used many of the same characterisation techniques to portray this tough, earthy yet very sympathetic character, but here she has refined her acting skills enough to make the audience like her as well as the Academy. Josh Hutcherson has also been very well cast as Peeta, being very believable and incredibly moving. It is a pleasure to see him still acting well and prominently after his terrific efforts as a child actor in the last decade, and hopefully he will make the transition to serious adult actor. Lenny Kravitz portrays another powerfully sympathetic character, Cinna, the only Capitol official who recognises the cruelty and harshness of the Hunger Games and extends a gentle, helping hand towards Katniss. Indeed, the upper class is a ghastly sight. Respected actors Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones and Elizabeth Banks stagger on screen as outrageously dressed, ridiculously drunk, shamelessly shallow and often shockingly heartless bureaucrats that appear to be caricatures at first glance, but eventually one realises that as far as representations of government officials go they couldn't be more realistic.A story such as this could never have a concrete ending and remain believable, and unfortunately, by giving it an ending across two sequels, Suzanne Collins has ruined this marvellous fable's chances of ever being taken seriously by anyone over the age of twenty. Still, make sure you experience this fantastic book and film.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie has not been reviewed fairly at all. You gotta look past the book okay movies that are based on book are going to be different from the film always because books are a bundle of words on a page. Unless your running time is 7 hours for the film naturally you have to cut and paste all I am saying to you hardcore book fans out there is be aware of that. Films and books are two completely different mediums. As for some reviews on this film I failed to see the Blair witch camera work relations at all. The movie was shot quite decently there it's an action film the camera needs to move around in order to bring the audience in if the camera just sat on a tripod you'd complain that the action got away from you. Great fight choreography well written story with some good direction. The cast was wonderful in their performances the only two thing that bugged me were the fact that glimmer died at all and the starship flying over head in the forest.

As a reader of the first book but not the sequels, I liked how Katniss was an independent and strong character and that it's a teen lit novel that doesn't become a love story. The idea is great (I'm a firm Battle Royale fan) but the writing was only fair- too many cheap cliffhangers- but I felt that it would translate excellently to the screen. However I was able to avoid the hype and hold a very neutral, yet educated stance.The structure of the book is intact. From start to finish the film is very faithful, with the only exception being that a flashback is told sporadically in the film instead of being laid out early in the book. The time distribution however is not equal throughout the film: the first act is skimmed through. It gets the plot rolling quickly, but the characters suffer- something that happens a lot. Gale, Prim and Mom see so little screen time, which makes The Reaping feels very wrong. It seems too quiet and empty, despite silence being the point of it.Very early we get to the Capitol, which is lushly realized despite some very plain visual effects. The costumes and locales are ridiculous, extravagant and ignorant like the citizens who wear and occupy them. And the Games itself jump right out of the book.There's two major, looming problems with the film, which are the assumptions filmmakers made about you and removing the narrator. Suzanne Collins, the author of the books, co-wrote the screenplay. So in her mind, it is assumed you know anything she leaves out of the film because you have to have read the book. For example, who Foxface is. Readers know, but if you are in the dark you probably won't understand until her arc is completed. In fact, most characters disappear in the film- Thresh gets one line, Clove, and Rue even. The thing that could have rectified this problem was taken out of the film: Katniss' thoughts. The perspective changed in transfer to objective, meaning we only see what happens, no thoughts about them. Katniss' thoughts could explained so much that didn't need to be shown and wasn't. Maybe a full blown narration wouldn't have worked, but even hearing her think to herself sometimes, or hearing things others said earlier, or even Nathan Drake (Uncharted) style talking to herself could've fleshed out the world and made the film easier to stomach for those who didn't read.There are more issues though. The camera gets ridiculous. Understandably, not all of the violence could be shown on screen, but the action shots here are sickeningly unfocused and uninspired. A late change to the 'dogs' makes the scene impersonal and has the cheapest scare I've ever seen in a PG film, and like the source material there's not much closure. Despite a healthy 2:20 runtime, characters are really underdeveloped (Peeta's alliance has no repercussions or explanation, mind-boggling), and it still feels slow in some areas. The visual effects are lazy- the flaming dress is SO BAD- it put very dangerous words in my head: cash in. There are some great performances though. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is perfect, strong and unaffected by men, and the film thankfully has even less forced romance than the book. And while it's not played up for excitement, she kicks some ass for survival. Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) makes the best of any support. He's captivating, a clearly haunted and tired character, but still humorous and helpful. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) is a character I can't even remember from the book, and I'm conflicted about him. Some parts he seems too nice to be the Gamemaker, and in others he seems too cruel, but he gets a fantastic last scene that I think was the best original thing they added. It's very poetic. Lastly Cato (Alexander Ludwig) is the primary tribute antagonist, and I always pictured a very intimidating young man playing him. So while the casting isn't the best for him, he's convincingly vicious.The atmosphere slips sometimes. Some parts nail the desperation and horror of the event, but others actually coaxed laughter from the audience like a very important and tense last scene from the book that had the whole theater giggling- still not sure if it was intended to be comedic.The Hunger Games has its ups and downs, but a solid core. It's a fair adaptation of material heavier than its developed audience and it shows in the film that the goal is to make lots of money from fans. It's a good couple of hours but not an especially memorable film. If you're a fan of the novels you'll love because you'll actually understand it, but if you're like me, on the fringe, or haven't read them at all, don't feel too bad if you miss this one. 7.5/10","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So before The Truman Show, which is essentially the same idea as The Hunger Games, we have Battle Royale, The Running Man and of course, Rollerball. They all deal with mass entertainment in a dystopian future society and they all have their flaws. What's really disappointing about The Hunger Games is that unless you've read the book, the film will give you only a fleeting glimpse into why the games are called that. There's nothing else to help the naive reader make sense of the plot and because of this, the involvement of children will seem a bit odd to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact, that's something you should take into account when reading many of the reviews of the film as they're written by people who have read the books and can fill in the wide gaps in the film without even thinking about it. Some have said its plot line is mildy satirical, but in my view that's just an excuse for a poorly filleted and disappointing adaptation of a marvellous book.","554 out of 945 found this helpful.

It's also based on a series of books by author Suzanne Collins. In this action packed Katniss is an independent girl who tries her best to care for her young sister and unstable mother. When her young sister Prim is chosen to take part in the deadly ""Hunger Games"", a fight to the death for safety, riches, fame, and freedom Katniss decides to take Prim's place to fight for her sister. The film takes place in the country of Panem which is a post apocalyptic North America. The acting was great. The cinematography was good also. The film was dramatic but not too over the top. It really showed the struggle that the characters faced throughout the film.The country of Panem was divided into 13 districts. After an uprising The Capitol decided to destroy District 13, leaving the country with only 12 Districts. As a way to remember the lives lost during the rebellion that took place decades earlier the Capitol started ""The Hunger Games"". Two people (1 boy, 1 girl) from each of the 12 districts that North America is divided into after the uprising have to fight to the death. Only one is left standing. Fighting for her life, Katniss competes with 23 other people, Katniss and Peeta are representatives of District 12. They come from a dark depressing District full of coal miners. Peeta and Katniss soon find themselves working together to eliminate the other players. Soon a friendship forms between them that could kill them or save them both.An aspect of the film that I really enjoyed was the acting; I loved it. The chemistry between the characters was believable. When the characters didn't particularly like it each other it was convincing. The style of acting in the movie went well with the plot. It wasn't too dramatic and it also wasn't depressing. The actors knew how to act in that moment. I especially thought Jennifer Lawrence did great in her portrayal of Katniss. If you've ever read the books Katniss seems to not care about anyone except her young sister and Jennifer really showed that in the film. The way Jennifer acted when her character didn't like someone was very believable. Katniss isn't very emotional or friendly, which is another thing Jeniffer portrayed well. I also enjoyed Josh Hutcherson's portrayal of Peeta. I believed the emotions being portrayed by the character. I believed when he was in love, angry sad etc Overall every person did a great job portraying their characters. The style of acting was good also. It went well with the film. They did not act like they were bored as a way to convey sadness. The actors really conveyed the sadness the characters were supposed to feel. I also loved the cinematography used in the film. I thought when the camera shook really went well with the moments it was apart of. It heightened the sense of restlessness, hopelessness and chaos. It stuck with the movies theme of sacrifice, hopelessness and the need people have to survive. I loved when this particular use of the camera was used during moments of running because it really immersed me in the film. It made you feel like you were apart of the moment. The use of that type of cinematography also went well with fighting scenes in the movie, it really heightened the chaos that was going on in the scene. It also made the scenes more dramatic which is a good thing in a movie like this. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. I've already seen it like three times and I would definitely watch it again. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 12 because they might not be able to handle violence, but I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action drama and a little romance. Also to anyone who has read the series of books. They really keep true to the story except for a few changes, but the movie was great without them. ""The Hunger Games"" is a great movie that brought tears to my eyes and kept me at the edge of my seat. I truly enjoyed it, and I hope that more people see it because it is a great movie.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

I have never read the novel, but knew much about it going in. Going out, I might've known less. If that's possible.The film is simple, moderately effective entertainment, but slow, a tad incompetent, and a bit overblown in some areas. The film centers around the nation of Panem, which has replaced North America. It is a totalitarian nation, with its government inflicting harsh punishments and dictatorship this way and that. Every year, they hold an event called ""The Hunger Games,"" where two people, a male and a female from each of the twelve districts of Panem, battle to the death until one remains. It is done to further assure the Capitol has any and all authority, and that they can do what they want, when they want. No question.The girl chosen from District 12 is Prim Everdeen (Shields), younger sister of sixteen year old Katniss (Lawrence) who volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen from the district is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), who has had a life-long crush on Katniss. Both are taken from the district to train relentlessly for the games, which involve mainly practicing their archery skills. By far the most entertaining character in the whole film is Haymitch, portrayed wonderfully by Woody Harrelson, the only living victor from District 12. He mentors both Katniss and Peeta as they enter the most grueling task of their life.Let's start with the landscapes and the cinematography. When we see them, they are wonderful. Breathtaking and consuming. But director Gary Ross seems to enjoy seeing them through a shaky, indistinct position. It may not be his own fault, just his lack of credible experience. A good portion of the film and its battle scenes are captured with a shaky camera, possibly to add to the idea that the action is so fast-paced and non-linear the camera can't keep up. Even during some of the regular scenes the camera remains this way. It would've been nice if The Hunger Games could capture its battle scenes in a calm, collective, and controlled manner, but instead, it favors the route of incoherency and disjointedness.From a stylistic approach, the film is rather nice to look at. We do get well-deserved backstory on how the country operates and functions, but we don't learn enough about our leads. Also, these characters are being grossly toyed with in this nation. Does anyone try to rebel or overthrow the government? Or are they so oblivious to the idea of dictatorship and develop a strong contentment for this world. It seems illogical, when you think about it.The Hunger Games has its areas of strength. For one, its female leader is no priss. It's so rare to see women take charge in sci-fi adventure films, especially ones that follow this sort of formula. Jennifer Lawrence is strong and beyond capable as the role of a strong woman, victim to unfair circumstances, and manipulated by an unfair society. It's nice to see that the series looks at her as fearless and fit rather than a whiny, uninspired female caricature. Hutcherson, too, is very good and the two work together nicely when they can.But this is pretty standard in the field of adventures, in areas excluding its plot and acting. It lacks any sort of commentary on totalitarian societies, and doesn't seem to break new ground with the material it has. I sat debating on why the series has reached such a rare level of popularity with the masses. Is this the groundbreaking, extra-special, page-gripping novel that everyone is reading? The book had to be more than predominant scenes of archery and hectic instances of action. There had to be more depth and attraction to a novel so popular. What we are left with is somewhat sufficient, but droning for a two and a half hour film, including tacked on, roughly seventy minutes of buildup to the games themselves. The Hunger Games isn't bad, but it's redundant and winded, with much of the end being rather quiet and seemingly void of progression. Audiences are likely to enjoy it, but I'm sure fan reception will be all over the place. The film just seems too basic and limp, considering the book was a smashing success.Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. Directed by: Gary Ross.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Jennifer Lawrence is the Girl on Fire...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2584564/?ref_=tt_urv","Chalice_Of_Evil","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5464931/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2012","The best thing about this movie is Jennifer Lawrence and her performance. All doubters & naysayers should eat their words, as Lawrence proves more than up to the task of completely embodying the character of Katniss Everdeen. She's every bit as intelligent, fierce, vulnerable, resourceful as the character requires and more. The majority of the film rests on Lawrence's shoulders, and if she hadn't been up to the task, everything would have fallen apart. You have to believe/care about this girl, Katniss, and her portrayer ensures that you certainly do. Her scenes of sorrow are very heart-wrenching, it must be said. Initially someone who would rather stay hidden in trees than kill, she eventually reaches the point where she has to kill or be killed. She doesn't outright kill people at first, but rather does things which lead to people's deaths (if not at her hand directly). Inevitably, though, she does wind up getting her hands dirty in the end. Also important is the character of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and his friendship with Katniss. Through minimal flashbacks, we see how they met and why they are what they are to each other. Hutcherson fits the role of the likable guy, capturing that fear and despair upon being selected, then later the determination to rebel against what's expected of him. This relationship proves pivotal to the story and both actors absolutely bring it, having the right chemistry required. Not sure why such a big deal was made out of Gale (Liam Hemsworth, who has yet to prove himself to be up to the same standard of acting as his brother, Chris), friend of Katniss, having his role expanded in the film - he's barely in it. He shares two scenes with Katniss, and the rest is longing looks.Elizabeth Banks is great in the role of eccentric and slightly scary-looking Effie Trinket. She's virtually unrecognizable in her first scene, but slightly less so in subsequent scenes. She provides the main source of what little humour is in the film. Woody Harrelson, as Games survivor Haymitch, starts out as the stereotypical drunkard, but becomes more interesting as he helps out both Katniss & Peeta with how they can ensure the odds are indeed ever in their favour. The unexpected casting of Lenny Kravitz as stylist Cinna turns out to have been a good choice. With what little screen time he has, he believably forms an attachment to Katniss and ensures she looks fabulous (which ends up being rather important). I enjoyed the scenes with these characters.Somewhat wasted are Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane and Donald Sutherland as President Snow. They're in a few scenes, but don't really leave THAT much of an impression (not nearly as much as Bentley's weird facial hair does anyway). And while Stanley Tucci was very good in the role of Caesar, he wound up being mainly exposition guy (explaining stuff we already knew or could figure out ourselves). Not faring much better are the various other Tributes - most of whom are of the 'everyone for himself/herself' mentality (even when they seemingly team up). It's certainly cutthroat, sometimes literally. People get slashed, stabbed, their necks broken, shot with arrows and stung by horrible wasp things called Tracker Jackers, which turn you all gnarly and swollen. The frustrating shaky cam is WAY overdone at times, even when people are just simply walking (the Reaping scene), but particularly later on when they're fighting and killing (the Cornucopia scenes). Due to the camera's wild shaking, the scenes of violence are not really that detailed and the fighting is at times hard to follow. Kills are either done quickly/not lingered upon or they are edited around. It'll be a question of whether this bothers you/how much you *let* it bother you that determines whether you come away satisfied or annoyed with how the brutality in the film is portrayed on screen. Is it enough that you get the gist of the horrible murders being committed, or do you need to SEE them in explicit detail? Having said that, it's not like there's a complete absence of blood or anything. There is a fair amount, it's just not especially gory/gratuitous. One Tribute who does leave some actual impact is Rue (Amandla Stenberg). This young actress proves herself a natural in her role. Thanks to the actors playing them, Katniss and Rue are able to form a believable alliance/friendship, despite being given very little time to do it in (and, in Stenberg's case, very little dialogue). It's quite remarkable how quickly you come to care about the two of them as a team, which makes what comes later actually effective/have weight and depth. The Mockingjay call they whistle to each other is quite haunting, as is Lawrence's singing.The costumes are stunning...if a little frightening, the sets and scenery are luscious, and the CGI is fairly good (though there are some questionable giant wolf-like creatures at one point). The pacing of the film is...well...I'm not sure how it is in the book, but things did seem to drag here and there at several points (and the ending was rather lacklustre). I'm surprised people were worried the runtime wouldn't be long enough, as I felt it was more than sufficient. I haven't read the books, but knew the gist of what this film was about, so I elected to go into the movie not having read the novels so that I could enjoy the film based solely on its own merits. Perhaps readers of the book will be more satisfied, as they will appreciate the little or 'slower' parts more than non-readers. I think upon re-watching the film, I might appreciate them more too. I can't rate it as an adaptation, but I can say that, as it stands, this is a pretty decent introductory film for those who haven't read the books - being one myself. Here's hoping for even greater things from the next movie.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

For me the Hunger Games is kind of like Harry Potter, except a little bit past my time, and not as good. As much as I enjoyed this movie, there were quite a few things that bothered me, as well as a number of great moments. Let's start with the negatives: 1) Too many awkward close ups 2) Not enough complexity, or showing of how the characters really feel, like it was in the novel 3) Pg-13, the novel was R-rated, I'm not saying that violence makes a movie, but in the case of the Hunger Games it actually does. Now for the positives: 1) Great Acting 2) Tense, well directed action scenes 3) Brilliant use of CGI 4) Very good at putting a face to the characters we read about. In the end, this movie without a doubt deserves an 8/10, and that isn't anything to sneeze at. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested, or whoever read the novel.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society. Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.","266 out of 452 found this helpful.

I mean love is nice, yet I find myself more entertained by the notion of it when its focus is more than skin deep. Yet, there is no love put into this film it is entirely focused on entertaining your peripheral and lacks substance in dialogue and explanation as well as some of the story being altered in presentation from a book to movie.

While it is not a perfect adaption of the first book by any means, if you have not read the books you will still be entertained and dare I say it be less critical of the things that were left out.Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is pretty much as I pictured her while reading the books, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was solid and here I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was nicely done and he fit my image of him from the books, again I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character as well. Liam Hemsworth was terrible as Gale, not totally his fault though, another character with way too much cut from the book, not that I cared too much, I didn't have much time for him throughout the series.A few reviewers, or more than a few compared this to Battle Royale. I can see where they are coming from, but this not comparable, they are not the same. OK fine they both involve teenagers fighting to the death, but that is where the comparison ends for me. Battle Royale is in a class of its own and has a story of it's own, this movie should not be compared to it.I am not a teenager, but I went to see this with my teenage daughter and we both enjoyed it and thought it was money well spent for 2 hours of entertainment. I would have liked to see it quite a bit longer just to do the book justice, but I can see that when catering to the teenage market movies have to be cut short. Or do they? Hopefully there will be an extended version ala Avatar, which explained so much more than the theatrical cut.7 out of 10 for me, I would have given it an 8 or a 9 if it had kept more of the depth from the book.

People put five stars for this movie, millions of people decided to read and watch the movie of The Hunger Games, and it was as great as it promised to be. This movie was based on the book by Suzanne Collins. However, this movie didn't completely follow the book. Some parts of the book were either discarded or replaced. Even though the movie did this, it was even better than the book itself. I do however warn all people who go to see this movie. Warning: There are no scary or disturbing images, but there are very scary parts in the movie where a person will die in a very cruel manner. But besides this the movie is awesome, and deserves all the wonderful praise it can get. There was no cussing at all, and there was no use of strong language either. Never underestimate the wonderful things of The Hunger Games. Another warning though, this is not for young children. There are moments of violence, and as I said before, very scary moments. There are also a small handful of sad parts. I prefer this movie for anyone ten years old or higher. Anyway this is a wonderful movie, and I hope that the sequel, Catching Fire, will come out in theaters soon. Can not wait to get on DVD.

The book was so good (of what I had read of it at the time) that I was impatient to see the movie, especially with all of the notice it was getting.Getting ready to see this movie, I had taken a couple of things into consideration: it was an action and partial teen-romance book. One big thing I notice in movies, while I'm watching them, is the music. This movie being the two genres I mentioned, I expected the music to either be epic (like Pirates of the Caribbean, LOTR, etc.) or very teen- oriented (band-based songs). It was, mostly, neither. The musical score let me down, and the main song that I had fallen in love with (""Safe and Sound"") wasn't actually in the movie.However, many other things were done right. The graphics and camera shots were AMAZING. In one scene, the contestants are let loose into the arena, and the film goes relatively silent. This in itself portrays how easily your ears can fuzz-out when you are experiencing an adrenaline rush. I applaud the use of that tactic in this movie.Also, when I saw Katniss's dress as compared to how the book described it, I was briefly disappointed. The book mentioned that it was supposed to look fiery, and as the scene continued, I saw nothing. Then, she stood up and twirled around--and the hem of her dress burst to flames! I was amazed. And one of the most beautiful shots was when they were in the chariot with their capes ignited. Many scenes/shots in this movie are gorgeous and worthy of being stills.Honestly, when I imagined all of the violence that took place in the book, I was afraid of how thoroughly depressing it would be to see children killing each other in a battle to survive. Though it was sad, the movie was filmed to shield eyes from the worst of what happened, which I am grateful for.Overall, since this review has gone on for far too long, I give this movie an 7.

"8","/10","A Nutshell Review: The Hunger Games","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2589461/?ref_=tt_urv","DICK STEEL","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0317399/?ref_=tt_urv","30 March 2012","I have to admit at first glance, going by the trailers that have been incessantly playing since late last year, that this was nothing more than a Battle Royale rip off, having teenagers put into an arena and fighting to the death. Such genre films have been done countless of time, from the days of Schwarzeneggar in his The Running Man, to even Stone Cold Steve Austin in The Condemned, where everyone becomes gladiators and essentially television content fodder, and The Hunger Games surely contained the exact same elements too. But what excelled and stood this film from its peers, boils back to Collins' superbly set up story, and in Gary Ross' focused direction that never leaves the film soulless, filling it with plenty of heart and got the audience to emotionally invest in its protagonist from the get go.And that is something Gary Ross, going by his filmography such as Seabiscuit and Pleasantville, does quite effortlessly, with a story that's set in a fictional period where much of the known world is divided into districts to suppress an uprising decades ago, where each district, living in hunger and in fear, have to cough out a teenage boy and girl each between the ages of 12 to 18 every year as tribute to battle in The Hunger Games, a fight to the last, that is also broadcast live in a television show. The arena is at The Capitol where the elites live amongst armed protection, and the combatants duke it out in an arena of faux pas natural habitat that can be manipulated at will by designers.What set this out from the rest is that it has a female protagonist who is not a useless, or whining damsel in distress. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a hunter and provider for her family, volunteering as tribute in place of her sister Primrose (Willow Shields), and together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they become the tributes from District 12. We spend the first hour unhurried in painting the background set for the entire trilogy, so much so that not everything got explained, which was a sly move to leave out unessential details at this point for the other sequels to follow up on, especially the need to know more about the current state of the world. We're left to concentrate on a series of unfolding events around Katniss, as well as to get to know the reclusive girl who has to learn how to milk her popularity to increase her chances of survival.While it's essentially Battle Royale, there are the necessary tweaks to the rules of the game to keep it unique, such as the introduction of sponsors and external assistance. Katniss also had to rely on a lot of luck, and isn't your superhero Rambo from the onset, making her believable, identifiable, and with qualities in a character that you would root for. Even her skill with the bow doesn't make her a deadly shot all the time, as things like anxiety and fear make her character all the more believable, and human. Pacing was kept just right especially after the hour mark when the games kick into gear, although one complaint will be that since this is a teenage flick, you do not get to see the gory details of teen killing teen, no thanks to the deliberate cinematography to keep thing shaky, out of focus and never within comfortable depth of field. After all, this is supposed to be PG-13 stuff for the mass market, so everything's kept at a level that Walt Disney himself will approve.Still, it's not about the violence and the deaths, but a lot more about the theme of survival, with the story going a lot more for collaboration and cooperation, even amongst allies and alliances formed amongst the strong to pick on the meek. Subplots included in the film all hint at stories that the next two installments will pick up on, such as Katniss' growing popularity amongst the districts and her becoming the icon of rebellion that you'd know will be dealt with even without reading the books. Romance also finds time to creep into the storyline, especially since an engineered one starts to become a little bit more real, and setting up an uncomplicated love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and the former's best friend in Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who had sworn to protect and provide for her family while she's away competing to return home.And the supporting ensemble cast consists of notables such as Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson as pro-Katniss supporters, or at least those who have to stand at her corner during her preparation for the Games, and others such as Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones as television personalities, Wes Bentley as the primary gamemaster, and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, everyone veterans in their own right propping up the relative newcomers who take on primary roles in this expected franchise. Amongst those who stood out are Banks, almost unrecognizable in her makeup and costumes, and Tucci who hams it up as a television host.The Hunger Games have got me hooked despite getting off on the wrong footing during its marketing, and I am as eager as many new found fans out there who are anticipating what's next in the story. It may be tame, but Katniss is a fresh female protagonist who will have you hooked to her cause, and that alone is this film's strength that it played up superbly. Recommended!","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

When I saw the trailers for the movie, I got excited--I wanted to curb my excitement, though, and I'm glad I did. A word to anyone who read the books and wants to see the movie: the movie is NEVER as good. Keep that in mind.However, this movie did a really good job of keeping the key components of the story in the movie and trying to explain them the best they could: I could only find about six small things that they changed from the book, which is amazing as far as book adaptations go. You have to realize, though--there's no way they can have the whole book in one two-hour movie.So many people are complaining that the book was so vivid and so detailed. If you want a close to probably four hour movie or have it broken into two parts (which I'm sure everyone would hate as well), then be my guest. But honestly, if you just read the books, the movie is astounding.There were minute details in the book that Collins spent chapters writing. And guess what? No physical action actually happened. So many thoughts and emotions that were drawn out in the book had to be broken down to a ten-second close-up on Jennifer Lawrence. There was simply no other way to do it . . . unless, of course, the whole movie was narrated or Katniss talked to herself incessantly (far worse alternatives in my opinion).But enough about the adaptation. I was kind of thrown by some of the casting choices for awhile, but they did not disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Lenny Kravitz did so well--Hutcherson in particular. I really liked the costumes for the Games themselves and the Capitol people. The District 12 costumes were bland and kind of ugly, but they were supposed to be, so no complaints there. The Arena was exactly how I pictured it.Pretty much the only thing I didn't like about this movie was the camera work. The camera never stopped moving. I understand that it's an action movie, but we don't have to have action when everyone is just sitting around and talking. I really wish the director wouldn't have gone for that style. i don't know very many people who actually like it.Another thing that I think they could have done to make the movie more enjoyable was to add in some more ""down time""--everything is super intense the whole movie, and it would have been nice to have a breather here and there. It worked how it was, but I think I would have liked it a little more.All in all, this was a great adaptation from the book. But it's just that--an adaptation. If you haven't read the books, you're probably going to be confused and think it's a really shallow movie. If you have read the books, you can fill in the blanks for all their thoughts and the deeper meaning to it--just enjoy the Hunger Games coming to life.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

Despite the movie's multiple setbacks, however, the world that Collins created is utterly frightening and eerily familiar. As the hype for this movie increased in recent weeks, the headlines informed non-fans of the basic storyline: kids killing kids. The movie itself—although not shying away from death—allowed it to encompass so much more.The core of this movie stands on the shoulders of Jennifer Lawrence. I've thought hard and cannot honestly think of a better Katniss Everdeen. Her complicated character has to pull off a ""Is this really happening"" look for nearly 40 minutes of screen time. She does it beautifully. Behind her—everyone from Donald Sutherland to the girl who plays Primrose—is a cast that holds its own weight (I'm still unsure about Gale—but that will be decided in Catching Fire).The main problems with this film derive from the Director—Gary Ross. Although this director is talented, he has never taken on a project of this size. That much is obvious. From the very start you will see the amateur mistakes—from very poor editing to unfocused shots. The camera moved so much during the action scenes when a simple wide angle would have had more impact on the audience. Hopefully he'll have a handle on it by the second or third film.As a fan, I feel a must attest to how the movie plays out compared to the book. I was quite surprised how well the movie followed the book. There were things that had to be cut out—the Mockingjay pin coming from the mayor's daughter or eyes of the creatures at the end. Other than that, few changes were made. One problem the audience (and I) was clearly unhappy about was the symbol of the revolution being used in the first half hour of the first movie.If you are a fan of the books, you should have seen it at midnight. If you haven't seen it, go see it now. If you are not a fan of the series, I have only one thing to say to you: go read the books. This movie is good, but the books will blow you away. If you are not much of a reader, this movie is still worth your time. It holds its own and will (mostly) make sense. As a fan of the series, I expected morebut was not disappointed.reillyreviews.wordpress.com","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

As weird as this may sound, it could have been more violent. I know that they have to cater towards their demographic (pre-teens), but I felt that the way the violence was portrayed in the movie didn't give it the same sense of peril and intensity as the book. I'm not saying it need to be gorier, but there definitely could have been a bit more raw. There were also some character development issues. The Katniss-Gale relationship is never completely explained. Also, the Katniss-Peeta dynamic was not developed fully enough for the audience to get a clear picture of Katniss' true feelings (as stated in the book). Overall, the movie is good. It is definitely worth seeing and will make you laugh, cry and jump out of your seat.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"","","That which is old, is new again.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2586954/?ref_=tt_urv","Blueghost","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1552793/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2012","I guess I'm just not in sync with popular teenage culture, because I kind of liked this film, but, based on the number of negative user reviews, you'd think everyone would have dismissed this thing as the next ""Gili"". Well, it is a teenage action adventure romp that skews female, so there's bound to be some disappointment among young male audience members.But, to the film. One wonders if Miss Collins, author of the series, ever read Frederic Brown, or watched classic Star Trek in the late 1960s or during its syndication run in the 70s and 80s, because the basic bulk of the story is taken right out of ""Arena"" (which also saw reincarnation via an issue of ""Adam Strange"" in Detective Comics). Which is okay, because it's not a clone of the story, but uses the basic plot and story written by Brown, and adds many young person and female flourishes to comment on contemporary TV watching habits, and societies' imperilment of becoming addicted to a certain type of bloodletting entertainment.The film is nicely paced, and seems to be riding a fine line of trying to be edgy, real, and young person's fair all at the same time. I think it achieves this for the bulk of the audience whose dollars they're trying to capture, but the rough and tumble sci-fi gamer who is used to blood and gore via an online gaming server (and I'm talking pre-teen boys here) might probably get little impatient with it. But, the young ladies in tonight's audience, seemed to really connect with the film.Some critiques here; in the original ""Arena"" we had Captain James T. Kirk pitted against a very fake looking intelligent lizard-captain, with the goal being for said starship captains to finish each other off in a ""more civil"" manner, as opposed to creating a mess in space via starship combat. In ""Hunger Games"" the main characters must fight for a dystopic world, again to avoid a messy war. And that's my biggest critique; the backstory, and the setting; because I didn't get a whole lot of logic to what exactly the Hunger Games represented. There seemed to be some kind of starvation component, but it really wasn't made clear in the film, just inferred that food might be in short supply. Yet one was hard pressed to see starving citizens, and with such lush green forests, one wonders why crops aren't planted to feed the people if food is indeed in such short supply. But, that's kind of the premise of the film, so you have to buy into it to really enjoy the film itself. This verse Kirk and the Gorn who were fighting over territory.There's some symbolism going on in here. There's a hearkening back to ancient Greek heroes and gods, as well as an Asmodeus like TV producer calling the shots for the Hunger Games. Woody ""let me tie up traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge some 12 years ago"" Harrelson makes an appearance as an aged vet of the games (as I digress bitterly), who relays what wisdom and beneficence that he can to the selected champions of his district.There's romance, there's intrigue, there's hand to hand combat, there's MTV like shaky-cam cinematography, some girlish moments, and even some pyrotechnics (a rarity for any film). In the original ""Arena"", or rather the Star Trek adaptation of Frederic Brown's short story, Shatner gave another sterling speech at the end to the Metrons who had been pulling his strings the entire time. ""Hunger Games"" does the same thing, only more cinematically, and, unlike my beloved Star Trek, does it with a female bent. Which is better, or which do I prefer? I'm not really sure. Being a starship and phaser kind of guy, you'd think I would lean towards Kirk and crew, but I think I kind of like Katniss's challenge at the end. Kirk uses a Prometheus like solution, where Katniss sticks true to Artemis' ways, even to her ultimate act of defiance to the TV producers and audience. I would ask anybody who reads this to watch Star Trek's ""Arena"", and compare Kirk yelling up at the sky near the end of the episode with Katniss's gesture and solution. Technical notes; the editing is slow (thank goodness), and there're few jump cuts, which makes watching this film easy on the eyes. No digital cinematography here. This is pure film making. The costumes were interesting, and the makeup fell into the same category; trying to look appealing to young audiences while at the same time being edgy and flashy. All in all respectably shot.Not a super sterling film, but, using recycled material from a variety of sci-fi sources, with a gripping narrative, and polishing the package with a pink female bow, makes the film an interesting watch.Check it out.","18 out of 38 found this helpful.

Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the stars do a good job, but it's a start-- and luckily for us, they do a tremendous job. Jennifer Lawrence enters the celebrity life coming out of her role as Mystique from X-Men, and perhaps for another time to discuss, I hate that character. With that said, she was also coming from an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone-- a lifeless film that nobody need bother to see unless you're just compelled enough for the one bright spot of the film which is her performance. And Jenny from the block is handed the role of Katniss Everdeen, a persistent heroine sure to have inspired girls everywhere. Needless to say, she had big shoes to fill, for everybody would be judging whether she fit the mold of the character envisioned from the book. And emphatically I will tell you that she succeeds. You root for the gender role breaking Katniss at every step. Perhaps even more impressive than Lawrence are the people she is surrounded by. The unrestrained costume designs for the Capitol work so well with Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Bank's characters. But easily my favorites are the hilarious Woody Harrelson and Wes Bentley's beard.Undoubtedly, you guys know the basis for The Hunger Games. Even so, it is important to at least talk about the structure. There are two distinct halves in the film: the ceremonies before the Games, and the Games themselves. And in the off chance that you have no idea what The Hunger Games is, I shall briefly clarify. A future dystopia consists of 12 districts. In order to keep the threats of revolt at ease, fear is struck by an event known as the Hunger Games that takes place annually. Everybody ages 12-18 have their names put in to be drawn at random with two tributes from the 12 districts, a male and female. And for those of you counting at home, that's 24 tributes every year.Katniss lives in District 12 with her sister and mother. This district is mineral based, and thus, also hard-working and poor. To the credit of the film, lots of this can be inferred through visual context instead of pointless exposition. The film is 140 minutes, and even though I think that could have been reduced through some cuts, it reminds me of what happened with Jurassic Park. Just like author Suzanne Collins, Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton also had a hand in writing the screenplay for the film adaptation. And he explained what he did by saying that about 10% of the book made it to big screen, and this is simply because that's all that could be fit into it. Similarly, there's details I wished to have seen made it to the movie, but there's only so much that can be done. With all that they had, there's nothing huge that got excluded to cause any outrage.Something becoming familiar ground is a love triangle in these dystopian teenage novels. And there's certainly glimpses of this in this film, but I'm glad we aren't swarmed by it (can't speak for the sequels). One of my negatives follows from this. I have been a fan of Josh Hutcherson, but to be a little hypocritical, he is not what one imagines as Peeta. The best way to describe his performance is just ""good,"" nothing more, and really nothing less. And completing the triangle is Katniss's childhood friend, Gale. And I'm not sure how much there is to think about for Katniss, for when I have the chance to pick either Josh Hutcherson or Liam Hemsworth, you know I'd take Liam any day... What, I'm getting off track? I do apologize.As I said before, there are two halves to this film. And separately, they both work. And they are necessary together, but it is pacing that simply is designed better for a book. The ceremonies are fresh and entertaining, but it's a lot of build up for what will end up turning into another half of the film. And this again plays into my belief that ten minutes or so of run time could have been cut to flow everything better. In regards to the Games themselves, I think what was accomplished is pretty astounding. I was so curious how you transfer weeks of survival in the forest into an hour of action-packed fatal adventure. There's never a dull in the action, yet no scene is forced. And the brilliantly harrowing setup for Collins's plot is transferred to the screen by shaky cams that bring the audience to the arena while giving glimmers of wonderful nature in, ultimately, all that the Capitol and its citizens see, a reality show-like game. Gruesome? Absolutely. Stunning? Well, not on the same level of some beautiful films, but for the sake of compliments, yes, stunning.

Every citizen must watch as the youths fight to the death until only one remains. District 12 Tribute Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has little to rely on, other than her hunting skills and sharp instincts, in an arena where she must weigh survival against love.So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far. I think I must have been the only one who hasn't yet. It's human nature for things in this first film to not seem as climactic when you've previously known things about films past and future. This review will be based on this.This film took place in what seems like some dystopian future but we never really got an explanation about how this world came to be. We start off by seeing Katniss (Lawrence) trying to hunt for food for her family including her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her sister (Willow Shields) (they mentioned a father but I'm not sure how he died). Her family appears to be poor and the residents of each District appear to be poor as well. She lives in District 12 with her friends Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Her life soon gets interrupted when her sister gets selected as a tribute (participant) in this year's annual Hunger Games, a televised event where male and female youth from each district are selected at random to fight to the death (that's why these are YA novels). They don't really explain why this is the case but the explanation we do get just seemed silly to me. When her sister gets selected as a tribute, Katniss volunteers to compete in her place. Her friend Peeta gets selected as well. So the majority of the film after that is just her and Peeta being introduced to this world and preparing themselves to compete in these Hunger Games. These two get assistance with this from Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). Once they finally do get to compete (it took a while to get to this point), they must face the elements, the landscape, and the other participants. The actual Hunger Games itself was quite a letdown when it was something that had to potential to be exciting (the subject matter as far as I've heard had ""R"" level violence but was watered down to cater to a wider PG-13 audience). I found the violence to be quite muted and infrequent as most of the killing was offscreen and implied. But a film/book called ""The Hunger Games"" isn't necessarily about the games itself but it was about Katniss and Peeta having to stick together and survive the games. The second half of the film serves to further develop the friendship/relationship between the two teens. This worked as the acting of Lawrence and Hutcherson were good here as well as Harrelson, Banks, and Kravitz (surprisingly). Despite finding the story to be very silly, I found the film was shot very beautifully. I cannot speak to its authenticity but it did a good job depicting a dystopian world. Overall. this is a decent, big-world film but I just couldn't get into it as I probably should because I did not like the story. I can, however, understand why people just ate this up.Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie has officially changed my life. Yes I am a fan of the books also, but the movie has changed my perspective in lots of things. From silly things like ""Film Adaptations can be amazing, too"" to serious things like ""Life is precious"". Am I overreacting? I might be according to some people, but I have not experience any film that effects me this much for a long time. This is inspirational and powerful. Yes I used the word powerful again, because it's true. There is not a single moment where I felt it was flawed, not that it's perfect and everyone will love it, but it's perfect in its own way. The actors are unforgettable, Jennifer Lawrence's performance will haunt me forever, in a good way of course. Through the whole movie, I cried, I laughed, I bite my nails and sit on the edge of my seat. Once again, it's powerful, so powerful it can literally change lives, mine for example and I know a lot more people will be like me. The realistic elements of The Hunger Games reflects on how to live your life to the fullest, it will make you realize how lucky you are to be YOU.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Entertaining but shallow & you'll need to have read the book to fill in the gaps.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2628615/?ref_=tt_urv","TheSquiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34414709/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2012","Late last year I was handed a free book at the cinema as part of a promotion. I read the back, dismissed it as a teen book and plonked it on the bookcase for a day of lazy reading sometime in the future. A couple of weeks ago I saw the trailer for The Hunger Games and dismissed it as a watered down, sanitized version of Battle Royale. Then I noticed the logo and recognized it from the afore mentioned book. Intrigued, I set aside an hour that Sunday to read the first couple of chapters to see if it would be worth watching the film and promptly devoured the book in a single sitting.Whilst it will never go down in history as a literary classic and will be forgotten in twenty years, unlike the Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter volumes, The Hunger Games trilogy is a stomping good read and perfectly fits the overused cliché of 'page-turner.' Though a couple of hundred pages away from the end, I'm loving it. It's easy, gripping, highly entertaining, disposable fun. That said, I've read Catch 22 more times than I have fingers on one-and-a-half hands and look what they did to that on film. And Captain Corelli's Mandolin. And For those without a clue, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are selected for the Hunger Games, a barbaric, televised show in which 'Tributes' are taken from each of twelve districts of a futuristic, dystopian America (now known as Panem) to enter a vast, synthetic arena and kill each other until only one remains. There's more to it than that but if you're familiar with the likes of Battle Royale, Rollerball and The Running Man you'll know where it's heading.So, what did they do to The Hunger Games? Well, they cut it. They had to, because it would have been at least a four hour film. Being written largely in the first person, there were no subplots with peripheral characters to excise and so the editing had to come through losing detail with the result that the film lacks depth. I took a friend who hadn't read the books and afterwards I needed to explain some of the exchanged glances between protagonists Katniss and Peeta and fill in the gaps for him. Gary Ross has directed it with the aim of satisfying the vast army of readers whilst hoping not to ostracize those who enter the cinema without background knowledge of the film. Unfortunately he doesn't quite satisfy either camp.Katniss' thoughts, the reason we understand and identify with her so completely, have been lost. Her relationships with both Peeta and her lifelong friend, Gale, are shallow and we are not given enough time with their team in the Capitol to really appreciate the mind games, the relationships and the characters. This is a rare example when a film just shy of two-and-a-half hours needs to be at least thirty minutes longer! Too much is compressed and it feels choked of the life that flowed rapidly through the book. From the film I don't know much about Katniss and couldn't warm to her while, in the book, she is flawed, driven, angry, hopeful and a multi-faceted character I both liked and could respect.The 'game' is all too brief. We actually see very little of the killing and know comparatively little of the battles between the twenty-four adolescents that must dwindle to one. The violence has been virtually eradicated to the point where only a Daily Mail reader could be shocked and the beasts in the final act are completely wasted and the reason for them all but lost in clumsy CGI not at all befitting the $78m budget. More frustrating is the complete redesign of the cornucopia in the arena that is very pointedly described as gold throughout the books and conjures an image of a vast, ornate horn. Instead it more closely resembles an unpainted, bastardized Batmobile stolen from Christian Bale.Is it as good as Battle Royale? Hmmm, probably not in the case of the film. But, particularly with the book, it's different and equally as valid. See the film. It is very entertaining, but read the trilogy first so that you can fill in the gaps as they pass across the screen.Another film review from The Squiss.

Unfortuanately I was to be disappointed, the movie had missed out many key points, and in some areas they where completely changed, making it difficult to understand - even for someone who has read the books. Another unfortunate element to the movie was the acting. In some areas there was special points when I really felt how they where feeling, but most of the time I could not connect with them, making the film less enjoyable. The idea of reducing the rating to a 12A and editing out elements that would of expressed the classic story that the author wrote. Overall the film was very plain, dare I say ""boring"", leaving me wondering what all the hype was over.All in all, I would say this is a film to perhaps wait till it comes out on DVD, and not one to waist a night out on.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is two and a half hours that goes by in the blink of an eye. If you've read the books and know the context surrounding everything that happens here, the movie flows smoothly, adheres to the books in MOST cases, and leaves little to be desired. If, however, you haven't read it, you won't like it as much. There are many things (won't get into specifics) that go unexplained or under-explained; stuff that is explained through the first person point of view in the book just can't be explained as thoroughly in the movie. If you've read the book, you know everything and you're a bystander watching the events unfold without the extra Katniss commentary. If you haven't read it, you will probably have a lot of questions. I think it's a movie that is obviously aimed at Hunger Games readers and it does an excellent job with that audience. It's still a good film for everyone else, it just isn't a ten, probably more of a 7.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Seeing what happened during the 18 days was like watching Suzanne Collins' books on screen. Until today, more than a year after the revolution, I believe The Hunger Games remains the closest work of fiction to the events of the revolution in Egypt. After all, it's about a game that the Capitol of Panem has started after the people made an uprising against it. The Hunger Games has 24 tributes but only one can win and that's by surviving.Violence, thus, is the keyword. It's the core of the world created by Suzanne Collins who mentioned in an interview that she got the idea of the books while watching footage of the US crimes in Iraq. On the other hand, Gary Ross's film adaptation did not survive the gleam of Hollywood. The result is unnecessary scenes of romance (which filled the theatre with giggles at its silliness) at the expense of core violent scenes, all for the sake of topping the box office.Despite that, most of the performances were excellent. When fans of the book trilogy (me included) made their disagreement clear when she was first cast, Jennifer Lawrence replied that she will do her best, playing Katniss Everdeen. And she did. When it comes to other leading characters, Josh Hutcherson is no less good, though there should have been much focus on the character of Haymitch and the humorous side of it as well as the relationship he developed with Katniss and Peeta.Of course it couldn't all fit in 2 hours and 8 minutes. However, this is no justification for the film's clear means to win the war to the top of the box office. But, in the end, the first book is my least favourite. The best is yet to come.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not very often that there is a movie about teenagers that is not overwhelmingly full of love and crushes and lovely things of that sort but they kept that part toned way down.There were some things that they changed that I was kind of sad about but they kept the suspense going very well. I personally liked the shaky cameras when they were running but sometimes the fights were hard to follow because they were so close up. As for the actors,I thought they were amazing. I had never heard of Jennifer Lawrence until I heard about this movie being made but she was awesome. I already liked Liam Hemsworth, but I think I am now in love with Josh Hutcherson too.

This daring depiction of a country gone ""hungry"", for food, for games, for entertainment, and for the blood of its young, is simply too familiar, too close to disturbingly similar developments in recent years right here in the good old USA. That chill you feel down your spine is your conscience telling you to pay attention, and thanks to the skills and vision of both writer Suzanne Collins and Director Gary Ross, we have little choice but to pay attention. Judging by how hungry I am to experience the next chapter in this saga of a depressingly bleak future, where human beings are trapped in a frightening world of extreme poverty and horrifying opulence, unchecked greed, and an insatiable appetite for gratuitous mind-numbing and violent entertainment, there is little doubt Director Gary Ross has created the first installment in what portends to be one of Hollywood's most successful franchises of inspired filmmaking. For all that, The Hunger Games would have certainly earned at least 7+ stars, but one unexpected and inspired choice lifts this movie into the rarefied air of masterpiece, worth every bit the 10 star rating I believe it deserves. I'm talking about the choice to cast young Louisville actress Jennifer Lawrence in the role of Katniss Everdeen. Ms. Lawrence delivers an incredibly delicate, searing, Oscar-worthy portrayal of the film's reluctant heroine, who is forced to survive on wits, skill, and ultimately an indomitable will in a world gone mad. Reminiscent of her equally mesmerizing work in The Poker House and her Oscar-nominated performance in last year's ""Winter's Bone"", Jennifer Lawrence literally becomes one of recent popular literature's most admired and loved heroines. What this young actress can convey in her face and eyes is absolutely spellbinding, and this performance deserves all the praise it's now receiving, aptly embodied in one word by her Hunger Games co-star, Donald Sutherland, who described it as ""Extraordinary"". After casting Jennifer in her new movie ""Beaver"", Director Jodie Foster said of then 19 year old Ms. Lawrence, """"It's like she has tragedy etched in her face ...she has that thing in her face that's like she has been through something, you know she's been through something."" That quality, along with her ability to convince the viewer to buy into her character's story completely and want to know everything about her, establishes Jennifer Lawrence as a true star of the first order, whose performances compel us to watch, riveted by every moment she inhabits the screen. Director Gary Ross has said he would not have agreed to direct the Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence not been cast as Katniss. His reason?

Which is why I say - bring on the ""rest of the story"", Mr. Ross, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Lawrence. 18 months (till November 2013 when the next installment is scheduled for release), is an awfully long time to wait, but for Jennifer Lawrence and the team that created ""The Hunger Games"", I'll wait as long as it takes.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Although it does incorporate the same elements, it is a much more engaging story.I read all 3 of the books in less then a week and I still read them over and over. I was nervous to see how the film adaptation would be cause I know I was always upset of what they cut out of the Harry Potter movies, but I was pleasantly surprised that hardly anything was taken out of the first book, and only minimal things were slightly altered. I've seen this movie 7 times and each time I have taken a new person with me. Whether it be someone who has read the book or has never heard of it I have not heard one disappointed reaction....other then one of my friends who doesn't understand stories unless they're dumbed down like mirror mirror, but we forgive her cause she is slow.I'm very impressed how they made this movie with such a low budget, and still it feels like a huge summer blockbuster. I had the opportunity to experience the film in Dbox seats yesterday and I have to say.... That was incredible! It really made you feel like you were a part of the games and made it much more intense a viewing experience.I am simply giving a review, so no spoilers here, but I think everyone is making WAY too big a deal about this being, ""The most gruesome PG-13 movie of all time."" In all honesty it got the rating it deserved, but it isn't the most gruesome I've ever seen. It is tastefully done without ruining any of the violence from the book surprisingly. If you have not seen it yet.... GO! You will love it :)","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Such a character should be a role model for these young people. In 2012, we are left with no more ""Harry Potter"" films to be made. The ""Twilight"" series, which has albeit made a great deal of money, doesn't quite cut it for those of us who expect something more from our movie-going experience.""The Hunger Games"" has it all: a wonderful slew of characters, an unfamiliar and interesting world, real problems to overcome, not to mention a star-making performance by Jennifer Lawrence. One major problem that I find in the ""Twilight"" series lies in the lack of role models for young women reading them. Bella Swan is an idiot. She relies on men for every single thing she does, and doesn't change and become her own person over the course of the four books, ultimately becoming the epitome of anti-feminism, in this viewer's eyes. Having said that, ""The Hunger Games"" is something of a godsend. Katniss Everdeen is headstrong, brutal, resourceful, witty, uncannily smart and a truly original personality. She knows when to back down, yet she knows when to take charge. She is an ideal role model for young people who will undoubtedly approach the film. ""The Hunger Games"" takes place in the post-apocalyptic region of Panem, divided into twelve ""districts"". Once a year, an Olympics-style event takes place where one young man and woman from each of the twelve districts is forced to take part in a fight to the death on national television, where only one contestant can survive. A member of working- class District 12, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) takes her young sister's place after she has somehow been chosen in her first year of eligibility. Katniss has essentially raised her sister, with a mother who has been useless ever since the father's death. She learns to put her knowledge to good use, becomes something of a badass in her quest to above all else, stay alive.Like I mentioned, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, is a revelation. She clearly knew the character she was playing. While her performance is strong and ever-commanding, the character of Katniss was never permitted to let her true emotions show, and Lawrence obviously understood that. She couldn't have been better. Josh Hutcherson does a good enough job as Peeta, the other contestant from District 12, who becomes a good friend to Katniss; and possibly a love interest? We'll let the next film in the trilogy tackle that.The film has a tremendous supporting cast, including Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, the often-inebriated mentor to Katniss and Peeta, ""30 Rock""'s Elizabeth Banks as the loud and flamboyant Effie, Donald Sutherland as the country's president, and the always-great Stanley Tucci, as Caesar.My only gripe lies with director Gary Ross, who has previously directed ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Pleasantville"". His shaky camera-work works in scenes where we're seeing events from a character's perspective, especially when the ""games"", themselves, begin. However, shaky hand-held camera- work is present, even in scenes where only two characters are having a conversation. Why? It's distracting, and should have been done differently.However, Ross did a well enough job interpreting this novel, which I believe many other directors could have screwed up. He made a sensitive, yet not-for-the-faint-of-heart film out of a novel that felt exactly the same way. Like the ""Twilight"" series, there is a love story in ""The Hunger Games"", but it's not the most important thing going on. The film could stand as simply an adaptation of a novel, or could be interpreted as social commentary, with obvious hints being made about the Occupy Wall Street movement, as well as the grim picture it paints of what our society could one day become. Yet it's quality entertainment that even the least discerning film-goer can appreciate. Bring on ""Catching Fire"".Grade: A","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Making a book-to-movie adaptation can be very hard, especially when you have to try and find a way to portray a character as complex and analytical as Katniss. But I have to give kudos to Jennifer Lawrence for taking on that role, and playing her beautifully. I'll admit, she was a bit more agressive and impulsive than the book version, but it's easily forgivable considering Katniss's thought life being just as cynical and sometimes aggressive. I relate to her very much. She wasn't in it for the glory. She sacrificed herself for her sister and mother, and because she knew she had a better chance of surviving. She has a sense of duty stronger than most fictional characters I've read about.
To people who haven't read the book, I can understand if they don't like it. There are a lot of plot points that weren't explained properly, and for a person who's diving into this movie without having read the book, it can be very confusing, and honestly just unsatisfactory. So, if you want to understand the movie, and maybe enjoy it more, I highly reccommend reading the book.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was wrong. One reviewer thought the motion camera was overdone. In the beginning it did seem as if it might go that way, but quickly it calms down and you forget about it. Another reviewer thought a couple of the characters needed some of their back story told as in the book, but I didn't read the book and didn't miss it at all.What I noticed first was how gripping it all quickly became. I think the director and his screenwriters did a wonderful job. It felt as if the essence of some very compelling book was being conveyed. And that actually was what I thought about second, that I am now extremely curious to know more about the book's author, Suzanne Collins. This film gives no indication it was written by some wishy washy woman without a clue about real combat. There's been some real thought given to what might have happened in real life though her real gift to her readers is her keen understanding of the way leaders manipulate.But the real driving force behind this movie is divided between the writing and the lead, the mega-impressive Jennifer Lawrence. I remember seeing her in 'Winter's Bone' another film set in hill country and thinking I'd like to see more of her. Boy, was I right. Spending the time of this movie with her is a true joy. But her real trick is, I still want more! Something about watching her is very rewarding. I'm at a complete loss as to what exactly except that I kept thinking I know exactly what she's thinking and feeling. That's very rare, especially for such a young actress, I think, to be able to reach an old guy like me so clearly and effortlessly.Of the rest I'd give special attention to Woody Harrelson who is spot on and Donald Sutherland who seems to know about leadership for real. I've no idea where this trilogy is going but I do know I want to see it as it seems millions of others do. I saw this at a matinée in a smallish town and it was packed. I don't doubt this series will be in the Potter range.Finally I'd mention one small quibble I have, but what for? You'll probably notice it yourself and then quickly forgive the director for it. So why mention it at all? Go enjoy!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. -- (C) LionsgateAs someone who has read the novel, I must say now that THG is not a perfect adaptation. After all, when do you ever see a novel be perfectly translated to the big screen? Saying that, THG is an incredibly solid and strong effort that should please the fans of the series as well as those who are curious to see what the hype surrounding the film is. If I were to compare this to the Harry Potter and Twilight series, which, of course, is inevitable, you'll be happy when I say that it's a lot closer to the quality of Harry Potter than that of Twilight. I'd also like to end the issue of THG ""ripping off"" Battle Royale. Let's be honest here: Those who say THG is a ripoff of BR either haven't read THG or seen BR. While the two both revolve around the same concept, the executions are vastly different. THG and BR both deal with different issues and themes, and therefore, the comparison ends there. Additionally, there is no reason why you should like one and not the other.Getting all that out of the way, here are some issues I had with the film: Even with a long running time of 142 minutes, THG condenses a lot of events that play out in the novel and glosses over some details that I would have liked for the filmmakers to focus more on. The condensing of the material cuts a bit of characterization and makes emotional scenes feel rushed, and the glossing over of some details may make it difficult for someone who has not read the novel to understand what's going on. Furthermore, some of the CGI were a bit cartoonish, especially with the use of fire. Let's hope that the next film will get a bigger budget to improve on some of these effects.However, there are some great additions that came with the film too. Since the novel is written in Katniss' first-person perspective, we only get to know about what she sees and thinks. The film takes advantage of its format and adds some third-person scenes that ingeniously expand the world already created by author Suzanne Collins. As a result, some secondary characters that didn't have much presence in the novel have a lot more screen time in the film, including President Snow, Seneca Crane, and Haymitch. In particular, we get to see the behind-the-scenes of the Hunger Games in a control room where the tech people literally get to play Mother Nature. There are also some small plot changes that help set up the sequels.Director Gary Ross makes the great decision to downplay many things, with the use of hand-held cameras and the resistance to glorify many cinematic techniques. For example, the score by James Newton Howard is only used when is necessary, and when it is used, it's used effectively. This makes the world of Panem feel real and the issues more pressing. Of course, the shaky cameras also allow a lot of violence to pass with a PG-13 rating, resulting in possibly the most violent PG-13 film I've ever seen in my life so far. I also have to give a shout out to the sound department as well, which is another aspect that is taken advantage of to convey the violence. With the start of the film, we are put into an unusual world that we learn ourselves as the film progresses instead of the characters telling us every important plot point because they naturally know the rules of their world already. On top of that, the bleak and somber tone is done extremely well, with the build up to the game terrifying.Of course, this is Jennifer Lawrence's film, and the camera is mostly with her the entire way through. Accordingly, it's a good thing that Lawrence does a terrific job in her role, playing the strong-willed character with such incredible subtlety that it aches us when she finally does show her emotions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta does a great job as well, successfully giving the character the charismatic quality that was in the novel. Adult stars Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland are just great, doing justice to their roles. Sutherland, in particular, plays a menacing villain without showing much emotion at all, delivering his lines in such a subtle yet fierce manner.If you think about what the filmmakers had to work with, a book told in first-person of a new world, and saw what resulted on screen, the accomplishment is commendable, if not entirely amazing. With the direction of Gary Ross and a powerhouse performance from Jennifer Lawrence, THG is a faithful adaptation of the novel that deserves the success it receives. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be EVER in the series' favor!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I'm also one of those people that when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a Battle Royale remake. When I found out it wasn't, I was quite surprised, cause they seemed very similar. You cant always judge a film by it's trailer though. So to be fair, I decided to give this movie a chance, and not go into it comparing the two.The movie has quite a slow start, and even though they take a long time building up; I didn't get the idea that I was getting to know any of the characters. They really didn't do a good job making any of the characters likable, or let them develop in any way. The main character in this film, Katniss, was already portrayed as a tough girl from the very beginning of the film. Nothing in the first part of the movie did anything to either develop this, or add to it.When the games finally start, I was kind of excited, because I was looking forward to some action finally. Unfortunately for me; the action was lacking quite a bit. Shaky camera-work, which I guess is meant to be artistic these days, left a lot of the killing to your imagination. Due to lack of character building in the beginning of the film, I didn't really mind who died, cause I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters. On top of that; many scenes from the actual games seem to be lacking dept, reason or logic. It was as if they went for too many scenes in too little time. This resulted into the whole story of the movie being kind of blur to me, and left me wondering if there was even one there.On a positive note; the acting was quite OK. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed her role quite well, and her acting had nothing to do with me not being able to relate to her character. Elizabeth Banks was splendid, as a character that at first sight seems totally misplaced in this world, but totally works in the way it's portrayed. All in all, I'll have to be fair and say I don't quite get the hype. The movie seemed to be lacking in too many areas, in order for me to stay interested throughout the entire two and a half hours. Not comparing this film to Battle Royale while watching it was made quite easy, simply because this wasn't close to being as good.

I also believe that people should be more respectful on what goes into a movie. People that make these movies have done the best job that they can to make a movie but on the other hand sometimes they don't work out that way. But this movie was just wonderful. It is a must-see, but if you haven't read all of the books yet, then I would recommend you read the books before you see the movie. I thought that Jennifer Lawrence was very good in it too.

They really maximized the profit margin here. I swear they put half the average-to-meeger blockbuster budget in marketing. Hard to believe that Kurt Wimmer made a film that looked as good(or should I say as slightly fake) as Hunger Games with his nearly decade old release, Equilibrium. Only Kurt did it with a million bucks, and the movie was significantly better!That said, I'm a little disappointed in this one. It's not terrible. It's not good either.One of the films major flaws is the complete lack of chemistry between the leads. The way the two leads are written - you almost think they should hate each other. They do early on, but the ""growing"" relationship part of this story makes no sense whatsoever. Just no chemistry at all here. Peeta Malark comes off as a cold, heartless coward, and that just really belittles Katnis Everdeen's character when she starts to ""Fall"" for this nincapoop. I liked the fact that Katnis learned her media lessons throughout the film, but I was never sold on any attachment to Peeta. One minute Peeta is helping the others hunt Katnis down - the next minute they're kissing in a cave.This was an alright passing of the time. I didn't reach to turn it off. The pacing was OK. I won't watch this again even if it's down the road on cable.Significantly over-rated at it's current 7.4 here. Just thinking about a film like ""Frantic"" from Roman Polanski being .6 lower at 6.8 kinda makes me queesy. This one made me feel like I did after watching ""The Running Man"" for the first time back in the 80's. It's a little cheesy, and a bit disappointing.57/100 You MIGHT like this if you liked:The Running Man(slightly better or about even), Logan's Run(better than HG), Battle Royale(better than HG), No Escape(ever-so-slightly worse than HG), In Time(equally average)or Gymkata(much worse)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Watching it years later I still love it but can understand that I was a little infatuated. It's a solid flick and I think what makes it work so well is because of the smaller moments. The film is filled with brilliant performances from Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks and especially Josh Hutchinson. From the flashbacks to the revelations of his character he really nails. Also good are Wes Bentley with the coolest beard ever, Donald Sutherland and a surprisingly complex Alexander Ludwig. It's easy to write off Kato as one note. A hulking, looming privileged character but those moments he gives him towards the end really make a huge difference. Unfortunately the other love interest of sorts Liam Hemsworth is just eye candy. The movie is disturbing and well made but lacks the punch it really needs to drive the desperation and darkness of the material home. The end result is still an inspired piece of filmmaking that pushes its PG13 rating to the max with an independent, artistic flare. The costumes and set design are award worthy and the impact is still powerful","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie follows the story of Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a televised battle to the death between 24 young tributes from the 12 districts of Panem.The film manages to capture the tense and suspenseful atmosphere of the book, with stunning visuals and a talented cast of actors. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a powerful performance as Katniss, perfectly capturing the character's strength, vulnerability, and determination. Other standout performances include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy.The film's direction and cinematography are also top-notch, effectively conveying the oppressive nature of the Capitol and the visceral violence of the Hunger Games. The action scenes are intense and well-choreographed, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.However, as is often the case with adaptations, the movie falls short of the book in some aspects. While the film does an admirable job of condensing the story into a two-hour runtime, it lacks some of the depth and nuance of the source material. Some important plot points and character developments are left out, which may leave viewers unfamiliar with the book feeling confused or unsatisfied.Overall, The Hunger Games is a good movie that successfully brings the world of Panem to life. However, fans of the book may find themselves missing some of the details and complexity that made the novel so compelling. Nevertheless, the film is a thrilling ride that is definitely worth watching.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I have not read the books however from the summaries I can conclude a few things. First of all, Collins has written this series of books that keeps all ages alike interested. I think Collins has taught kids the consequences of our beliefs. She raises serious questions about our culture and violence and what it does to the hearts and minds of the younger generation. There have been a few people that I know personally and from what I have read that complained about the violence, not because there is violence, rather there wasn't enough. The violence seems to show past things that happened in history; for example, the Coliseum with the persecution of Christians. Children today are attending government schools and learning that man can save man. However, as a Christian, I know that's not the case. Socialism seems to play a major role. Another topic that I'm not sure if Collins knew or not, but she incorporated the idea of total depravity. Total depravity is the idea that no one is innocent and everyone is in need or redemption. (Romans 3:9-18) Collins added a few ideas into her books in order to make the readers think. The Hunger Games was a good movie, if you can get over the idea of kids killing kids. I know a biblical world view has nothing to do with The Hunger Games; however Collins placed a few ideas such as consequences for your beliefs, what violence does to the heart and mind, and a huge idea of total depravity throughout her books.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The acting was great, they pulled off the tone greatly, and I just loved it. It is a slow burner and that may irritate people but, so was the book. My only real issue was they didn't develop the love story between Katniss and Peeta well. In the book you can clearly see Katniss' feelings towards Peeta grow from disliking him to falling in love with him. In the movie it sort of just happens. I thought the movie breezed right by. It did not feel like 2hrs 22mins. I thought the movie worked.

The event is televised. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) from District 12 takes her sister's place in the competition. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is the male from District 12. This movie proves that people go to auto races to see accidents. If you can get over the idea of kids killing kids, then you may enjoy this movie. How does one do that? Well, some will say it's all tastefully done; and there are instances where the killings come as a result of self-defense.If I said the name Katniss 10,000 times over and over again, I may get used to it. Every time I heard it I said ""catnip"" to myself (easy now). Jennifer Lawrence, as Katniss, carries this movie to perfection. We know she doesn't want to kill anyone, yet.there's that self-defense thing that comes along. Yes, yes, we hope she wins.Observations: the nervous camera was in evidence for about the first 15-minutes, then it went away as well it should. The people who run the television event and other elites have the most garish fashion sense. It's like they all came from the Mad Hatter's tea party. And, don't get me started on the hairdos, beards and a new way to slap-on lipstick. You see, because this takes place waaaaay in the future, we have to be bombarded with extremes. After a while we do get used to these fashion extremes. Sad, but true. I didn't expect the first half of the movie to drag but, it did with the training and securing of sponsors (who help the participants). The hype that went on for years before the movie was released didn't go into that. Each team is given a mentor to advise them on how to survive in the woods, the battleground for the Hunger Games. The Mentors were previous winners in the Hunger Games. Woody Harrelson plays a mentor part to perfection. The guy should be given Oscars for just showing up. He is that good. And, aside from Jennifer Lawrence, he steals the show. It wouldn't surprise me if Jennifer Lawrence is nominated for an Oscar as she was in WINTER'S BONE, a great movie. And, Woody Harrelson also.Other notables: Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, and Donald Sutherland who performed well. Donald Sutherland as President Snow says the thing more powerful than fear is hope. The way I see it the contestants and the parents of the participants have hope. The audience sits in fear. If the audience ever gets hope that things can change Snow's government will fall.There is a certain amount of tension and suspense throughout because we side with Katniss, who is wary of everything, as are we. Now for the kicker - more tension: the ones running the show can inject fire or wild animals into the event if they feel they are losing or losing face. Why they would do that blew my mind. Yes, that is not fair. The contestants have no recourse but to fend for themselves. The audience watching all this doesn't seem to be too upset about it. The audience is every bit of sheep mentality. Is this where we are heading? There are political agendas in here and you may see the implications.Here is what I was hoping for throughout: that the contestants or the audience would somehow put a stop to these Hunger Games forever. But the ending for this movie is extremely weak. Go see for yourself. But, oh, oh, a sequel is coming: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire in 2013. Sad, but true. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games is the next in line of young adult adaptations steamrolling their way into the theaters, to the extreme delight and disappointment of fans of the books.The arguments are eternal: Did it really capture the tone of the book? Did they get all the details right? Did that character actually look like that?On and on they go, but really, the only question that should be asked is, did they make a good movie? In order to get that answer, let's move right ahead into the review and see what made it onto the big screen.The Hunger Games is a dystopian tale of twelve outlying districts that must sacrifice one young boy and one young girl up to their capital every year to participate in a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen volunteers herself in place of her younger sister and we follow her into battle, not only over the other ""tributes"", but also over the deadly pitfalls in the arena and the bloodthirsty nature of a society that allows these games to continue.First off, this movie clocked in at just under two and a half hours, which is incredibly long for a teen flick. Even Harry Potter didn't dare create such a marathon until well into the franchise where they knew fans would eat up every minute of it. Also highlighting the length was the incredibly slow pacing. The experience was oddly reminiscent of seeing The Da Vinci Code, where the original book was an eye-popping page turner, but the on-screen rendition seemed to suck all the life out of it. The Hunger Games didn't quite starve itself into a cinematic coma, but there certainly was a momentum and energy missing in the translation.As for the actors, Jennifer Lawrence was the prodigal choice and really brought much of that angst, conflict and fire-in-the-belly attitude Katniss needed to have. Josh Hutcherson also displayed a great deal of the heartfelt charm and inner strength that made Peeta such an easy character to root for in the books. Wes Bentley also gets a special mention for pulling off the expertly choreographed beard, but I missed a touch of the creepiness I expected from the Head Gamekeeper. Beyond that, everyone I felt did what they needed to do, but there weren't any stand out performances.The story was there, the pages played out on-screen almost right off the page, but it felt like they tried too hard to capture everything from the book, making it overly long, yet dropped particular sections that would have better served the overall experience. In that regard, without going into too much detail, I'll point to the mutts and how disappointing that entire sequence was. The whole point of who and what they were was lost, making them nothing more than aggressive bulldogs.Now there have been reviews buzzing around all weekend about this movie, so this will likely get swept away in the digital wind of the internet, but I must say this in closing. To those people who were upset because Rue and Thresh were cast as African-Americans, while Suzanne Collins didn't feel the need to spend a whole lot of time and energy repeatedly describing the races of her characters, those two were in fact written as ""dark skinned"", so the casting was not ""politically correct"", just correct. Secondly, to those people who went the step further to say that you felt less when they died because of that casting, yep, you guessed it, you're racist.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Instead, ""The Hunger Games"" earns the right to 'go there', so to speak - taking its time to establish character and situation. What I also appreciated was its subtext to do with violence and entertainment; de-sensitisation and trivialisation, and more broadly how governments are able to utilise such things to control populations. Jennifer Lawrence plays the rather conspicuously named Katniss Everdeen, a young woman living somewhere in a North America which has gone to the dogs through war and now suffers life under a totalitarian regime in the far-future. Where she lives, the equally conspicuously named Panem, possesses in its constitution a highly questionable law which dictates that, every year, one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 19 from each of the country's dozen or so districts must face off to the bloody death in a large gamezone carved out of the forests in what are the eponymous 'hunger games'. The reasons for this brutal regulation pertain to the dictatorial government wanting to keep up the traditions of honour and willpower synonymous with its national identity, but these days everybody largely agrees it is down to the sheer fact that said contest makes for damn good television. Questions pertaining to how old the nation is and what they did before television was invented are not answered... As a character, Everdeen is nobody special - nobody in Panem is, because the grip the rulers have on the country keeps anybody from broadening out too far into becoming anything at all. She maintains her friendships; lives in her rudimentary village; takes care of her younger sister and spends enough time fooling around with a bow and arrow to become a bit of a crack-shot. Will the skill come to benefit her later on in the tale? Disaster strikes when, through reasons I will leave unspoilt, Everdeen winds up appearing in the yearly contest having been selected as the female to represent her district. This plunges Lawrence's character into a whole new world of colour; energy and fame, not to mention life-threatening danger on account of having to do battle with a motley group of compatriots from the other districts which range from robust, muscular black males on the very brink of being too old to compete to mousey younger girls too young to possess any real clue as to what is even happening. ""The Hunger Games"" is not an especially exhilarating character piece, but it does do the basics required of both the action and horror (and, in part, romance) genres especially well. The film is an energetic post-modern fusion of all sorts of things ranging from ""Predator"" to ""TRON"" by way of the 2000 Japanese film, to which it seems to owe its greatest debt, ""Battle Royale"". It allows its premise and the sheer scope afforded to it in terms of whatever content it might possess to make a scathing attack on modern American (even Western) free-market consumer entertainment. This is unsubtly presented to us for the first time quite early on when one character quips about the contest that ""...if no one watched (on TV), they (the government) wouldn't do it"", eventually becoming a film depicting a society with a violent, deranged spectacle at the very core of its identity. Indeed, while nothing in the world (that we know of) can quite match the barbarity of what Gary Ross' film depicts here, we should be aware by now that WWE is adored by millions; heavyweight championship boxing matches can make billionaires out of its participants in one evening and that some of the highest grossing films of all time are action (or violence) packed blockbusters. This begs the question: how do WE - the film-going audience - react to the violent action when it finally starts? Are we entertained? Do we fall into the trap of rooting for a character because we want them to succeed? Is it not too often the case that the target audience for the film roll from multiplex screening to multiplex screening absorbing the latest actioner? By the time the ""Games"" themselves have begun, the film has earned the right to take us to where we go. To complain that they are episodic, and that the set-pieces & killings might happen in any order, seems silly, but the best action films have always had a sense of grace and timing to their second unit sequences as events unfold around their characters: ""Terminator2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" might be two good examples from recent history. The screenplay possesses very little of any terrific profundity, while the lead's taking in under her wing of a fellow female contestant far too young to survive on her own merely proves what we already knew: she is a good older sister - a more affecting arc may have been to establish her earlier as a bully to her sibling and have her return much kinder. Irrespective, there is enough in ""The Hunger Games"" to get stuck into and enjoy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Where other stories of the same genre often deal with technology and artificial intelligence as the main threat to human existence, Hunger Games actually takes us back to Roman times, with a revitalised version of ""Panem et Circenses"" or ""Bread and Circuses"". Simply put; human devastation as mass entertainment. Welcome to Panem: formerly known as The United States of America, where every year, a young man and woman from each of the twelve districts are selected to fight each other to the death, with only one possible survivor. These Games are broadcast on national television as a means to keep the people happy and submissive.Considering the fact that this film is based on a teen book series (written by Suzanne Collins), I can't help but feel this concept is pretty far out there, and actually it's kind of sick. It's not a pretty idea to think that one day we might live in a world where watching young people, ranging from 12 to 18 years old, brutally murder each other is considered to be a form of mass entertainment. Thankfully, this is 'just' a story, and I must say, a very entertaining one at that (no pun intended).The story revolves around the two youngsters from District 12, where the people are dirt poor and life is utterly desolate. 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers as 'tribute' to fight in the Hunger Games, after her little sister is initially selected. Her male counterpart is Peeta Mellark, and together they set off to train for and participate in the Games.The character of Katniss is played by Jennifer Lawrence, and she is terrific. Actually, she is my biggest recommendation for watching this film. Before this, I had only seen her in X- Men: First Class and thought she was pretty good, but after seeing The Hunger Games, it's not hard to see why this 21-year-old already has her first Oscar nomination under her belt. She has a very natural quality about her, which makes it very easy to make you empathise with her character. She's not a superficial, happy-go-lucky kind of girl; she's actually very sullen, not even particularly likable. And yet you just love her from the get go. I guess it's charisma, and Jennifer Lawrence definitely has it.Actually, this film is full of great actors. One of the greatest is definitely Stanley Tucci, who plays his most flamboyant role yet. His character (Caesar Flickerman, the TV-host who emcees the Games) is ridiculously over-the-top, but brilliantly amusing. With blue hair, prosthetic teeth and a big horse's smile which he flashes incessantly, he looks like a PG-13 version of the Joker. And if you're at all familiar with Tucci's work and talent, you know just what I mean when I say he's making this character appear to be oh-so nice, yet subtly sadistic at the same time. He's just great, period. Woody Harrelson also has a pretty interesting role as Haymitch Abernathy, a once-winner of the Hunger Games, who now mentors Katniss and Peeta in their training. He's scruffy and gnarly, basically just typically another weird Woody character, which is always worth the watch. Wes Bentley plays Seneca Crane, a character most notable for his unusual facial hair: he sports a beard Lucifer himself would be proud of. However, the biggest surprise to me was Elizabeth Banks, whom I am well familiar with, but never really cared for because I only know her from superficial, comedic roles. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she can also play challenging roles like this one. She plays Effie Trinket, a bizarre, neo-Renaissance type from the richest District, big wig, crazy make-up and all. She's pretty much the female version of Tucci's character and she was a delight to watch, beautifully grotesque in all her decadence.Unfortunately, it can't all be great. I had three major problems with this film. One: if you haven't read the book, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. They really should have spent a little more time explaining everything, because more than once it simply wasn't clear to me what was going on and why. Two: Peeta's character. It could be just me of course, but he annoyed the crap out of me. He just comes across as such a sissy that it's frustrating to watch. Katniss burns her leg and deals with it. Peeta cuts his leg and stays lying in a cave because he ""can't walk"". And then he lets her take care of him, at the risk of her own life. Give me a break. Three: totally disappointing climax. I was waiting for fireworks, for Katniss having to make brutal decisions, but this never happened. It just kind of faded out.And this is how you can clearly tell this story has a mainly teenage demographic, and they obviously wanted to keep it PG-13. Because despite the sometimes pretty brutal violence, nasty use of weaponry and tomato ketchup-a-plenty, overall the whole just lacked, well... balls. You can tell they tried to spike things up a bit here and there, but the film failed to make things truly interesting at moments where it definitely should have been. In my opinion, had they decided to make this rated-R, it would have been infinitely better.Having said that, you can rest assured there is still plenty to enjoy. Visually it is absolutely awesome and simply beautiful. The costumes and make-up are great, as are the CGI effects. The characters (aside from Peeta...) are great, and the whole futuristic 'universe' that is created is pretty inventive.There is actually still a lot more I would like to say, but I've reached my word-limit, so I'll just leave you with this: Thumbs up!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

What is more, the camera shake was at times annoying- and by seeing the movie in the cinema, I was even more annoyed by it. Unnecessary again. However, the fantasy part was well developed and it was the only ""up"" for me. Special effects made it for me. All in all, if you think of watching this movie - think twice.

It's hard to present that, especially for PG-13 movies. I love how ""The Hunger Games"" bring a satisfying dystopian sci-fi action adventure movie.The story happens in the ruins of what once known as North America, called in their time as Panem. Its government the Capitol requires a girl and a boy, called Tributes, from each of the twelve districts to send to the Hunger Games, where only one will come out alive. Katniss Everdeen volunteers for her younger sister Primrose. She meets her co-tribute Peeta Mellark, who has saved her from hunger for giving her a piece of burnt bread.I like how the movie deals with a totalitarian government. It's unusual for a teen movie to talk about it. The action scenes are okay, but mixed with drama. Children ages 12-18 are forced to fight against one another for survival, which includes killing. It also tackles entertainment, like reality TV. I just hate the shaky camera. It's dizzying. There's a cliffhanger. So expect for a sequel, and I'll see it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's hard to believe this is the next Big Thing, after Harry Potter and the TWILIGHT series. Stanley Tucci, hosting the TV reality show in which kids hunt each other to extinction, combines everything you hate about Simon Cowell with everything you hate about Louis Walsh! Jennifer Lawrence occasionally has the arresting beauty of the young Elizabeth Taylor.Even if you haven't read the books on which this highly-publicised series is based, it's fairly obvious from the start who's going to survive and who isn't. A thin storyline doesn't really justify stretching the film well beyond two hours. The ending suggests that creepy President Sutherland (Donald, not Keifer, looking like a throwback to Abe Lincoln) has got some more gruelling games up his sleeve for Volume Two. Don't think I'll bother.The killing scenes - knifings, bludgeonings and arrows-through-the-heart - are not too excessively detailed, but there's no escaping the fact that this a movie about kids killing kids. Leaving aside the obvious borrowings from RAMBO, THE RUNNING MAN and PREDATOR, this is a disturbing theme for a movie to emerge from the country that went through Columbine and other high-school and college massacres. And it's especially disturbing to be watching it in the week when a Norwegian right-wing lunatic is on trial for murdering several dozen students.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you've read these reviews, take them with a hint of salt. Granted this is pretty much setting itself to be the next money-making Hollywoodesque saga. It has a lot of the usual elements that get teenage groups to fall in love with the franchise, throwing their money - and tear-jerking awe's - its way. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad film.As for the comparison to Battle Royale, I'd much rather, if feeling the need to compare this to something else, compare it with The Gladiator - fighters from whatever part of a given world, mostly poor or slaves, are pitted against each other in an arena of death. Ring a bell? In fact, human nature, human history... humans in general, were definitely the inspiration for this story. Comparing this to Battle Royale is the equivalent to comparing 1984, a Brave New World and The Trial because of their descriptions of a ""future dystopian society"" - for anyone who's read them, you'll know how impossible this comparison is.To wrap it up, go watch this film. I was expecting little and came out well impressed, if not a bit disappointed about how people are analyzing stuff these days. I'm a huge film and book fan, I watch films on a daily basis (being quite picky and critic of most of the stuff Hollywood sends out this way) and also read plenty of books, and I would find it very hard to compare the two franchises, BR and Hunger Games, let alone call the latter a ripoff of the former.Please, please, please, just stop reading stuff online before watching a film if you know it will bias your opinion... You'll have a better time at the movies and you'll be thinking about them by yourself.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I will not by a hypocrite and tell you guys that it was a nice movie but it had some stupid things in it just to appear lofty. I really liked The Hunger Games! I do not consider it to be actual Oscar material, but it is a great film that keeps you interested and makes you anxious to see what happens next.It's weird to say this, because she is only 21 years old, but I have always loved Jennifer Lawrence as an actress. I first saw her in Winter's Bone, and after that I tried to find other movies in which she starred. And I must mention that I liked her in most of her performances. In The Hunger Games she stars as Katniss Everdeen, and I think she nails the role perfectly.I liked the way Gary Ross directed this film, considering it is only his third film(as a director). The script isn't that great, but I guess that in this kind of a film it's not fundamental for it to be so. The makeup artist did a very good job, so congratulations to him/her also.The one place the director should've insisted more, was the relationship between Jennifer Lawrence and John Hutcherson. I have not read the book, although I intend to, but I think he should have defined their relationship a bit better. The main reason for this, is because in some parts of the film I kind of got confused about how they really felt about each other.What can I say more above the fact that I am really looking forward to the next film in this franchise? Probably that for the first time after a very long period, a movie convinced me to read the books it was based on.

I'm a giant admirer of classic horror/cult cinema and thus consequently a hater of everything that falls under the category of popular new teenage age trends, including remakes of classic horror movies and ridiculously over-hyped and phony franchises (like ""Twilight"", for instance). I automatically assumed that ""The Hunger Games"" would fall under this last subcategory and thus decided not to waste any time or money on it, but then it came on television and I had nothing better to watch, so what the hell. I must admit that I was quite entertained by this first movie in the franchise and – contrary to what I feared –compared to ""The Hunger Games"", any entry in the ""Twilight"" saga looks like an episode of the ""Teletubbies"". Obviously I still think this movie is tremendously overrated and I didn't like it enough in order to run out and immediately purchase all the other sequels right away, but at least I was pleasantly surprised by the overall grim & depressing atmosphere, the brutality of some of the death sequences and the execution of the basic story concept. Speaking of which, the plot is as old as cinema itself and absolutely doesn't anything original. Back in 1933 already, there was a fabulous movie that dealt about the hunting-humans formula – entitled ""The Most Dangerous Game"" – and since then there came copious of rip-offs, imitations or variants. Some of them are cheap and dull (""Bloodlust!""), some of them are sleazy (""The Women Hunt""), some of them are extremely violent (""Blood Camp Thatcher"") and some of them became legendary cult classics themselves (""Battle Royale""). Some of them already even integrated the sub plot of the hunting game being one giant reality TV show, like ""The Running Man"" and Lucio Fulci's obscure piece of Sci-Fi trash ""The New Gladiators"". Basically that's all ""The Hunger Games"" is; another umpteenth re-telling of ""The Most Dangerous Game"", except this time it's based on a novel that all teenagers across the world have read and loved, so they think it's unique and groundbreaking. It's definitely innovating at all, but I'm already glad that it became a thriller with a a reasonably disturbing dystopian setting, a fair amount of suspense, intense situations and above average acting performances. Somewhere in the (not too distant) future, the nation of Panem – which is whatever is left over from the United States – is divided into 12 districts, ranged from proud and powerful to pitiable and poor. Once per year, the authorial president Snow organizes the ""hunger games""; a big media circus in which 24 randomly selected participants, two from each district, and unleashed into a wilderness where they battle each other to the death. In District 12, Katniss Everdeen volunteered to take the place of her younger sister, and she also happens to be a cool chick and a brilliant archer. There's quite a lot of additional blah blah and uninteresting sub plots, but I will admit that ""The Hunger Games"" contains a handful of impressive action sequences in the jungle and even a few shocking moments in spite of its PG-13 rating. The apotheosis is utterly weak, which is inevitably I suppose, and the use of computer-engineered effects (the mutated dog- pack attack, for example) is terribly annoying, but perhaps this is all linked to me being a sourpuss. As for the remaining installments in the series, I will patiently wait until they get aired on TV as well.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

She has shown she is a serious actress and has really out-done herself in this. Josh Hutcherson also performed well along with Liam Hemsworth despite not having a lot of screen time, he still makes an impression. My favourite performance however, was by Stanley Tucci. He was excellent, his role was not the most vital but it did shape a lot of the film's context, with him being the cheesy show host with a big fake smile and catch-phrases. His performance was without a doubt the best in the film. The editing was really well done, it must have been difficult to try and make such a violent plot become child friendly, they've managed to do their best. It cleverly cuts away from violent scenes meaning very little blood is shows so you think you've seen something horrible when you haven't really, it's a good example of how films do not need to be violent to have an impact. However, young children can still be frightened by this because it can be very jumpy, particularly during the climax, and the sound effects could scare easily. The only problem I had with this film was some of the hand-held camera work was just too much, there were points where the camera was jolting so much that you didn't really know what was going on. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film to both children and adults however, I do believe only people over 12 should watch this film as it can be quite frightening. This film is a breath of fresh air and shows that a blockbuster can be cinematically great as well as commercially.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was sort of expecting it to be really terrible like most films that are based on a book. Not this one. It was very action packed for a PG13 movie, but there are SOME flaws though.One: There should have been a Madge. I think it would have worked better if there was a Madge to give Katniss the pin.Two: I think it was kind of rushed, but I don't blame them. If it were longer than two hours and thirty minutes I think I would have peed my pants though. Two hours and thirty minutes is pretty appropriate for this film.Three: I think that the movie could have been more steady. I mean sure they're in a forest with explosions and all that, but I just think that they shouldn't have filmed this so shakily. I think I was really dizzy watching this movie.Those are the ONLY flaws to this movie. Overall, it was very impressive. I think they really stayed true to the book. I mean what did you guys expect? For the movie to be better than the book? I don't think that's EVER going to happen. Not in a million years. I highly recommend this movie, if not, read the book!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The lack of chemistry and compatibility with the role was so glaringly obvious to me while watching.People might think that looking older than a young girl is not an issue, but I believe it's quite problematic. After all, the age of the main character has significant implications for many plot mechanics. If the main character appears too mature in appearance, it could make it much harder for the audience to buy into the drama of the story, which revolves around a teenager trying to fill the role of her mother.The real issue is indeed the complete lack of compatibility between Lawrence's acting and the character. She plays the character with an incredible emotional constipation. It's clear they wanted her to portray a character who struggles to express her emotions, but I can't think of a word better than ""cringe"" to describe how she translates that onto the screen. The character's intended pride, strength, and personality all got crushed and vanished due to Lawrence's attempt to sell her shyness through an edgy, forced role.The strong concept, storyline, and world-building are undermined with Lawrence's acting. The main material of this film indeed has a truly solid. The screenplay does have plot convenient events happening, but these could have been seamlessly integrated into the film with good acting. However, the mismatched casting of the main character makes it glaringly obvious.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A totalitarian state which still punishes its people for a rebellion committed many years ago. It reminded me of the world of George Orwell's ""1984"". The people of the districts will have to pay for their rebellion and live a deprived life while the people of the Capitol, Panem, live a life of plenty and extravagance.Which reminds of another Orwellian element in the story: the ignorance in which people of the Capitol live. The whole frenzy of the people of the Capitol about the Hunger Games -- the deaths, the violence, the bets -- is out of their ignorance, and quite frightening.The whole setting of the film and the story quite fascinated me and promised a very good film. But as it went on, it became more and more a teenager film with big flaws in the story and the characters.As a whole, the film is entertaining and doesn't make you bored even at about two and a half hours. There are some good performances by Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley, not to mention the lead role played by Jennifer Lawrence.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The right people were certainly assigned the right roles and because of this a convincing and engaging performance was delivered. Josh Hutchersons portrayal of Peeta Mellark was heartwarming enough to make me warm to a character that I despised throughout the book trilogy - which is something that does not happen often. The special effects looked for the most part real and the costumes (bar one of two outfits) were beautifully designed and suited both the setting and the character.Dialogue was well thought out and kept me hooked throughout the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes. The characters were so well distinguished and varied that you'd be hard pushed not to find a character that you identify with making parts of the film very personal.Really the only problem I have is that some of the scenes strayed from the original story - which shouldn't have happened with the author writing the script. The opening is slow to start and it is only when the tributes reach the Capitol that you feel the pace liven. This is one of the few book adaptations that has actually worked and well worth the ticket fare. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am waiting in anticipation for the sequel.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a movie first viewer, I have to say the film was quite entertaining. I watched the late late show when I should have been sleeping and the movie kept me up and engaged the entire time. I was expecting from the trailers for a bit of cheese due to the lead character looking like the girl from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I was pleasantly surprised that the characters and acting were not half bad, and that the story was in fact quite fresh. I have read that this is the first book of 3, and I noticed the characters were built and left with some hanging conflict. I have to agree with another reviewer about the camera work. The use of hand-held cameras was appropriate some of the time, but there was just too much of it. It was jarring to the eye and distracted me from time to time. I got a bit confused in the fight scenes, because I could never tell who was hitting who. Some shots could have definitely benefited from a locked off tripod, or a steady cam. My goal in every movie is to get lost in it, not confused by it. Overall, this was an awesome film and I look forward to the sequel.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Survivalist Adventure with Satirical Reality TV Sensibilities Benefits from Lawrence's Star Turn","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2595983/?ref_=tt_urv","EUyeshima","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3608743/?ref_=tt_urv","12 April 2012","Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga's ""The Burning Plain"" (2008), Drake Doremus's ""Like Crazy"" (2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik's ""Winter's Bone"" (2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of the ""X-Men: First Class"" in the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in ""Winter's Bone"" that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, ""Survivor""-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two ""tributes"" from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' (""Seabiscuit"") surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass""); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district ""tribute"" at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the ""tributes"", they are groomed and trained in a style akin to ""American Idol"". This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underrated ""The Truman Show"". However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the ""tributes"" meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the hand-held camera-work by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids Are All Right"") doesn't make as vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the ""tributes"", Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley (""American Beauty"") as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films like ""The Running Man"" and even ancient relics like ""The Most Dangerous Game"". It's a pretty effective start to the trilogy.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Well, one good point really. I think all the readers can agree that Katniss is a very complicated character to play, with multitude of emotions. And I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a good job, considering screenplay she had to work with. This is probably the main positive of the movie.Now the negatives. For me (personally), the lack of gore and fighting (and hence making it a 12A instead of a 15) wasn't the problem. I didn't like the book because of the gore. I liked the book because it made me feel happy, sad, anger and compassion at different times. It made me care about the characters and what happened to them... how a good book should. This is where the movie failed for me. After asking my friends about the movie (who haven't read the book), they said that they found that they didn't care about the characters during the movie, whether if they died or survived. I think this hits the nail on the head. A book can achieve a connection between the reader and the characters by creating depth to the characters and more importantly richness of the relationships between characters. By doing this, the reader can relate to the internal feelings of the characters at major situations throughout the book. Hence, the reader will find themselves wanting good things to happen to the main characters such as Katniss and Peeta, and feel emotional pain when bad things happen to them. But this takes pages and pages of emotive descriptions, which is hard to portray on screen. Therefore, the writers had to balance between the depths of characters/relationships with the breadth of storyline within the given time frame, which was probably by far the biggest hurdle. This is where I sympathise with the screen writers. The movie was already 2 hours and 20 minutes long. It would over have to be a lot longer to do achieve this balance. But, obviously that is way too long for a movie. Therefore, as a movie this was destined to fail... maybe as a TV series where there is more time to develop this connection with the characters could have worked better. Who knows?","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Of the five of us, three have read the books, one is reading them and one has no interest in reading them. Accordingly, those of us who have read/are reading the books, understood the movie. The one who has no frame of reference for the story, hated the movie. He found it choppy, disjointed, shallow and had a hard time following the storyline. And the extreme use of the hand held/shaky camera style gave him a headache. For myself, I enjoyed the books but found the movie to be unsatisfying...which is no shock. It's usually that way when they take a well known story and make it into a movie. Especially one told in the first person. Without knowing what was going on in her mind (despite Jennifer Lawrence trying to convey as much as possible with her eyes/facial expressions) it's difficult to fully understand the storyline. My personal issue was that it made Katniss look as though she just jumped from one guy to the other...kind of made her seem skanky & shallow. The timing also felt a bit off...like the first 2/3 of the movie was leading up to the arena and then the rest was really rushed. There is no time given to the cave and all that happens in that part of the story. I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the movie was basically a synopsis of the book...it was like watching a really shaky Cliff Notes.I think Jennifer Lawrence carries the movie as the acting by the two male leads wasn't that great.

Such as the cat, and how Katniss met Gale.The overall setup of the movie is fantastic, and it's obvious the director knew what he was doing with casting and shooting this film. Nothing really drags on, and goes on forever, unlike some movies I've seen.I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because I found it captivating right from the start.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was impressed by the between teen and adult actors they were really good, I felt really connected to each of them which is also because their characters were written very well it's great to see that the author obviously treats his audience/readers seriously and knows how to write clever teenagers who aren't just cardboard cutouts. Next the camera-work is pretty good although there is a lot of shaky cam, the length and the way the suspense is build up with it's sort of two half's was really great sort of a Kubrick like and overall I liked the idea But with the idea and story were my problems. Now keep in mind I haven't read the book and i didn't want my friends to tell me anything from the book so that I can only understand this universe by the movie and I think thats were some people gonna have the same complains as I have.*I'm not gonna spoil anything, but give a short version of the beginning* First of all these are the 74th Hunger-Games is seriously anyone telling me that this ending NO SPOILER has never happened in 74 years? I mean these are still humans I just cant comprehend the fact that for over 74 years these hunger games happened just as they were planed without any problems caused by the competitors. Second these games *again no real spoiler but a basic info* as I understood were made to prevent a war of the districts. Exactly how is a tournament of kids from 12-18 going to prevent a war rather then forcing people to get mad at the government and system who made this happen? In the book its probably explained but again in the movie it stays as a plot hole, at least for me. There is also a little problem that would require me to spoil something but I think a review doesn't need spoilers to explain my thoughts.All in all its a nice movie, definitely watchable and for smart teenagers a must see but in the end I feel like I really have to read the book in order to understand the world this story takes place in and thats kind of sad because with Harry Potter I could leave the books aside and enjoy the movies for what they are without feeling betrayed, with Hunger Games I know that I cant understand this universe enough.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

However I ended up going anyway and it was a really good film although upsetting in some places but this was a vital part of the storyline and it worked well cinematically. I would definitely recommend this film to any one but in the audience were children about 9 years old with their parents and they were clearly effected by it so I wouldn't recommend any parent to take young children as the certificate already advises. The acting was brilliant especially Jennifer Lawerence who was very convincing with the hardships that her character has to go through.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was pleasantly surprised. This movie does a nice job of setting up the back-story and history leading up to the Hunger Games themselves. I thought that the casting was on the spot and Jennifer Lawrence captures the depth and strength of our heroine Katniss with aplomb. The book had a fairly dense storyline, so there are always sacrifices that must be made in bringing it to film. However, the story hits the high points well. While it's a little slow out of the gate, it finishes strong. If I had to offer a criticism, it would be the lack of emotional depth in some scenes, which too often was sacrificed to the momentum of the story. I expect that the coming 2nd film will be the real highlight of this series as the book was packed with action.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's a chilling idea doled out with high drama and great campiness: in the future, a televised ritual annually pits teenagers in a fight to the death as a kind of protection against war. The brutality and primal cheering of the masses bring to mind the Roman matches to the death in the Colosseum. And the superstitions implied (that such a thing would actually work) made me think of the story (and movie) by Shirley Jackson, ""The Lottery.""The main character is a young woman already equipped with survival skills. She is the female representative from District 12, and in all there are 24 combatants, a male and a female from each of the dozen districts. Yes, it's eventually a bloody awful affair. In fact, the first half of the movie, before the battles, is the best. It introduces the whole idea, including the pomp and circumstance, the game show atmosphere, and behind-the-scenes primping and strategizing. Stanley Tucci is the host of the show, the Hunger Games as they are called, and he's wonderfully nutty. Woody Harrelson is a jaded and unconventional tutor (and former games winner) for the District 12 pair. And Lenny Kravitz plays an attractive smart stage manager and morale booster.Dominating in every way is Jennifer Lawrence, who is a good reluctant strong participant. How long she survives you'll have to see for yourself--that's part of the game--but it's how she survives that matters, and how she becomes the target of some of the other ""tributes"" (as they are called, since the youngsters are bloody sacrifices for peace, ultimately). The scenario is great stuff, the sets and filming and pace of it really first rate. In many ways it's a terrific movie, and it's making billions at the box office for good reasons.The second half of the film is the grand battle. It amounts mostly a series of encounters between various ""tributes,"" a dwindling number of course. Members of the television audience worldwide are cheering for their own districts to win, and cameras seem to be everywhere. In fact, the control room of the ""world"" makes clear it's a lot like ""The Truman Show"" with complete mastery over the elements, the sun, and even invented fires and other threats. (It was all filmed in North Carolina, by the way.)If you like logic to your ritual barbarism, you'll have to look the other way now and then. Our heroine is singled out for some extra terrors, a bit unfairly, and then avoids other sure death situations by inexplicable kindness or little goodies floated in on metal parachutes. And those ultra-lethal genetically modified wasps? They don't live up to their billing. And why do some giant dog cyber-beasts suddenly attack our heroes and not anyone else?Nitpicking? Only maybe. There were some avoidable gaffes like this, and it's the director (Gary Ross) who is also the writer who needs to shoulder a little blame there. Or can we eventually attribute some of the limitations here to the young adult novel that forms the basis to it all. There is some background buzz about the movie because of supposed racist and feminist issues one way or another, and I think there is room for argument there because the ""types"" used in the movie are in fact stereotypes. Some small effort at surprising the audience with better casting would have avoided the criticism and made a better movie. (The wikipedia entry for this movie is stunningly long. Check it out.)In some ways this is nearly a 10 star movie. It's that good. But it's really too long overall, especially the second half which revels in some pretty basic hunt and kill violence. And there are some cracks in the veneer that drag the whole thing down to simply a fun, inventive, interesting futurist drama. That's good enough.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I think the film could've been cut quite a lot shorter which could of made it more exciting and effective, because a lot of the film focuses on the run up to 'The Hunger Games' i would've liked to see more effort put into the filming of the actual competition.With a few of the bad points out of the way, here come the good points: I still think that the story is an absolutely brilliant idea though it wasn't used to it's full potential in the instance it didn't really matter to me because i loved the concept so much. The acting is brilliant throughout, i especially loved the little girls acting, she was such a lovable character, i almost shed a tear at a certain part of the film which i wont mention due to spoilers.

The word ""hype"" doesn't even begin to summarize how much attention and praise this movie has received, and it definitely did not deliver. The lead actress was great and the idea of a bleak future landscape separated into districts to keep the population in check is a great story. But the film didn't tell that story well. We get only flashes of how or why this system game into place or what the ""hunger games"" purpose actually is. It was very slow, very predictable even if you hadn't read the book and had virtually no action. The fight scenes it did have were quick flashes that if combined total two or so minutes of the movie.

Personally, I love to hear the DIE HARD tween moms claim there is NO similarity between HUNGER GAMES and Twilight. The director, in his allotted 90 Hollywood minutes (hopefully his last), drain this movie of ALL of the passion the books contain. He surgically removed all evidence of the socioeconomic struggle the characters go through,which IS the point of the movie. I mean ITS THE TITLE of the book! Either this Director (I only call him this for lack of a better word) did not read the books, or failed every English class he ever took.

She is an underdog against other participants who have trained for this their whole lives.Other than Jennifer Lawrence, there isn't much to write home about. The scale of the movie barely big enough. The action isn't that brutal. The artistic style is a mishmash. Some of the important people have fanciful hair but are they truly original? I haven't read the books and after watching this, I don't intend to. By comparison, I eventually broke down and read the Harry Potter books after watching the 3rd movie.

Nearly every scene is taken word from word for the page, and while some things obviously have to be left out in the interest of time, watching the movie is incredibly close to the experience of reading the novel. And in this case that's a very good thing, because The Hunger Games is a great book and makes for a great movie. The tone is spot-on, be it the frivolous, manic environment of the Capitol (the ruling city of the future post-war remains of America and yearly organizer of the Hunger Games), the unflinching poverty of District 12 (home of our main character and several other people important to the overall story), or the brutality of the games themselves. Nothing featuring children killing each other should be easy to watch, and the PG-13 rating doesn't stop several scenes from being wince inducing. The violence is never really glorified or lingered on, but it's there. I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Any concerns I had about her being a little older than the character or too ""healthy"" looking were quickly forgotten. Katniss is defined by her determination and resourcefulness, and Lawrence nailed that. I also was pleasantly surprised by how well most of rest of the cast embodies their characters, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, who actually made me like the character in the movie more than the book. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Woody Harrleson as Haymitch, and Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane all help bring the world to life by handling their characters so well. Even the actors playing the other contestants in the games managed to be memorable and show the essence of their characters, no matter how brief their scenes are. If you're a fan of the books, put your worries aside. This is The Hunger Games you know and love on the big screen, and it's done well. If you're new to the franchise, just know you're in for a thrilling, often brutal, and occasionally touching story.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I went into this movie wanting it to be more then it was. I wonder if it will take all three movies together to get some of the impact that came from the books? I left the book series with the hunger for the revolution. The revolution that improved the social injustices bestowed on the poor souls of Pannam. Feeling sad for how broken Kat and the others were etc. I left this first movie wanting the bathroom and that's about it. This movie lacked character development. People have defended this with statements like there just wasn't enough time. I don't buy that and here is an example of why. If you saw the movie Star Ship Troopers a ""B"" movie if ever there was one you end up caring a little at least about what happens to some of the characters. To be honest I really didn't care what happened to any of the charters in this movie. I might have cared about Peetta more if I could have stopped confusing him with Cato. I almost cared about Rue, I wanted to but it just never developed. All in all this was just an OK post-apocalyptic movie somewhere in-between Mad Max and The Postman (another book the movie failed to translate). I hope they get another director for the Catching Fire because this story deserves a lot more effort. Some have said they enjoyed it much more the second time. I may put this to the test because I really wanted this movie to succeed.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Today, I saw the movie.I thought it was pretty good, but not great. It REALLY needed another 20 minutes or so during the actual Games. Many characters that are quite important in the book (especially Rue and Cato), are barely shown in the movie, and give us little or no reason to care about them.A big chunk of the movie was the lead-up to the actual Games. I understand there was a lot to get through, especially for people unfamiliar with the book, but it took too much time away from the actual premise of the movie.I will give the director solid props for conveying just how much the people were afraid of being selected to compete, and Jennifer Lawrence's scene (as Katniss) right before going up the tube was extremely well done. She's a fantastic actor.In fact, almost all of the actors were great. The only one I thought was kinda average was Peeta, and I think that had more to do with his voice tone than anything. Still, he did a good job overall.The main bad guy (Cato) in the book was not even much of a presence on screen. The knife girl did a better job showing that she was dangerous. The big black kid was probably on screen less than two minutes, and he was a major concern during the Games as well.Again, Rue was REALLY not done well. I blame this on the editor. The actress did fine, but the movie just plain didn't show why she was so important to Katniss. Her character should have had at least five more minutes of screen time just to explain their bond.The finishing scenes were decent, but the very end was ambiguous, at best, for anyone who hasn't read the book.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Other reviewers have commented on the use of hand-held shaky-cam, fast-cut camera-work - none of them positively that I can find.From the Trivia section on IMDb we read this one sentence:---- The director has stated that his decision to go with shaky cam work, ""had a lot to do with the urgency of what's going on and to reflect protagonist Katniss Everdeen's point of view."" ----There was nothing ""urgent"" about the first 2/3rds of the film. I'm glad I don't go around throwing my head from side-to-side in normal life, stressed or not. When are film-makers going to realise they are the only ones that truly like this type of camera-work? They sit there editing the film on their desktop monitors in an office but faithful movie-goers have to watch their ""creativity"" on 50ft+ screens, where every sudden jerk sideways is at best distracting, at worst nauseating. It doesn't convey urgency, it conveys amateurism. Enough already.Hitchcock asked the composer Friedhofer, ""where would the orchestra be?"" when the latter wanted a string piece for a scene in ""Lifeboat"" The composer replied ""The same place as the cameraman."" We expect movies to have a soundtrack, and if the music is working properly, then we don't really notice it because it joins in with the visuals and enhances the scene. We are viewers of make-believe, sometimes realistic, often fantastical, and immersion into the world of the story is key to a satisfying movie-going experience. A camera being wiggled about on purpose draws attention to itself, and it shouldn't. This constant reminder of the presence of a, seemingly badly trained cameraman, is a real turn-off. Please stop it.As far as the other aspects of the film were concerned, I found the narrative somewhat plodding, and the pre-games section of the film could have done with being 20-30mins shorter. I knew nothing about the books beforehand, so I'm of the opinion that this is perhaps one for the S.Collins enthusiast rather than the general movie-goer. Though if the other reviews are anything to go by, plenty of Collins' readers are not very pleased either!","211 out of 393 found this helpful.

"","","Did they take the rights of the Japanese thriller 'BATTLE ROYALE' or just copied it shamelessly as per modern Hollywood's tradition?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3414995/?ref_=tt_urv","terrildavis-44052","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65431721/?ref_=tt_urv","14 February 2016","With The Hunger Games, the decade old tradition of Hollywood continues, taking it all (from the first frame to the last) from an engrossingly well made Japanese Thriller called ""BATTLE ROYALE"" released in 2000.In short, the director and his writer take 90% ingredients for their over-cooked script from the Japanese Film. Then they add a love-sex angle to it as a mandatory clause of Twilightesque Film-making technique. To make it more spicier, they bring in some eunuch characters into the narration with the get-up earlier used in their own films. And further, sprinkling it with a few emotional sequences about some broken families, they are ready with their latest flick The Hunger Games, taking advantage of the brand name.As I have realised, many of my reader friends here would like to say that, ""We don't really care if it's a copy or not, so cut out the allegation crap and just let us know whether the movie is good or bad and that's it."" In answer to that I would only like to say that The Hunger Games is an Open Creative Theft made by the Collis camp in this current age of world-wide- web. Now, a theft remains a theft, whether done carelessly or with utmost care and devotion. Even if it happens to be a too good movie (which fortunately it isn't), still it remains a Shameless Robbery of any other person's creative work and nothing else. And I am simply not interested in writing a detailed review of a copied movie.However, for all my friendly readers, who are willing to know more about Cinema in details, I would like to present this movie as a fine lesson in learning few important things about Hollywood Film-making style.1. Hollywood film-maker's biggest problem is that we still are not sure of what genre we are dealing in while making a film. The current The Hunger Games copies a fast paced cruel bloody Japanese thriller ""BATTLE ROYALE"" , it's a Bloody Suspense Thriller and it remains a bloody suspense thriller throughout.But The Hunger Games not even remains a thriller in its more than 2 hours of duration. There is an added track in it of a beautiful model girl who is in love with the hero as Love essentially has to be there like sugar or salt in a dish. There are many unwanted eunuchs and unmoving stories of broken families inserted into it which were not required at all. The soundtrack has surprisingly all love songs in a SCIFI THRILLER movie like a variety served on the dinner table by its makers.2. Secondly in this new age of fresh creative minds, we still follow double standards in showing the characters of our male and female leads. Now in the original flick the lead character or the hero is not a female. But in our Tweenie version the hero becomes a strong female character. So the writers give a certain amount of disrespect to the very source they are copying from directly.But on the other hand The Hunger Games has a sexy-model beefcake characters played by eunuchs, who simply have no definite role in the movie but is added only to be exploited as a male butt rump.That's the double standard mind-set Hollywood actually works in.3. Thirdly after watching both the movies, you will have a clear idea of what it means by the term ""Added Sub Plots"" which in most of the cases ruin the real essence of a film. In this case too, where the original keeps walking on a single track and never gets distracted from its basic storyline of BATTLE ROYALE, its USA copy keeps wandering between its various added subplots which could have been easily avoided. Frankly speaking we can't even stick to a basic storyline even when its all copied from another brilliant source.4. Lastly and more importantly, if you even copy the idea for the Poster of your film along with its script then I wonder what the whole team actually may have done as far as creativity is concerned in this project. Here the makers of The Hunger Games not only copy their whole film from the Japanese Original scene to scene, but they also copy their posters. Now that's really a great amount of research done by the team.Summing up, with The Hunger Games, the Gary Ross camp continues to try for their next box office success in American Cinema by taking the credit of all the hard work done by someone else residing in a different part of the globe far awayand they have really mastered this shameful act of ""Art of Inspiration"" by now. (However, I would love to be surprised with the impossible news that they actually did buy the rights this time.)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The games are broadcast through the Capital and the twelve districts to entertain and intimidate the population.In the District 12, the teenager Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a great hunter and eximious archer. When her younger sister Primrose Everdeen is selected as one of the representative of their district, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. Together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they head by train to the Capital to be trained to the brutal game.

It is quite impossible to recognize Elizabeth Banks travestied in her androgynous character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos Vorazes"" (""Voracious Games"")","9 out of 33 found this helpful.

From the early images which surfaced online all the way to the trailer and the final poster I thought she looked the part, and after seeing the final film it's safe to say she nails every facet of this wonderful character. Miss Lawrence is a supremely talented young actress and it's great to see someone with mega talent being rewarded by getting the big roles. She just absolutely nails it as Katniss, from the emotional side to the violent tough side, she is the character.The movie itself is a fine adaptation, all the best parts of the book are present and accounted for, a few bit and pieces have been omitted but it doesn't affect it majorly, the beginning of the story is set in a barren land known as district 12 and it is presented exactly how I imagined it, this chapter is only slight though which is really the only disappointment, i would have liked to see a bit more of that but oh well, the middle part of the story is hilarious with Stanley Tucci stealing every scene, again the eccentric Capitol is presented in great detail, again exactly the way I had imagined it while reading the books. And finally the third act, the one every has waited for is a truly action packed adventure, it's non stop action and you don't fare tear your eyes away even for a second.The romance element is very very slight and not overdone thankfully, I'm glad they didn't over do that, the rest of the cast are mostly great, Josh Hutcherson is nice to watch and you care about him just as much as you do Katniss, and Elizabeth Banks like Stanley Tucci is a scene stealer and great comic relief.All in all the film is excellent, a great book has been treated with care and it's paid off, fans of the book and just general movie goers will love it. Excellent excellent excellent.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

A parable that must resonate for teenagers indeed... since the film's 24 participants must be 12 to 18 years in order to qualify for the deadly competition that will leave 23 of them dead. A parable with manipulative and controlling adults taking their disproportionate pleasure from contests that children play on the little league fields, soccer fields and basketball courts of the USA... as in the hungry arena of fictional Panera. And what percentage will make it to the big time college circuit and then on to the pros? A game seen by teenagers as set up by controlling adults so as to produce one winner and twenty three losers: that is, one Ivy League acceptance for every twenty four applications in the annual American college admissions contest. Cut throat (oh so literally in the movie) competition over grades, honors, external recognitions. The big question in the viewers' final ten minutes of the film is... can the teenagers turn the tables on the adult leaders, outwit the system, and survive? Avoiding a spoiler...I let the question stand. Seven stars, not ten...a few too many internal inconsistencies left unexplained, but surely a question-raiser of a movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was very excited because I read the Hunger Games' books. Firstly, the book of Hunger Games to be printed 2008 but I read 2009 and I was very affected by the book. The story included both real parts and unreal parts. I think, this book's construct is very impressive. After I read the book, I watched the film and I found that, the film is very good. The characters of film's are related to book's of characters in view of my imagination. Actors' speaking, appearance, manners is very closed when it is comparing film and book. When I heard the bad critics about the film I shocked, because in my opinion the film has got very good construct and very good film player cadre. But I think that, who are doing bad critics, are not read the Hunger Games books. Because if one can not understand anything the film, I say only she/he didn't read the book or else certainly understand and admire the film. If I hadn't read this book, I wouldn't affected a lot. Because the book has got a lot of paper to giving a detail for reader, but the film is only showing two hours and only give specific points. Therefore, a lot of people didn't like this film but I very like this film but only I said negative comment about the film, the scene of dying Rue.

'His Dark Materials' and 'Stormbreaker'. The latest series hoping to make the transition from print to box office gold is 'The Hunger Games'. Grittier than 'Harry Potter' and less melodramatic than 'Twilight, this one could well make it. Jennifer Lawrence takes the lead as Katniss Everdeen, handling the role with amazing maturity. Woody Harrelson brings his immense talent to his character Haymitch Abernathy and is a welcome addition to the cast for older viewers. The plot has three distinct sections; before, during and after the games which is a lot to cover in a movie, giving a running time of 142 minutes. It's a credit to director Gary Ross that it doesn't outstay its welcome. Being aimed at the younger audience, violence is toned down as much as possible – although you're never in any doubt about what's happening as the game's participants fight to the death. I did find the costumes of the ruling classes over the top and a bit childish with their garish colours. Whilst not quite meaty enough to satisfy adults, this film does succeed in being well pitched for its target audience.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

To my surprise, this movie is easily better and plays in another league as ""Twilight"" or the last two ""Harry Potter"" movies.This movie is also based on many special effects but they are visually truly beautiful and the strange future world is quite interesting to discover. The acting is also solid at many points I really appreciated the appearances of the charismatic Donald Sutherland, singer Lenny Kravitz and the very talented young actress Isabelle Fuhrman. The movie also contains some decent criticism about media and society but it could dig deeper at some points. The open ending makes you want to see the evolution of the characters and the addicting future world in the upcoming two movies. This movie is a solid Hollywood popcorn movie for teenagers but might also please to older fans of fantasy and science fiction movies even though I prefer the more mature ""John Carter"" that has been released a few weeks before this output. I was positively surprised by the high amount of brutality and raw killing scenes in the movie that make it more dramatic towards the end. After horrible adoptions from fantasy books such as the teeth-less ""Eragon"" in the past, this is definitely a step in the right direction even of worried parents, conservative Hollywood maniacs and too religious watchers might feel shocked about these tendencies.On the other side, this movie offers nothing new after all. The dystopian context and the brutal games make me think of ""Rollerball"" and other classics and this movie has not enough originality and soul to come close to this masterpiece. It could though initiate a younger audience to this genre and make them discover further great dystopian movies such as ""1984"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Renaissance"" and ""V For Vendetta"". In comparison to these movie this one we have here is rather forgettable and only worth to be watched once even though you get well entertained in over two hours of running time. I also disliked the choice of the main male character who lacks of charisma and guts in comparison to the convincing female lead role. Josh Hutcherson seems to be like a mixture of Justin Bieber and Robert Pattinson and seems only to be there to attract young girls to this movie. He might be a sweet guy for them but he honestly is a rather mediocre actor. The love story between him and the female lead role is simply not convincing in this movie and I'm looking forward to read the book to see if the whole thing is more authentic in the written version. The next time I wish the studios would chose an edgier and more unique actor or change the character of the book a little bit to make him more interesting. The soft guy simply feels out of place in this rather brutal survival movie towards the end.In the end, it's worth to watch this movie once and to get out and watch the two sequels if their quality is as good or better than this movie. It's nothing groundbreaking though or something I would watch twice or purchase. A younger audience might though like it and overall the flick is well done and a step forward after the last rather mediocre Hollywood fantasy blockbusters with the exception of ""John Carter"" and ""Super 8"" that were approximatively as good or slightly better than this.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The wait was worth it, and I cannot express how much this film moved me. I was always expecting it to be good, because of the books. However, it was better than I expected! The characters were portrayed excellently especially Katniss. The settings were perfect and exactly how I had imagined when reading the books. There were a few let downs but very minor ones at that; a few changes to how things should have happened and a few things missed out that I thought should have been in there. However, it is only meant to be a film based on the book - they can't get it one hundred percent the same as the book and therefore I don't really complain about these minor faults. I would say to everyone - GO AND WATCH THE HUNGER GAMES. Whether you heard the whole 'Team Gale, Team Peeta' thing about this film - ignore that. This movie is about so much more than a romantic relationship between two characters. It is such a moving film and those people who bring it down to that 'team' argument are not giving it any justice and making it sound like a stupid meaningless film like 'Twilight'.So, don't be put off by thinking it's about the whole 'team Gale or Peeta' ... I promise you it is not and that you will most likely thoroughly enjoy this film (unless you wanted the team love thing).Overall, outstanding film.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Suzanne Collins should be sued, and this issue should be brought to light.","31 out of 51 found this helpful.

That's the way most films made for the younger set turn out these days - uninteresting stories accenting form over substance and with inferior acting. But, since they're aimed at unsophisticated audiences, hardly anyone notices.This one is a variation on a theme that's been done many times in the past - humans hunted by other humans. This one has the requisite special effects and color process, sound modification, etc. but it is a joyless exercise with no heart at its core and no chemistry between the 'star-crossed lovers'.""Hunger Games"" is no better or worse than most other big budget pictures made nowadays that lead the viewer to expect more than what shows up on the screen. It benefits from a big publicity campaign, leading you to believe that P.T. Barnum was right.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought the acting was reasonably good, the casting, direction, costuming/makeup well done. I agree with many here that the camera work was pretty annoying. I thought some of the special effects were pretty good.But what really hit me was the feeling of sitting there, watching the whole reality TV thing (or ancient Rome thing) taken to its logical conclusion, and that I'm actually part of the voyeuristic problem, because I paid my $10 to watch other people being killed. If you could do it (and I think you could), I think it would be very cool to have a scene where the camera pans around the audience in the film, watching raptly, but the camera continues to pan around the actual theater where we were all sitting and have us see ourselves for what we are - not much better than the people in the capitol feasting on the carnage. (Incidentally it doesn't help that many people here on IMDb have complained that the killing scenes aren't clear enough!) I find the whole thing pretty unsettling. I suppose that's the author's intention - I will now read the book to see if I can discern such a motive...and I will keep looking around the reviews and boards here to see if anyone else has this reaction - so far I don't see it. Maybe we're all too jaded to worry about that?","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence does the incredible job of actually bringing Katniss Everdeen alive on stage, and I have never seen Josh Hutcherson act like this before. They truly are the embodiment of their characters, and I don't think anyone else would have done a better job living the story. Wow..

After reading other people's reviews and knowing the talented actors who were featuring in this film, I couldn't help but have very high expectations of it. It was even better than I expected. The acting of Jennifer Lawrence was amazing, she managed to keep all the parts of Katniss I loved, especially her fierce protectiveness over Prim and Rue. Josh's portrayal of Peeta was also good, although Peeta's charming character struggled to come through, though I think that was a problem with timing rather than Josh's acting. Other notable mentions are Lenny, Woody, Elizabeth and Liam, who were all great at their roles. Throughout the movie, I kept thinking of all the things that were missing, for example the Avox and Madge, but had to then keep reminding myself that it was a movie, and of course they couldn't fit every single part of the book into a 142 minute film, so if you think of it that way then you shouldn't be too disappointed. I hope in Catching Fire they find time to show Peeta's character a bit more, and explain about the Mockingjay's significance, but I think it did a great job at capturing the essence of the book. We weren't just shown scenes of Katniss and Peeta kissing, it had much more depth than I could have hoped. I felt the anger at the Capitol with Katniss, and the fear before the Games began, and have not been able to stop thinking about the Hunger Games since seeing it last night, and I think that is the important thing. Whether you've read the books or not, I'm sure you won't be disappointed with this film.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

More so the if i loved the original. I know there are extremely few which equals or excels to the original but it's not a big problem for me 'cause i don't even expect them to. It is to me like a bonus track of a beloved album, no more no less.So i got no hesitation in checking Hunger Games as well (i was even excited actually) 'cause the original must be in my all-time best 10, but, oh my..I won't say any more about this XEROX COPY crap. (copied on retarded machine, moreover) Nough said by nough people.Now one thing i just can't believe is how this could be legal. As far as i've read on internet articles, Sanjay and his people haven't even paid a penny to the original Oldboy makers for doing this, which means Hunger Games is not an official remake of Battle royale.Then what the h..! is Hunger Games's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Lionsgate and its company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Liongate's kept saying he's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Battle Royale is totally different from THG or something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from battle Royale, Lionsgate intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Battle Royale's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : HG is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY. I don't understand why Oldboy makers let them make money with this stolen thing.Am i disappointed ? No i'm fine i didn't even expect. I'm just p***ed and upset for this shitmakers' shamelessness that's all.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, my wife after reading the books convinced me to do the same. As a 30 year old bloke I'm not ashamed to say the trilogy of books is outstanding, it is gripping, emotion filled, a riveting read from start to finish.I finally got around to watching the film yesterday and after reading some of the criticisms here I felt compelled to address them.1. Shaky cam: I've seen a few films where this technique is used to disastrous effect, the only point to it seems to be to make you feel sick. However, in The Hunger Games, the shaky cam is shot from eye level, often just behind the main characters head in a weird '3rd person' viewpoint that really, really works. I almost wept on a number of occasions as the emotions of the main characters hits you like a brick to the face. This is down to the amazing Directing skills of Gary Ross (I'll certainly be looking up more of his work).2. 'It's just a rip off of Battle Royal': Please. Three prerequisites are required for anyone to come to this conclusion: i - You've watched Battle Royal ii - As it's a cult film, you feel smug and special because you've watched it and the 'idiot main stream audience' haven't. iii - You haven't bothered to watched 'The hunger games'.Only on the internet, could this lazy opinion be allowed to propagate.Seriously, saying ""its like battle royal"" because ""kids are forced to fight to the death"" in both? Oh great, well in that case Harry Potter is exactly the same as Buffy the Vampire Slayer because both ""involve school kids fighting monsters with 'magic'"". See, I can be intentionally misleading too. Granted, there are parallels that can be drawn between the two movies, well, one parallel, that's all in fact.3. It's just another Twilight What? Because it supposedly involves a 'love triangle' between teenagers? Well, whoopdiedo, the internet guff is propagating again. Twilight is an awful movie, the direction is lazy, the plot is lazy, simple and dull, the only thing in the film is the love story. Though to be fair, there's not much you can do when you start with the premise 'Girl meets Vampire'. In contrast the love story in The Hunger Games barely registers, it's background, it's not what the film is about.The only thing these two movies have in common is the amazing scenery and...OK, Joseph does look a bit like Gale.4. It isn't true to the book. Yes it is, and where it deviates it does so for good reason, and it does so exceptionally well (either to simplify too-complex-for-screen issues, remove unnecessary characters, or to simply make the story better). This is the best book adaptation I have ever seen, and I include LotR in that.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

To me it seemed like an excuse for a straightforward action-flick from the very beginning. The basic idea- people killing each other as part of a show- dates back to Antiquity. We've seen it countless times, in all settings and styles imaginable. As far as original ideas are concerned, this film- or the book, for that matter- doesn't even qualify for the competition. But that's OK. I like a straightforward action-flick. To be fair, it was a decently entertaining movie. But that's about the highest praise I can think of.The whole idea of a tense, psychological manhunt, with believable scenes and a careful pacing- that I was sort of hoping for- quickly ended up as a B-movie for kids. I just couldn't take any of it seriously. The whole 'world' in which this story takes place is all-too-obviously artificial, built hastily in order to give some supposedly-needed context for the whole 'Hunger Games'. It doesn't have any depth, any identity or personality. I don't know about the books, but I have a feeling I wouldn't like the written background story very much either. It's like... would anyone give a s**t about the whole imagined universe, unless the Hunger Games? It's just a decorum, but one I couldn't care less about.But that still would be OK. I just wanted a show. A cool manhunt, one where characters have to make tough decisions, where their true strengths and weaknesses come to light. Instead I was treated to the above mentioned kids movie. Genetically modified bees, gigantic dogs and godly f***ing firestorms coming out of nowhere, with no previous hint that they even exist. Rules randomly changed in the middle of the game. Characters eagerly conforming to their assigned unidimensional roles as 'arrogant bad guy' and 'nice kids who actually couldn't hurt a fly'. The nice kids are then conveniently killed off by bad guys or poison themselves only leaving the heroine the task to mourn them. Ridiculous, stupid tactics that no one would use, like placing all your belongings in the middle of a mine-field or sleeping like you're dead while the person you're trying to kill is camping on the tree... wtf was that?? All too often, the heroine was just saved by pure luck and lack of sense; I mean, seriously how far could she have wandered after being bitten by those bees? The others had all the time to arrange stuff around the mine-field, but not to walk like 100 meters further and kill one of their most dangerous opponents (supposedly). Anyway, I'm not trying to be overparticular, but the originality and the story being clearly not worth for consideration, about the only criterion by which this movie could be worth something is how cool, ingenious and smart they made the manhunt. It seems to me that everyone just took the safe way and piled up a bunch of clichés and/or ultimately dull scenes. I mean were you once surprised by the turn of events? Do you remember thinking wow, I wouldn't have thought he/she/they would do that? What a surprise?Ps. In spite of this all, Jennifer Lawrence rocks, I hope to see her in some cool movies over the next years. After she finishes this trilogy, I mean.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

My daughter and I had read the book, my son had not. All three of us LOVED it, and plan to see it again. And again. And again. And buy the DVD. It followed the book very closely, was riveting and exciting. To address some of the common complaints: 1. This is a 2 hour/22 minute movie. There is not enough time to put every single thing from the book into the movie. Character and storyline development was as good as it could possibly be without making the pre-Games half 3 hours long. The character development was good enough that several adults in the theater started crying at one point during the Games...2. ""The Hunger Games"" is considered a young adult/teen book, and the movie is rated PG-13, which stays in line with the book's intended audience. So don't expect it to be all blood and gore. There was enough blood to make it believable, but not so much as to offend or nauseate anyone. While the book focuses a lot on the violence, there are other important issues: reality TV, totalitarian government, class-separation...3. A lot of people don't like the ""shaky-cam"", and I can understand that. It doesn't bother me. It gives the feeling of disorientation and anxiety - what the Tributes were feeling - and also helps convey the bloody scenes - you only get snippets of the violent attacks and blood. Honestly, as I read the book, I was wondering how in the world they were going to show violent deaths of children to an audience of tweens, teens and parents. I think they did a good job.As I said, my kids and I loved the movie. It's a good idea to read all the reviews and consider the things you do or don't like in a movie. Does a ""shaky-cam"" bother you? Do you prefer to see lots of blood and gore? Do you need a lot of in-depth background and character development to feel an attachment to the characters? If yes, then you may not enjoy this movie. Regardless - if you are at all curious about the movie - GO SEE IT!!! You might regret having missed it on the big screen!","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

However, the disturbing plot is the less brilliant aspect of the film. The movie takes a long time to get into the meat of the story, namely, the Hunger Games. Much of the time, the film feels more like someone is reading you a (more boring) book instead of actually watching it.This is not a compliment. The movie feels like it follows very closely with the book (something I have read), but there are parts where instead of connecting emotionally with the characters and really feeling the fear, the exhilaration, or the remorse of the ""games"".Part of the problem with the film is that much of the book consists of Katniss, the lead character, and her thoughts and emotions running through her. The author, Suzanne Collins (a writer for Emmy-nominated children's hits Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo among other things) uses the countless thoughts and emotions surging through Katniss' brain to tell the tale of her emotions and of how she copes with the horrors of living in the impoverished Seam of District 12, how she disobeys the Capitol by hunting in the off-limits forest nearby her home, and her feelings towards marriage, raising kids in a terrifying world like Panem, and her interests in two male friends.These thoughts were not provided in the film to its detriment. Collins captures in her novels so seamlessly who Katniss really is that as readers we can relate to her, feel for her and understand her fears in such a world, whereas the movie feels more emotionally distant. It's much harder in the film to really understand these ""kids"" fighting against one another and oftentimes as observers, the viewers are more just watching what goes on, on the screen and reacting.The movie lacks character development and love interests between the main characters. It struggles to really connect viewers to the grotesque acts on the scene and it really hurts the movie as a whole.Still, millions of viewers have flocked to the film the past couple of weeks, as it has earned over $250 million at the box office in its opening two weeks, however, the film was a bit disappointing in some of the areas that are most important areas.Jennifer Lawrence plays a terrific Katniss Everdeen and Woody Harrelson gives a memorable performance as the bumbling drunk, Haymitch Abernathy. The others give an average performance and are forgettable.For me, I left the theater feeling disappointed at Gary Ross' attempts to re-create the same feeling Collins created in her novels. Instead of feeling for these poor kids, I feel nauseous.My Score – Overall Rating: 6.75 out of 10 Plot: 7 out of 10 Character Development: 6 out of 10 Acting: 6 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I then read user reviews and was shocked at all the negative responses so I did lower my expectations. however, i watched it and thought it was absolutely brilliant! a lot of fans of the book are giving it a lot of stick cause it misses out a few scenes and some changes have been made but my opinion is, if its good enough for the author, suzanne collins, who did in fact have a part in writing the screenplay and whatnot, then it should be good enough for the fans. I think people are just nit-picking; film adaptations are very rarely better than the books so just deal with it. as for the comparisons to twilight...errr no. the hunger games is better in every way, from the acting to the script. the acting by Jennifer, Josh woody etc. is on another level. its just fab. Jennifer and Josh portray their characters to a tee. everything is explained great so even if you haven't read the books, its easy to understand - no confusion whatsoever. a decent film adaptation doesn't leave people who haven't read the books, confused. only reason I've not given it a 10/10 is cause I would have liked a bit more blood and gore cause I'm weird and like things like that. Ta for reading, much love x","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I did not even notice the shaking camera that much, though I'm not very sensitive when it comes to this, so I shall say no more.The portrayal of the characters by the actors/actresses have been done very well, and I don't really have any negative comments for them, so I would like to congratulate them for a job well done.Now this is where I disagree with the mainstream comments: I found the pace of the film easy to follow, and not at all boring. I watched it twice and I didn't feel bored both times. Maybe it was even a bit too quick. I would have liked to watch a bit more and I thought it could go up to 3 hours, but that might be pushing the boundaries a little... Also, I felt that the artistic side of the film was done very well, from the costumes to the design of the Capitol.But I think the enjoyable aspects of the film speak for themselves. I should focus on the frowns a bit more:I do agree that the book is a lot better, though I enjoyed the film nonetheless. I would have liked to see the political context explored in the film, and yes, there was a lack of desperation during the Games, and even outside of the Games. I think the audience is all too familiar with images of poverty and disorder. The book has much more to offer than these superficial images of a dystopian world. And if there is one thing which can separate the Hunger Games from similar stories like Battle Royale, it is the political context of the Games. Hopefully, the next two films will pay more attention to these issues as the protagonists become involved in a bigger world.Also, the film did not develop the characters well enough. For example, there is more to the hunting and the mockingjay symbol than what the film suggests. Much of the history of the characters, as well as Panem, have been omitted. However, I probably enjoyed these aspects of the book most. It's not the actors'/actresses' problem - they have done a great job embodying the many aspects of the characters. Rather, the screenplay was unable to take advantage of the actors'/actresses' talents by not providing more background information to portray and develop the characters properly.As a film, I'd give it 7/10, but I've always had this personal attraction to dystopian stories so I feel inclined to give this film one extra score, which makes 8/10. And I will readily admit that I'm quite biased, too! :D","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I disregarded the entire thing yet when i saw the movie trailer, it caught my interest. I regret I never tried this earlier(though not reading the book allows me to not compare both movie and book but rather critically view just the way the movie was made).The idea was quite unique and in my opinion, sometimes seeing something visually has greater effects. This movie has succeeded there, with scenes able to truly portray the feelings of that part. The sound is also quite satisfying. I liked the acting and the actors who portrayed the characters as they gave it a realistic touch,albeit some of the actors may not have really shown vivid feelings.Also,some parts of the movie left you hanging, wondering what certain things meant and some characters were shallow in that we never really learn anything about them, especially those who may have been crucial in our understanding of the story's background.Overall, it was an excellent film(for someone who never read the book and did not expect it).","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I loved in a maximum way I could love the adventure drama. It was so much fun to read this book that when I finished it, I was mad at myself for doing this so quickly. But I'm not writing this post about Susan Collins. It's about a movie:Generally, I liked the movie. Loved the way it was screened, liked the production design, cinematography, sound mixers and editors have done great job. So, this movie had every supporting feature that could make the story more spectacular.I liked actors as well. In all the whole cast is quite good and well fitted the roles they are assigned to. But Jennifer Lawrence is really awesome not because that I love her but her performance was exactly the same I imagined from book.The thing I did not like much is the screenplay itself. I know this is an adaptation but it was too much copy of the book, there was no surprises, no much creativity. I felt the director followed the book word by word, paragraph by paragraph and did not changed much. So I found the movie boring in the middle. If I had not read the book I would more enjoy watching the film.But still I award this movie with 8 points out of 10 and make it as highly recommended to watch at least one time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

When I saw the previews to the movie, I assumed it was just another teen movie to drive me crazy will all the unnecessary hype. But I heard good things about the books from a couple of people and ended up reading it. Safe to say I enjoyed reading the first book and plan to read the rest in the series.On the contrary I was not too caught up with the movie. I tired very quickly of the teen frenzy, which included the Twilight mania. Although I actually enjoyed the Twilight book series as well, but the movies are probably one of the worst film adaptations of any book series. Again I digress. I had the same fear with the Hunger Games. On a good note, I was pleasantly surprised and happy that this is definitely not another Twilight.The Hunger Games was excellent in the visionary department. The scenery was excellent. The beautiful landscapes, District 12, the surrounding foliage and woods, and also the Capitol. I imagine you have to get the feel of the setting in the book. From the impoverished slums of the districts, to the plush and vibrant mood of the Capital. They did a splendid job on that. The Games were done well too. I liked the technique of them showing the blood splatter of the tributes that were killed. I think this could have easily been a Rated-R movie because of how brutal the killings were in the book, but I liked that they made it more easier for kids and teens to watch. The camera angles and tricks were also cool and added great imagery. I thought Jennifer Lawrence gave a convincing performance as Katniss Everdeen. One minor detail is that she didn't fit the physical description of Katniss (as also Gale) I just remember that some people made comments about some of the African Americans that were cast. (Rue, Thresh and Cinna.)I don't understand double standards. To defend the casting, I think Rue, Thresh, and Cinna where perfectly cast. I love Lenny Kravitz and who could resist the innocent face of Rue? The rest of the cast was surprisingly good as well. It was nice to see Donald Sutherland again.Again I know the books are always better than the movie versions, but I just wished they paid more closer attention to details. The flashbacks were kinda confusing and would probably be even more confusing to someone who didn't read the book. They cut several scenes and rearranged it. The pacing was sometimes slow and sometimes it felt rushed, but these are minor details that don't ruin the movie.I watched it four times already so far, so it is definitely worth more than one watch.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

No it is not Battle Royale, no it is not Twilight. Yes, I can see similarities to Battle Royal in how the competition is held, executed, and even the end result all together. However, Battle Royal is a Japanese film that has it's culture deeply embedded with in it, not to mention the heavy use of guns and other weapons not allowed or seen in The Hunger Games. Battle Royal is also incredibly gory and violent having no official rating in the US due to such factors. There is also the entire story surrounding the competitions which differ completely. There is no resemblance to Twilight other than that it will likely have a huge following, most of which will likely be the same age group and possibly even the same fans. Now that I have that out of the way, the film was very well done. The acting was very believable, which is important to note due to the huge science fiction or fantasy like culture that exists within the capitol when you have such derelict conditions within the districts. With this you have two very different cultures that make up the same nation-state. The filming in a few scenes could be described as shaky, which I know from past experience will bother those who are sensitive to such methods. However, I do not think most will notice it, and the majority of the movie was filmed quite well. The Hunger Games as a whole was all done very well, with the exception that the ending was rather anti-climatic. The ending truly just drifts off for the await of the next film in the series. I personally would have liked to have seen more violence and gore, but doing so would be unnecessary due to the context and target audience of the movie. Now that the movie is in full release I would highly recommend those reading this to go see it. I don't think you will be disappointed.For my full review, visit http://visuallyimpairedreviews.blogspot.com/2012/03/hunger-games.html","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie is that good! Although the book had more details, and made more sense I still recommend this movie for Hunger Games fans. This movie is really appropriate compared to if every single detail of the book was put in the movie. If you don't know what the movie is about, then don't fret! This movie actually explains everything in the first 10 minutes. This movie has everything from romance, (which is for the show), action (basically 7/10 of the movie was all action) , and intensity. (which is the same as action) The actor for Katniss (the main character) was actually mystique from X men first class, I kept on thinking about the girl on fire looking blue! Although there is going to be sequels (Of course!) IMDb announced that there will be a 4th movie even though there are only 3 books....

He is quite right too as Catching Fire, the second installment in The Hunger Games franchise has become; far darker, moodier and emotionally styled - all with a bigger, broader scope in comparison to the first.Continuing from the first HG, the film begins - as fans of the book will know - with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) back in District 12. With nearly a year passed since the events of the arena, and now mentors the duo must proceed with a victory tour throughout the Districts 11-1 to celebrate, all whilst keeping up the appearances of their love story. (There is not a single Prawn insight at District 9 - who knew.)Shortly after capturing all of the standout emotion and violent traits from the novel they arrive in District 1, the Capitol. Where President Snow orders in his army of Stormtrooper look-alikes to the lower districts and announces that the 75th Hunger Games also coincides with the third Quarter Quell. Where that years reaping tributes are chosen from each Districts existing victors. Which in turn brings Peeta and Katniss back into the arena one more time. Dramatic suspense entrails and the story continues from there.Taking over as director, Francis Lawrence- (no relation to Jen) and writers Michael Arndt and Simon Beaufoy have rather successfully crafted the story from paper to screen. Creating a rather faithful adaption. With its 146 minutes running time, it in fact includes almost every page from the book. But it is worth it.Filled with mesmerizing performances, surreal narrative and seamless CG effects, you easily forget that you are watching a 12A, what with the raining blood, killing of Pensioners and extreme whipping scenes too. You are only reminded that it is a Young Adult film when you see the Wizard of Oz style Capitol and Effie's (Elizabeth Banks) elaborate attire, and hairstyles that even Princess Leia would avoid.Post her Oscar win back in February, Jennifer Lawrence is the key to the franchises now even larger success. Her performance is flawless, emotional and simply striking. Portraying Katniss through and through, she represents the lost heroine lead that has not been this good since Lara Croft. Almost the greatest anyway, during filming Harrelson ordered on multiple occasions to give the Oscar back for forgetting her lines.Starring alongside the now Academy Award Winner, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) now has an even bigger challenge. The first HG's showed him as a bit of a drip, rather weak and quite defenseless. But this time around he seems healthier, stronger and more confident in the role – but still not great. Also returning are regulars Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland, who has a much larger dictator-sith type role.Additionally the new cast is equally as exceptional, which include; Sam Claflin as Finnick (the most standout character, no doubt a fan favourite) Jeffery Wright, Jena Malone and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, respectively, are also brilliant. Proving promising sparring partners for Jennifer Lawrence.May the odds be forever in Mockingjay's favour.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The action sequences were good, and the story line was almost exactly the same as the book, probably because Suzanne Collins co-wrote the screenplay. The best performances in this movie came from Woody Harrelson as a drunk trainer, Stanley Tucci as a slightly gay commentator and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. The only problem I had was this movie was some of the characters weren't developed enough, or at least I felt that way. For example, Cato said three things then died. Also, the great Claudius Templesmith only said a few words and mostly just was a shadow under Ceaser Flickerman the whole movie.

Director Gary Ross, who also co-adapted the screenplay from Suzanne Collins' book (with Collins and Billy Ray), throws a lot at the screen (action, family drama, teen romance) yet is relatively unable to erase the distastefulness from this scenario (which isn't made palatable simply by putting the context of human exploitation within a totalitarian society framework). Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have a particularly expressive voice or face, though she makes us care for the central character, a tough young woman who volunteers to substitute for her little sister after the child is chosen as a participant during the preliminary 'reaping.' The handsome boys cast opposite Lawrence don't really suit her, however--and there's an unavoidably anti-climactic void at the finale, which leaves itself open for the obligatory sequel. Well-produced and occasionally gripping, despite over-the-top visual effects, jittery camera-work and simple scenes edited to a fare-thee-well, apparently by filmmakers who didn't trust the collective attention spans of the movie-going public. **1/2 from ****","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

Rarely do films rise above direction. Gary Ross is not Nolan or Fincher and they are not Scorsese or Kubrick. In my life I can say that there are now three films that surpass the book that created them. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was better as a film. ""On the Beach"" was  better as a film. I had concluded that Gregory Peck may have been responsible for this. Now I have to add ""The Hunger Games"" to that list. Odd thing is that I did it backwards. I saw the film Friday and read the book on Saturday. It may be that the first person narrative was not as engaging to me as the film. I may be pathetic because I am old but I have followed Jennifer Lawrence since ""Winter's Bone."" I thought that she deserved the Academy Award then. I also know that the politics of that system allows great performers to be nominated over and over again and never win, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Kate Winslet had to be nominated for two great performances in one year to finally win. I just assumed, heck, Lawrence is just a kid and she will get her justice later. I thought that she stole every scene in which she appeared in ""X-Men First Class."" That was a character driven cartoon with several terrific actors but even with McAvoy and Fassenbender, Lawrence shined. To add to my native, aged prejudice, I am repulsed by the teen-trilogies. If ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and ""The Emprire Strikes Back"" offered the best,  then that is where I drew my lines. I am a ""Hurt Locker"" ""Tree of Life"" kind of movie film fan. Perhaps driven by lechery or recognition of talent, I rushed to ""The Hunger Games."" I have been blown away. I don't know how Lawrence manages to communicate to a camera as she does. These are not Streep's ""Sophie's Choice"" medium shots. These are intimate and intense close shots of the twitch of the eye, the corner of the mouth. The Dystopia runs deep but is passé to me. The world of Harlan Ellison was done best by Harlan Ellison. I have been closed to these revisions of his work.The film, ""The Hunger Games"" has opened my skull. I am not certain if President Snow is Kronos or Zeus but both kill their children. The Greek Mythology got one thing right, we kill our children. The manipulation of ""hope,"" which was crystal clear in the film, did not seem central to the book. It was not Katniss's endurance or heroism, it was her humanity in the darkness of savagery that broke me to tears. It is the flickering flame of humanity that has moved me to write this. I remain deeply moved. I can't get this out of my head. I am an old man who wishes our children are better than we are, not better off. The spiritual elation of the human heart found in children, embodied by Lawrence in her portrayal of Katniss, provided me with unexpected transcendence.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A Good Adaptation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2587440/?ref_=tt_urv","NyxEos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27308088/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2012","For those of you who don't know the basic story line: There are 12 districts controlled by the Capitol. Every year a boy and girl, aged 12-18, are chosen from each district to fight to the death for all to watch. There lies the biggest problem with this adaptation. It is about the brutal slaughter of nearly two dozen teens by each other, and yet the movie has been watered down to be PG-13 appropriate, most likely to expand the potential audience. Unfortunately, this means that the true brutality of the games is somewhat overlooked.For people who have read the novel(s), there of course are changes made. Having read the books when they first came out, I only noticed a few changes. Fortunately, these new ideas don't impact the overall story line that much, making for a good book to movie adaptation. However, the changes made do ignore some of the more subtle ideas of the book. This is especially true for explaining the relationship between Katniss and Gale, which is a minimal part in the movie because it occurs mostly in the opening of the book.Overall, the movie was well done. The camera work was often shaky (on purpose to create drama), which worked in some scenes but became tedious in others, especially when it was simply used to cover up deaths. The actors worked better than I had originally thought they would. Josh Hutcherson is a little too boyish in my opinion to play Peeta, especially since all of his work has been in children's movies, but he did pull off the role. Fortunately, there were no actors who simply could not act or just did not have the ability to fill the role.I went into this movie slightly terrified that they would ruin one of my favourite novels and was very pleasantly surprised when I left to find myself happy with the adaptation and with plans to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD. I definitely suggest seeing the movie, and reading the books of course.I rate this a 9/10.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Let me make this clear firsthand, I did *not* read the books. I wanted to see what the hype was about and entered the movies ready to judge the Hunger Games as a film rather than a realization of the books. I have to say I was disappointed. The movie unsuccessfully tried to cram what appeared to be highlights of the novel's plot into 2.5 hours, shifting awkwardly from one conflict to the next. The pacing of the movie was terrible, with the opening sequences rushed, shaky, and almost unbearable to watch. Flurries of shots wizzed across the screen, each held for 1-2 seconds, attempting to illustrate the helter skelter of the main character, ""Katniss."" The result was a ratchety relationship barely developed between ""Katniss,"" and what should be the driving force behind her efforts, her family. Towards the second act of the film, I thought the movie would actually be OK; Katniss's character development improved and some intriguing conflicts arose posing potentially satisfying plot twists for her own journey. Yet none of these opportunities were maximized, and seemingly important developments were dropped for other conflicts that had no precursor whatsoever. There was honestly no tension anywhere else apart from the chase scenes of the movie, plus some awkward departure scenes in the beginning-- a style which I highly doubt dominated the novel. An earlier review noted how it seemed like the director just read the Sparknotes and crafted the movie-- a criticism which rings well with the movie's lack of meaningful development. The movie used the audience as a crutch, depicting events not as a means of solidifying the story,instead just paying small tributes (pun) to the novel.The books sounds like it would be a much better read. Once established, the premise seemed extremely promising with a lot of potential. Throughout the movie, I heard the teenage groupies giggling at the jokes that were most likely funnier in the book, but carried off poorly on screen. I'm guessing the books weaved the dramatic elements together much better. The movie crossed the bare minimum for developing plot, and only managed to carry across the basic storyline of the book. Yet I did not feel anywhere as involved in the story as throughout the Harry Potter series, which I thought was a much better execution than Hunger Games. So go ahead, pay that $12 for the movie ticket, but don't expect anything beyond a weak slideshow of chapter summaries.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Set in the future, each year twelve colonies must send a boy and girl to participate in the sport known as The Hunger Games. The battle to the death will allow for one winner who will get to take food back to her people but this year there's a twist as the two contestants from twelve (Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson) begin to have feelings for each other. I'm probably one of the very few that hasn't read the novel so I have no way to compare the two and I can't say what the book got right or wrong. For the most part I thought this was pretty entertaining from start to finish even though there are some flaws in the film. I think one of the biggest flaws isn't really the fault of the film but when you know sequels are coming it's pretty hard not to know what's going to happen at the end of this film. The one other problem might get me killed by some but I found there to be very little passion between the two leads and I thought the love story was the weakest thing even though this obviously plays a very big part in the film. With that said, the rest of the film was highly entertaining and I was pleasantly surprised to see how effective the film was even with its PG-13 rating. The hunt sequences are actually pretty intense and there are some gripping moments during the deadly games. I also thought the entire opening bit was quite good and really helped build up the hype for the game that was to follow. It also didn't hurt that the cast were so good. Lawrence turns in another winning performance and she's so good here that it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off of her. I also thought the supporting players were great including Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Wes Brently, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. THE HUNGER GAMES also benefits from some beautiful scenery even if some of the CGI looks incredibly fake. Again, I'm not sure how this differs from the novel but as someone unfamiliar with the story I must admit that the movie is extremely well made, gripping and delivers some fine performance all of which makes it worth viewing.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

First of all, I really enjoyed this movie it was so well done! Everything that was important was here. But there were also things that made me a little bit sad but I totally understand why they changed things.Second, after seeing this movie, I have to say to those people who didn't read the books, it will be a little bit hard to understand. I don't think I would of understand it clearly if I didn't read the book seriously. And I also have to admit that the shaky camera was a little bit annoying in the beginning but then it was less shaky. Still, they did a wonderful job and stayed true to the books.Then, even if there were changes, I don't think there would be any better way to do it. If you really didn't like the changes, than tell me how would you do this? It's not that easy at all. Plus, since the book is written in Katniss' point of view it is harder to ""convert"" it into a movie. So, they made it perfectly and there were scenes that I imagined the way they did it.Finally, The Hunger Games movie is an amazing movie, it has a little bit of all. Even if this movie doesn't look like a funny movie, they did have a little bit funny scenes with Haymitch. And there is also violence but they tried to not put too much blood in it. Well, I really enjoyed this movie and even wish it was a longer...","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

I thought the movie stayed very true to the books and the essence of this story. The movie was, for me, a facilitator of the images I constructed in my head as I was reading the books. I HIGHLY recommend reading the books before watching the movies because most of the books are about Katniss' way of seeing things, how she felt, etc and of course, that's hard to catch in a movie so the books are helpful in many scenes where the things Katniss says are important to understand the full meaning of the scene. If I had to choose between the movie and the books, of course I'd choose the books but gladly, I don't have to choose and I can enjoy both masterpieces.

I read them all cover to cover within a week and a half, and I am not even an avid reader. In short, the books are highly addictive, and very thought provoking.When I heard that a film was in production for the first book, I was scared they would turn the whole thing into a ""Twilight Phenomenon"", a bad movie for 12-year-old girls to scream and rave about. And how wrong I was, this film is a very good adaptation of the book! I particularly enjoyed the added perspective of the game makers, which is something not detailed in the book. I thought the use of flashbacks to explain Katniss' family situation was appropriate and helped with the pacing of the film. Jenifer Lawrence was perfect for the role of Katniss; every wince of pain, every nervous line, every forced smile was very convincing.My only complaint with this film is Garry Ross's use of shaky cam throughout the action sequences; I understand he was trying to emulate the book's first person perspective, but I felt that it was over done, to the point of nauseating. Some sequences were hard to follow because you couldn't physically see what was happening. On the other hand, if the camera work had been steadier, the action would have been shown in much greater detail and brutality, bringing the film's classification closer to an ""R"" (or MA 15+ in Australia), which in my opinion would have been in keeping with the book's graphic and brutal style.But never the less, this is a worthy adaptation of an amazing novel; acting is brilliant, sets are convincing and characters were very true to their ""written word counterparts"". Despite some nauseating camera work, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone over the age of 13. But most of all, I recommend reading the books, they are well worthy of your attention.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening.

The Story is based around Katniss Everdeen, A girl in district 12 who's younger sister Primrose is selected for the Hunger Games but she volunteers herself and replaces her sister in this dangerous games, and her journey in this dangerous games and how she copes with danger all around her in The Hunger Games.The Acting by the whole ensemble cast is very good and everyone has done their own job very well and have portrayed their characters brilliantly, But the stand-out performer was Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen as she portrays her character brilliantly and she was a brilliant pick for this character because she had all that it took to perfectly play this character. Her acting skills are very good and she is a really potential star on the rise. Stanly Tucci does a great job as the eccentric Caesar Flickerman who is TV presenter and Tucci has a small role in this movie but he really plays his character very well. Woody Harrelson and Josh Hutcherson also do there roles very well and their characters in this movie are quite significant and they do not disappoint. The Other Actors have done their part very well and the acting in this movie is very good.The Director Gary Ross has done a brilliant job in making this movie and he implemented this interesting story and concept brilliantly and made a very good fantasy movie and he has done a marvelous job with his acting crew which is mostly a bit in-experienced. He was also a screen-writer in this movie and wrote a very good story for the movie which is unique and interesting in its own way and Ross did well by implementing the story written by Collins and he wrote good dialogues and took out the crucial parts and he implemented the story very well in the movie. Billy Ray and Suzanne Collins also were screen-writers and Ross along with them wrote a perfect story to start this franchise which is expected to be the next big franchise.The Cinematography in the movie is quite good and all these new districts shown in the movie are really good and the Capitol was shown brilliantly too along with the area where the Hunger Games took place and the cinematographer Tom Stern did a very good job with the cinematography of this movie. The Special Effects were very good too and all these futuristic things shown in the movie were brilliantly shown and the special effects team did very well with all these action scenes and all the futuristic things shown. The Art Direction of this movie also was quite good as the Capitol, the districts and area where The Hunger games took place were made up brilliantly by the Art Direction team. The Background score of this movie is also quite good and the music is synchronised well with the scenes in this movie and music director James Newton Howard has done a good job with the music.This movie has really set the tone for the upcoming movies to come for this highly anticipated and expected trilogy and with great acting and with actions and entertainment Guaranteed, this movie can be enjoyed by any audience.My Rating: 7.5/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

So a bunch of years ago, there was a District 13 but there was a war, which demolished 13. So to remind the whole of Panem that the Capital was still the big shot, every year they held a televised program called The Hunger Games, where one young girl and boy was chosen from each district as Tributes, where they would fight in an enclosed arena to the death where one would survive and crowned victor, and bring the tribute's district money and respect. So this time, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence)'s sister gets chosen, and out of love for her sister, she volunteer's as tribute, and along with her Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) gets chosen... and the rest of the film tells us what happens to the both of them.Okay, I read the books of Hunger Games, which is a series, and when I heard the movie was coming out, I was so hyped for it. I even forced my friends to come with me telling them the exact same story above, because it sounded so great, and come on, if you are a guy and just read that story, you gotta be pretty intrigued. So first day, I went for the Hunger Games, expecting mind-crushing action. I was all like ""YEEUUHH, kids fighting to death! What are the odds of it being bad?!?!"" Turns out, quite high. Okay, so this movie isn't THAATT bad, but it just totally changed my WHOLE opinion of Hunger Games, just because of a stupid rating. ""A RATING?! What does that have to do with anything"" you say. YES, a rating. From the story of Hunger Games, it is completely an R rated film! but they had to go ahead and mess that up and make it PG13, just because the books had its fame with teenagers. The book focuses more on action, which I loved about it. The film, on the other hand, does all it can to focus on the one thing which the book needed, because there was no way they could edit it out, which was the romance. I'm not blaming Suzanne Collins, it was 100% needed, yet she did her best to lower it down so that it wasn't that big a deal. The movie, because it was PG13 and couldn't put the action, decided to make the romance a big deal, and went ahead and messed up people's thoughts on Hunger Games. The only one time they had action was at the part when The Hunger Games actually starts, its brutal but they use shaky cam so you can barely see anything. Half-way through the film, I was wondering, ""Is this what I want from this film? Coz it sure as hell doesn't feel that way.""In the end, this movie is an OKAY entertainer... because now they are making another one, as planned, but its going to be PG13, which makes me doubt myself on whether I should see it or not. See what this movie has done to me? However it isn't a twilight fest, don't worry, thats something Hunger Games will never do to you. It doesn't pull off that big a cheap trick.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes, this is a film adaptation of the first of a book series (three to be exact) that are adored by teens and young adults the world over. Yes, the tale is told from the POV of a 16 y.o. girl. Yes, there are two boys who are smitten with said girl. But no, this is not a weepy love story with shonky action and dubious acting. The Hunger Games – set in a dystopian future where two adolescents from each of the 12 districts of Panem (nee U.S.A.) are chosen to engage in a televised battle to the death where only one survives – is a thought-provoking and ambitious dramatic blockbuster that tackles themes such as oppression and class divide, all the while offering up thrilling (and surprisingly violent) set pieces and intriguing character arcs. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique from X-Men: First Class), who injects the ideal amount of both strength and vulnerability into Katniss and subsequently earns the audience's whole-hearted investment into her plight. Elsewhere Josh Hutcherson is solid (if not as powerful as Lawrence) as fellow competitor, and potential love interest, Peeta Malark, whilst older cast members Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci (very funny) and Donald Sutherland provide terrific support in their smaller roles. The Hunger Games is not perfect – the CGI could've been better – however it's an engrossing event that deserves to attract widespread critical acclaim along with its guaranteed massive box-office haul. Do yourself a favour and ignore the Twilight comparisons, this is well worth a visit to the cinema.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

A new nation, Panem, exists in North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government, which hosts the 'hunger games' annually, a brutal reality show featuring 24 contestants from Panem's 12 subjugated districts. The contestants, called ""tributes,"" range from ages 12-18 and there can only be one winner since it's a survival fight to the death! The first thing that impressed me was the realistic air and overall ambiance of the film, as well as the entire dystopian concept and story set-up.Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as the two ""tributes"" from District 12, Katniss and Peeta, are quality protagonists and I like the ambiguity of their feelings – are they for real or for show.Lenny Kravitz stands out as one of the few caring characters from the Capitol, while Woody Harrelson is effective as the drunken adviser to the tributes, a past victor of the hunger games. Also on hand are Elizabeth banks, as the creepy but sorta winsome host of the District 12 tributes; Donald Sutherland as Panem's dictatorial president; and Wes Bentley as his right-hand man with a beard Satan himself would covet.For me, the weak point of the film is the long third act, which constitutes the hunger games themselves, a fight-to-the-death in the forested wilderness (shot in the mountains of Western North Carolina). I anticipated this to be the best part, especially since I love survival stories and the wilderness, but it just wasn't as suspenseful or thrilling as it could have been. At the same time, it wasn't bad. The additions of the dubious ""mockingjay"" sequence and artificial horror-dogs who for some strange reason can't overtake the protagonists mar the film.I thought the name of the nation -- Panem -- was really strange, until I discovered that 'Panem' means ""bread"" in Latin, as in the popular phrase ""bread and circuses"" (panem et circenses), which is figurative of superficial appeasement to pacify the masses. In the film, President Snow said something to this effect to Seneca Crane (Bentley). On top of this, the film shows flashbacks of Peeta intentionally burning literal bread and throwing it to the starving Katniss, which saves her. The bread motif appears elsewhere as well: as a parachute offering to Katniss from District 11 to show her their gratitude for her kindness to Rue (Amandla Stenberg) and the bread parachutes given to the tributes that communicated covert information.I was a bit bewildered by the ending, since it left some things up in the air, but I suppose it leaves room for sequels.When the credits began to role a song came on that just blew my mind; my wife motioned to leave, but I couldn't leave my chair while this awe-inspiring tune played. It's ""Abraham's Daughter"" by Arcade Fire, an incredible piece. Check it out on youtube.FINAL WORD: If the long third act were better I wouldn't hesitate to give ""The Hunger Games"" an A-level rating. As it is, it's a good dystopian adventure with some excellent aspects, like the entire set-up, the protagonists and closing song.The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes.GRADE: B","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is more of a character driven personal story than an action thriller, though it certainly has enough action and thrills.The acting carries this film. Hutcherson does an admirable job of conveying the shift in the character from a gross lack of confidence, to competitor, to lover? Well, maybe lover, as the director does a terrific job of blending the competitors fake affection for actual affection brought on by the intensity of the setting. Hemsworth's small role seemed to be a teaser as Thor's little brother is expected to play a much larger role in the sequel. Finally, Jennifer Lawrence is terrific in her role without using a ton of dialogue. She delivers powerful emotion without speaking, which is a bit reminiscent of Clint Eastwood.This more than compensates for a handful of flat, underdeveloped and ""evil"" characters. There were numerous other actors and actresses that delivered in the final product including Woody Harelson, Elizabeth Banks, the always terrific Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Southerland, and an amazing though short lived performance by Amandla Stenberg.Gary Ross perfectly blended all the elements of action, suspense, and even some lovey dovey moments. The beginning of the movie had several nice touches including the split screen and polyvision which amplified the crushing presence of government and the poverty of the people. The costumes, specifically those of the ""peace keepers"", were terrific and gave a feel of 70s and 80s science fiction.The bottom line is that Lion's Gate hit it out of the park, and unless Batman can rise to the challenge this could be 2012s top grossing film.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

There is a continuous walk on the edge between popcorn movie or something more serious and deep. At the end you are not sure of it is totally achieved or even you never get to know about the real purpose. The best without doubt, the image of the media and realities.

If you read the books and were upset because minor parts were removed or changed, then get a life. I read the book again for the second time right before watching the movie, to see how close it would be, and I was not disappointed. In fact the few changes were even better and all the action I wanted was there. The story depicts very well the disconnect of a modern vain society between reality and violence, the power and dominion on the weak. It did very well showing what our human nature is capable of.

I think the cast set up an amazing performance. I absolutely love Jennifer, she's very confident and strong but she can also show her sensitivity to the viewers. Josh is just adorable, in every way. I'm not a huge Liam Hemsworth fan, but he was rather good as Gale. I do have a downside. I went home with a major headache, cause I was on the 4th row in front, and the camera was really shaky so your eyes get so tired of it.

Nothing personal. Making her point, she says. ""Thank you for your consideration."" Lawrence is amazing. Her Katniss is the brave and noble hero, who never forfeits being a woman, in fact it is the source of her courage and compassion in Suzanne Collins's ""The Hunger Games"" envisioned on the movie screen. After selflessly volunteering as Tribute to replace her younger sister Prim (fearful Willow Shields) for The Hunger Games, she consoles friend Gale (charismatic Liam Hemsworth). Gale, her blossoming love interest and hunting mate, reassures, ""You're stronger than they are!"" Katniss admits that she only hunts animals. Gale reminds that people are no different. At the dramatic arc in the woods, Katniss kills a boy out of rage and vengeance—still in icy repose. What good can come of kids killing each other, in a bloody contest of survival? That is the paradox of Director and Writer Gary Ross's ""The Hunger Games"", based on the book by Suzanne Collins. Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray wrote the screenplay based on the first book of Collins's enormously popular bestselling trilogy. I have not read the books. One of my friends Carol, also a published author, had told me that the books were great. I took her word. ""The Hunger Games"" is awesome: You have a young girl, who is the powerful hero of the tale. Jennifer Lawrence makes ""The Hunger Games"" work. Katniss is not the physically strongest, fastest or most skilled warrior. However, she is the toughest and she's smart. In a great scene before the Games, she tells her costumer Cinna (fostering Lenny Kravitz), ""I'm not afraid."" And both Gale and Peeta, who fall in love with Katniss, are attracted to her courage and character. Collins gets her hero transformation right. ""The Hunger Games"" depicts the post apocalyptic world, where the United States is now Panem which consists of 12 Districts. President Snow (calmly menacing Donald Sutherland) seemingly uses starvation and shiny objects to oppress the population. These are the 74th Hunger Games. Every year each District sends a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to the Capital to compete in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are like the reality TV ""Survivor"" on steroids combined with cage fighting, where children compete to the death—only one winner. Though set in the distant future the story opens in Katniss Everdeen's home District 12 which looks like a 1930's coal mining town. The dichotomy is that each cabin has a flat screen to watch The Hunger Games. Ross and cinematographer Tom Stern (""Million Dollar Baby"") have a serene affinity for the land—filmed mostly in North Carolina. The music by T-Bone Burnett and James Newton Howard provides a haunting down home atmosphere. Katniss lives with her Mom and sister Primrose (innocent and fragile Shields). Her Dad died in mining accident. Katniss helps feed her family as an expert archer and hunter.When Tribute Escort Effie Trinket (seemingly vapid and unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) selects Primrose in The Hunger Games lottery, Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers to take her place, and save her life. The other participant selected is Peeta (subdued and strong Josh Hutcherson). They travel to the Capitol to train and compete in The Hunger Games. They meet their mentor and former winner Haymitch Abernathy (deceptively powerful Woody Harrelson), who occurs as a drunk washout. Harrelson is one of the wonderful touches: As Haymitch he distinguishes the greatness in both Katniss and Peeta. He schools them in playing the Game. Peeta reveals that he has always been in love with Katniss. And she practically strangles him after his disclosure. ""The Hunger Games"" has a broader metaphor. When President Snow talks with Host Seneca Crane (meticulously charming Wes Bentley), he says that the only thing more dangerous than fear is hope. The Hunger Games exist to kill all hope. Amidst the atrocity of children killing each other for celebrity and food, the hero emerges in Katniss, who inspires others. Lawrence never sacrifices Katniss's humanity and boldly acts in the presence of fear. She gets amazing support from a talented cast. Stanley Tucci balances flamboyance and awareness as talk show host Caesar Flickerman. Amandla Stenberg is touching and powerful as young Rue, who befriends Katniss. Hutcherson is vulnerable and brave as Peeta. In the story Peeta can throw a 100 lb. weight 50 feet, but this is never used as a logical threat. Granted the twist is that Katniss is the savior. The fighting scenes, including the climatic fight, are difficult to discern in the quick cut edits—maybe not Ross's strength. ""The Hunger Games"" is not an action movie, but action threaded. This is a minor point in the big picture. ""The Hunger Games"" is the great classic hero story that inspires others to dare to be great. Jennifer Lawrence is the awesome hero Katniss. Bring on the revolution and the sequel.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

That's fine. It's good, it means that the script- writers, directors, actors etc. are not completely brain dead, so any review comparing the two materials is just redundant as literature and film are two different mediums that cannot be compared. The film:Acting: 7/10 I don't get the hype over Jennifer Lawrence. She was good, but not amazing. They could have done worse; she held her own over the show and I must admit she didn't screw up so credit is due there, most of the other actors were sub par, but again, didn't screw up too badly. Little Rue held her own and her death scene was quite powerful, but was ruined by the lack of violence (I'll explain my problem with the whole lack of violence on it's own later), Josh Hutcherson was alright. Not as strong as Jennifer, but not as weak as Liam Hemsworth. The adult actors were not dreadful; but not amazing enough for merit.Story: 9/10 The film's story was interesting, especially how they managed to explain every aspect fully and successfully so the film was clear and well done. It's not an original story by far, but the plot is great and it's expressed in a very universal way. Direction: 3/10 Awfully directed in my opinion. I hate hand held camera's and the shaky- cam in this film was over used to death. My biggest hang up of this film over all is the lack of violence. Yes, I understand that to appeal to the wider audience they had to cut back on the gore, violence etc. But in my opinion they went too far. Rue's death wasn't half as impacting as it should have been, neither Cloves', Cato's, Marvel's or even Peeta's injury. They held back and the film greatly suffered and lost the majority of it's impact, stunting the story and the cohesion of the film as a whole. The directing wasn't a one because when the directer finally put away the shaky-cam for a moment the shots were nice and decent, but most of the action, albeit had to be re framed made little or no sense- case in point- Clove tackling Katniss, the actress Jenifer Lawrence had a good six inches from the angle of the camera over Clove, and with the obnoxious unrelenting of the camera movement I can give no reasonable explanation to how that little girl over powered Katniss. And when Thresh killed Clove I had roll my eyes at the blatant awfulness of the death itself. I'm not a gore hound, I admit, I might be biased: I like violence, but this film's sequences are barely coherent and sadly really ruined the viewing experience. Overall I give this a six. Not an awful film by any standards. And maybe a re-viewing of the film again with more attentiveness on my part it could be better, or it could just be the sheer audacity of the producers to cut away much of the impact of violence ( a huge theme, I might add) for more profit revenue. Thank you Hollywood. But hey, the sets were pretty and the effects were good, well, all except Katniss' barely flaming costume.Over and out.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

So, here's the good news to all fans of the books, the movie is a success from start to finish. Set in a strange world in the future where the Capitol selects a boy and girl from twelve districts, and they are forced to fight to the death on television, Katniss Everdeen has volunteered to take her sister's place in the latest match, and might take the biggest challenge of her entire life. Jennifer Laurence delivers one of the best performances of her career as Katniss, bringing the perfect mixture of sharpness, cleverness, and powerful enthusiasm to the big screen. Josh Hutcherson is also really good for his performance as Peeta, a contestant who remembers Katniss, and Liam Hemsworth as Katniss' oldest friend. We also get some stellar performances by a remarkable casting ensemble. Elizabeth Banks as the director of the District 12 group, Stanley Tucci as the games' ringmaster, Donald Sutherland as the evil president, and Woody Harrelson in a nomination-worthy performance as a previous Hunger Games champion with a taste for the drink, are all just brilliant in their own special way. Yes, this movie is 142 minutes really long, but you will be entertained a lot by this movie, you won't care if this movie takes forever. Director Gary Ross makes the perfect accomplishments to keep this movie relative to the books. Stellar art direction, enchanting costumes and makeup, and breathtaking visual effects and sound, help you get captured in the wonders of this movie. But most of the credit has to go to Jennifer Laurence, in her winning and powerful performance in this movie. Whether you're a ""die-hard"" Hunger Games fan, or if you never read any of the books, ""The Hunger Games"" is still an entertaining ride from start to finish that has everything to offer from a talented director, wonderful visuals, and a breakthrough performance by Laurence. This is the best movie of 2012, so far! ""The Hunger Games"", in my review, ""a groundbreaking feast, what a journey!"".","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have read all three books by Suzanne Collins several months before, so I know what will happen already. Despite this knowledge, I remained excited and riveted by how the details of the story had been translated on screen by writer- director Gary Ross.The first hour was dedicated to the events preceding the games, as the last hour and a half depicted the games themselves. This movie was the story of a future world, in a country with 12 districts controlled a central Capitol. Every year, they would commemorate the revolution by staging a ""Hunger Games"", where two tributes from each district would fight to the death until only one remains the victor. On this the 74th Games, the tributes of outlying District 12 would be Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutchinson) and the central heroine of the series, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence).I could say really that this movie was practically how I imagined the book while I was reading it. I guess you can also say that Suzanne Collins' description of this non-existent world was so vividly cinematic to begin with. First rate special effects were used to bring essential highlights of the book, such as the ""girl on fire"" costume and the control room of game-master, Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley). However, credit should also be given the intimate scenes that did not rely on any special effect, but the sensitivity of the actors themselves. These were also well-executed, albeit sometimes bordering on cheesy (although that was how they really were described in the book!). Overall, I would say this movie achieved that rare balance between book and film interpretation. Fans of the book and those who never read the books both would appreciate the characters, story-telling, the set design, art direction and visual effects. This is a must-see, and sets up the upcoming sequels as there is no doubt they will also produce the next two books, ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mockingjay"". Well-recommended!","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

I thought I'd see some lame movie for teens, but I was pleasantly surprised. I saw the movie WITHOUT having read the books first (I think you need to judge a movie on its own, not versus a book. Just like any another movie).The concept isn't that original throughout time, but it is original in this setting. Put some people in a cage, and the last man standing wins. First time I've seen that idea with children though. The acting was great. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job, and so do other actors.Even Lenny Kravitz delivers a good performance. The main plot seems (as unlikely as it sounds) believable. I had heard about horrible and gruesome details, but that's just wrong. The makers don't hide that children die, but they don't show it in a gruesome way either. The camera-work and overall directing of the movie are really good as well. But, there are some issues. The entire movie just seems to short.A longer movie (or possibly 2 parts) would've been justified. The love subplot is unbelievable. At least in the movie. And, the movie seems to go a bit downhill near the end. So, conclusion: good movie, but not great.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie is so much like the book it's scary; even minor details, like the character's appearance, are faithfully included. Jennifer Lawrence was an incredible pick as Katniss, pouring her all into a heartfelt performance that made me cry at times. And Josh Hutcherson was a find - he portrays Peeta accurately as a caring, compassionate individual who fiercely loves Katniss. A warning: while Katniss and Peeta's romance is included, it's definitely not the forefront of the story. But what takes the movie to the next level is the supporting cast. Stanley Tucci is exactly how I thought of Ceaser Flickerman; he pulls off the entertainment personality flawlessly. Elizabeth Banks is almost the comic relief of the movie as Effie Trinket, and Woody Harrelson almost unnoticeably sets the tone for the movie as Haymitch. The actors really make the movie what it is, pouring their all into their performances and giving depth to such a politically poignant movie. While it is pretty violent, the end result has me counting the days until ""Catching Fire"" hits theatres!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Like an episode of Bear Grills meets the running man, I have mixed feelings about this one. Whilst it undoubtedly has its moments I cannot overlook some of the more annoying aspects of the film. Specifically the jerky camera thing, I assume this is some kind of ""technique"", if that technique is to make its viewers feel sick then bravo! It worked. Woody Harrelson has a great knock about role, but I wasn't sure what his motivation was, he seemed to swing from useless drunk to ruthless realist, I didn't get it. The ridiculous female character who picked the names, what was that all about? What was her role? Too many questions, not enough time, even in 2+ hours. Anyway, despite the daftness of the plot and the lack of charm or warmth from most of the actors I still quite enjoyed it - after all I do like Bear Grills and The Running Man, so there you go.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Katniss's thoughts are what drive her characterization and it's through her that we grow distaste for the Capitol/Panem. If you take out her thoughts, you may as well not bother making the film. Yes, having voice-overs in a movie becomes draining after a while, but not when those voice-overs actually link you emotionally to what's being depicted. Katniss's dialogue, (important when it comes to talking with Peeta) does not deliver enough during most other parts of the story. The Katniss on screen is just a shallow representation of the book's Katniss. Without her viewpoint, Prim, Rue, Cinna, Haymitch, and even Peeta are pointless. You just see people moving on screen.I don't feel pity for the districts nor for the tributes. Death in the movie, in the end, is just death. But in the books, each death furthered hatred towards the Capitol and President Snow; you want to destroy them and you want Katniss to win. It was that desire that makes the series so endearing and addictive.The visuals were okay, though. As was the acting. And the countdown was exciting. The costumes, however, were too bizarre without the explanation for them. And the climax was abysmal.It was just lazy, and laziness is easy to spot in art.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The lead actress gives a wonderful performance as a courageous teenager who is determined to survive without becoming depraved. This movie in some ways parallels the Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger, except here the characters are more nuanced and the heroine much more vulnerable, making her surviving that much more impressive and dramatically compelling. The supporting cast is excellent too and includes a composite of characters that are both amusing and repellent.

True to the spirit and very premise of the show, after cancellation it emerged through word of mouth and a widespread underground movement to become one of the most popular DVD collections ever. Universal Studios then acquired the rights to produce the movie Serenity in 2005, concluding the arc of the story and initiating Mr. Whedon to big screen directing. Nowadays the one season series runs almost continually in syndication on cable.This story is reminiscent of the first Star Trek series, which was also cancelled (if somewhat less rudely) by clueless executives in the sixties, going on to become one of the most successful movie franchises ever. Ironically, Firefly offers sort of an anti-Star Trek narrative, where the corporate establishment that the Federation glorifies has now become bad guys and the heroes are essentially anarchists and criminals. Likely this is symptomatic of a collective loss of faith in the promise of unending technological progress and the corporate American Dream. Personally I hope that it indicates a resistance to the virtual assimilation and homogenization of the social commons by the Borglike marketing spheres of vast networked entities like Facebookistan and Twitter.The quote, ""I aim to misbehave"", is one of the key lines spoken by pirate captain Malcolm Reynolds before he leads the forces of the the Alliance into a deadly trap to expose the secret that allows them to maintain absolute control. It expresses the spirit of contrariness and rebellion better than almost any phrase I can recall spoken in the movies. I've decided therefore to establish a personal commemorative to honor any movie or television show that embodies the subversive spirit so well portrayed in Firefly. To this end, the first award goes to The Hunger Games, a film by director Gary Ross (Pleasantvulle, Seabiscuit). In a recent interview on Elvis Mitchell's show, The Treatment, Mr. Ross speaks about his interest in exploring societies where a select few exercise disproportionate power without consensus (the 99 and the 1 percent) and how single acts of morality can cause the tenuous fibers of that culture to unravel. I saw the movie the other day, not without some apprehension. Judging by the number of cover stories on the magazine racks of my local grocery store, it was the most hyped movie since Avatar, and it appeared to be geared toward a younger audience that flocks to movies like Harry Potter and the Twilight series of vampire melodramas. Not only was I more than pleased with the movie itself, I was gratified that such intelligent storytelling is going over big with an up and coming generation. The Hunger Games worked for me on many levels. The story is a finally crafted arc where a young and very believable heroine named Katniss Everdeen (embodied with strength and intelligence by Jennifer Lawrence) grows beyond her narrow focus on survival to discover the boundaries of her own ethics and morality. She lifts it proudly in the face of a brutal spectacle in which she is risks everything. Supporting the lead performance by a fine group of young actors are veterans like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson (particularly good as a game survivor and mentor) and Donald Sutherland. Although the movie is set in a high tech future the special effects are largely understated and never come to dominate the performances. Most of the narrative takes place in the woods of an Appalachian wilderness (it was filmed in and around Ashville, North Carolina) reminiscent of the Michael Mann film of The Last of the Mohicans. Unlike many sci-fi epics, The Hunger Games keeps its focus tightly with the point of view of particular characters. Through mostly close-up footage we witness the world narrowly through the eyes of Katniss and thus are taken along on her very personal journey. Outside and against the point of view of Katniss' we see the spectacle from the standpoint of those who work the machinery. In a single notable exception that breaks us out of this closed circle we get a short glimpse of people rising up in response to an act of courage and honor to express rage and quickly repressed rebellion. The scene is effective and memorable as it exposes the thinly fraying threads of brutal control that an act of individual courage can potentially unravel. The spectacle itself is portrayed as a cross between a television show like Survivor and a modern broadcast version of the gladiatorial arena. By juxtaposing the brutality spawned by the Roman Empire with the presentation techniques of contemporary television (only the costumes and hairdos would seem out of place) we see the dark side of how modern media becomes the primary vehicle for social control. This is the reality of network television. At the end of the movie we are left with an acute awareness that beneath a very thin veneer of temporary media satiation large forces have been triggered by an act of moral courage. The story is only beginning. Although I've never read the books, I can't wait for the sequel.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Only obtaining some minor information beforehand apart from The Guardian's review, I was prepared for anything.What I got was a well executed blockbuster.In a bit more depth, The Hunger Games was well acted and put together, unlike so many other films on the market today. The plot-line was heavily similar to Koushun Takami's 'Battle Royale', one of my all time favorite novels, however, until the day comes that it gets a GOOD film adaption, The Hunger Games makes a good substitute.In order to keep the age limitations down to a minimum, it was obvious heavy camera shake was employed, although, in some circumstances it made me doubt the sobriety of the cameraman. Also, this focused the story more on survival and love elements, which were pulled off reasonably well. However, despite its 2:20 running time, I felt some characters were really just placed to die, and I found I didn't care for them due to lack of character development. I reckon The Hunger Games would probably benefit more from a mini-series, but as I said, all round, It was all very slick.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Enter the movie. Since most movie adaptations from books are worse, I initially didn't have very high hopes for it. The fact Jennifer Lawrence was cast didn't ease my mind either, as I have seen what big movie franchises can do to decent actresses; compare Kristen Stewart's performance in The Cake Eaters to her performance in Twilight for an instance. I rest my case. Then reports started coming in about excessive shaky cam usage. About Jennifer being ""too fat"" for the role. Key passages left out, etc. I decided to ignore all that and give it a shot. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! THE GREAT: - Jennifer Lawrence really does deserve all the praise she gets for her acting talent, because she really delivers in this. When she shoots, you believe she is a great archer, when she whimpers, you feel her pain and when she cries she seems genuinely upset. She conveys layers of emotion with a single look. I love how she doesn't have the blank stare many young starlets have. This movie rests on her shoulders and though everyone else did a good job, it all would have fallen apart if it weren't for her. And to all who call her ""too fat"" you know that if she had lost a ton of weight there would be trashing going on about her promoting an unhealthy image. Damned if she does, damned if she doesn't. For the record I think she looks lovely, a breath of fresh air in an industry populated by people as fake as those in the Capitol. THE GOOD: - Set, costumes, special effects. It looks like a different world, but recognisable at the same time. Believable. Never once did I feel like I was watching actors in costumes. Everyone seemed right where they belonged. The effects aren't the best you've ever seen, but they get the job done. - Supporting cast. All very capable actors who know how to deliver their lines. I didn't really buy into Rue's performance at her last scene, but that's a minor thing. THE BAD: - Personally, nothing about this movie is bad. Personally, they fixed a lot of issues I had with the book. I preferred Katniss & Peeta's relationship in the movie over what's described in the book. If I had to name one thing it's that I would have liked to see more of their training. CONCLUSION: -A very faithful adaption that stays true to the book without having to sell its soul. In fact, it improved upon it. Great main character, suspense, action. Definitely a favourite of mine.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was disgusted to see the hordes of gaudily painted adults crammed into the theatre waiting to be entertained by the killing of children, and realized uncomfortably part way through that this was exactly what I was doing. The juxtaposition of decadent opulence with abject poverty was obscene, yet it was nothing more than a true reflection of the extremes in our own real world. So please don't take your children if you're out for entertainment. The incidents of violence, though unpleasant, are nothing compared to two and a half hours of unrelenting dread and despair. You might on the other hand for a thoughtful discussion about the influence of media, reality TV and world economics, though if your family's anything like mine, their response is more likely to be ""Get over it Mum, it's just a movie"". There's no denying that this movie was a taster, an unfinished introduction to the series based on the books. Like it or not, I'm hooked - I can't wait to read them.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Most of the unfavourable reviews come from a tendency, which might be called - No, there isn't a chance, that a film based on a teen-bestseller book-might be - artistically good. But well, it is. A genuinely perfect scene-to-scene montage reflects the struggles of unimaginable dictatorship. As for actorship I'd like to mention Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland as making the perfect ""baddie"" image. Especially Snow's mono-dialogue about hope - which is near to Gregory Peck's acting. The trembling camera comes and goes as a feature, but it establishes a certain here-be feeling, which might've been lost in some of the terrible CGI scenes. All in all - even a literature critic, who happened not to have read ""The Hunger Games"" ""read"" all she needed from Gary Ross's sweat and blood, which took to make this extraordinary good ecranisation.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were all very good.Summary: There is an annual event whereby the capital of the nation of Panem makes sections to send a boy and a girl to compete in what is known as the Hunger Games.Televised all over the nation, the event has Tributes fighting each other until the last tribute is left standing. Our hero (heroine), Katniss, uses her instincts and skills that she learned from a former victor. It's basically the survival of the fittest.I've read the books. In the book, Katnis has clear thoughts about everything, which is kind of missing in the movie. I really wish that aspect was played up more in the movie. But given that the filmmakers ended up with a fast moving and action packed theatrical piece of entertainment, I can excuse the omission.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you haven't read the book like me, you'll find that the same popular concept has been brilliantly executed in a unique way, thereby making it special from the currently releasing movies,and hence allowing one to easily give it a rating of 8. I'd say that it is one of the very few movies where the futuristic world, though transformed with high-end technology, still has the poor whose lives aren't changed a bit.

If that notion scares you as a mother or a teen, this movie may not be for you . I personally think that while the movie doesn't leap to the level of 'saw' or similar types, its enough to have possibly warranted a R rating. I would certainly think twice about taking a teenager, because some scenes are extremely vivid.That sad, while I went into the movie expecting horrific things, I admit to being overall impressed with the take away.The harsh reality sets in as a opulent and lavishly dressed 'announcer' shouts names from a list of teens to be involved in a gruesome last-teen-standing duel. We are then presented with a short 'video' explaining why all this has come to pass , and that those involved in this 'battle' most violent, are there due to a treasonous event of their ancestors. A high price to pay for civil disobedience, though we aren't told the details of any of it.You do not need details, when its rather clear why everyone is there and the cruelty about to unfold, and I suspect those details will be present in some 'sequel'.As I sat watching, I was pleasantly surprised to see not just another gruesome violent fest, but real philosophies being presented; as in out of the mouthes of babes . These aren't all just willing participants, but in a few cases, reluctant, sometimes to the point of rebellion at great risk of bodily peril.'Players' are thrust into a environment ( after coaching), not unlike the gladiators of ancient Rome. It's quite unsettling given the age group of the people involved, but it sets a proper tone for what is to come. The innocent of youth, thrust into the barbarity of war, and those 'in charge' with their opulence and extremes, poised over their materialism to the exclusion of the safety of those about to fight.The movie includes not only great acting from a young new cast, but exciting visuals, exciting if not basic plot line and amazing visuals of a world seeming full of technology, yet some questionable morals.To consider ones death yet remain true to their nature, as well as wishing a end to the sickness , where rooting for a victor , yet sadness when a entrant succombs, are expressed sentiments.This is no pure gore fest, but do take care in taking those young adults who may need to wait a few years before seeing something so visually troublesome. Everyone else will see a movie that on the outset may seem gruesome and violent, yet inside containing questions of us all, in a sometimes world where injustice and elitism rule the day.A decent see not for its violence, but the questions asked by the participants.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I went into the film with such incredible expectations and as a huge fan of the book series. The film was good, but did not quite meet my expectations. I feel that as far as casting, direction, and effects it was pretty spot on. The way the movie was filmed added a lot of drama and suspense. I don't think a single person wouldn't have their heart pounding as Katniss raises up into the arena! I will definitely say that the movie up until the point of the Game starting cannon going off was spot on. The emotion and plot were almost exactly what were in the book. I wish the meaning of the Mockingjay pin had been explained and that Katniss' relationship with Peeta had been a little more developed. In the book she is a lot more conflicted on whether to trust him or not and in the film she just appears to not like him. Haymitch was also a little nicer than he was in the book. In the book you are never sure if he likes Katniss or not.As far as the games were concerned: it just felt way too rushed. There should have been less scenes outside the arena and more focus on developing the characters within the games. There was no time to develop Katniss' relationship with Rue or even Peeta for that matter. By the end of the Games in the book, the reader is very convinced that Katniss really does love and care about Peeta but that she's just not fully aware of it. By the end of the games in the movie you really aren't convinced she cares for him at all.The cave scenes were too short not because we wanted more romance... but because those are the scenes where Katniss' tenderness shines through and where you really get to know Peeta. The whole plot line with his leg was completely botched. He was supposed to have a gaping hole in his leg that required medicine to heal blood poisoning. He was supposed to be on death's door. Katniss' retrieval of the medicine was not as heroic if you didn't believe he was dying.Finally the ending was just not dramatic! Peeta was supposed to be bleeding to death because of a wound from one of the mutts. They cut out my favorite scene when they are lifted into the hover craft and Peeta is whisked away for surgery. Katniss goes berserk, not knowing what's going to happen to him and you are really convinced she does in fact love and care about him. In the film he doesn't lose his leg, that scene is completely cut out, Katniss and Peeta don't appear scarred or as if they have been through anything traumatic. Their reunion is nowhere near convincing that they are in love. If I lived in the Capitol... I would not have been convinced.Overall, I was pretty disappointed. Not that I need violence to enjoy a movie, but the horror of the games just wasn't portrayed convincingly enough and just hope and pray they do an even better job with Catching Fire.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The majority of scenes were silence or dubbed over with gently epic music. And, throughout, I couldn't help but feel that the whole moral premise was on par with The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE); In order to be successful, you must pander to socially acceptable rules, the way you look and are perceived are the only factors important in your social acceptance not what you can do.

I read all 3 in 3 days they were so good and so was very excited to see the movie. Its always interesting to see what view of the story the movie will take.Now I reread the book right before watching the movie and so I caught all the little changes. And yes the books are better than the movie but thats almost always the case.Despite all that it was a great movie, one that i would definitely watch again. The acting was great and whenever I read the books i will see Jennifer and Josh as Katniss and Peeta. They noted all the important aspects of the book though they didn't go into a lot of depth. Someone else commented that they didn't focus enough on Gale and Peeta's relationship with Katniss, but to me the romance triangle was never the primary point of the book, so it didn't bother me that much. Also seeing as it was already 2.5 hours, there wasn't much they could do. I hope they split the last the next two books into two movies a piece though.Overall the effects were great, lots of action, a great story line and great actors. Loved it and will definitely pre-order the DVD :) However to anyone who hasn't read the books, I highly recommend you do so that you have a better understanding of the movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I thought was pretty damn good awesome start of the series from it's books I love it and it is my favorite. Katniss killed three people in the first movie and she was very gorgeous talented and very intelligent. Is my favorite best film of the franchise, I own this movie on DVD and Blu-ray disc. Just my Blu-ray has a better quality. I love this movie and it is the best in the series I don't think the sequels are better than this movie, I am sorry I just don't agree with other opinions saying the sequels are better they are not. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) is pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, but not better than this one and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a true disappointment, I haven't seen Part 2 yet but I hope it is better than part 1. The first movie in the franchise is evolving in a Dystopian future every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her younger sister's place and must rely upon her sharp instincts when she's pitted against highly trained Tributes who have prepared their entire lives. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. I love the challenge and the game so much. For 2. Hrs I was entertained on my seat from the beginning till end. ""The Hunger Games"" is a rare book-turned-movie that's able to live up to the gigantic hype of the book series it's based upon, while also standing out as a superbly crafted action blockbuster all its own. It's a marvelously entertaining thrill ride from start to finish that never forgoes its characters' humanity, nor does it ever abandon the strong political and social undertones of its source material. In the end, not only did this film exceed all my expectations of what a cinematic adaptation could accomplish, but it truly encapsulated everything I felt while reading the novel for the first time. I had no expectations for this film.. I thought it would be another ""Twilight"", however I was so wrong. I actually enjoyed it. The plot was incredible, the acting was sublime. Incredible film that blew me away. I am honestly honored to have had the pleasure of watching it. Definitely going down on my personal movie list :P A triumph! The odds were actually in my favor this time :) I would definitely recommend this - it was amazing, and I was obsessed with the movie and cast for a while afterward. But you should read the book before you watch the movie, but that's just my opinion ;) Jennifer Lawrence is amazing, gorgeous as Katniss Everdeen, very, very beautiful talented and sexy. She did amazing perfect job playing her character, this is the second time I memorized her in famous role. The second famous role she played was Raven Darkholme/Mystique in X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past. I heard that The Hunger Games quadrilogy and X-Men trilogy are the last movies of the franchise she will ever play. Than she will start playing in stand up alone roles. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy did an outstanding performance of acting his character. I had no idea Woody Harrelson will be in this movie and he did a job so well. This is a great futuristic Dystopian science fiction film. The people in the Capitol enjoy the Hunger Games, for them its their yearly highlight:) But for the poor people from the District it's a punishment. I did enjoyed some action sequences and clever intense scenes, like Katniss been on a tree and than climbs up the tree towards the nest and begins sawing at the branch holding it up, until the nest of venom wasps fall down and kills Glimmer (Leven Rambin) who stung too many times by wasps. It is hard to believe people would want to watch kids battle to the death, but in the Dystopian future is everything possible. This movie gets 10 by me for been a fun solid not boring Dystopian Science Fiction action flick by the novel. The Hunger Games is a 2012 American dystopian science fiction adventure film directed by Gary Ross and based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins. It is the first installment in The Hunger Games film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Lionsgate Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland Director: Gary Ross Screenplay: Suzanne Collins, Gary Ross, Billy Ray Based on The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins Producers: Nina Jacobson, Jon Kilik Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 22 Mins.

I'll break down my review because there are some elements that need to be addressed and this is the easiest way I can think of doing it. I'll do my best to not give any spoilers.Story:I don't read a lot of books but I was compelled by my wife to read the books before we go and see the movie. I thought the books were great and the story in the movie follows pretty darn close to the first book, with some elements from the second book thrown in. This leads me to believe that the second movie will not only contain elements from the third book but some from the first book as well to tie it all together. Yes the movie does move along at a fast clip which I could see it making the movie confusing for some people, but it kinda had to move fast in order to be a two and a half hour movie. It was not as dark as the books and some of the traumatizing elements that you are supposed to be left with happened so fast they didn't quite sink in.Characters: So the main characters such as Peeta, Katniss and Gale and even Effie were done great and were introduced very well. However like I said in the ""Story"" portion the movie does move along fast so a lot of the other Important characters such as Hammich, Cinna and his team were introduced but not developed very much (This may be corrected in the second movie). But the time everyone spent on screen was done very well.Directing: OK so my main gripe, the shaky cam thing was overdone. There were times when a shaky cam would be fine but shook so much you could hardly make anything out (may have been necessary for the PG-13 rating for the gory stuff). And other moments when a shaky cam is not necessary at all it was used (the reaping seen WTF?). The time when you were supposed to have your heart strings tugged on where there and did what they were supposed to but the action scenes tend to happen so fast you would almost miss it (once again PG-13). Would this director have been my first choice being his biggest movies were Seabiskit and BIG, no. He has not done a future/Sifi/action/suspense flick before. But he did the drama portions very well, but needs to work on fast moving action scenes a little more. Overall score: The movie is a solid 8 on its own with a possibility of being raised to a 9 or 10 if the subsequent movies are done right. Was everything perfect no, but the movie did succeed in me wanting more which if the next movies deliver it will be Awesome!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Importantly however, the film is given context and grounding for those who have not read the novels making it comprehensible as a story, even if you don't warm to it as a premise. Reading a novel, specifically one full of minute details which can make a large difference to perceptions, will almost always supersede the film if every detail is not treated appropriately and as a 'virgin', you get the impression that there remain some grey areas and potential plot holes, but nothing leaves you utterly perplexed. Ultimately though, you come to realise that the 'Hunger Games' is not as much about cruel commerciality than about hope and inspiration in a dystopian, empire type world. The plot becomes more sophisticated and grows on you with time. The realm itself is depicted magnificently in a futuristic, fantastical and fashionable way, the latter part being most peculiar yet still visually appealing. The usage of CGI was brilliant in highlighting the stark contrast between the dictatorial, advanced 'Capitol' and the backward, subordinated 'Districts'. Such young adult novel film adaptations are often fraught with castings of young 'hunks' or 'princesses' who are on the screen more for looks than acting but this film sets itself apart through some particularly good characterisation from Jennifer Lawrence ('Katniss Everdeen') as well as old timers such as Elizabeth Banks ('Effie Trinkett') and Woody Harrelson ('Haymitch Abernathy'), both of whom portrayed oddball, quirky sort characters which needed some thinking out of the box.Certainly, fanatics of the novels would be more than pleasantly receptive towards the cinematic adaptation but expect non-fanatics to be walking out of the film thinking 'what was that all about?' It's definitely unique and beats 'Twilight' on screen hands down, but the content still remains a touch overwhelming and outlandish for 'virgins'.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first half of the film was awesome, the gloomy atmosphere of District 12 was perfectly portrayed through establishing shots of the life around the district, as well as the set in which actual concrete elements used to flesh out the setting- made the realism of the film all the more stronger. There are, unfortunately, moments when CGI rears its ugly head to create futuristic landscapes that look artificial and lifeless, and it contrasts senselessly with the scenic nature of District 12. With that said, I do think that Ross tried his hardest not to incorporate CGI as much as possible, which I commend him for, by all means. As far as the plot is concerned, it's a bit hit-and-miss. Yes, we're all aware of the similarities between this and Fukasaku's Battle Royale, but the acting in this film felt a little wooden. The characters didn't show the slightest bit of sympathy or remorse when they murdered one of the contenders in the game, and the script was riddled with the kind of clichés one would find in a young adult novel(Yes, it's based on a young adult novel, but I digress). Furthermore, a lot of elements were left unexplained and felt quite ridiculous. But, then again, if you think about the synopsis for the backstory... I guess you couldn't expect much else. There are some interesting camera angles used to enhance the intensity of the games, which work quite well, and the brutality may not be as bloody as Battle Royale, but the emotion of the first couple of deaths are just as exhausting. I do think that once the movie hits the actual 'games,' it starts to take a nose-dive. The plot succumbs to the generic clichés that you'd expect to find in a film such as this, and a lot of the elements used to enhance the way the 'games' are played are too vague in design that it breaks away from the reality of the plot. But for what it's worth, it's still a damn good movie. It has great action, decent acting, and while the entirety of the script may not be perfect, its still entertaining to watch. Definitely consider checking this one out.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But its true. In the quest to ever lower the bar for how far Hollywood will go to grab a buck, they finally made a movie about children slaughtering each other with a PG-13 rating.How did they accomplish this? By shaking the camera mercilessly and never showing any actual penetration. In effect, its about as violent as any three stooges movie without the zany sound effects. Dogs mauling kids; either off-screen or in the shadows. Killer wasps; more shaky camera work and muddied CGI. If it wasn't for the cannon blasts signifying the deaths of the contestants, there would be no way to know what happened to most of the characters in the arena.I'm not saying this movie is stupid, its actually pretty good. Its just not a good action film and its almost too juvenile for what should be a more dramatic piece. The violence is all done off-screen or through the use of shaky cameras so there's no sense of imminent danger. The other sacrifices are ignored so entirely that there's no feeling that the main character wouldn't make it to the end. There is a scene where a friend of the main character is impaled with a spear and there is no weight to the scene or the memorial scene that follows, its just another minor character dying off screen.This movie is more of a satire on reality TV game shows, but they don't do enough viewer reaction to important scenes (as they did in The Truman Show) to really monopolize on that satire. Only one scene attempts to capture that moment, but the gestures expressed between the character in the game and the audience are lost to those that haven't read the book. If you wish to find a better satire of reality TV game shows and socially acceptable violence, I recommend the movie Death Race 2000 with David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone.The best reason to see this movie is Woody Harrelson's character of a psychologically damaged and alcoholic winner from a previous tournament. He steals the show in every scene he's in.Its good, but it could have been better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had heard of the books, but I never read them nor did I know anything about how much of a fan base it has until recently. As for the trailers, they didn't seem to really excite me; they didn't look bad, but it didn't really get me hyped up to see the movie. I'm glad I gave the film a chance, because honestly, this is probably my favorite film of 2012 so far.Now this film is directed by Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, and while he hasn't directed many movies (he has written quite a few though), when he does direct he's actually really good. And same goes for The Hunger Games; he really did a good job of bringing this story to the screen. And he's also one of the writers of the story, along with Suzanne Collins (the book's author), and they both turn in a great script here, with great dialog, great story, and great characters. And this movie really gets you involved with what's going on, even for the minor characters. When a person dies in this movie, even if they've had less than five minutes of screen time, it was kind of shocking.Speaking of the characters, let's get to the actors. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing in this film, and not just in beauty (my future wife, ladies and gentlemen), she really can act. Now I've only seen her in X-Men: First Class and in this film (haven't seen her in Winter's Bone), but this is probably the best I've seen of her. She is outstanding. And while I'm not the biggest fan of Josh Hutcherson in the few films that I've seen him in (mostly kids movies so maybe that's why, he was never really given a chance to act ever), but here he does a really good job, and he's sort of like the underdog of the story. There are also some great secondary performances by Woody Harrelson, Wes Bently, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz, and Stanley Tucci. All of them do a great job, in fact there is probably not a single weak role in this film.And the action sequences are just fantastic in this film. There's been a few complaints about the use of shaky cam in the movie, but I think it actually made the scenes better because it really showed the intensity of the situation and the chaos of it all. And this movie is violent for PG-13, in fact there are a lot of bloody moments. This isn't something you should take your kids to see, young ones anyway. The pacing was also really good, and for a movie clocking in at almost two and a half hours, it felt neither too long or too short; it felt just right.The funny thing was that I thought this movie would get boring after the first half had passed through, because I was so wrapped up in just getting to know the characters and wasn't really interested in seeing the actually Hunger Games section of the story. But it caught me off guard; not only did the second half keep me interested, it got even more and more better as the film went along. It has been a while since I've seen a movie that did that to me. In fact this is so good, that I can't really say anything wrong about it. It just succeeds in every way that it should have. Check this movie out if you haven't already. Don't worry if you haven't read the books at all, you will enjoy this movie as well. I never read them, but I may now after watching this. And yes, this is my favorite movie of the year so far.I give The Hunger Games a 9/10.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Heard of it? But of course you have, most of America and the world has not only heard of this movie but have already digested ""The Hunger Games"" with a cinematic viewing. I did that myself and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Based on Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel, ""The Hunger Games"" takes place in the future where the Capitol selects a boy and a girl (called tributes) from twelve districts to fight to the death on live television; hopefully, not the future of reality shows even though some of them have already plagued many with superficiality syndrome. In the competition, there is only one winner and the rest of the twenty-three participants will be fatally eliminated which can make any of the twenty-four participants sick to their stomach in the hunger games competition. The movie stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, she is the arching aficionado who volunteers to enter the hunger games replacing her kid sister Primrose who was primarily selected as the District 12 female tribute. Josh Hutcherson co-stars as Peeta Mellark, the District 12 male tribute representative selected for the hunger games in order for the Capitol to get a taste of that Peeta bred. Director Gary Ross does not dress for less this movie by brilliantly capturing the film's pulsating tone of its Darwinism competition and depicting a future of an oxymoron-like colorful darkness. Collins, Ross, and Billy Ray's screenplay was not a utopia scribe, but it did hit the verbal bulls-eye in numerous scenes. Jennifer Lawrence's starring performance as Katniss was multilayered and magnetic! It was dead on! Maybe wrong choice of words, sorry Katniss! Hutcherson's work as Peeta was mediocre at its best or maybe it was because the Kitty Katniss was more delicious than the Peeta White Bread. Woody Harrelson was hey bitchin' in his supporting work as mentor Haywitch Abernathy, and provided some of the best lines in the movie; so another kudos there for the film's screenplay. Other tasty supporting performances in ""The Hunger Games"" include Elizabeth Banks as District 12 spokesperson Effie Trinket, Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games' master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman, Donald Sutherland as Capitol President Snow, and Amandla Stenberg as District 11 child tribute Hue. But it was Lawrence's tour-de-force performance that filled me up the most with thespian pleasure in ""The Hunger Games"". OK, I know you have had enough of my pun tributes to this movie, so I will conclude my review. So in all, I think the odds are in your favor that you will enjoy ""The Hunger Games"". **** Good","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Heck, I can hold any camera steadier than the camera work in The Hunger Games, without image stabilization. Is the cinematographer drunk?There's a place for hand-held cameras, and for the hand-held look, such as those faux crime scene TV shows. But at least they go for a Steadicam partially stabilized look. The scenes in The Hunger Games are deliberately jerked around. It looks gimmicky, and I get real suspicious of gimmicky pictures. Plus, the wobbly image gave me a headache, along with the too loud piercing music score. The combined effect is that while you are trying to figure out what the heck is going on, you can't hear yourself think. I figure the director needs to give me some reason to watch the movie within 10 minutes. I don't need to know everything, but I would at least like to see something interesting, and have the feeling the odds are better than 50-50 that I'm not going to be wasting my time. Is this too much to ask? Heck, most movies do this in five minutes. I was looking at another movie recently, The King of Marvin Gardens. It might be a good movie, but the beginning turned me off so much that I probably will never find out. And I'm a Jack Nicholson fan. I like artsy movies. But I don't like pretentious ones. I think the reviews also play a role. I can ignore a smattering of negative reviews and the usual stupid reviews. But there are also the glowing subsidized reviews, and the naive fawning reviews by people who have never seen a truly great picture, to discount. When what's left are people who say the movie is a waste of time, and the beginning is, indeed, a waste of time, not to mention highly unpleasant, why would I stay?I generally avoid the latest hit movie, When I haven't, when I've gotten dragged in, all too often I've been miserable, and then you have to pretend you liked the movie to avoid hurting someone's feelings, even if the movie made no sense. Heck, I've sat through movies in theaters by myself, wanting to get up and walk out, but I spent my money, and surely it is going to get better, I kept telling myself every 10 minutes, but it never did get better, and when I finally walk back into the sunlight I feel like I've just spent two hours in a Dumpster. So it is a great joy, with the wonders of modern technology, to be able to just press a button and put an end to movie misery. Gary Ross, you've made some truly great movies. I am all for experimentation, directors trying something new. I'm not going to write you off. But what I did see was awful.Maybe I wasn't the target audience for this movie. When I was the age of this target audience, I saw some great movies -- A Clockwork Orange, Barbarella, Easy Rider, 2001, Blow Up, Zabriskie Point -- movies that squares and old folks just didn't understand. There was a certain perspective that viewers brought to movies back then. Perhaps young people bring a certain perspective with them to movies these days. If they do, I wouldn't even know where to get it. But I still think those old movies are classics, viewed from the perspective of cold sober reality. Another thought: Is this movie some indication of the deep seated fears of young people these days of the world to come? If so, I feel sad. I am very afraid we are headed toward a dystopian future, due to human-caused global warming. But these real fears seem here to be displaced into some weird dystopian teen-centered fantasy world. And one last thought: This is the first time I have encountered a formal FAQ explainer of a movie on IMDb covering such questions as, ""What is 'Hunger Games' about?"" and ""What are 'Hunger Games'?"" If you need someone to explain these questions, apparently even after you've watched the movie, there is something wrong with the movie. I read the answers, and I still don't understand. Perhaps it is me. I tell you what, though. If in 10 years the reviews of The Hunger Games have improved significantly, I will give another try making it past the first 10 minutes, if in the meantime global warming hasn't destroyed the environment, producing wildfires, droughts, floods, plagues of locusts and other insects, disease, famine, extreme weather, political insurrection, world war and the collapse of what we laughingly call civilization. I promise.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

You can't expect the film to be exactly like the book and if they included everything in the book it would end up being a 5 hour film. Having read the book, I can tell you that some of the things that were omitted from the book were mainly due to having to keep the film at an acceptable length. The film even got the thumbs up from the author herself, which I think says a lot right there. I thought all the actors did a fantastic job....especially the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence. She is a rising star and for good reason. For a film that is over 2 hours, you will find that it flows easily and keeps your attention. I know many people that have already seen it 2 or 3 times. I strongly recommend this film!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It lacks a presence of fear that war and horror should produce and instead develops a emotional foundation around a single character which limits the ability to display the true horror of the situation. It is fun to watch the idea of a common person become a idol (figure like superhero) and raise an league of fighters to defeat a villian. I do believe this series of movie is a cheap shot to tell this story and causes a shortcoming in the climax of the plot, silly twist that don't add creativity to the story, and a emotional depression that stigmatizes the actions of the actors. I do believe this should have been a episode base seasonal show that allowed for an expansion into the hunger games themselves and a lengthy war against the capitol with numerous battles carried out under numerous heroic figures. But, this series of films does set a stage for possible future spin offs involving the hunger games, it is my opinion that it is simple NOT the best option.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong , I did not dislike the movie but I left the theatre thinking it's an OK movie, filmed well but what's the big deal? It felt like there was so much missing.

I didn't expect much, as I believed it to be yet another boring action movie. Well, I suppose it is an action movie (quite brutal at some stages - do not bring your kids!).... but it is so, so much more! I was glued on my seat the whole time. Partly because I was trying to understand what the hell was going on, how did something like this ever happen!!! The story line is beautiful, in a very sad and brutal kind of way. The acting is excellent, absolutely fantastic! After the movies, I went home at 10pm, and I started to download the kindle version of the second book straight away. I could not wait, I NEEDED to know what would happen next. I finished the book around 5 am. Went to bed, woke up at 8am to download the third book from amazon. I finished the third book the same day. I was still flabbergasted by the story line. I went to the cinema the next day again.... I am not sure if I can describe the heart ache I felt watching the story.I just finished the first book. I was surprised to see that the movie was SO close to the written story... like they just took all of the conversations word to word from the book! The love story is a little different in the book than it is in the movie. Honestly, the dude who plays Peeta - he acted so incredibly well, my heat aches thinking about his eyes when he looks at Katniss. How did he do this? I am still not sure what the books actually stirred in my. But 4 days later, I can still not shake it off... I would have enjoyed the movie more, if it would have been less brutal - but it would not have been the same! Also at first, I felt like some characters were somehow ""fake"", take Cato for example. I thought... he was somehow unbelievable, there was nothing human left in him. I changed my mind in the finale... he looked scared.I rambling. But this is, because I still have not wrapped my mind around this movie/story line. Go, watch it. (and read the books, they are beautiful!)","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I had no idea there was a book called ""The Hunger Games"" until I saw the trailer for this film. I don't know why, but something about this movie stuck out to me upon my viewing of the trailer. Maybe it was the premise of teenagers brutally fighting to the death as a game and tradition, or maybe it was how the movie clearly demonstrates the unbreakable love between siblings. But for whatever reason, I knew I needed to see this film.I went with a friend of mine who had read the book. She assured me the book was fantastic, and she was sure I'd love the movie as long as it followed the book. After it was over and I asked her how closely it followed it, she seemed a bit disappointed. But, having no previous knowledge, I didn't find many major flaws in this film.Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic young actress. Her performance in the great Winter's Bone was remarkable, and she doesn't disappoint here either. She plays our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, who takes her young sister's place in The Hunger Games, a brutal but traditional game where 24 teenagers battle to the death while the entire country watches. The action scenes are tense and awesome, and Katniss proves herself to be an extremely intelligent player as the games go on, finding clever ways to pick off opponents. Lawrence's portrayal is really a joy to watch, as is the film itself.Look out for a decent acting turn from Lenny Kravitz as well, as well as a strong performance from Josh Hutcherson. It is these performances that make the movie special, and make it such a thrilling and enjoyable film. I cannot speak as a fan of the book, but as someone who loves to watch a good movie, I was very pleased with this one. And if you are a fan of smart, clever action-fantasies, you shouldn't feel any differently.Overall: 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I must say, it did not disappoint me. The acting was good, the sets and costume design very well done, especially in the Capitol. It also did quite a good job following the book, while also doing a good job of making it available to those who hadn't read the books. People will complain about some characters being omitted, but these characters were very minor in the overall story-arch, and were necessary omissions to keep the movie at an acceptable length. In my opinion, the only real problem with this movie is the excessive use of shaky-cam. It was quite distracting at times, and usually was quite pointless. 9/10","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was never really highly anticipating this film. I saw this weeks after it came out, with the hype already having died down. So after saying all of that, what do I get? A pretty excellent and viscerally exciting blockbuster.I think that the film does a very good job of being able to stand on its own two feet. It moves pretty quickly, but it never drags in any places. It also really does hold a lot of emotional impact. As the film goes on, we see more and more of the ""usual"" blockbuster trademarks, like music appearing especially louder in a ""sad"" scene. But it all works well. The film editing and cinematography are brilliant in the way they give the film it's tone and it's visceral excitement. A lot of people have complained about the cinematography especially, but I honestly loved it, and it's a big part of why the film worked so well.How about the performances? All pretty good. But this is Jennifer Lawrence's film. She was great in Winter's Bone, but here she develops her character in a much more fascinating fashion. I loved Winter's Bone, it's one of the best films of 2010, but I was one of the few who thought that Lawrence's performance had some weak points definitely. Here? Not at all, she manages to show her traits and her subtle emotional ticks much better. As it is, she's an actress to watch out for, and this is her best performance yet.Overall, I can't say everything in the film worked perfectly. I thought that the relationship between Peeta and Katniss was a bit forced, a bit awkward. I didn't completely buy it, then again I'm not so sure I was supposed to because I have heard book fans say they are ""faking"" it... could someone clarify on that? But as it is, this is great blockbuster entertainment, and a great film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Decent but unspectacular YA adaptation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2702516/?ref_=tt_urv","rparham","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0637916/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2012","With the Harry Potter films over and Twilight concluding soon, Hollywood has filled the financially lucrative void with its latest Young Adult series adaptation, The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a stronger than the first Harry Potter film, but is still only a decent but unspectacular film, with a lot of ideas at the core, but not quite mining them all to success.The film opens at some point in the future, where society has collapsed and the country is split into 12 impoverished districts while the control is located in the resplendent Capitol. In the past, the Districts had rose up against the Capitol, but had been put down, and as punishment The Hunger Games was born: a televised competition where one boy and one girl from each district are chosen annually to fight one another in a bloody tournament where only one survivor can go home. From District 12, Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is selected, but her older and tougher sister, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place. Also selected from District 12 is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who holds a secret crush for Katniss.At the Capitol, they participate in a series of training exercises and public ceremonies leading up to the games, groomed by Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) to create a memorable impression on the crowds whom they will rely on as potential sponsors for weapons and supplies during the games. They are also given survival guidance by Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), the last winner from District 12 who is now a lush, using his position largely as an opportunity to avail himself of food and drink. Katniss quickly proves an impressive find, and gamemaster Seneca (Wes Bentley) tries to influence President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to make a few adjustments to the games due to her, but Snow is not so taken, seeing her strength and willpower as dangerous. When the games are finally underway, in a wooded landscape, Katniss must summon all her strength and resourcefulness to survive the elements and her fellow players.You would have to have been living under a rock for the last decade or so to not recognize the Hunger Games is a cautionary tale about modern reality TV taken to the Nth degree. It is most successful when the characters are being featured on a talk show, hosted by an over-the-top Stanley Tucci, which resembles today's fluff interview programs such as The Tonight Show and Entertainment Weekly, biting satire which hits the mark. Tucci and his co-anchor, portrayed by Toby Jones, commentate and reflect on the games as if people's lives weren't in the balance, giving us a glimpse at what could, unfortunately, be our future. Unfortunately, the background of the dystopian world the characters live in is underdeveloped, leaving a lot of questions concerning how the Capitol maintains control of the people unexplored.The Hunger Games doesn't really tread any ground that hasn't already been well-worn by other works, including The Running Man, Battle Royale and more. The idea of man's inhumanity to man being treated as entertainment is certainly not groundbreaking, but in the world of YA literature, it seems, everything old is new again. However, the decision to go for a PG-13 rating dulls the film's potential edge. While it doesn't completely shy away from the violence inherent in the story, shaky camera motion and quick edits keep the audience at arm's length from the true viciousness of the concept that is really worth exploring. The film also suffers from a bit too much from archetypal characters. Katniss and Peeta are both somewhat naive, innocent and inherently ""good"" individuals. Aside from a young girl named Roo (Amandla Stenberg) who is befriended by Katniss, almost all the rest of the participants in the games are bloodthirsty jackals, reveling in the murder of the others. Most of them are merely fodder for the story's eventual parade of death, but the few that stand out are ""evil"". We can't help but root for our heroes, they are among the only relatable people in the story. As with other stories targeted at a teen female audience, there is the seemingly inevitable love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and another boy from District 12, Gale (Liam Hemsworth). For the most part, though, this is just window dressing to the film, a storyline that may have more meat in the source novel, but here lacks depth. Gale and Katniss relationship doesn't have any chemistry to it, and Hemsworth's scenes are minimal. Katniss and Peeta's relationship isn't any deeper, and several of the scenes where they begin to connect romantically are manipulative and ineffective. The two don't come across as being attracted to each other, but merely going through the motions the screenplay has laid out for them.Jennifer Lawrence, who came to notice from her work in Winter's Bone, impresses as Katniss. She provides us with a girl who is alternately strong, scared and thoughtful. She is the film's anchor, and when the Hunger Games works in its second half, it is often due to her performance. Surprisingly, the most engaging relationship in the film is between Katniss and Cinna, with their parting scene one of the emotional high points. Josh Hutcherson does give Peeta a nice dose of naivete, but he proves a tad underwhelming in the role. Stanley Tucci chews the scenery with great aplomb in his moments, Wes Bentley comes across as a man who is a bit too easily manipulated for his own good, and Donald Sutherland gives President Snow and quiet degree of menace.I give credit to The Hunger Games for addressing ideas and issues relevant to the current state of society, but the package that it is delivered in ultimately proves a bit underwhelming. With the ground- work laid, perhaps the next installment will be a stronger film and build on the base of The Hunger Games.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The adaptation of The Hunger Games can stand alongside them with its head held high. The Hunger Games is a dark, grim movie that is brutal with its violence (or as brutal as a PG-13 movie can be) and a character-driven story that is brilliantly led by Jennifer Lawrence with a talented supporting cast. Gary Ross was able to bring us into this futuristic world and the use of shaky cam was a benefit not a hindrance. The Hunger Games shows a well-created world and society with plenty of ideas of its own about violence in the youth and reality TV.

Set in a bleak future reminiscent of something from a George Orwell nightmare, we find our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, thrust into a bloody tournament called The Hunger Games, where she is expected to fight to the death against 23 other youths, all of them under 18. The whole world tunes in to watch. In the universe of The Hunger Games, this is tantamount to the Olympics, and it happens every year. To most, this is entertainment.The film is shot beautifully, the frame gritty and full of popping colors. We get down and dirty with the fighters, tributes as they are called, right down in the arena with them. It's a scary place. It's made all the more real by the outstanding performances by all, wholesome and sinister. Jennifer Lawrence is unstoppable it seems, and is destined for greatness. She is joined by other talented actors like Woody Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, and Josh Hutcherson - all of whom pour their hearts into their characters, making their presence known no matter the amount of screen time. You feel these characters are real, and that they must exist, and so the gravity of their world is felt all the more. Fans of the books won't be let down, for the script is very true, and succeeds at capturing the essence of Suzanne Collins' vision for the world of Panem.The theme of the books, and the film as well, is one of purposeful irony. Here we are, eyes glued to the silver screen, watching children murder each other. Are we to be excited when we witness them hacking each other to pieces? Even if it's a ""good guy"" kid impaling a ""bad guy"" kid? No, not at all. The film is a challenge to us all to reexamine what we find as entertainment, and ask ""why?"". What is it about reality television that keeps so many Americans tuning in week after week? Are we aware of an ever-pushing envelope? Do we make conscious efforts about what we watch, or do we simply watch what flashes on the screen in front of us. How strong is the media's alluring spin on our discernment about what is moral? I know I'm guilty.Many find the film's storyline deplorable. Why? Is it not the attitude towards the material that we should be evaluating, not the subject that the writer has freely chosen to examine? To be angry at the film's theme and content, and even its approach to the material, is outrageous. You're not supposed to find it entertaining, it is supposed to make you sick and disturbed.The film is simply a commentary of our society's disgusting love and heartfelt embrace of outrageously immoral behavior, expedited through and by the Media.The Hunger Games could have been sharper, however. It could have examined these themes even more, it could have further and more explicitly explored the totalitarian society the film inhabits. The film plays a little light on the heavy subjects, and seems to cater more towards an audience that may not fully understand the deeper message. A PG-13 audience may be simply entertained, and that would be a tragedy.Perhaps the film wasn't shocking enough, not enough to rattle the masses from their comfortable cages anyways, but merely enough to give them something to grumble about on the way back from the cineplex.The Hunger Games is a film to ponder deeply, however surfacey it may seem. There are still two more films to come, and I hope they are even more powerful than this great first installment. May the odds be ever in their favor.By TOMMY BOND, thefilmdiscussion.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They did a good job of sticking to the book, though there were some minor details they left out, but it didn't change the story too much so I think it worked for the most part. And since the main character was also the narrator of the books and you never saw anything other than her point of view, I thought it was interesting how they showed the outside world when she was in the arena. However, since the books are in the first person narrative, the emotion of the story was not conveyed as well I it could have been, but how would someone convey that without a fully narrated movie, which would become irritating? The only thing I really disliked was the close-up, camera shake style that was used. You could barely make out what was going on in the fight scenes, or even some of the non-fight scenes because they did it this way. I understand that they wanted you to understand the fight or flight stuff. And it had to be kept PG-13 so the inability to really see the deaths and bloodiness was part of the reason for the style, but really too much shaking can sometimes induce nausea! Other than that, I think they did an awesome job with it! They kept to the book much better than some movies I have seen adapted from books. My only hope is that they do not continue the nauseating camera shake style for the rest of the series. There are better ways to show the action and emotion of a scene. Still, highly recommend The Hunger Games! Enjoy!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Contains some stunning scenes and images, but also uneven","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2589780/?ref_=tt_urv","longcooljolie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20025813/?ref_=tt_urv","31 March 2012","This review is being written on the morning of March 31, 2012, when the initial hype for the movie has died down a little and the hatchet job reviews have started popping up here on IMDb.Suzanne Collin's novel, written in 2008, tells an intricate and evocative story. In broad terms, the United States approximately one to two centuries into the future has become a dystopic totalitarian regime divided into twelve districts. The governing body called ""The Capitol"" has devised ""The Hunger Games"" as a way of quelling rebellions and keeping the populace in line. Twenty-four children (a boy and a girl from each district) between the ages of 12 and 18 are randomly chosen to fight to the death in a massive outdoor arena, until only one survives.The novel triumphs because the author manages to capture a dystopian universe through the eyes of a rough-hewn 16 year-old-girl who is both the product of her time and amazingly resourceful. Since the book has had so much success and is read largely by high-school age children, it's easy to dispatch it into the ""Twilight"" category of ""fad"" fiction. Yet Suzanne Collins is an experienced, successful television writer and it shows. By contrast, even author Stephanie Meyer admits that the ""Twilight"" books are far from literary masterpieces.Now onto the challenge in filming ""The Hunger Games:"" the filmmakers have to take a story with a first-person viewpoint and tell it in third person objective. Some reviews have criticized the lack of story development into the mores of the dystopian society but they have missed one important detail: author Suzanne Collins was part of the screenplay team and was still trying to tell the story through Katniss' eyes in the best way she could. Let's face it: no matter how educated or rough-hewn they may be, a sixteen year old is just not going to have much world experience yet.""The Hunger Games"" best moments occur during the pomp and pageantry that precedes the games. To use too much detail in describing it would be to court spoilers, so suffice it to say that the images of Katniss and Peeta arriving in a chariot are stunning and unforgettable. Katniss interview with Caesar the emcee is also striking and taken almost verbatim from the book.Most other reviews fail to appreciate the great work of the Art Direction team in creating the Capitol. The exhibition hall where the interviews for the tributes take place shows a crowd layout and architectural detail that eerily mimics the Nuremburg rallies during the Nazi era in pre world war 2 Germany. Taking it a step further, the Reaping scene near the beginning shows the youths dressed in bland, demure clothing straight out of a Hitler youth rally.During the ""games"" themselves, the movie becomes a somewhat bland action thriller. This brings up another problem which faced the producers: to truly reflect the strife Katniss and Peeta faced, the movie would have had to have been at least twice as long. Katniss' relationship with Rue, one of the best parts of the novel, also suffers in the story streamlining for cinema. On top of everything else the producers also downplayed and sanitized the violence to secure a PG-13 rating.As many have also reported, the ending seemed flat but there's a rhyme to that reason: the makers are clearly springboarding to one or possibly two sequels. Still, if you're on the fence about whether to pay $11 to $13 to see this in theaters, just go. ""Hunger"" is good cinema, with fine performance by all the principals and a movie that in the end asks a disturbing question: ""Is this what we're heading toward?""","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Apart from some good acting by the pleasant looking Jennifer Lawrence, whose character development this movie revolves around, there is not much to commend in it. A shaky, inconsistent and incoherent plot, only a couple of good dialogs and jerky action scenes are what characterize it. There are no really good ideas in it, and a couple of very bad ones. The first bad idea is that a contest in which all but one of the participants are killed by the others can be called any sort of 'game' by any stretch of imagination. The correct term is clearly 'war' if the movie is to be taken seriously. (Perhaps in the post- postmodern dystopia words have entirely new meanings, or totally hazy meanings.) The idea that games can be a substitute for war is a good idea, but only if these games are not fatal, or are fatal only exceptionally. The other bad idea is that children are forced by lottery to participate in this death contest (notice that nobody volunteers, and the only exception is also motivated by the desire to save her sister). This is similar to the 'archaic man's' (Jung) worst habits of trying to please the gods by ritual human sacrifices that were almost never voluntary. The popularity of the Hunger Games books and now this movie could be that it stirs that archaic visceral excitement of seeing people being sacrificed as tribute or to please the powers that were presumed to be, so that those powers (gods) give the cult, community or tribe a bountiful harvest so that they don't go 'hungry'. Let me bring some rational balance here by pointing out that these archaic practices did work in exceptions, and only if a powerful person of the community sacrificed something voluntarily with a pure heart and impeccable motive. In all other cases, it was a perverse ritual that had bad consequences for the community, but which was not to be realized by the perpetrators of the ritual. Does watching this movie ring a bell?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I believe that's saying quite a bit considering this young decade has already provided us with films such as Inception, Black Swan, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Artist, and of course the 2 Part Harry Potter finale!Honestly, this film was fantastic. Incredible cast (Jennifer Lawrence has such amazing range and beauty), hard hitting emotion, and some really great adaptation choices. It's such a skillful adaptation of the novel's story of sacrifice and survival and does a fine job of retaining the novel's themes and satirical statements against violence, reality TV, etc while at the same time providing entertainment and genuine emotional impact. Oh how I wish all films were like this.All that being said, the film is not completely free of flaws (frankly I have yet to see a film that is though) however and there were times when I wanted to strangle either the director or cinematographer. The much discussed shaky cam is completely inappropriate at times (like before the games start) though quite effective at others. Also on the visual side of things, for a film that is going to rake in so much dough, some of the special effects could have been better. Oh, and yes, of course some things in the novel were left out but I think the film would have dragged if they had focused too much on life in the districts and not condensed the games a bit. On the other hand, as I said there was some really great adaptation decisions which fleshed out the novel in certain ways and made the film work even though it wasn't all first person POV like the novel. Also quite frankly I think a lot of scenes play out better on screen then they read, so I think the film is more then deserving of Best Adapted Screenplay consideration and maybe even Best Picture. Other award consideration should go to Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress, Woody Harrelson for Best Supporting Actor, and James Newton Howard for Best Original Score. Possibly Art Direction and Costumes as well. All I've got left to say is after this year's fiasco of virtually ignoring the fantastic final chapter of the Harry Potter saga, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences better take notice of this one; this is blockbuster film-making at its finest!For a richer experience you'll probably want to have read the novel though!","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

We all found them exciting, frightening, involving and above all, thought-provoking. I took them to see the movie without desperately high hopes because I usually find films of books I enjoy to be unrewarding or even just boring.Instead I found myself drawn in to the film. I thought the production - in particular the camera-work that has been criticized by many - was excellent in the way it drew me in to the scene, to the chaos, panic and fear that surrounds so many of the characters.As the film moved on, I became aware that there were points where other audience members were laughing - points that I found very serious or moving - and I began to realise that maybe as a movie in its own right it wasn't quite hitting the mark. Because I already know the characters and what moves them I was seeing things that weren't really there.After the film finished, this feeling continued to nag at me. Taken on the surface (as many media writers have done) this is a brutal film about children killing other children. Only once you are immersed in the characters and situations as they are drawn in the books does the real meaning of the stories become apparent - the themes of love, the corrupting influence of power, the bonds of family and so on. I felt comfortable reading the books to my kids because we could talk about these themes and see that the event of the Hunger Games is really just a device to explore them. I don't think the film really gives you that picture.In the end, I think Hunger Games is a good, faithful rendering of the storyline of the book and I really enjoyed it, but it fails paint the characters and the situation as well as it could. The unfortunate result of this is that it risks becoming the very thing it aims to criticize - a bloody circus.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games is not just a movie of action and romance – it is a movie about survival of the fittest. The Hunger Games is about who can outwit the others. The Hunger Games is about finding your true self. But how can one find their self in a brutal attempt to please the one nation that created the games – The Capitol and the ruthless dictator of all time President Snow (played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland).With an all-star cast, directed by Gary Ross – who brought us Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, interwove the world that Suzanne Collins created. From Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) to Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) to Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to Cinna (Lenny Kravtiz), this movie defied all odds.I have nothing negative to say about this movie, it was a movie that will stand up against one other movie this year. A movie of a test of time standing still for one immortal girl, one immortal boy and clan that will have to meet their end in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2.But for The Hunger Games, thank you Suzanne for sharing your world with us. Thank you Gary Ross for your excellence in movie making. And thank you to the cast – you outshone and maybe just maybe in Catching Fire we will see more of your brilliant work.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Her husky but feminine voice is enthralling. She carries the movie. Even though she's not a classic beauty she has a certain look that attracts the eye. But there is plenty other talent to entertain as well. Not having read the book I was surprised at who wasn't chosen to go to the competition from her village. But as the story unfolds its understood that it's being set up for a sequel. The sets and the futuristic setting is a nice add to an old story line. Some reviews have said that the story doesn't pay homage to the village starvation that the book spoke to. I think it's pretty evident but it's not dwelling piece in the story. I got the point well enough and don't think it was necessary to emphasize it more. There could have been more character interaction during the training period to set up the bad relations between contestants during the contest. The time does fly and I would have never guessed it was over two hours long although I did have to bow to the Big Gulp in the later half of the movie. Dehydrate before you go.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I started reading the novels a few months ago when I first heard about the films and I have loved all three of the books, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. Now before I go onto the review I need to go over some of the preconceived notions about the film and books going around in movie reviews and the internet. The first is that the books and film are a rip off of manga series Battle Royal. For some reason fans of the series thinks the manga is an original idea when it isn't. I've read the manga. Years ago my older brother introduced me to the manga series. I enjoyed it for what it was a violent manga with great action, but not much else behind it. The story was lacking and so were the characters. As for the originality of the series it takes its ideas from great books and films like Lord of the Fly and Ender's Game among others, so saying that Battle Royal is original is laughable. When are people going to learn that it is virtually impossible to find a truly original idea anymore. What it comes down to is execution, bringing your own take on the idea and making it your own. Suzanne Collins does that The Hunger Games and her series of books using an idea that has been used before and making it her own in which she created a great and dark futuristic dark world with flawed and likable characters. The second thing I hear about is how the novel is geared down tween girls and these comments from people who actually haven't read the books. I've read the novels and I'm a man and in my early thirties, and I don't think they're geared for girls in their early teens. In my opinion this is geared for everyone. It's a dark series especially Mockingjay that deals with child on child violence, children forced to sell their bodies, war and torture among the other themes in the books, so saying the novels are truly geared for teen girls is just wrong. Finally we have the comparison to the Twilight books. For some reason reviewers and the public and general are overstating the romantic element in the novels and the so called love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peete. It's nothing like Twilight, which I tried to read but couldn't because it was really bad. First of all unlike Twilight some crappy romance isn't the main driving force in the novels. Second there isn't a love triangle especially if you've read or have gone on to read the other two books. It comes down to Katniss and Peete. Collin's made that pretty clear in the novels. They are after all the two most important characters in the book. Katniss who will do almost anything to survive and the kind hearted Peete who doesn't want to let the Capital to change him and the confusing and growing relationship between the two. All right I'm done with my rant. I really got to stop surfing the internet or going to certain sites, and now onto what I thought of the film.As I've said I've read the novels before seeing the film, but I'm not one of those people who'll penalize a film if it's not a perfect copy of the novel. The Hunger Games film adaptation is a great film to put it mildly, but in my opinion it's an excellent film. The best I've seen in recent memory. I think since Inception a few years ago. I won't go to in-depth into the plot of the film since it might spoil the film for those who haven't read the novel. It takes place sometime in the distant future after some kind of world war/disaster which caused the collapse of the United States and North America, and what rose from the ashes was Panem. Panem has a president but it's more of an empire then a republic. Years before the novel the thirteen districts of Panem rose up against the Capital but lost with the destruction of district 13. After the war the Capital forced the districts obedience by holding annual games in which a boy and girl from each district from the ages 12 to 18 are randomly picked and forced into game/reality show in which they children must kill each other and there can be only one winner. You don't need to read the books to enjoy the film as it's pretty easy to follow. As for the film adaptation of the book its stays pretty close to the book. There are a few people cut from the film. The mayor's daughter Madge Undersee and Peete's parents cut from the film. I shouldn't say they were cut since I don't know if they were edited out or just not added. Then there is Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who they didn't wasn't introduced in the film like he was in the movie. I didn't mind the small deviations from the novel and I liked what they added in place. The added a behind the scenes take on the film. Showing the head game master Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as he views the games along with his interaction with president Snow (Donald Sutherland).Sadly there's a word limit for reviews here. If you want to see my full review go to Movieweb.com and look under the name Huntsman. Otherwise this is a great film and should be seen by everybody.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

This promises to be an outstanding new series of films (with 3 more on the way), that although quite dark in context, is suitable for a wide audience. And for people who are worried about it being aimed at teenagers too much, (what with the love interest of the main character, Katniss) they do not need to worry- it is portrayed perfectly and not in any way overdone- the story is believable and it all plays a part in a much deeper plot, that will leave you ruminating about this fantastic movie for days after you have seen it.

You just cant put the book down, and when finished, you just feel the need to read them again. Like all the other fans of the book; I was super excited to see the movie, and I loved it! But! If you want to see the movie, you should defiantly read the books first, you will understand the costumes, sets (background),characters and dialogue more if you do, otherwise it may not make a lot of sense. The 'Shaky camera' was just to create the illusion that you are running, in the arena, with Katniss. When we are running, does our vision stay perfect? This movie (and the book) is raw; it faces the facts about reality TV, and poor human treatment. The cast is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence does a fantastic job at bringing Katniss to the big screen; opposite other skilled actors and actresses. Even the youngest of the cast; Amandla Stenberg, and Willow Sheilds do a great job in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Hunger Games, and am thankful that it is very true to the book! Read the books THEN see the movie; trust me!You will love and enjoy the movie more if you have the knowledge from the books. And now! I must be off! May the odds be EVER in you favour. and remember! Manners! And... THAT IS MAHOGANY! ;) :) xoxoxo","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The action scenes were good, although I wish there was more, especially with the contestants fighting each other. One thing I didn't like about the movie is how the people in charge of the game were involved in the game itself and trying to manipulate how the game goes. Like starting a fire and unleashing beasts; what's that all about? I just wanted the contestants to fight without any help and influence from the people in charge. Other than that, the movie is pretty good and you should definitely watch it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The major problem for me is I have seen Battle Royale and for me that is the same concept, but executed more efficiently. The problem with the Hunger Games is that it takes almost 70- 80mins before the movie kicks in. If you want a quick thrill ride this is not it, I understand its part of a trilogy but the idea seems to be a carbon copy of battle royale with its own spin.I have seen all the Battle Royale films and even the Condemned with Steve Austin is very similar to the Hunger Games. I guess if you have seen those don't bother watching, but if you haven't then the hunger games will be fresh and new for you.But for me it seemed like watching a movie I had already seen before.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What they cut made sense, what they added made sense. But most importantly, I watched something that worked as a movie, not just as an adaptation. Imagine my surprise as I was leaving the theater pretty satisfied (I'd give it a 8/10 at that time), and hear someone comment that it was ""pretty boring, and there are still two others to come? What will the movies be about if the games are already over?"", and I realized how the movie might come across to some people: an action movie with a sexy female hero and typical cartoon villains trying to kill her. But that was not the point of the movie at all. It's not a story about Katniss (the main character), violent games and romance on the side. It's a story about oppression. And a pretty good one at that. The Capitol creates the Hunger Games with the objective of ending rebellions before they begin. They make the twelve districts remember, each year, how powerless they are to act against the capitol, and also makes the districts hate each other instead of the capitol by making one district's teenagers kill the other's. Then Katniss comes and semi- unintentionally turns the system around by starting to bring unity to the districts instead of distrust, and at the end of the movie exposes how fragile the whole system actually is.""Do you know why we have a winner? Because the only thing more powerful than fear is hope. A small spark is fine as long as it's contained"" - That quote by the ""evil"" president Snow summarizes the premise of the movie. Katniss is that spark; she knows that rebelling won't end well for her and her family, but she still ends up accidentally (or is it?) bringing hope to the districts by showing them that they can, indeed, fight against the capitol - whether she wins the games or not is incidental. And that is why this movie, actually, this story, is genius. That was just on the story part, though. I have seen a lot of people comment on 2 things (aside from the boredom from lack of action thing which I already commented about above): the shaky camera and the ""horrible costumes and make up"". The camera is indeed shaky, but the friends that watched the movie with me didn't even notice it; I only noticed it because I was looking for it (read too many reviews before watching it). If it bothers you that much, then I guess you won't like it, but your mileage may vary. As for the costumes and make up, it's supposed to be like that. That's their fashion sense. The book emphasizes that for Katniss, they look hideous.Another thing that I found rather interesting were the people saying that Cato and the Career tributes (tributes who train their whole lives and volunteer for the games) were bad because they were just typical bully evil jerk villains. Villains? Were they? Out of the 24 tributes in the arena, who all have the same goals, to kill all the other tributes, some are considered evil and some aren't? This is exactly what I was talking about when I said that some people missed the point; the fact is that the villain wasn't the other tributes, the mutations, etc. It was the capitol, and the fact that many people forgot about the capitol and just took the other tributes as enemies just proves how the scenario described in the movie is not so unbelievable as it seems to some.In the end, instead of the 8 I was going to give it, I had to give it a 10 after I saw how many people missed the point of the movie, and that made me realize the story was much deeper than I thought. If you go to this movie expecting an unending action scene with a simple, obvious plot, or if you don't like shaky cameras, you will be disappointed. This movie definitely isn't ""easy watching"", and you have to pay attention and read between the lines for it to make sense, and come into the theater with an open mind to enjoy it.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Films that portray futuristic death-matches for sport could probably be counted only in the double-digits; titles like the original ""Rollerball,"" ""The Running Man,"" ""Battle Royale,"" and the ""Death Race"" remake typically dominate this obscure corner of sci-fi.In this niche, ""The Hunger Games"" might be the most accessible film ever. It doesn't indulge on gory, graphic details the way these other films do; most deaths in this death-match are off-screen, obscured, or just plain bloodless. There's still enough roughness to emphasize the harrowing nature of the actual Hunger Games; some might even say it's better that way.It takes a good hour or so to get to the games; the film runs a good long length and takes its time to establish the story, characters, the environment, and the conflict, before getting down and dirty with everything else. The film entertains throughout; very few, if any scenes, dragged. I personally found myself well-invested in the story.And the story will be the thing worth seeing. Those familiar with Suzanne Collins' book will probably relate to the film best, as they can pick out all the fine details and understand every nuance the best. The film does a first-rate job of adapting the original story; there are many minor changes, but most of it is just like the book. Those unfamiliar with the book may be alienated from the film, though most of it can stand on its own. Characters stand out pretty well; a romance does come about that seems reminiscent of ""Twilight,"" which will attract young audiences (especially the ladies) and could be off-putting for dudes wanting straightforward fighting. Regardless, the film never comes off as sappy or pandering.My biggest complaint is in the filming; it looks great half of the time, but harsh, shaky, jittery cameramanship rears its ugly head throughout. There are three or four times where I wish I could have seen more of what was going on, but couldn't because of the photography. Otherwise, parts of the film look great and stylish, and have fine editing. I was pleased with the acting and writing; everybody puts on a quality performance. This production has some very fascinating sets, props, and costumes. For special effects, I've seen better and I've seen worse. Music is pretty nice.I'd recommend this best to fans of the book, and interested sci-fi fans. Those seeking more hardcore material can do better.4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4/5)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

If your barometer for measuring the success of Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation begins and ends with faithfulness to the source material, by all accounts it is one. If you can swing a bit of emotional transference, all the better — I suspect few who enter without a preexisting love for Katniss and Peeta will be moved by their exploits. This $78 million companion piece to Suzanne Collins' young adult novel isn't especially concerned with converting the uninitiated; it's about cashing in on a fertile franchise. Cha-ching!For the rest of you: Katniss Everdeen is a girl from District 12. In the future, America is divided into 12 districts under a totalitarian government. Once a year, at a grim lottery known as a ""reaping,"" two adolescents' names are drawn to represent each district in a televised battle to the death known as The Hunger Games. Katniss, 16, has survived several reapings, but when her younger sister's name is called, she volunteers to fight in her stead.Directed by 55-year-old Gary Ross, The Hunger Games isn't exactly brimming with angst and youthful energy. His craftsmanship is competent, but Ross puts too much pressure on the talent to sell Collins' world and contributes too little himself. Where's the scale? The novel pops with aesthetic opportunity, but Ross isn't visionary enough to really capture our imagination. District 12 is a destitute mining community that counts starvation and black lung among the leading causes of death. Show us that. By skimping on act one atmosphere, the director undermines the comparative splendor of the bizarre and extravagant capitol city.Ross routinely sabotages the emotional potential of Collins' story and setting. The reaping in particular lacks narrative punch. Ross adequately animates the flesh of the scene, but as a storyteller he fails to find the soul. On paper, a family is splintered and an act of defiant bravery instigates a Herculean trial. Ross puts the impetus on the audience to feel the weight of that choice — artistically, he renders the scene with all the gravitas of mild indigestion.And the cast — talented though its constituents may be — often feels curiously misplaced. Kudos to Ross for casting an anti A-lister like Jennifer Lawrence as his lead, but he negates any goodwill with clunky misallocations of more famous folk. Woody Harrelson sticks out like a sore thumb as drunkard slash mentor (in that order) Haymitch Abernathy. Harrelson's half- hearted take on the character plays like a spacey stoner from a bad SNL sketch. Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz are also underwhelming as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman and stylist Cinna, respectively.It feels like an eternity before the games actually get underway, and it quickly becomes apparent (this is a criticism consistent with the novel) that any illusion of challenging the preconceptions of preteen storytelling disintegrates. Granted, there's a bloody death or two, but mostly Katniss gets by with clever alternatives to direct combat — there's something distinctly Home Alone-ian about watching her drop a hornets' nest onto her would-be assassins. For Ross' part, he frames the action just inelegantly enough to obscure any offensive violence.Ultimately, what works about Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation are the traits intrinsic to the novel. A worthy premise lends a compelling backdrop to a young adult coming-of-age sci-fi romance whatchamacallit — and Ross borrows those ideas wholesale. It's all there. His is a relatively faithful transcription of the source material, and it's a shame he does so little to distinguish his version. He fails to replicate the emotional oomph of Collins' imperfect novel, and expands upon those imperfections with lazy visuals and uneven pacing. After all, when financial success is a certainty, there's little incentive for a director to think outside the box.Naturally, my complaints will carry little weight with the Hunger Games superfans, for whom this film was expensively and exclusively realized. If you count yourself among that elite group — read no further. This is your film. Enjoy it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

She's a very like-able character, but really the only one that gets any development of any sort. The action itself isn't overly gory, although it does take a level of understanding from the kids that children are going to die. I did not think they did enough to explain *what* was evil to warrant killing children in the plot. In the end, the plot is about survival and the kids got that.

By midnight, I was thinking that I had made a very serious mistake. I was beginning to feel unusually aged; I had just spent two hours sitting in a movie theater as scores of teenagers flitted by giggling, texting and composing songs. When I saw how many of them were sporting hand-painted t-shirts emblazoned with ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"", I started wondering if I should develop a taste for tapioca and begin amassing an obnoxious number of cats. ""Do NOT do this to me,"" I thought with a burning and selfish anger. ""Do NOT turn this into TWILIGHT.""I need not have worried. From the opening, THE HUNGER GAMES pulled me in and immersed me in Suzanne Collins' dystopian world. Sure, I really enjoyed the book, but it does not necessarily follow that I'll enjoy the movie. This time, I did. Certainly, there are some things I would have liked to see done differently, but overall, I was impressed. No, not this-is-going-to-go-down-in-the-annals-of-classic-cinema impressed, but I felt as though the purchase of my ticket was money well-spent.The movie stays very true to the story: Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) becomes her district's first volunteer for the government-powered, homicidal powerfest in the guise of a reality show known as the Hunger Games. When Katniss' younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) is randomly selected to compete in the games, Katniss rushes forward to offer herself in Prim's place as tribute. Katniss is then swept off to the Capitol with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) as the other tribute where they must put on a show for the glory and power of the Capitol as they fight to the death against 22 other youngsters.There is a great deal of bloodshed in THE HUNGER GAMES, but it furthers the movie's plot and does not feel as though the film team is just gratuitously spraying red paint across the screen. In fact, I had the distinct sense that those responsible for the production were toning down the movie's potential sanguinity. I had wondered how they were going to handle the infamous bloodbath at the Cornucopia, and I will say that I am impressed with how they depict such a raw and brutal scene. The use of the camera to give a distorted sense of time and vision does a wonderful job of underscoring the horror of what is occurring while not permitting the blood-letting to overpower the underlying message. At no point does the movie give the sense that it relishes the blood and the body count.I am also impressed with the actors' performances. Lawrence's Katniss is appropriately strong with undercurrents of emotion while not delving into distracting waves of angst. Woody Harrelson does a fine job of portraying Haymitch as simultaneously humorous, sympathetic and haunted. I have to give some major props to Hutcherson for his portrayal of Peeta. Reading the book, I was lukewarm on Peeta- I didn't hate him, but I didn't care one whit what happened to him. Hutcherson's performance changed that. He presents Peeta as a complex and engaging person, really giving dimensions to a character I had felt was rather flat.I do wonder, though, who signed off on the shaky-cam. Seriously. I see what you're doing there, but please stop. The jitteriness of the picture grows tedious quickly. I am not a film student, but I am under the impression that the shaky-cam ought to be used sparingly. If so, I now know why. And of course, I wish more time could have been spent on the other tributes, particularly Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Rue's relationship with Katniss becomes the catalyst for so many things on a grand scale, and it really deserves more time. Certainly, the scene in District 11 brought goosebumps to my arms, but I had also read the book.That brings me to my next point: I would recommend reading the book first. The movie cannot possibly include all of the nuances, all of the character development, all of the implications of what is occurring. However, without understanding the depths of Collins' world, it can be difficult to fully appreciate the movie. For me, reading the book meant the difference between ""well, this is an entertaining movie"" and ""wow, I would definitely see that again"" (which I did, just in case anybody cared to know).In the end, THE HUNGER GAMES is a very engaging, very satisfying movie and definitely is worth a watch.

I saw this movie on its opening weekend, it was a great film, that had it all. It has a phenomenal depiction of Suzanne Collins' futuristic world that is post war. I would suggest this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it.The relationship between the book and the movie is actually pretty similar. If you have read the books and liked them (like most movies based off novels) you will love the movie for sure.Lastly Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job as the lead. The characters themselves were not developed as much as in the book but other then that it was still a awesome film and everyone should see it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Well executed futuristic dystopia tale, albeit an unlikely scenario","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2604108/?ref_=tt_urv","MartianOctocretr5","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8046532/?ref_=tt_urv","29 April 2012","Like any blockbuster movie with a futuristic dystopia theme, this one will have its hard core fans as well as equally passionate detractors. The one thing you can count on from any movie of this ilk worth its salt is that there'll be plenty of discussion--both on the positive side regarding its imagination and vision, while being vulnerable to ridicule about where it's over the top and unrealistic.The vision is impeccable: a brutal government rules with unilateral control over a meek, broken, and battered proletariat. This was the result of a failed rebellion 70 years or so earlier, to the misfortune of the contemporary citizens. The government insulated their future control by rendering the rebels to little more than submissive, powerless slave colonies. Their ultimate symbol of their unquestioned authority was to force each of the 12 colonies to send two young people, through lottery, into a free-for-all challenge to the death. Only the last standing fighter would be allowed to live, in this apparent reference to ancient Roman Gladiators. Not an exact parallel, however; this challenge makes the Romans pale by comparison: it pits children/teens against one another, and no quarter is ever given. Kill or be killed is the only rule.The story depicts the central government as something akin to the self- indulging phonies that Alice met in Wonderland. Fashion styles that would make the 80's punkers blush or laugh; hair styles that were even sillier. The inevitable mockery and finger pointing of modern society is not left out, usually expressed in the forms of technology, weaponry, communication, and social behavior. The arena-style presentation over television for a population of passionate spectators is a prime example of this. If taken at face value, the artistic point is clearly made through these exaggerations. The absurd styles seem unlikely (we're moving away from that, not towards it right now), but watching violence for vicarious pleasure is indeed already evolving in ever weirder and more dangerous reality show competitions.The action of the film is appropriately brisk, and also masterfully tempered. Bloodbath scenes are measured by often being implied rather than brazenly shown for the sake of gore. This balances the intellectual moral of its dystopia message, with just enough violence to support why such a future is negative in the first place. Still, even though the movie successfully avoids overdoing the violence, the plot's idea of children killing children should give you pause before taking your entire family to see this.The acting, by a mostly unknown cast, is exceptional, at least for the actors with a character that is developed enough to give them a chance to stand out. The settings and backdrop decor are impressive, and the flow of the story is spot on. The story is told well, the characters are interesting, and the world that is imagined leaves an imprint after leaving the theater. There are minor faults in the execution, but this is overall, a worth while film to see.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

After seeing a few previews months before its opening date, I felt it was going to be a different type of movie. One that we have not had in a good time. Now after I make my mind up on if or if not i will go see any movie I stop looking at previews and I do not look at the cast and crew. I feel it takes away from any surprise the film makers may have install for viewers. So now fast forward opening day I go online at 7am to check show times and they are sold out off all times in pretty much any place it was showing in manhattan, mind you it's 7am and I'm looking for tickets for 10 that day and there's nothing. So now I check for the next day witch is a Saturday all sold out up to 9:50 pm . Bam I buy 2 tickets for me and the lady, fast forward I get to the movies 2 hours before the movie starts to get good seats. I'm told to come back 45 min before the show starts because that's when they will start to let people in, I come back and hour later not 45 min and they let me I and there's almost 45 people in line, OK now I'm freakimg mad, but I did end up getting good seats for us. So now the Movie is about to start and yes there's people that can't just stop talking as always. 1st few minor the movie I really liked. They way they made her and everything look was very good. Jennifer played a great roll very strong but yet not over strong, Wes also played a good roll, wasn't to over powering so it rolled into her performance pretty good. The move effects were not as good as good as I felt they could have been. I mean it is after a book I would hope it will have everything it should have to hope top off good actors. I felt there was a lil time where the movie was dragging along and as it got to the end I also felt it was a short and not as good of one to over way the beginning witch as I said was pretty dorn good. So my review is its good enough to go see it you never read the book. If you did read the book maybe ull love it or maybe ull feel it's not as the book is and won't. But no matter if u have read the book or not ull walk out saying it was good at lest.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

First-off The Hunger Games is a good film, whereby the cast are great, there is a sense of atmosphere and delivers what it promises. However, is it as good as how everyone hoped it to be? Well what is but this film has many flaws. While I can't blame a teen-oriented film for not showing the killing of multiple young people clearly, blood and everything, the director thought it would be better to zoom in hand-held camera with quick cuts so you never get a clear view to avoid offending its audience and receiving the 15/R rating. The overall effect is distracting and cheapens the film. If you intend to show something, then show it! The film's half-hearted attitude to the violence felt indecisive, not sure whether to stay true to the books or to make something family friendly. This is a much talked about issue and there is more that could be said, however the film does have its moments. Half the running time is set before the game begins and creates a tense atmosphere as the games move closer and closer. As mentioned the cast are great and the film allows time to develop their characters. Some scenes, particularly flashbacks, did feel poorly handled though and if more time had been spent developing them, I believe it would have improved the film immensely.As it stands, the film is good, however the direction is not all that strong. The climactic fight felt poorly handled, which is a shame since it also successfully developed the antagonist. Two CGI scenes were weak and did not add anything to film. While I did enjoy it, the film lacked a certain edge needed to keep me invested in what will happen next for the characters. Looking at the box office, hopefully the sequel will build on what this achieved and make up for its shortcomings.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It took me 2 years since the release of the first movie to actually watch it - and I was pleasantly surprised. (Keep in mind, I haven't read the books, but I did have a general understanding of it.) I can't comment on the accuracy of the movie-book adaptation, but as someone that hasn't read the books - yes there were a few question marks going through my mind at some points - but overall, I felt that the movie conveyed the subject matter effectively and was easy to understand. I got the general sense of the movie - and I knew there were questions to be answered, but I also knew that there would be sequels to the first that might answer my questions. The acting was superb, costume and makeup absolutely stunning (the portrayal of people in the Capitol had always intrigued me) - and I saw some comments about the shaky camera...I watched this on a small screen, so it didn't affect my viewing experience. I think it was appropriate for conveying a sense of urgency in this movie and showing Katniss' perspective while not detracting too much from the movie itself.I found myself really wanting to read the books and reading up on the Hunger Games universe to know more about the world itself. If a movie- book adaptation can make me want to know more about the book, having not read it first-hand, I think it's a job well done.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought it was really suspenseful, there was definitely emotion to it. I would've liked Rue to be in the movie longer though to really grab the audiences connection with her. I don't think Katniss overreacted to her death though even though Rue as only in there for like 15 minutes. I think a lot of people would cry if they just saw a little girl get murdered for no reason in front of them. Overall i think it was very entertaining and i will be watching this again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film is excellent, still recommend to those who did not read the book in which it is based, do so because it complements, not only adding situations that do not appear in the film but also helps to understand how the character feels or thinks at certain times. The choice of actors is sublime, the best I remember at this time. In my opinion, the character of Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Caesar, Snow, Seneca Crane, Effie, Prim, Cinna, Rue, well, basically all but minor roles are well represented, although some may are not great actors. I have read some reviews that do not agree to the following, but in my opinion, the setting of the film is remarkable. If aspects are taken separately, may have weak spots, but the combination of all them transmit more than efficiently what the book expressed in words.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I tend to be able to overlook the hype. Having said that, the film lacks in a few things. 1. the plot was too forced, there were moments that could've been built up better. 2. The use of shaky camera was too much and added to the 'forced' feel of the film. This is the main problem with directors who do this. They don't seem to get that viewers need to SEE what's going on to get into the story, and it's blurry it doesn't engage them, it has the opposite effect. 3. The emotional highpoint of the film was a scene with a minor character, not when Katniss volunteered instead of her sister or the ending, which it should've been. It lacked emotion where it counted. The pacing also could've used a bit of tightening, especially the scenes in the forest. The good parts: plot was engaging and good performance from Jennifer Lawrence, and the action is not bad. All in all, worth watching but it's not what it's hyped up to be.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Discovering that the film was to be a 12A I was rather shocked and put off by the fact that a film like this could be rated that low, but nevertheless was still determined to watch it.I must say that I'm glad that I did. The acting throughout the film is superb! The emotion of the characters really gives different parts of the film distinctive moods that entices you into the film. It gets you thinking, which is always a good thing, who's going to die next and what you'd do in their situation. Although I'd say it was pretty predictable towards the end, this is still a film definitely worth every penny!I was very disappointed to hear that the bloody bits had been edited to reduce the rating (obviously for money purposes) as I am a blood and gore fan I have to say, but the story and acting indubitably makes up for this. I wouldn't have really thought this to have been a family film before I watched it, but it is one that the whole family will definitely enjoy!

""Battle Royale"" is bloodier and more brutal, and it doesn't beat around the bush. This film, on the other hand, concentrates on plot development before the actual game begins. I was getting a bit impatient for the game to begin, and for people to really fight with each other. ""The Hunger Games"" still show the struggle for social, cooperation and altruism like ""Battle Royale"" does, but on a smaller scale. Jennifer Lawrence is very convincing as a brave young woman fighting for survival. I was amazed by her in ""Winter's Bone"", and this time she amazes me again.The plot is tight but not eventful enough to fill up the 2.5 hour screen time.

The movie is an excellent _augmenter_ to the book, it is not (and is not meant to be) a replacement for the book. _No_ single-sitting movie can replace the depth that a book can provide you, and the days of the mini-series are long gone.I won't drop spoilers here, but there are certainly things (and fairly key plot points) in the book that are glossed over, or eliminated entirely. That's a sad point, and will leave the non-book readers wondering what all the fuss is about.Bottom line - READ THE BOOK FIRST and you will LOVE the movie.

I liked some changes in the movie better, some of the differences in the book better...It was pretty obvious, however, reading ""The Hunger Games,"" that even though it's not a very long novel, the exposition in it would require a 4-hour movie to have all the scenes from the book, so I KNEW they'd cut a lot of the superfluous scenes, and they did (and most of the stuff they cut was OK to cut). My biggest issue, perhaps, is the SHEER POLITICS of Hollywood ""Blockbuster-Making."" There was more brutality in the novel than they showed in the movie, and some of it I felt important to the story, but I'm certain what they cut was to get a PG-13 rating SO the movie would be available to a much wider audience and therefore SELL MORE TICKETS! That said, the changes they made in the FINAL FIGHT SCENE -- particularly with the ""wildlife"" -- were, to me INEXCUSABLE. Katniss' realization of what was going on there, and the sheer horror of just WHAT this ""Capitol"" can, and will do, was pivotal, to me. I would recommend you see the movie first, THEN read the book, and see what I mean.Flip side, they added A LOT of ""stuff"" in the movie that's NOT in the book -- mostly involving the president, played by Donald Sutherland... Of course a lot of the things he says may reflect things Katniss thought to herself in the novel. At any rate, I actually think what they did with him may have added to the impact of the story, a bit, but NOT at the expense of some of the other changes and a few deletions. I eagerly await (hopefully), an unrated ""Director's Cut"" of this movie that's 30 minutes or so longer and has more of what's missing.I might have rated this a bit higher if the final battle scene had been true to the book. Then again, there were some other things after that which weren't that I actually preferred. I'll leave it to folks who've read the book to see for themselves.I'd still recommend seeing this film to those who've read the novel. Just don't expect quite everything you may have hoped for. If you haven't read the novel, you'll probably LOVE IT. By itself, with no other context, it's a pretty great movie.Jeff Hayes","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

It is soooo convenient that the ages of our teenage warriors are exactly the same age range (12-18) as the target demographic for said teenage vampire fans. The setup on paper sounds pretty contrived: a set of males & females from 12 regions must fight to the death. As an older adult, I have skipped all those Twilight films, and never would find myself interested in this film. So why am I recommending it? Because the filmmakers were able make the story transcend the genre. This is not an easy task, and my guess it must have taken many rewrites to find themes and subtlety for a subject matter that belongs as a TV show on the CW network. Let's begin with the actual action scenes where you witness the brutal hunting down and killing of fellow human beings. You won't really find them in this film. In fact, the focus on weapons and people's skill using them is also a very minor feature in this film. Instead, the majority of the journey our protagonists go on is about relationships. Relationships with sister, Mother, boyfriend, state, country, mentors, sponsors, and rulers. We even get to learn about the relationship between the TV show producer and the country's dictator. Then there is the theme about how the oppressed are reduced to TV show idols, and are forced to perform to the whimsy of the viewing masses. The movie ""The Truman Show"" went this direction and mostly failed in it's attempt to humanise it. Somehow, ""The Hunger Games"" pulls it off. The wealthy class were deliberately cast with people with strange faces, and painted up like clowns to make them more like monsters than human.How does this film create believability? For one, the filmmakers completely immersed themselves in this alter-reality. Nothing is painted in broad strokes. Scenes of a poor community come to life through nice human moments, and keep the momentum going while making the best of exposition. Scenes requiring exposition in movies are very hard to make interesting. Again, credit goes to the screenwriters for approaching exposition in a creative way. Sometimes talking about the effect of an important plot point, leaving audiences briefly curious, then circling back and explaining why that effect happens. And how come this movie is 2 1/2 hours and doesn't contain much action? Because the filmmakers wisely avoided a cliché third act by avoiding predictability and keeping expectations fresh for the audience.My only real complaint is that the film did not need to be 2 1/2 hours, even though I bet many character subplots were cut out of the final version to make this running time. The second act drags somewhat while our competitors go through the rituals leading up to the actual game. This is the period where the players train and are evaluated, but once again little of this is actually shown. Instead we spend even more time on, yes, relationships. One of the greatest achievements in this film is the editing. Through the power of editing, a great deal of story is told in a short period of time. A friendship between two characters is established with some body language, instead of clunky dialogue. The music avoids bombastic action beats and instead evokes a folky ""human"" tone, something right in the comfort zone for composer James Newton Howard. The special effects are a minor part of the movie and don't really stand out when briefly seen.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

To make this film available for its target audience every aspect of the film had to be toned down to allow it to slip in at a PG-13/12 rating. What this means is that the possibly great fighting scenes feel false and cheap. I have read the book when it came out and i would say that this film doesn't close. most of the aspects which made the books so good are lacking here. If you are a fan of the books I would still watch this film, it may not be the full package which you would hope it to be, but that is because it is aimed at you (being the under 15 year old) who may have ruined a possibly great film.

Television still plays a huge role in this future society. Television producers are able to create elaborate fantasy worlds.For historical reasons, each zone is required to select a young man and young woman to participate in a reality show that is essentially a mutual hunt to the death combined with an escape from deadly special effects. The story focuses on the experiences of one engaging and attractive young couple from a particularly poor district.This interesting future world and the grand theatricality and drama of the ""hunger games"" are gradually revealed in a way that allowed me to get caught up in it. I enjoyed seeing how they imagined the future would look and how such a show would be mounted. The characters were extraordinarily attractive and the movie was visually appealing. The movie was fast paced and I was curious to see where it would lead.The character development of the Katniss character was good and the role was believably and well played by Jennifer Lawrence. She was the focal point of the movie (perhaps at the expense of the other characters). I ending up caring about what happened to her and there were a few places where I was emotionally affected by her experiences.Every movie has flaws though. Most of the characters were two-dimensional. Some aspects of this future society, including the technological capabilities of the show producers, bordered on the unbelievable.After looking at the discussion boards, I've discovered that this movie is part of a teenage phenomenon. Many young people see themselves as cognoscenti because they've read the books. They are explaining the movie in light of the book. It seems many fans don't want this movie to be taken at face value -- they want viewers to read the book and they want the movie to be interpreted in that light.Also, some young fans are apparently troubled by comparisons between this movie and earlier movies, between this movie and earlier cultural themes and concepts. Of course, they want the Hunger Games phenomenon (including the movie) to be seen as something fresh and new in our culture.I think we have to remember to respect the fact that a movie is a separate work of art. Books and movies are different media. The book will reveal more detail, including the thoughts of the characters. A movie is much more of a visceral, visual experience. A movie may be loosely based on historical facts or a book, but it will not be the same. And nor should it be. Hunger Games the book and Hunger Games the movie are two different things. They are approached differently. It's not really useful to explain the ""real"" story behind the movie. There is no real story. The movie is what it is. It stands on its own, separate from the historical events or book that gave rise to it. This doesn't effect the validity of the original book or historical events, of course. They can all be enjoyed, but in a different way.Also, many books and movies reflect earlier books, movies and themes that have arisen in our culture. This is a good thing and enriches the experience. Every book and movie will have to rely on artistic elements that went before. Some fans don't want this movie compared to the ""Truman Show"", for example, which was a fantastic, original movie. The movie ""In Time"" also had a future world where people were forced to live in districts with disparate wealth levels.The fans particularly don't want the Hunger Games compared to gladiatorial combat. But to me that's what this movie reminded me of, especially the chariot entrance into the stadium. It was essentially futuristic gladiatorial combat aimed at teenagers. Clearly this is what the author intended or the country wouldn't have been called ""Panem"".It didn't escape my notice that there was not much difference between the 21st century moviegoers and the futuristic audience watching the Hunger Games live. Perhaps not surprisingly, the morality of of sadistic voyeurism was a theme not explored in this movie. This movie might have been improved by the realistic depiction of gore. The violence here, despite being the core of the movie really, was of the goreless Hollywood variety. True gore is too difficult for most people to watch. For me the unrealistic violence mitigated the horror of the situation and the underlying moral point.Hunger Games seems to be aimed at a generation that has grown up watching survivor, reality and game shows where people get ""voted off"". ""You are the weakest link -- Boom!""I enjoyed the movie (but only for what it was) and would recommend it to anyone.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's an action movie with some pretty good action scenes, but the dour concept keeps it from being a fun popcorn-style action movie. At the same time, the movie didn't really embrace the moral darkness of the tale; the lead character is put in a situation where there would seem to be no possibility of not doing monstrous things, but then she manages to go through the whole movie being flawlessly pure and noble, with any problematic moral choices neatly swept out of her way.It's a good movie, and I enjoyed it, for the most part, but honestly I feel I would have been better served to have followed my instincts and skipped it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

From reading some of the more negative reviews, I think this may have a lot to do with how I feel about this movie.I found the world that this film constructed mesmerising. It immediately engaged me at both an intellectual and emotional level. Being a guy who normally has a lot of space between his thoughts and his emotions, this is a rare and welcome surprise in a movie. You immediately connect with the plight of the people in the District's and develop a curiosity as to how the city folk live. When their opulence, disconnection and disregard for other people becomes clear, your hatred for the system that Katniss, Peeta and the others have to live under becomes almost palpable. Heck, I was practically ready to cry out for and end to the inhumanity, inequality and injustice right there in the theatre and start a revolution! On several occasions I actually felt horror and upset when some of the younger characters are killed and hatred for the characters that would kill younger children with little regard. I don't think that you have to be an intellectual or political person to feel this way. I imagine the books are so popular because they tug at our own intrinsic sense of compassion and humanity and if this is the case, the movie does an amazing job of transferring that to the silver screen.The script was somewhat minimalist and fast moving in my opinion. It feels like anything that didn't further the narrative was cut. Every scene contributed something and seemed to be another important development or milestone in the story. As far as the casting is concerned - I can't really compare the actors chosen to the way that they were described in the book and as such I had no real expectations as to how the actors needed to look in order to fit the part. However, I will say that I was struck immediately by the depth of character that Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) managed to portray. I felt immediately that the character being portrayed was a rare kind of woman - a strong, determined and exceptionally intelligent leader. Lawrence's performance has an immediacy and a directness to it, verging on a minimalism which is strikingly effective and is the kind of performance that I feel is marginalised in today's world of over-acting and over-reacting in every scene.The other main part, certainly in terms of screen time, is played by Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark). Again I think this is a solid performance and I bought into the character portrayed, finding him convincing as a potential partner to Katniss as well as a key driving force in their survival. Some people seem to be complaining that he doesn't fit the big and strong description given (apparently) in the books. Personally, however, I actually find that couples that appear too picture perfect become less believable. If anything, the fact that he at times appears slightly smaller than Lawrence lends their relationship a kind of reality, in a story that is ultimately about depth of character, that I feel is far too often missing from Hollywood and its fake plastic world. Life is messy and very rarely picture perfect, and if a movie about the tragedies of death, the horrors of poverty, oppression, inhumanity and war can't reflect that then what can? By accident or design I think Hutcherson's casting is actually a good thing.I don't have time (or available word limit remaining) to review all of the other factors that went into this movie in detail. Suffice it to say that I thought every actor on the screen was excellent and delivered believable performances with real depth of character. The effects were minimal but well used and the way that the world drew on both Ancient Roman/Gladiatorial and Nazi architecture and imagery to reinforce the dystopian nature of the society was a nice touch. Overall: a fast paced film with great acting and an intrinsically moving and well represented story line. Go see it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thankfully, it was a pretty fun read, even though the books are fairly derivative, at least in regard to their dystopian theme. It's the ambivalence of Katniss that drives the story forward and keeps it interesting, so to my mind this was one of the most important things to get right in the movie.The universe of Panem, a land set in the future comprised of twelve districts and run by an authoritarian capitol, may seem a bit implausible in its literary portrayal, but the movie gets the tone and scope of the place just right. District Twelve is the home of our main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, a teenager charged with the responsibility of taking care of her mother and sister after the passing of her father in a mining accident. As if life weren't difficult enough on a day to day basis, every year the Capitol organizes ""The Hunger Games"", a duel to the death in which two tributes, a boy and a girl, are enlisted from each district to battle for survival. The event is supposed to serve as a reminder and punishment of the failed rebellion against the capital which took place 74 years prior. In an unfortunate turn of the odds, Katniss is forced to volunteer for her younger sister once she is selected for participation in the games, and together with Peeta Mellark, the male tribute of District Twelve, she heads off into the unknown and, most likely, towards her demise.The key to understanding the event itself is that it represents a piece of entertainment, similar to the gladiator fights of Ancient Rome. As the participants are groomed for a televised show, the macabre concept behind the games may be easy to lose out of sight, and it is at this point that the direction of the film becomes a bit skewed and decides to evade/underplay one of the central plot lines in the book. In the transition from Katniss' literary narrative to the cinematic transposition, her struggle with herself and those around her, in particular Peeta, loses out. As the two tributes, under the guidance of their mentor, decide to play out a love story in order to endear themselves to the public, the film's focus shifts to the more easily translatable tension resulting from the potential love triangle between Peeta, Katniss and her childhood friend Gale (who remained in District Twelve), rather than focusing on the constant ambivalence in Katniss' soul. This is particularly interesting once it becomes evident that Peeta has truly been in love with her for many years, while the question of her own feelings towards him are shrouded behind the importance of self-preservation.Therefore, it is a shame that the film's choice is to portray the situation as a love triangle, set to develop further in the upcoming sequels, rather than to investigate the implication of how Katniss feels at odds with her situation and the role she has to play, knowing that in the end there is only one survivor to The Hunger Games. It is understandable that due to the scope of the movie franchise this would be a bit harder to sell, but it undermines one of the most fascinating themes of the book, the journey of Katniss' self-discovery.Implicitly, we get a fairly limited understanding of most characters and how they relate to one another. Despite this hindrance, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, who play Katniss and Peeta, manage to infuse a lot of what their characters are supposed to be into the final print of the movie, thereby conveying at least part of what is unwritten in the script and transpires from the books. Hopefully, the undertones of their relationship will be further expanded upon in the second movie, without focusing too much on the romantic dilemma, which serves as a backdrop in the books, rather than a driving force. Also, what the movie managed to do quite well is create a fine rapport between President Snow, played with delightful and menacing restraint by Donald Sutherland, and the game-maker Seneca Crane. Their scenes shed some insight into the workings of the games which otherwise could have needed a rather tiresome narrative, while still defining two characters of interesting depth.I can imagine some of the shortcomings mentioned are less evident to viewers who have not read the whole story, which leaves them with a pretty well rounded film about a cruel world that begs for many answers - but lacks a fair bit of heart. Seeing how difficult it is to rise up to the expectations of so many interested parties when producing a film like The Hunger Games, it is fair to say that the end result is a reasonably faithful and sensible adaptation of an engaging story. The politics behind Panem, which should feature more extensively in the second movie, will be a different challenge altogether, but the set-up for the sequel is solid and should offer a large enough scope to fulfill the vision of Suzanne Collins and her rather uncompromising characters.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Then when the Hunger Games actually start, it may as well be a different film, an R rated one. It's total suspense and heart pumping at times, which is good. The shaky camera didn't bother me, as it started only when the kids were fighting and running, keeping with the tone of urgency and desperation. Jennifer Laurence is absolutely brilliant as Katniss Everdeen - which the character has many similarities to that of the Oscar nominated role of Ree in Winter's Bone (taking care of her siblings while her mother is catatonic, facing dangerous situations, never giving up and doing it on her own), and really captures the emotional turmoil her character faces.Now on the other hand, what really bugged me was that the film was too long and really dragged on towards the end, making the ending less than enthusiastic and sort of ruined the prospect of it being a ""game changer"" . Also, the film has a very interesting message and theme: Combining war with reality TV. The way the kids are exploited like they are not human beings is really horrifying, but the film focuses more on the action rather than the message and the reasons for these terrible Hunger Games. The book was brilliant, but the film really could have been much better. 6 out of 10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's difficult to add polished production to a post-apocalyptic scenario and still be taken seriously, and The Hunger Games does this so masterfully, it's especially impressive by movie adaptations of young adult novels standards. It doesn't feel the need to constantly remind you visually that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, avoiding bland color schemes by utilizing its moody vibe and lighting which the production brings to life, and relies on its characters and well-crafted story telling to remind you of what the inhabitants of the world have brought upon it, with a intelligently powerful observational message that unfortunately rings too true a bell, on how we as a race continue to do so even after the world fell apart. It leaves a diversely organic yet grimy impression on a scale of varying atmospheres, without drowning itself in darkness, and has the balls to not let up on the violence and action even though the subject actors are teenagers, as is the target audience. Making it an example for poor adaptations of young adult novels with clichéd adolescent personalities and stereotyped casting to follow. This finds middle ground in thrilling appeal, and doesn't go too soft or too hard in either respect, making it very accessible without coming across as restrained or watered down. Its engaging, exciting, and remarkably respectable when considering the quality deprived reputation of its demographic of origin.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

(Sorry that I'm being a little vague but I want to minimise spoilers as much as practicable). My greatest criticism is that the character of Rue seems a little bit rushed, and it's hard to emotionally engage with her, that being said it is still pretty well done.

The best moments of the film pretty much all involved her and she takes this from just an OK film to something pretty good (although it was a slightly sub par performance compared than her in Winters Bone, but that's probably to do with the script). I'm definitely a fan of hers. The film was fairly unique, and much better than the usual teen fair. The concept kept you interested and things definitely got a bit dark, more so than normal in a run of the mill kids film. Surprisingly, the pacing of the film was excellent, as it never really felt like 2.5 hours long, at all. I've always found that to be a good trait of a great film. I wasn't really moved by the ""big emotional scene"", because I never really cared for any of the characters outside of Katniss. There wasn't enough character development for me to feel connected to them. A bit surprising given the almost 2.5 hour run time, you figured there'd be enough time for more character development. Admittedly, it did seem to work for some of the younger kids in the audience (who probably read the book and had the background I lacked). However, the scene directly after this did hit home (for me anyway), as it really underscored the bleakness of the films sci-fi future.The hype machine on this was clearly in over drive. I enjoyed it, but it's definitely not as good as it's been touted. It was fairly predictable as the ending was never really in doubt and there were few scenes that really blew me away. Still, definitely worth watching though. http://andretms.blogspot.ca@the_movie_snob","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The government forces children into these ferocious games as penance for society uprising; to keep people in their place they sacrifice two teens from every district, parading them around to gain popularity for a world wide audience. The Hunger Games fashions style and tenacity from its vibrant cinematography, creating a futuristic dystopia where upper society strives on extravagant hair-styles and gaga esque outfits, while the lower classes wallow in 19th century living styles. Millions tune in nationally to see these teens beat each others brains out and take bets on who will become the victor. Much of the build-up revolves around how these contestants sell themselves to gain sponsors who essentially will ensure their survival, the pay-off is immense. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen shines, and adds a depth to her character that others may have lacked. The fear on her face as she enters the battle royale is real. Up to that point it's been a parade, showing off to gain acclaim, but the fun and games are over and what is about take place is life or death.The source material for The Hunger Games I'm certain is far more in- depth, and that is somewhat missed within the film. Just when we think we're going to get to know some of these characters they die, or worse yet a flashy explosion detracts from the narrative, but still The Hunger Games delivers in entertainment value, keeping you guessing who will survive and how Katniss will escape her perilous enemies within the battle yet again. Her prowess and survival skills make her a tough cookie, we learn that early on, so were not surprised when her rough exterior makes her a formidable opponent. While she's interesting to say the least, it's her counter-parts who are somewhat lacking; we barely get to know many of them before they're sent off to the slaughter for our viewing pleasure. Amandla Stenberg as the young girl Rue is also noteworthy, shedding humanity onto a film which desperately needs it. Her expressions go beyond her years as a young actress and she adds a delight to the film. Woody Harelson also has a nice supporting role, playing a drunken-tutor who seemingly has written the book on how best to survive.The Hunger Games while having a wonderful entertainment value fails to go the extra mile to ensure greatness (the ending lacks somewhat; without question they're leaving room for sequels). If anything, the only gripe anyone can have is simply wanting more out of it. Much like a helpless society, we watch people we hardly know slaughter each other, and young adults at that, we are emotionally startled at first but as things progress we become more desensitized until all we want is more brutality. The Hunger Games delivers in this regard, forcing a love angle that may or may not develop in the films to come, and creating a sense of alarm within each of us as we imagine how we would react in a similar scenario. Odds are we would do what was necessary to survive, odds are we would also have the moral fiber to question the games themselves. The Hunger Games works however. Just like the audience watching within the film, you'll have a hard time turning away.Stephen Febick, 4/2/2012","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The novel, The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, mesmerized me in the two days that I spent reading it, and by being so infatuated by the book, I prayed that the film would accentuate that same excitement. Fortunately for me, the movie did just that, and director Gary Ross used his touch of brilliance to create a nail biting film that captured the novel's themes of love, war, and hope. Although the movie exceeded two hours in length, it contained no uninteresting segments and the plot moved smoothly and efficiently. The three main characters in The Hunger Games, Katniss, Peeta, and Gale, were convincingly portrayed in the movie and the personality traits of each character were articulated and evident in their actions. As Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence was the fierce, skilled, and intelligent young woman that the book described, and the big screen allowed Katniss' character to truly flourish. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, who played Gale and Peeta, made a perfect supporting cast, and the duo helped bring Katniss' contrasting qualities of toughness and femininity to the forefront. The multiple settings of the movie were exactly what I had pictured while reading the book, and I loved how director Ross captured the desolation of District 12, the flamboyance of the Capital, and the treacherousness of the arena. Overall, I enjoyed the movie because of its realistic effects, its adherence to the novel, and its ability to keep me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. It is rare to witness a movie that forces oneself to meditate on the plot after leaving the theater, but this film involved elements of culture, politics, and morals that provided food for thought. I am happy to say that The Hunger Games did live up to its hype, and after seeing the movie, I am keenly anticipating the sequel, Catching Fire.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Then came the insane Box-Office earnings and rave reviews from most parties. My expectations, as a result, were heightened. However, for me, the hype did not match it's reality. I am not saying that it wasn't a good film, it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be and I think it was so because it really did not put much detail into the many aspects which define the sociological order that exists in this dystopia. This is personified in an event which is based on the idea of a celebration dedicated to nothing other than constant revenge being undertaken by the powerful on it's powerless to serve as a reminder to the consequences of their actions. I know that most people (who have read the book) would not hold this critique into consideration coming from someone who has not read the prose. Most of the film's fans,however, are thoroughly satisfied due to it keeping true to the original material. To me a great adaptation does not necessarily need to replicate it's source but also give a perspective of the film-maker on it to be really considered to be a piece of art he/she can call their own. Even though the film is directed well by Gary Ross, the lack of that insight into the mechanisms that rule this dystopian futuristic world would have been appropriate and would have been a film which he could call his own. Probably the next installments will delve into that aspect a lot more to make it a better film than it is.Despite this flaw, I found the movie to be very enjoyable and would watch the sequel. Gary Ross (who, unfortunately, won't be back to direct the second installment) does tell the story he wants to tell very effectively with the use of Flashbacks and skillful editing despite the material lacking proper character development. A lot of people are saying that it lacks this insight into the characters due to it being the first of four films, but that for me is no reason why it could not be delved into since it has been done with such a series before.The star of the show was Jennifer Lawrence who continues to awe us all with her versatility and maturity on screen at such a young age. She really gives us a glimpse into what her character is all about and does it with a guile that is synonymous to the most seasoned actors. Unless, God forbid, some unforeseen tragedy befalls her, I think we are really witnessing the growth of a great actress for the future who will give us a career with performances to remember. Even though this performance is nothing compared to her brilliant breakout role as ""Ree"" in ""Winter's Bone"", it brings out her versatility as she plays the different facets of her character with admirable realism.A lot of people have been comparing this film to ""Battle Royale"" and I can't blame them. ""The Hunger Games"" even though it deals with very different schematics to that of the Japanese film, the portrayal of darkness in Takashi Miike's film was far more resounding giving it a more realistic perspective to society's degradation than ""The Hunger Games"" did. I am no sadist, but I think another flaw of ""The Hunger Games"" was that it really did not delve into the darkness and brutality which is the signature of such an event to a level which was required with such a premise. I guess if it was Directed with a darkness which is a signature for Director's in the East, it would have not been as accessible in theaters as it was, thus would have definitely deflated it's monstrous earnings (In hindsight, a wise business decision). Despite it's flaws (ones I consider to be), the film is really enjoyable and does have some very gripping scenes which complement it's material. Not a must-see, but I promise you would be entertained if you do.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Transcription of secret tape of Ross explaining Hunger Games cinematography asethetic to Soderbergh: ""Just pretend that the camera is a bouncing rubber ball on LSD, and that you have this weird compulsion for closeups.

A good job was done by all parties involved given the movie's modest (by today's standards) budget. Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson round-up a good cast.Jennifer Lawrence though, truly is the centre piece of this movie. Without her in the lead role, I doubt that the movie would have been as good as it ended up being.I have not read the books, so this review is solely based on the movie itself. I found it strange that a lot of people bring up ""Battle Royale"" as the movie they most compare ""The Hunger Games"" with, but fail to also bring up George Orwell's novel ""1984"" or Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"". I rather think that ""The Hunger Games"" has undertones of those stories, and that is a positive thing! Based on this first instalment, I will be in the theatre when the next chapter comes to the big-screen. I am not a huge fan, or an established one, since I have not read the books, but as a moviegoer, I was not disappointed!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Hype got me in that seat and the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is pretty hot. I feared that this would be another Twilight but thankfully it's much better than that piece of garbage.Hunger Games follows a Running Man competition when two people from each district must hunt and kill each other for food for the districts. This is entertainment for the rich people, see, and us po' people must earn our way if we want to survive. Two things about this scenario strikes me: 1) This could happen because the Government and rich people are getting worse and 2) Someone during the development (possibly the author of the book) must have played too many online games because that's what this reminded me of. Not that I really invest much time in those but I'm just saying.Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job carrying this movie and the characters and plot devices keeps you from getting bored. However, there really wasn't much character development to get you fully invested to characters who contribute to important scenes. There's a scene where Jennifer Lawrence was crying over a character and I really didn't feel much emotion, mainly because this character she was crying for never had the time to develop. Another thing that bugs me and I hear it's in the book is the costumes. They were just so outlandish and weird for my tastes. I was never really big on future movies anyway so I digress. I love the sets, though.But Hunger Games was a really good movie and I'll catch the sequel earlier when it comes out. Hopefully I'm not busy then.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Good source material, mediocre direction, mildly entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9583226/?ref_=tt_urv","Christopher_Reid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13995491/?ref_=tt_urv","24 January 2024","This movie is like Battle Royale for teens, except that that kind of movie is not remotely for children, or even many adults. That's part of the issue with The Hunger Games. It has the tone of a coming-of-age, slightly edgy, young adult action romance, but the most interesting parts of the movie feel more like A Clockwork Orange, Saw or Se7en.This is not a cute and cuddly story, however much it tries to include that kind of stuff. It wants to have its cake and eat it too and it doesn't work. The most violent, intense parts work the best but nothing else fits with it.The direction is bland. What else has the director made? Nobody knows. No vision, no style. Way too often, he uses close-ups or medium shots so we can't see the environment properly. Like so many weak directors (Abrams, for example), he thinks he just has to show the characters and their intense emotions and we'll be won over. No, it doesn't work like that.We have to connect with the world, understand it, understand what the characters want and why. Only then will we feel something. The Hunger Games does some of that, but I can tell most of the inspiration is coming from the book, not the direction or acting, which are much more average.Jennifer Lawrence is fine in the main role, nothing amazing, but she suits the role. There are just a few too many close-ups where I'm really not sure what she's thinking or why it matters. I don't care that much. I want the world and the events to be interesting. Then I can project myself onto the main character, like with Luke Skywalker, for example.We connect with Luke over time. Star Wars doesn't expect us to cry when he faces tragedy - and there are several pivotal events/scenes. But it does want us to root for him by the end. We've seen what the bad guys are capable and now the stakes are really high. Too many movies expect too much empathy too early, including The Hunger Games.Katniss (which constantly reminded me of cat piss and/or catnip, not a great choice for a name) has a younger sister whose only purpose seems to be to gain our empathy. But the sister is overly emotional and kind of annoying. We don't even know anything about her interests. It's so generic. The same with the mother. Make us LIKE the characters, let them do fun or normal things, THEN we'll care. Don't show them constantly crying - that's dull.The overall plot has some interesting twists and turns - the book is clearly pretty interesting. But as a film, it does very little with the material. A few parts work quite well - when the games start, for example. No sound, but a pretty crazy adrenaline rush, and probably pretty realistic.Speaking of realism, I have my doubts that females would last long at all in such a challenge. Okay, Katniss is good with a bow and arrow. But, on average, I don't see girls surviving for long, with all due respect. I can only suspend disbelief for so long and the completely failure of the movie to address this insane imbalance is strange, indeed. Imagine having a big sport match between boys and girls and the characters all act like it's a 50/50 toss up. Yeah, sure.At times, key issues didn't seem to be addressed. In particular, if I was Katniss, I would have been so furious at one point. I kept wanting her to ask or say certain things to someone else. When the main character no longer seems to have basic common sense or self-respect, it gets really frustrating.Also, she sometimes tells someone else to be quiet. Why? It's such a stupid cliche. Just let them say it! ""Go on without me!"" ""No, I'm not leaving you."" ""But..."" ""Shhhh..."" And I just died of cringe. If I've seen it 500 times before, add a twist or do it really, really well.Some of the CGI has already dated although it wasn't horrendous. It's the kind of thing where you can instantly tell something is fake without being able to exactly explain how. But it reduces the immersion nevertheless.Again, the tone was one of the main issues. We're talking life and death here. You don't have time for your cute little, 90s sitcom moments. At times it felt like Fresh Prince of Bel Air, with characters making jokes or learning lessons, in between teenagers brutally murdering each-other.Not enough is explained about the world. In short - I don't buy it. None of it makes sense. Big gaps between rich and poor? It can happen, but always for a reason. And no reason is given here. Where is the wealth coming from? We don't know. Like most movies which have a disenfranchised poor group, it completely ignores culture, as if no such thing exists. They must be poor because of malevolent baddies.The same with the glamorisation of death. It's just not sustainable. People wouldn't accept that. I guess the sequels will probably go into that. The fashion is also strange. I mean, who knows, people wear all kinds of weird things, but this just feels fake. Ironically, all the actors, both playing rich and poor characters, look like they've just put their costumes and make-up on right before the camera started rolling.Since I've only seen the first movie, I think it's fine for me to speculate about the sequels. I think there'll be a massive revolution (or an attempt at one) which tries to end The Hunger Games and eventually brings all the Districts together in peace and prosperity. The rich, evil people will learn their lesson and the poor will revolt, etc. But deeper questions about human nature, or how economics actually works, will go untouched. I'll find out.One of the simplest issues with The Hunger Games is just that it's boring, a little too laborious with some of the plot points, a little too artificial with its emotions. Quite a few cliches as well. The villains are 1-dimensional and we learn nothing about the people of the Capitol or what they think and why. In The Truman Show, we get glimpses of the people watching from home - what kind of people they are and how they react.Also, the movie cheats to make Katniss look better. She only ever kills in self-defence, which is convenient. She never has to face the prospect of killing a child to win and survive, others do things for her. It's a contrived way to elevate Katniss morally and it feels unearned. Realistically, people aren't all good or evil and you'd face some real moral and psychological dilemmas if put into a fight for your life.THG plays with your emotions too often. Because of the nature of the story, most characters are disposable and this gets abused way too much. It feels arbitrary which characters we (or Katniss) are meant to care about - whatever enhances the drama of the moment.I don't regret missing The Hunger Games all these years but at least I've got a few movies to distract myself with now.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Movie is beautifully shot, accompanied with melancholic music. Battle scenes are sparse bur dramatic and not overdone like the fighting scenes in the recent movies like ""Game of Shadows"" where everybody seems to know some martial art. In reality fights are short and people die easily and that is how they are shown on the screen. Main character arouses sympathy and is someone who we can root for. Jennifer Lawrence looks gorgeous in every scene reminding of Diana, goddess of the Hunt. Some reviewers criticize the movie for its lack of gore claiming it is boring but that is far from true.

By this I mean, it is about teens brutally killing each other to win a contest; the violence sounds like an R rating to me. It would have been better if the kills were actually shown and more gore and blood to show the horror of it. Instead, it was really toned down to get a pg13 rating.The beginning was a little slow, like others have said, the game was the focus of the film and doesn't start to over an hour in. Some things that didn't make sense was how could they conger up fire and dogs that were real in the game, made no sense. If you could do that, why not wipe out all the people in the lesser districts so you don't have to worry about keeping them under control. I liked Woody Harrelson's character, he knew how to play all the power people perfectly. Did any of the other kids get help from their mentor? It was never shown.FINAL VERDICT: Fun, adventure film. I haven't read the books, but I bet quite a bit got left out because there wasn't room to put it in the movie. The only negative is it is set up for a sequel, and it will be many months before it's released.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Making 155 million dollars opening weekend, the Hungers Games exceeded fan's expectations. The film's accuracy to the book's text, written by Suzanne Collins, pleased the massive numbers of dedicated fans. The talented Jennifer Lawrence plays the main character Katniss Everdeen, a young girl who lived in District 12, the poorest of all districts, with her sister, mom, and best friend Gale Hawthorne, played by Liam Hemsworth. Lawrence made an outstanding performance which perfectly displayed Katniss' traits of bravery, stubbornness, and survivalist instincts. The story takes place in Panem, a post- apocalyptic country located on the continent of North America. The Capitol, an extravagant and lavish city which dictates the country, hosts an annual game show called ""The Hunger Games"" in which tributes are picked from each district to battle until death in the man-made and controlled arena. Katniss and Peeta Mallark, played by Josh Hutcherson, are selected from District 12 to participate in the games and must try to survive the cruel Capitol imposition that traditionally kills twenty- three people, leaving only one victor. One can assume that a plot set in a futuristic Utopian world has to be intriguing, but somewhat difficult to produce. The movie realistically portrays Panem through the intricate set details of the arena and Capitol. Many were excited to see how the game arena would be portrayed since the book described it as a force-field covered area, strictly controlled by the Gamemakers, with a Cornucopia center. The Cornucopia was where the games began and contained necessary weapons and tools. This part was disappointing because, in the movie, the Cornucopia was just a large, metal, box-looking structure. Aside from that, the set was extremely well done. Furthermore, the graphics of the fighting scenes did not fail to impress audiences. From Katniss' bow and arrow shootings to the chase of the mutated wolves, watchers were completely soaked into the movie absorbing the intense action-packed scenes. However, the film was comical at certain parts, mostly due to Katniss' sometimes awkward personality. The make-up of the cast members was also astonishing. It was elaborate and creative, but not overdone and frightening. Exemplary examples include Seneca Crane's beard and Cinna's eyeliner. Overall, the movie was marvelous and I applaud the cast for an outstanding job imitating an accent that has not yet been heard.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

As I am writing this review now I am on Part 2 of Catching Fire so I can't say that its my favorite trilogy in the past 5 years. The actual story is compelling, yet not original but it's still satisfying either way. So lets get started!After I saw the trailer which I think was an excellent trailer because of the fact that it didn't show any of the games, just the build up to them. By watching the trailer I felt as though they were going to follow the book very closely, considering that Suzanne Collins helped write the screenplay for the movie. So I was really excited that we are actually gonna see this world come to life and get to see the story unfold and see how another person would put together this world from what they thought it would look like. Gary Ross who directed the film did succeed in making the world and the characters come to life. From the rundown and poor life style of District 12 to the crazy, colorful, and futuristic style of the Capitol, he nailed it spot on. Its not only the places that came to life, but also the characters.The acting in this movie is extremely good. Jennifer Lawrence is the only person I can see in this role. She had already proved herself in Winters Bone, and once again she proves herself here. She makes Katniss come to life and plays her flawlessly. Josh Hutcherson I think did a fine job, even though I'm not a big fan of him at all. Woody Harlenson and Elizabeth Banks both did a really good job themselves in their roles. Donald Sutherland is up there with Lawrence in his role. He makes you hate President Snow as soon as he shows up on screen, fantastic job. Stanley Tucci also is amusing and does a good job.In the movie I like how they give you a feeling that they keep reminding you that you are watching a gameshow. By using the announcers tell the audience certain things that Katniss tells you in the book, the announcers do in the movie. I thought that was a great and creative idea. I also like how they show to people that haven't read the books, the gamemakers control room. Once again a creative way to help move the plot points. Now yes this movie does a good job adapting the source material, but it doesn't do a good job in exacuting them. By that I mean the biggest flaw of the film was character development. The character development I feel is unacceptable in every way. Now the movie is 2 hours and 20 mins its already pretty long. In that time span they decide to cram every detail of the story, or I should say ""big set pieces"" of the book in there. Which is fine but not fine if a character dies who we should care about, but completely don't due to the fact that both those characters had 5mins of screen time together, and what feels like an hour time of day for the characters in the film but is really a few days in the book. Personally I felt the movie seemed short due to the cramming of all the key points of the book in there, so I think the movie would have benefited with 10 more mins of character develop in there. Some might argue that the film would have been way too long and boring, but if it helps me connect with the characters I'm all for it.The Hunger Games does a fine job adapting the novel and making the universe come to life, I just wished I actually felt more emotion towards the characters and actually cared what happened to them.This one is really hard for me because I like the story of the book so much that I felt cheated on the saddest part of the book, next to the ending which they left out and I was disappointed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am writing this review because I believe this film should be judged BY THE FILM and not by the book. I did not read the book so I believe that my review will be fair. So, without further a do...Overall I was very happy with the film. I did have my doubts going in, whether it was from reading others reviews or seeing what my friends wrote, but at the end of the movie I can honestly say it was a very good film.Here were some of the things I did like: For a movie that was over 2 hours long it certainly did not feel like over 2 hours. The movie kept my attention very well. There were many times where I was incredibly anxious because I had to know what happened next. I thought the leading roles were well chosen with none of the characters seeming fake. Normally I do not pay much attention to costumes and scenery but it was hard not to in this film. They were excellent and very well thought up. To end the positives, I would like to add that the whole movie flowed together very nicely.Some things I did not like: Shaky camera. Sometimes it is Okay to have a shaky camera (i.e. Bourne movies) but at times in this film I felt it very unnecessary. I found this annoying especially in the beginning but towards the end it got much better. I think as time went on it seemed more appropriate, but when we are trying to get to know the characters in the film I would advise against it. Another part that bothered me, but only somewhat, was the ending. I felt it ended very abruptly. Although the closing scene left me wanting more I know that they could have brought the film more to a close while still leaving me wanting more.Overall I was very happy with the film. Again, I did not read the books nor talk to people who had read them. I wanted to be surprised by the contents of the film and at the end of the day I very much was.8/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

And to make matters worse all of the people giving it a 1- star? Or would like to give it a zero? It honestly is not that bad. The movie itself is based off of a book so the people that have an issue with the author's concept of children fighting to the death should not watch it, and those who do should not complain because they should have known what the movie was about before they watched it. The idea is pretty interesting and while some of the acting in a few of the cases could have been better I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit. And with 3 other movies already lined up, I'm sure some of the story line will come together in the end. So while everyone says its horrible, I say watch it anyhow. If you hate it, you hate it. If not then hopefully its interesting and enjoyable. But for everyone that comes on here just to complain about how god awful it is, you need to remember that it's rated pg-13 and that they are trying to appeal to a younger audience. It's not going to have everything u want in a movie and no movie is perfect.

The story follows District 12's participant Katniss who volunteers to replace her sister Prim.The film is interesting and engaging throughout and there's a definite influence from the Truman Show and Lord of the Flies amongst others. It certainly also leaves you with plenty to talk and think about afterwards. I found out that it was based on books and I enjoyed the film enough to make me go out and buy the trilogy.

For the first time I've watched a movie that is better than the original material. In a era that every channel has a new kind of reality TV program, like those ones that Truman Show (1998) and EdTV (1999) predicted a lot in a brief past, Suzanne Collins' idea sounds, by its own merits, interesting. And although her mix and parallels between reality shows and Roman Empire ""panem et circenses"" are by far the most interesting idea that came back to pop culture in the last couple years, I didn't like the book for a lot of reasons.The success of the book trilogy is completely understandable. Until 10 yrs back book series wasn't exactly a product of consumption until The Lord Of The Rings become more popular than it was. Then Harry Potter followed the success of its major source of inspiration, becoming the first young adult series to become a world wide hit. When the series was close to its end people was crazy for a new stuff, searching for a new book series that could replace it. Then Twilight saga was discovered and later, The Hunger Games.Unlikely Twilight saga, which entire movie series was made for young people that loved it without reasons because it is incredibly bad, this one is for a totally different audience. First of all because there is a real actress there, second because Gary Ross (director and writer) did a good work taking the essence of the book and amplifying it, never hiding from the audience that everything is a TV show, even the cheesy romance. But the good thing about Collins' saga is that it always was more interesting as a material to be used in the future than as literature. All three books of the brief saga are short, with a lack of description and poor narrative that would only satisfy those ones looking for a new subject. So, the best achievements of the screenwriters (including Collins herself) were taking all these flaws and transform them into a movie that does what the book fails: dive you into it.The 1st person narrative that Collins uses is an extremely old technique for those ones who does not succeeds a lot into other different perspectives, cutting a lot of what could be a great experience if a much more described narration was used instead. And that is what the movie does, it shows you the different and wider perspectives that the book does not.Gary Roos, who directed that sweet movie called Pleasentville (1998) and the great Seabiscuit (2003) had the same gentle hands here and the supporting actors give to the movie another high level. Elizabeth Banks performed Effie Trinket exactly as she is in the books. Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci (and his prosthetic teeth) were far better than the way Collins describe them.But at the same time that the movie feels better than the book, sometimes it also fails. It cuts some important facts of the book wasting time on Katniss hiding, crying and running or other uninteresting facts that if doesn't bore us, dumbs us. There are so much open space for close shots too, and also plenty of 1st person shots, which sometimes are interesting, connecting the audience to what the character is experiencing, but there is a time that it stops being interesting to become dull. For a movie rated PG 13, I think that more should have been shown like the fighting between other tributes which would have given us the feeling of what a true hunger game is. Instead, the tributes are shown as a bunch of teenagers in high school bullying each others.Its success is fair because it's not bad when compared to other low quality movies made for this age group. It has bad moments, but as a whole it deserves attention and Jennifer Lawrence deserves this success.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a film , I was annoyed with the shakey camera, it could have been filmed better, but the over all film was good. I loved the actors they chose, other then Peta's character, he seemed to be useless in the film. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job with her part, bringing the essence of Katnass alive. The action sequence was great, the CGI not so good, especially the dogs. The movie gave a good look into a communist world, divided by wealth, how twisted society was and how one girl can bring hope and change for people to rise up against it. Perhaps the film didn't deserve all its hype, as it was a watered down version compared to the books, but in a sense it needed to be watered down to accommodate all audiences, not just adults. I enjoyed the movie and give it two thumbs up.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was intrigued by the arena and the future technology employed in the fight to the death, though (I was a fan of The Running Man back in the 80s as well.) So I made the comment the story would work well as an action movie. I was told it was going to be a movie, and now it is.Alas, as a teen novel it had to be made PG-13 and to keep that rating the children-killing-children aspect had to be toned down. It was handled by jerky, out-of-focus shots of the actual murders, with clear visuals of either the dead bodies or of the splash of blood or sometimes just an eerie scream. Intense for younger children, appropriate for the target audience, somewhat dull for my bloody taste. I went on a bargain evening though, so for $7 I'm actually satisfied.It's not a cheesy Twilight-like teen romance. The main subject (beyond the story of the central character, Katniss) seems to be the carefully planned violence and tribute ""storylines"" of the ""reality"" broadcasts. It not-so-subtly parallels our own viewing habits and personally I enjoyed the irony. A love story does play a small role, about equal to that of the emotional toll on the children being forced to kill-or-be-killed. Worth a viewing if you have any interest.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

What's the premise of this movie? Well it's simple: The Rich are bastards. The Rich ignore The Poor just so the former may live their lives in lavish excess and plenty while everyone else starves. The Rich are totally oblivious of the sufferings of The Poor and are more easily distracted from real world problems than a pixie in a jewelry sto... ooooh, shiny!! Not only that but the beauty standards of The Rich are just sickening; they think they are pretty... but we all know they look like clowns. Then there are the People In Power. The People In Power are not just bastards, they are pure evil. They exploit The Poor to maintain the lifestyle of The Rich and will do absolutely anything to maintain the status quo, murder included. And they don't even do it themselves but make The Poor kill each other. Why? Because The People In Power exercise shameless victim blaming, so according to the ""logic"" of the Hunger Games - as explained by the People In Power - The Poor earned their plight. This evil is so institutionalized that the power to screw with The Poor even comes with a nifty Copy & Paste interface, used with smirking glee several times during the narrative. And this has been going on for no less than Seventy. Four. Years. Only if you read the books before you see the movie can you understand why this is happening.Enter The Heroic Underdog that is pure in heart, self-sacrificing, skilled, defiant and - most important of all - beautiful. She plays the game(s) of the People In Power, excels at them without actually getting her hands dirty and soon there is unrest among the oppressed masses that are The Poor. Do I need to mention that that People In Power explicitly hate pure, self-sacrificing, skilled, defiant and beautiful Heroic Underdogs that cause unrest and threaten to overthrow the system?The story is the theories of Karl Marx, heavily condensed to their simplest, most romanticized form. The disguise is paper thin: it is upper class vs. worker class as per The Communist Manifesto & Das Kapital For Teens In The 2010's. The workers are fed up getting used and abused, but are constantly quelled by the upper class. Enter the worker class hero that is the spark to the upcoming revolution... The rest is just some tastefully hidden violence to pad it out as a two hours teen action flick and drive home the point that the upper class really is The Evulz (as my teenage daughter would express it).Who should see this film? If you like stories of the ""system is corrupt and needs overthrowing""-genre... go for it. If you want to see rich, arrogant, gloating jerks get their comeuppance... this is just up your alley. If you want a movie with refreshingly strong female characters that your daughters and sons can watch without you worrying about stale gender roles... yes, this is it!Just don't think too much about the insane, over-the-top premise or you get an otherwise decent film ruined for you. I couldn't avoid that. But that's just because I'm getting too old for this flick.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Wondering why exactly The Hunger Games had so much hype, I decided to read the books and then check out the movie. I finished the series in three days and became thoroughly pumped for the film, since it doesn't look like the low budget poo of another young adult book adaptation (coughTwilightcough). But this isn't the place for complaining about that.In terms of following the book, The Hunger Games movie did remarkably well. This can be a good or bad thing. Of course, in order to condense the story many small details were cut. Small, but important to fully understanding the story. Depth, character development, these things are all sacrificed in the movie, which can lead to an unsatisfying middle ground where fans aren't happy and non-fans are confused as to what's going on.Casting of the characters was better than expected. Jennifer Lawrence makes a convincing enough Katniss, although she is way too tall and curvy to actually seem like she was suffering. I don't really know how that could be fixed though. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was...unsatisfying. Basically he was there to look wide-eyed and weak. Same with Prim. I hated how the movie makers interpreted Prim as a whiny, scream-y useless kid. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket was funny and spot-on, Haymitch was meh, President Snow wasn't bad but not as I imagined. Cinematography was very...shaky, as mentioned in other reviews. Also, the books were quite explicit in describing the violence in the arena, but the movie muted this quite a bit. Most scenes go something like this: someone waves/throws a weapon, the camera zooms around in a blurry manner, and the audience is shown the result (a gash, an arrow in something) without actually seeing the process. This really couldn't be helped if they wanted the PG-13 rating, given the teen fanbase, but it truly reduces the impact and power of the movie. It's fine with me though. The Hunger Games isn't supposed to be horror, per se. I think the series is a good introduction to thinking more deeply about human nature, society, war, and violence. It is STILL a story for kids! As for the Battle Royale thing, BR is distinctly more...Japanese. It's sick, twisted, and gloriously, insanely violent. Its purpose is to shock you and give you chills, maybe make you think about things once you get over the gore, which depends on your taste obviously. The Hunger Games dabbles in these parts, yes, but it's much more hopeful. It taps into the viewer's emotions and sympathy, and advocates that good people still have a chance.Anyway, basically The Hunger Games movie is pretty decent in getting the point across, although small things are lost in the process. If you want the full experience, read the books.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's incredibly hard not to compare this film to Battle Royale, I hate to do so, but the similarities are there and unfortunately for The Hunger Games, Battle Royale did it better. In the end, I did like it, but I can't help but feel that it was a lot of build up, with a mediocre delivery of the most important aspect of the film. They talk about how deadly the games are, how it's a fight for survival, but I never really felt that danger. I really do hate comparing it to Battle Royale, but that had a sense of danger. Battle Royale felt deadly, the characters seemed like they've been through hell, you felt sad to see characters die, here, not so much. The most deadly part was the bloodbath that occurred when characters ran to their weapons, then it seemed to be an autopilot. I might be the only one to say this, but this would actually work better as a television show. That way we can feel how devastating these games are, how long they are, how deadly they are. The film does not get this point across, at least not to me.Jennifer Lawrence was good in the lead role of Katniss, the only volunteer for the games. She shows how brave and heroic a female character can be (you suck Bella). She kicks more ass than any other character. That's another downfall, none of the other kids are really memorable. I wanted something unique for each kid to be memorable, but if they didn't speak a line, they were basically ghosts. There are 24 kids, with the exception of the obvious (Lawrence, Hutcherson, the ""villain"" kid, and the little black girl) everyone else fades away. I'm not asking for screen time to be dedicated to each one, but make some of them memorable. I knew who the redhead was because she had red hair, that's it. Again, Battle Royale did this right. They had the tech guys, the evil guy, the medical girls, the crazy girl, the romantics, the hero, etc. The smallest detail is enough to make someone in the background memorable. I had no idea who was dying.The supporting characters are poorly written, specifically Hutherson's character Peeta. Hell, Liam Hemsworth's character Gale does absolutely nothing in the film except brood about Katniss, and yet one little scene where he grabs her little sister to take to her mother screams more about his character than anything Peeta does. Banks, Kravitz and Harrelson all serve to make Katniss all that she can be. Harrelson has some backstory to him, he won a previous game and has since become an alcoholic. I hope more of the world is explored in the follow up films. They barely scratch the surface here, just the basics are given, which is really all we need for the first one, but I was hoping for a bit more of this world to be shown, specifically the Districts. I actually thought that all three books were about the games and that's what the films would be about. So when they wrapped up the game, I thought to myself, where are they going to go from here? But I suspect there will be some uprising and new characters introduced. As a stand lone flick, The Hunger Games works. It doesn't really leave you wanting to go deeper into the story, but it does tell the story it needs to tell and leaves it in a bow for you. It may not be a nice little bow, but it's enough.The detractors of the film are many, like the love between Katniss and Peeta. It's never really explained if she does love him or if she is only doing it for the show and to survive. I suspect the latter will eventually turn into the former, but as of right now, the film does not make this clear. The shaky camera work distracts as well. Even when no action is taking place, we are all over the screen, making it hard to connect to those speaking. The film is also a tad lengthy, which can be bothersome to some, running at two hours and twenty minutes.Despite those nitpicks, the film is entertaining. I guess I just expected a bit more from it, hearing rave reviews and it making millions. The training sequences are exciting and the initial build up, mainly the countdown, to the actual games is thrilling. As I said, I did like the film, I just had to point out those problems. As a film targeted towards teens, I recommend it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Having been chosen to represent their district in the annual Hunger Games, a contest or rather an involuntary battle of life and death, the two find themselves fighting for their lives together with a group of other scared-to-death teenagers in which the last man standing wins eternal fame and glory. There are no rules, but plenty of cameras - through which the rest of the nation watches and roots for their district's contestants.One of the best parts of The Hunger Games is how delicately the film portrays the unhealthiness of it all: the kids' fear, the nation's charade of pride, excitement and glory, and all the well written and acted humanity in the midst of it all. Like other examples of mass suggestion (such as Nazi Germany), the allure and glory seemingly overshadows the immorality, and we the viewers are left in the same predicament as the spectators of the Hunger Games; we know it's wrong, but we still want to watch.The story's underlying themes, of the elite wanting to control and subdue the masses, have already been more than sufficiently explored on film in the past, but what director Gary Ross (Pleasantville) is able to convey in terms of pertinent drama and tension in the fascinating setup is nothing short of amazing. The brilliant visuals, including the masterful set design by Larry Dias, add to this effect, as does the fine acting from a number of inspired players, including the talented Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) in the lead role, a fun Stanley Tucci as the TV host, and a brilliant Woody Harrelson as a previous and disillusioned champion of the games. The game is on.

It gives so much detail and is incomparable to most movies. This story is way ahead of its time, for being made in 2012 it's phenomenal. The perfect movement of the camera, amazing acting, and truely determined actors. The way Woody Harrelson treats Jennifer like his own daughter gives the wild situations in the movie hope for her to survive.

Every year TV shows are becoming crueler, fashion is becoming more freakish, social contradictions are aggravated more. Susan Collins' world is an amazing combination of the fiction about future, legends of the past and realities of the present. The story about young Katniss Everdeen touched deeply many people around the world and of course big hopes were pinned on the screen version.I read The Hunger Games in 2010 and it was my favorite book. So I was waiting impatiently for watching this film for two years. And when I watched it, it didn't look like I'd imagined.The script. Well, it's hard work to rewrite not very big but rich in events book in a two-hour film. But I can't tell that they did it well. However, I rate it as higher-than-expected. I thought scriptwriters would cut much more scenes but they only deleted some episodic characters and focused us on really important moments.But whether were they able to show the story?Born from the ashes a post apocalyptic state Panem with the shining Capitol and enslaved twelve Districts. Hunger, poverty, silence as only available act of the volition. In the spotlight the girl who was going to die for saving her little sister and the boy who was falling in love with heroine and who had saved her once. Die was cast and they both went to the grand capitol for making a show for its perverse residents and dying on the Arena for their entertainment. «The Hunger Games» – the story without semitones. This was the first spark; the Girl on Fire kindled it in people's hearts. And this was the thing which was missed – the fire. Despite of persistent book following they lost the point with chasing the details. No contrast, no fear, many questions and no sense. The world was gray and didn't aroused any emotions. Cast. Nobody looked hungry. At all. But OK, you can say that it's not important how they looked like but how they acted. Well, if glared eyes and frozen faces with open mouths were the best that Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson were able to show - it's disappointing. Maybe J.L. had a couple of good scenes but that's all. Now she is very famous and she's one of the best young actresses, she really can play brilliant. However, in this film she was awful. The only character in all film who was really great was Haymitch Abernathy. Woody Harrelson was the only actor who tried to play at least.Cinematography. What was doing on? Was the camera tied on the rope or was cinematographer drunk so his hands was shaking overtime? I had a headache, it was terrible!Music. This was the thing which saved the film. There were no needless songs, no pompous tirades. Music sounded naturally and moving where it should be. It made the film atmosphere and it was magnificent.Well, the odds were in the film favor because of many fans all around the world and because of simple pattern of the story that teenagers like - there were defiance to the system, love story and the choice. But there wasn't anything new or anything significant. It's so wailful, when a good book becomes a popular film because then it often loses its heart.I think the film was quite well but nothing else.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I did see the film adaptations however. The first installment of the franchise was a rock solid movie. It was anchored by strong performances from its stars. The film had good pacing and never let up or got boring. From start to finish the film did a good job of keeping me both engaged and feeling tense. While some of the films special effects haven't held up over the years, the true power of the film is the relationship of the main characters in the context of this authoritarian dystopian science fiction-esque story. This installment is by far the best in the movie franchise. Even if you don't like the sequels you can always watch this one stand alone and enjoy it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence deserved the plaudits heaped on her and I was surprised to see Josh Hutchinson come out of it so well. I was not keen on the art direction as far as make up was concerned - the weird-shaped beard was impossible for anyone to maintain and the ""futuristic"" hairstyles just looked ridiculous. I liked the premise but for Jennifer's character to manage to survive without hardly killing anyone was a cop-out. Yes she caused a death and retaliated and killed someone but I think if she had gone after some of the other tributes then it would have been more realistic. It will be interesting to see how they make the sequel and what the jumping-off point may be. My main complaint about this film is the amount of hand-held camera-work. As someone else pointed out it is nauseating seen on the big screen - believe me it is the same on a home TV. A very unnecessary technique too much employed in a lot of modern films. It adds nothing.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It could've been much better. Instead, it is just a normal popcorn flick that takes its source material for granted. Some important scenes doesn't have a proper lead-in to explain the action. Some were left out entirely. This makes some of them have less impact than what they were gunning for, instead, it induces awkwardness, even if one knows the reason for the scene. I'm not even talking about the symbol of the story that have been reduced to mere trinket. So, my advice is, go and see the movie with your hopes dialed down. This is not a faithful adaptation, even the casting is way off. Its a shame really, such misstep is truly unexpected. It could've trumped Twilight and takes its place as the leader in teen movie franchises. Instead, it happily place itself in the middle of the pack.

I never read any of the books, and before coming here to appreciate the film verbally after watching it for the first time on DVD, I never knew that the plot of the books upon which the film was based was similar to another set of books that I also never read. Fortunately, I do not care to read either set of books, and, most gratefully, I hadn't yet been polluted by all the trollish trash back and forth here on this board and in these reviews, so I was able to enjoy the movie objectively, having not read anything about it.I can say that when the film is watched on its own merit - i.e., without all that unnecessary baggage - it stands out as a truly impressive production. I thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle. The premise of the film is quite absurd, requiring huge suspension of disbelief, so to get oneself in a lather about plot niceties regarding this particular kind of fictional universe is nonsensical.No society populated by humans beings (homo sapiens sapiens) would allow the type of behavior typified in this movie to go on for so long. Rebellion would happen from the inside. People wouldn't just merrily go along with it. It's ridiculous to think otherwise. It's science fiction, occurring in a parallel universe of something like human beings, but not quite. That being the case, one would hope there would be more productive things to do than rabid fanboi bickering, but no, sadly.The pageantry was fabulous. Art direction was stellar. Acting was superb. (Until the credits rolled, I had no idea that was Elizabeth Banks behind that makeup and hair! I make a point to hear as little as possible about a film before I see it.) The score was first class. The story moved within its own logic very nicely, I felt for many of the characters, and I can't wait for the sequel for what was obviously just the opening act. This review from objectivity is the best praise I can give.I do hope that should some of the makers of this film be so unfortunate as to feel the need to read the rants, they must realize the insults and trolling mean nothing. (Most who are like me would just go away from the toxicity, rather than try to insert something good into all the nastiness.) Keep up the great work! I'll see the next one on the big screen, for sure.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The price of food is rocketing. The citizens of the Capitol, the fortress city of the rich and powerful, annually select, through a lottery, a young boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve districts to fight with each other to death. This is done live on television, leaving only one winner. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers instead of her younger sister to lead this fierce battle.16 year-old Katniss hails from the distinctly poor district 12, and area known for its rich supply of coal. She shows a rebellious streak and is the breadwinner who feeds her mother and younger sister. She has a talent for illegally hunting to sell goods on the black market with her best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).'The Hunger Game' is introduced in the film as ""something that knits us all together"" from the creator of this bloody live show. The poorer districts ask for food from the government; their names appear in the lottery. It's a life defined by day-to-day survival.The two selected protagonists of district 12, Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are moved to the Capitol, where the conglomeration of technology and money are based. Like gladiators, they are treated like stars with big banquets and fancy clothes before they're sent off to their deaths in an outdoor arena.They meet their drunken trainer and previous winner Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who introduces them to the manipulative nature of the game. Basically they have to please the audience in order to get more sponsors who will provide them with gifts of food and crucial items when they're out there fighting for their lives.Katniss understands she's nothing but mere entertainment for the rich living in Capitol. Her bravery in standing up for her sister has already given her more points, but she has to keep it up by employing her talents in order to shift public opinion in her favor while audiences anticipating death.The film is an analogy of the manipulation of media in our modern times, and how end-users are at the service of darker powers. I was reminded of Noam Chomsky, who has revealed the mass media schemes through the ""manufacture of fear"" in order to reach control.Media manipulation is not new to Hollywood, from ""Wag the Dog"", ""1984"" and ""The Truman Show"", all hint in different ways, the power of the media industry in shifting people's opinions towards war. But this is probably the first time this argument has been pitched at a younger generation.Oscar nominated Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") has proved once more that she's a formidable presence. The film, on the other hand, sometimes lacks details that would have moved it closer to perfection. There are some irrelevant futuristic costumes, and an under-developed storyline about the father-like daughter relationship between Lenny Kravitz and Katniss. The film is open for analogy with the current uprisings in the Middle East. As the film says, hope is ""the only thing stronger than fear"".Find the rest of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education, at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

The plot is as unique as it is interesting as it sounds and the casting for the roles was impeccable: Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, the severely underrated Josh Hutcherson as Peter, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and the Donald Sutherland as the villainous and scheming President Snow.Cinematography was spot on, and the soundtrack is one of the best I've seen (or heard even) in recent years. The pacing to the film is great, being neither too slow nor too fast as such the audience doesn't get bored whilst we still get treated to plenty of story elements.9/10: Exciting, action packed and gritty. A perfect dystopian film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

My son and wife enjoyed it, although there were no raves. Personally, I was disappointed and thought that the movie lacked intensity. This is likely due to the producers aiming for a very definitely younger teen crowd. I haven't read the book so can't comment on that aspect. The first third of the movie dragged for me and the latter part had no real surprises, with a storyline that left me with no real empathy for the characters.This movie will make a lot of money based purely from the effects of its marketing hype, but I can't see that continuing. I don't believe this movie will appeal to any male older than his mid-teen's. I'm not saying that this is a BAD movie, just that I think the premise could have been better explored in a darker, grittier, presentation with this future world detailed in more depth.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The humor, none whatsoever even though it tries at some points. It is also very clear that they put a whole team of cultural marxists in charge of the production. You have the multicultural towns being oppressed by the white-only bad people. You have not one but three(!) hero black people, one with a sexy touch.

I thought he'd be great and he just wasn't. 2) Not enough time was devoted to many parts of the movie. It felt rushed, especially at important parts of the story (it'd be a spoiler if I said where) 3) Like #2, they tried to pack too much into the plot. It really could have used another half hour to be a little more thorough. 4) Cinematography was awful. Often the camera seemed out of focus from my view in the theater. Too many close-ups and the resolution just seemed off. Didn't look like HD. 5) Could have used more dialogue. Main characters barely spoke to one another. 6) Capitol scenes seemed very cheaply done and the editing was sloppy, as many have already said. I was mildly disappointed but the movie was still pretty good. Definitely worth my $5 at the matinée, I just loved the book and the movie wasn't as good. Acting was spot on for the most part.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had not expected that much about the movie... maybe that's why I found it fun during the running time. Still, I am satisfied with the movie and it makes me want to read books. I heard there are some people who argue that The Hunger Games actually stole the idea from Japanese literature and movie called Battle Royale. I am a huge fan of Battle Royale, and I also think the idea of 'killing' game is quite similar. However, it looks hard to say that The Hunger Games copied the idea of Battle Royale. People killing others in order to survive is a common theme in literary or media works, I guess. And The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are entirely different films. While watching this movie, I thought that the audiences from Panem are similar to people of the real world including myself. They are eager to watch more horrible and provocative things in media. It's getting worse in these days. Also, I felt that the world in the film is not that different from real. District 1, a strong one, already established the structured and well organized system to make its own weapon. In contrary, a weak District 12 cannot help but participate the games for living. And the Panem which takes control over the districts looks just hideous even though it is decorated with colorful stuff. I sympathized with the movie in terms of these points.Anyhow, I think the movie The Hunger Games is enjoyable enough. It is thrilling, and it's too terrible to imagine... I am waiting for the next series, and I'd like to read the books.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is mostly due to my own enjoyment of dystopian and post-apocalyptic settings in general media. But, to counter my own statement of enjoyment, I didn't know how much I would like this, my bar was set pretty low at 2.5, which is the minimal passing score for my rating scale. The reason behind this is behind few exceptions I hate the genre of fiction known as young adult. It's simplistic, pandering, insulting and cliché. It simply is and with writers like Stephanie Meyer this can not be dismissed as a radical bias as there is some truth to it. But I did pick up the Hunger Games novel about a month ago and I ended up being interested on how it was going to be adapted. Let me say this before I say anything else, I believe Jennifer Lawrence is a talent that can't be denied. Calling her talentless, unemotive, stale or any negative term is just objectively wrong. If you don't think so please do yourself a favor and go watch Winter's Bone and to a lesser extent, The Burning Plain or The Poker House. Both were movies that really got me excited for her as a performer. This girl has range, ability and method and while in The Hunger Games it doesn't show completely, she does show the characters three dimensions. The plot is paced very well, with minor inconsistences with camera steadiness, but it does add some thrilling action-esque feel to the scenes even if it sacrifices emotion and reaction. At the end of the day, I can agree with Catherine Reitman on Josh Hutcherson being miscast. I do think higher of him then others, but he just didn't fit or he didn't for me. I also think Wes Bentley just didn't stick either, in appearance I think it was great but when he opened his mouth it seemed dreaded with blandness. I imagined the character presented would of had a thinner, more suave voice and characterization. But otherwise it was only a minor thing that irked me. Everyone else but these two sank into their roles, especially Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks; whom I didn't even recognize until the ending credits.The film has an interesting setting, style and succeeds with pacing, characterization and only falters when it comes to some blurps that can't be helped either due to casting or source material. This is probably the most finely crafted young adult thing I have experienced since maybe Brian Jacques adapted Redwall to the television screen.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a technical necessity.JLaw is strong and natural. Katniss portrayal is vivid. JLaw deserves all the fame and glory.Explaining a general confusion/ complaint:Why the kids gang up during the race - grouping-up is a 'natural' social behavior in Darwinian games. In (stupid) reality shows like Survivor, participants tend to pair up with the strongest possible to eliminate the weakest first, before final battles between the strongest. In THG, Rue is the hunted weakling. Katniss is also classified as a weakling because she is not a preemptive killer.Sociopaths or everyday narcissists need to win and to dominate at any cost. They tend to view kindness and compassion for fellow human beings as weakness. They have contempt for - and will eliminate such 'psychological weaklings' just for the ""gene pool weeding"" reason alone. The THG world has a mad, fascist-like ""Capital"". So within the story context, contestants ganging behavior made perfect sense.Is the world we live in as ""evil"" as that? Do incumbents gang up and scapegoat minority individuals, do wall street rich gang up to become richer, do powerful countries gang up on weak isolated countries?Some find the THG citizens' treatment of children gladiators as entertainment just too inhuman and unbelievable. Not long ago, ""fringe districts"" children and unarmed civilian women of our world were mass-sacrificed in the name of peace. The crimes against humanity still not acknowledged, justice still not done, after 70 years. Isn't that unbelievable?Are we still pinning all the blame and evils on a few scapegoat figures, so that we don't have to face the rot within?So the ""Capital"" citizens, the most powerful people on earth, their indifference and ignorance on the rest of the ""districts"", their choosing to not care about a few ""fringe scapegoats"", is very, very contemporary, and totally believable.For that timely theme alone, THG merited a 7.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm extremely biased as well, considering Battle Royale is one of my all-time favorite films/books/graphic novels. So let's get this rant out of the way: The Hunger Games takes the concept of Battle Royale and waters it down to a product more accessible to a wider audience, specifically the younger crowd. My biggest problem with this is it loses the impact of Battle Royale - a frightening, beautiful, orgiastic display of shocking violence and social commentary. What makes it so twisted is that the contestants are all fellow students and friends, and we get to know many of the students, making their deaths more disturbing. In The Hunger Games, we follow two contestants and the rest are nameless, and with the exception of one young black girl, their deaths are meaningless (and mostly off-screen). The fact that the violence is so much more tame seems irresponsible - we don't see how horrific and terrifying it would be. The characters in The Hunger Games are black-and-white, good and evil with no grey areas, whereas the characters in Battle Royale feature heroes, antiheroes, complete monsters, and terrified teens. They're plunged into a situation and act like normal teens would, freaking out, committing suicide, going ax crazy, professing love, etc.As a film, The Hunger Games is certainly not bad - it's a well-made, well-acted spectacle that is entertaining albeit predictable. It takes its time getting to the action, but when the contestants are finally released it's thrilling (there's also a particularly intense scene involving a wasp's nest). It's probably the best we can expect from what a predictable Hollywood remake of Battle Royale would look like - significantly toned down, with a gorgeous cast, and a soundtrack featuring Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, and a couple good indie bands (as opposed to Battle Royale's classical music). I also like that The Hunger Games focuses more on the media aspect of the game, which was mostly ignored in Battle Royale. It's much less melodramatic than Battle Royale as well. The bizarre costume designs are great too.TL;DR - It all comes down to taste. If you prefer fantasy stories, don't like subtitles, and have no desire to see kids kill each other in over-the-top gory fashion, you'll like The Hunger Games. If you're a fan of horror, exploitation, or extreme Asian cinema, you'll like Battle Royale. I prefer the latter, but The Hunger Games could've been a lot worse.","142 out of 290 found this helpful.

Ill give a short review that will hopefully add to the countless others.Having not read the book, i went in open minded to all and anything. Yes, i have seen Battle Royale. There are certainly some similarities, however i can say this is not a simple rehash of BR.Some of good things that stood out was the acting (Jennifer Lawrence i think it is did a superb job as the lead and i liked Woody Harrelsons portrayal of their mentor.) I am a big fan of dystopic society and thought the settings were well done. Futuristic in the Capitol and old, depressing, in the Districts.I have a few gripes. First, there is shaky camera a lot. Even when there is just calm convo, the camera moves like something really intense is happening. Gets annoying and makes it hard to observe the smaller details (ie set pieces, people). I also would've rather seen a little more brutality. I understand that it was pretty much restricted to PG-13 because of the target audience, however i think the brutish nature of the games and its contestants would have shown better if there was more....just more.Overall, Def a good movie. On a 100 scale, 77 does it justice. I am currently reading the book which explains some details i had questions about. Even if you have read the book, the movie will keep your interest.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. Some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. Other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels. Hope they will be better.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Capitol selects a boy and a girl from each district who fight to death on live television. Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her younger sister's place for the latest match.The movie is based on the first novel in the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, published in 2008. It was probably the most advertised film of the spring, and, given the bestseller nature of the books, the film to wait for. And the fans will not be put down.Art always follows the mood of the crowd, reflects it and tries to satisfy the desires of the majority. This is why the occurrence of the anti-Utopian and post-apocalyptic movie was actually predictable given the world-wide movements like ""Occupy Wall-Street"". The society filed a demand for another ""V for Vendetta"", and the movie industry (as well as book-publishing) rushed to satisfy it.The whole movie feels split into roughly two parts. In the first part, authors try to produce anti-utopia with all the necessary attributes. Suppression, fear, anger at the elites, excesses of the Capitol; all the components seem to be in place. Lonely hero, revolting masses, uniformed Special Forces – it took all the best from other anti-utopias. The second part feels like ""The Last Survivor"". Well, a bit more brutal. The movie almost forgets its anti-Utopian start and concentrates on action, reminding more of ""Predators"" and other movies about survival in the jungles. And the thing is that these two parts are as if they are filmed by two different people.The action part is tense, full of unexpected turns of the story line and genuinely breath-taking at moments. It is a joy and entertainment to watch, it is easy to empathize with the main characters, it is a thrilling movie to watch. But the anti-utopia part is in reality more of ""Anti-utopia for children"" – every single bit is carefully chewed and given to the audience for easy digestion. It is like 1984-lite: colorful, stylish, with charismatic characters, but absolutely dull. I honestly believe that the audience is smart enough to understand the purpose of the games. I do believe that everybody will understand what is going on the screen, without any need to revert to patronizing explanations which leave the taste of a kindergarten lessons.The cast played its part well. No revelations, no awe-inspiring performance, no Oscar-hopefuls. Straightforward work, no more, no less. I would only single out Lenny Kravitz. He managed to put life in his character, a lot of charisma and some personal touch to it, making it very natural and pretty positive. As concerned Jennifer Lawrence who played the main character, I honestly don't understand why there is a need for her to do everything with an open mouth. She hunts with open mouth, she sleeps with open mouth, she is angry with open mouth – etc. It was supposed to make her look hot, but instead she looks a bit lost and silly. Other than that, everybody seems to be in place and knowing what to do.P.S. I hated the camera work. The shaking image always unsettles me, I never quite grasped why would you want to use it? It is not how people see the world when they are nervous. It is simply a camera given to a man who has shaking hands. As a result, the whole movie feels like a ride on a very poor road rather than nice smooth journey. Maybe that was the intention? Because of this feature the final fight also lacks some pathos and tension. Instead, it looks like the cameraman himself participates in the fight.VERDICT: Despite pretty patronizing approach to the audience as concerned the ideological part, the movie is still great watch: captivating, breathtaking, interesting and with a little pinch of content for those of us who look for something more than simple action movie.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Director Gary Ross seems to think a shaky camera image is the way to go for half the scenes in the movie. Yes it seems to be the fad in movies today to give this ""natural"" shaky camera look, but I found my self having to look away. I found it very distracting and not enjoyable. The plot, which I always say is the most important, was based on the popular series of books, was just OK. The heroes made it through, but there weren't any real unexpected twists and this movie wasn't dialogue heavy, it relied upon the action scenes. I would have liked to have seen more development of the story, however this does leaves room for a prequel. The acting was fine, and Jennifer Lawrence played a very convincing lead role which showed the strength and vulnerability of her character. I enjoyed the movie overall, but I won't watch it again. The shaky camera is a real pet peeve of mine. Of course watch this if you have read the books. Warning, the ruthless killing of children even though crucial to the plot gives it the pg 13 rating and I would advise parents not to have their young children watch.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It felt that way.Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is quite entertaining, but there's missing a part. When a story takes place in a dystopic world I'd like to know more about that world because it is vital to understand the different characters and their motives. I obviously haven't read the books and from that perspective I found that the movie gave me very little information about the world's history. I think it wasn't even mentioned that there was a revolution during which district 13 was annihalated. I actually had to look that up on wikipedia. I know it's a difficult task to make a movie out of a book because you can only make a movie so long but I think there have been other movies which did this way better than Hunger Games (Harry Potter would come to my mind). To sum my impressions up: Good movie, but it could have been better if it focused a little less on everything around the hunger games and a little bit more on the people and the world they're living in because that's what the whole trilogy is about.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The premise was interesting and the characters (most of them) were compelling.I know people don't like to talk about messages in films. They want to just watch the film and be entertained; in much the same way they just want to pop a pill and never actually discuss their problems. We live in a consumption-oriented society, but we don't analyze what we're consuming. Talking about messages is important because you ARE influenced by what you watch (and read), whether you realize it or not.The underlying message of this film is extremely socialist, if not communist. The timing of its release is also very suspicious. Obama's entire campaign is based on the idea of the 1% (rich people) versus the 99% (the poor and starving). Interestingly enough, this is also (basically) the major underlying theme of this movie. This is a movie about CLASS WARFARE and socialist revolution. The actual premise could never happen in real life. The good guys are (of course) the poor and starving underclass; the bad guys are (of course) the evil rich class.The film is trying to draw attention to the importance of helping those who are starving - but no such people actually exist in the United States. There are people who are much less wealthy than others and there are people who are on welfare and food stamps - but there is NOBODY in the US who is starving to death. If you want to see that kind of poverty you should visit some of the war-torn parts of Africa. But even in these places, the people manage to survive.In any case, violence and social revolution are never the way to solve problems as complex as starvation and poverty, but that is exactly what this film is advocating (which you will see if you really take the time to analyze it).","4 out of 33 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, PG-13 movies can be great, but when the premise is 24 teenage gladiators fighting to the death, you can't make it PG-13 without detracting from the mood and thrills.

As such I had mixed feelings going in, and my worry mainly pertained to event accuracy. I understand the nuances of making a movie and had I have donned the Directors cap I would've had to change parts to make it an acceptable movie for all crowds. However, this team executed the movie with a general focus on fact accuracy and the first hand experience.The acting in this movie is great. The actors all reacted in the manor i envisioned while reading. The production quality is top notch, which was expected for such a high profile movie. The level of accuracy that this movie has in paralleling the book is astounding from an adaptation stand point. It can be very difficult to make an entertaining movie that closely follows the structure of a book, but they were able to.I'd like to start out by saying that this is a great movie, but being that I read the book, I had some criticisms. The biggest one in the execution of subtleties. This movie tried very hard to define the dystopian world and spent a lot of the movie's ""free"" time on that. However, the visuals are enough that i felt this time may have been better spent expanding on the other characters in the movie. Emotions also took a back seat. Katniss is portrayed as a very strong emotional character, but a lot of the emotions around the various events felt rushed and lost. I would easily recommend this movie to everyone. However I don't think it will be as highly rated as it is successful. If anything I would recommend reading the book. Because I think if you wanted to make this movie you have it stray a little further and create its own identity. Trying to capture everything the book offered in just over 2 hours is an impossible task.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games, set in a future dystopian society where each year one boy and one girl from each district (there are twelve districts) must enter the hunger games. Each contestant must fight till the death in a huge arena, until only one left. The main character is Katniss Everdeen who shows strong character and sparks a light in the darkness, she has a leadership temperament, she is calm in all circumstances and she will evolve with the film which makes her very endearing. The Hunger Games is a movie with suspense and thrills as the hunger games is not the end. The plot is a broad idea with great actors and thrilling events. I recommend the movie to those seeking a movie that will have them on the edge of their seats. I have nothing else to say! Hats off to the director, adapting such a book so well is not easy, but never have I been so eager to see a sequel to this film! Personally, I love action and dystopian movies, so The Hunger Games is the type of movie that I enjoy a lot watching, and that's why I've already watched the saga 3 or 4 times. Every time, I feel the same emotions and I discover new details that make me enjoy this amazing saga more. But I still prefer books, which are much more detailed and which I have read several times as well. For me, it was not possible that the film adaptation would be as good as the novels, but that does not prevent it from being very entertaining.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Surely it is difficult to find exact matches to the characters described in the books, but the heroine's small stature is essential to how she is perceived and perceives things and how she finally overcomes adversities. She is also supposedly coming from a starving background. So instead of getting a small in figure and thin actress, the producers cast a tall and rather bulky actress that looked well fed and not at all straggling and did not compensate this mismatch with her acting skills. The male leads, although different than how are being described in the books, are more consistent and functional.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Add in elements from The Wizard of Oz, The Truman Show, teen lit champ Twilight, and another classic American short story, Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, and you have The Hunger Games. No, there's no much originality left in Hollywood nowadays, but the money will be flying into the hands of the producers with this movie series. Hollywood still knows how to market and make an expensive film even more profitable and popular before its first screening. Money has been lavished on this big screen adaptation from Suzanne Collins best-selling trilogy, from its strong production crew to its fine casting. ( The author even helped to co- wrote the script, along with Billy Ray, and the director of the film, Gary Ross, giving it her seal of approval. ) The Hunger Games stars young up-and-coming talents who have proved their mettle in other movies: Jennifer Lawrence as the strong-willed heroine Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, her comrade-in-arms, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. her best friend and confidant. Also bringing a modicum of class to this project, in showier supporting roles, are a perfectly smarmy Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman), Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket), Wes Bentley (Seneca Crane), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch Abernathy) at his cynical best, and an underused Toby Jones (Claudius Templesmith).The simplistic story goes somewhat like this: It is the future. And, as we all know from past films of this genre, it's bleak. Global change is evident with drought, famine, and war the main causes. North America, now known as Panem, is made up of 12 districts where the 99% exist, and the Capitol, where the wealthy 1% live. Every year, there is a lottery where 24 teenagers from all the poorer districts, in teams of 2, are chosen to become part of a live reality game show like Survivor, only this time, it's real survival. One by one, these ""tributes"" are eliminated until the champion is crowned. It's Gladiator games with mandatory viewing, televised for all the citizens of Panem ( and us ) to see. What makes The Hunger Game fun to watch is that it successfully captures the satirical edge of present-day America's obscene fascination with reality shows and competitions, blending its sci-fi mentality and teenage romance angst with a relevant social message of our insatiable ""hunger"" for popular entertainment at all costs. Sure. it's an easy target to ridicule, but it works in an uncomplicated way.The story itself is pure action and only works on a visceral level. There is no true dramatic tug, no genuine emotion invested in the characters. Most of the teenage characters in peril do not resemble anything remotely real. They never go beyond the limitation of their stereotypical roles as pawns in the game of life vs. death ( the bloodthirsty jock, the mean girl, the innocent young waif, etc. ). Katniss, our noble protagonist, is portrayed as a young girl victimized by a cruel totalitarian society who sacrifices her own life to save her younger sister who was the actual Chosen One. She has all the heroic traits necessary to succeed: she's pretty and courageous, smart and strong-minded, agile and able to shoot a mean bow and arrow. Plus, she only kills in self- defense. A born leader and ultimate fighter, she's at the top at the food chain and the perfect role model for the tween set. Jennifer Lawrence shows the many sides of Katniss, all of her the spunk and savviness, and also subtly displaying her vulnerability and fear. Her casting is pivotal to the film's success in making Katniss such a sympathetic and likable character. Just as the tributes are manipulated by outside political forces, so is the movie audience controlled by its filmmakers. They have created a fine, if somewhat conventional, adaptation from an immensely popular novel. ( Loyal readers will not be disappointed in this version. ) Violence and gore are kept to a minimum to safeguard and assure that this PG-13 rated film reaches its targeted audience and the film is efficiently directed by Ross, although I wish he would have spent the extra $50 fora sturdy tripod to compensate for the overwrought shaky hand-held camera-work. The Hunger Games is diverting entertainment, a well-made film for assorted tastes, with enough satisfaction provided for mass consumption.

I think we all should take a lesson in how such a dystopian vision of a brutal future can become real. Other reviewers have complained about poor character development in the film compared to the novels. I found this almost universally to be true about movies. Think about it, if the movie was as long as it took the average reader to read the story in a book, then the movie goer would lose interest and walk away. Movies, out of necessity, are always basically summaries of the book.As for the storyline, this too is another expose on the battle between hope and fear. Hope of a better future versus a society that instills fear in the people in order to control the population. I envision Panem to be a allegory for the ancient Roman Empire, where the citizens of Tome were 'entertained' by the great gladiatorial games. A population properly entertained is one not susceptible to starting an insurrection that destroys a perfectly ordered society. Catniss and the other tributes are the gladiators. While those being entertained are the fat, dumb and happy citizens of Capital City live. The districts are the remote enclaves where everyone else on Panem toils in poverty and despair, resolved to their fate as lowly exploited peasants. Panem is a world where the masses, ruled by a few elites are held against their will within the ghettos.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There's one catch, however. They earn that victory by hunting down and murdering the others. The story take place in a futuristic dystopia called Panem where the central authority, ""The Capital"" demands that the twelve formerly rebellious outlying districts send two ""tributes""; kids between ages 12-18, to battle in the Games. All are picked by lottery. Once chosen, they are pampered like modern day reality stars before being sent into the forest with whatever weapons and supplies they can muster.The story focuses on the brave and resourceful Katniss Everdeen (played by the extraordinary Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteers to take the place of her younger sister. The first few scenes are excellent and chilling. Katniss's home, District 12, is an impoverished coal mining backwater that eerily mimics the Appalachian locale of Lawrence's last film, the equally bleak ""Winter's Bone"". The children are chosen at a staged event, called a ""reaping"", at the train station in a vignette that echoes (deliberately, I assume) the Selection Platform processing at Auschwitz.Once at the Capital, the story sags somewhat. This is supposedly where the rich, venal rulers congregate but, adorned as they are with exaggerated costumes and grotesque florescent hair styles, they look more like extras from a Fellini film. They come off as silly, not threatening, especially Stanley Tucci as the unctuous Ryan Seacrest-like MC who is cursed with a blue-tinted pompadour. The entire sequence is meant to mock the celebrity/reality show culture of our present day but it comes off a bit forced. The only character who radiates menace is Donald Sutherland's President Snow and he is dressed in plain formal attire.The story picks up again when the youngsters begin to battle although it's unsettling to see children casually slaughtering each other. Katniss is paired with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson in a tender, underplayed role), a boy from her home district and their love story, ruthlessly exploited by the show's controllers, provides the backdrop for what transpires.""The Hunger Games"", the beginning of the trilogy by author Suzanne Collins (who also wrote the screenplay), promises future sequels which will hopefully give more back story to Panem's beginnings and more challenges for the riveting and poignant Katniss Everdeen. These stories are aimed at teenage readers and it is easy to see their appeal. Combining elements of love and heroism, it also plays out every teen's revenge fantasy of getting back at the creeps who ignore them in the cafeteria and bully them in the hallways. A typical American high school is a true Hunger Games survival setting. The only difference is that the bloodletting is emotional, not physical.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

And here it is, The Hunger Games! A brilliant adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling series (and far better-written than Stephanie Meyer's Twilight books). This movie delivers in almost every aspect. Despite its one flaw, The Hunger Games was definitely worth the wait.The one flaw I was talking about is the over-use of shaky-cam in a few scenes of the movie. It gets less abundant later in the movie, but it can be mildly distracting at times.But don't let the camera work ruin the movie for you! This movie is full of good things: superb acting, thrilling action, great story, and genuine heart. The movie was very well casted, with Katniss, Primrose, Gale, Peeta, Cinna, Effie, and Haymitch's characters all flawlessly portrayed by the actors. I also enjoyed the girl who played Rue: she was perfect! The action was very well choreographed (despite the iffy camera-work) and I felt as though I was experiencing the same thrill I did when I first read the book. I was on the edge of my seat, even though I knew exactly what was going to happen. I cared about all the characters.There were a couple of alterations in the movie's script that left out some details from the book, but it didn't ruin the story for me at all. There is no need to be worried about the movie screwing up the book; the changes are rather small and inconsequential.This movie is also very emotionally charged, just like the book. You can feel the characters' devastation, their happiness, their sadness, their defeats and triumphs. Again, thanks to the acting and the well-written script.Overall, this movie did a fantastic job of bringing the book to the big screen. It was enjoyable, exciting, and satisfying. Even if you haven't read the book, if you like action movies and movies about triumph and standing strong, then this is the movie for you.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Based on a book by Suzanne Collins the movie takes place in a post apocalyptic world where the government makes children to fight to the death in an event that happens every year called the Hunger Games. The film's good guys are Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence, volunteers to take her sister's place in the games, and we follow her as she fights for survival and becomes the only glimpse of hope for the people who didn't make it in her district. The film does an great job of building tension and making you care about the characters and build a connection with them choosing which side you want to make it out, and the action parts of the movie are thrilling and very well made. One of the best parts of the movie are the people who are acting in it. Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast as Katniss, and other actors like Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson do a great job at acting too. The film also shows the impressive production and the way the set was made, with the Capitol city and the Hunger Games arena both looking so real and honestly makes you feel like you're in the movie. Overall, The Hunger Games did a great job at making the movie and did a great job with the set and story line. If you're a fan of action, drama, like a series that goes along with a book, or just great storytelling, I highly recommend this movie to anyone.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The book was embarrassingly bad. Poor writing, with no idea about characterisation, conflict, or pacing. Luckily Gary Ross is a much better filmmaker than Suzanne Collins is a writer. He manages to capture those silent moments of thought which allow the audience to breathe and contemplate what is happening. Unlike Collins' non-stop 1st person narrative from Katniss, which included every one of her mundane thoughts. She's a character that doesn't speak much, and this is better represented in this film. Lawrence gives a great performance and knows when a look is more than a speech. In fact, the whole cast do well. Like the book, the first half is more interesting, as we see the build-up to the games. The ceremony and pomposity is what hides this cruel sense of torture. It's in the second half where the film (like the book) begins to lose its pace. Ross does the best he can with having to deliver a PG-13 film. There was actually more violence than expected. However, the amount of violence wouldn't have changed a thing as we simply don't know nor care about the characters killed. They are nothing but fodder for the action scenes. It's strange to feel so empty at watching kids die. There's never a question about how this film is going to end because it is too cowardly. The amount of incidental deaths caused by accident are so high it relieves these kids of making any choices. It's still a fun watch for the most part, and simply by being better than the book it deserves a lot of respect.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are the games themselves, which seem to have been heavily influenced or inspired by ""Battle Royale"". And then there is the political commentary on inequality -- whether this is a critique of Rome, America today or just this imaginary world is up to the viewer to decide.Jennifer Lawrence is great as usual, and it is nice to see Donald Sutherland in a small but important role. But overall I was actually a bit disappointed. For how hugely successful the books were, and how many people were excited for the movie, I did not find it to be anything really special.

Of course when a film garners interest the trailers become more and more prominent; this could be said for the newly released ""Hunger Games:Catching Fire"". Constant trailers and advertisements on TV....which led me to think...well i haven't even seen the first one yet. This led me to take up the opportunity that CineWorld had put before me, in seeing the first film in the Cinema in a one day special showing of the 2012 blockbuster...........but oh how i wish i didn't. Fast Forward to the end of the film and i walk out wondering what all the fuss is about and ahead of me i see an ever growing queue outside of anxious teens awaiting the midnight showing of the sequel. And it hit me like a bullet. This is why there is so much hype. I mean there could be no better an example of teen power than the Twilight saga. And this is very similar. Has any of these nutters seen ""Battle Royale""? That is how you do a film focused on individual survival. That is a film that shows you the depths people will go to survive. It doesn't hide from the violence and it doesn't over complicate it. It is live or die. Simple.Now this farce of a film is more focused on creating a love triangle between Katnis, (Lawrence) Gale (Hemsworth) and Peeta (Hutcherson). All this district nonsense, all this sacrifice, all the deaths...just for a love triangle. That is what the underlying story and forthcoming films are going to be all about; twilight anyone? It is one of the cheesiest films ever; made me cringe so much i was almost sure my spine would snap at any moment. That my head would go all exorcist and just keep going when i constantly turned away in dismay. This film is successful because of the vast amount of teens who are vacuumed into love stories and won't let go until a shirt is taken off. And anyone over the age of 18 who still enjoys this needs to grow up and go watch Battle Royale and that'll show you what would really happen in a circumstance like this.The film takes almost an hour to start and when it does start, it actually doesn't. It's slow, uneventful and the characters they try so hard for you to feel sympathy towards are so incredibly unimportant that you simply don't care.Yet another film, that is over exaggerated, over hyped, over advertised and over the top with cheese.2/10 (and that's me being nice)","29 out of 52 found this helpful.

He himself adapts Suzanne Collins' first book in the Trilogy, along with writer Billy Ray and the author herself. Except the colourful costumes in a scene or two, the story is uniquely set in an aesthetic and gloomy environment, unlike the gloss, glam and colour of a typical Sci-Fi movie; Cinematographer Tom Stern lets the effect set in quite well.The whole satire on the concept of reality shows, set altogether at a completely different level, plays out in an intriguing way. Though it's mainly a story about violence, it's depicted without glorifying it at all.The acting by the two leads is strong and convincing, especially that of Jennifer Lawrence who portrays innocence quite efficiently. The supporting characters played by brilliant actors like Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci keep the story lively. Guest appearances by Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland are also interesting.Overall, the story of this first part bears a lot of resemblance to the concept and story of 2000's Japanese movie 'Battle Royale', it's the setting, the direction style and the acting that keep this movie engrossing till the very end.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

May the odds be ever in your favor. "" The Hunger Games have begun and the odds are definitely in director Gary Ross's favor as he has managed to adapt Suzanne Collins's bestselling novel really well to the big screen. Ross has delivered a highly entertaining post apocalyptic, sci-fi, action, romantic thriller. Most fans will be satisfied with this film because it is truly entertaining and has a little bit of everything for those people who are looking for action, or for those who are more interested in the romantic story, and so on. It also has a great cast and the lead performance from Jennifer Lawrence is just brilliant. She captures the ideal female heroine who we all want to root for. She is truly the girl on fire. It comes as no surprise since Lawrence blew us all away with her performance in a small independent film called Winter's Bone. She has already turned into a true star and proves she can have a lead role in what looks to be a very successful trilogy. The rest of the cast is also pretty interesting as you have great actors like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones, and Donald Sutherland, along with young talented actors like Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, and Alexander Ludwig. They've really done justice to the characters that were created by Collins, and I can't forget to mention Lenny Kravitz who was also excellent as Cinna. As good as all these actors were, Jennifer Lawrence was above par and she really delivered the story and brought a lot of heart to her character. A great deal of the success this movie is having can be owed to her remarkable performance as Katniss.Suzanne Collins has created a very creative new futuristic world with some common elements from the past. The United States doesn't exist as a country anymore, but it is divided into twelve districts which are all controlled by the Capitol. The name of the country is Panem, and the further away the districts are from the Capitol the poorer its people. The wealthiest families live in the Capitol and in order to control the districts and avoid another uprising they have created the Hunger Games, which consists of selecting two teenagers (one male and another female) from each district and have the 24 teens face off one another until only one survivor remains. They force the entire nation to watch these games and it has become a popular sporting event, kind of like the Roman Empire did with the gladiators, except that the arena is much bigger as they have the wilderness to hide in. This serves as a reminder of what happens when the districts rebel against their capitol and at the same time it keeps the districts fighting amongst themselves so they won't form any alliances to try to begin a revolution. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the 12th District along with her little sister and mother. She is a hunter and is excellent with the arch. Her best friend is Gale (Liam Hemsworth). When the elections for the 74th Hunger Games take place, Katniss's younger sister is selected, but she takes her place instead as a tribute. The other member selected from the 12th District is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is very strong and has a secret crush on Katniss. Together they must face the rest of the tributes with the help of their trainer, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), the sole Hunger Game winner from their district in its 74 year history. The favorites are always the tributes from the first two districts because they have been raised all their lives to be prepared for these games. Cato (Alexander Ludwig) from the 1st District and who is sadistic in nature is their biggest threat.Once the Hunger Games begin the audience is immediately submersed into the story and Katniss's struggle for survivor. The story is really well told and there are plenty of thrills and suspense for the audience to enjoy. The two and a half hour long movie has such a quick pace that by the end it will seem like you were only in there for an hour. The games are really that interesting and have you at the edge of your seat for almost the entire movie. I really enjoyed the pacing of this film along with the performances. It is hard to get a lot of character development with a movie that has so many things going on and that focuses almost entirely on Katniss, but we really do grow to care for several of these characters that have to face off each other. Of course there is no time to really know all 24 of them, because the story centers on Katniss and Peeta. There is sort of a love triangle going on, but the film really doesn't delve in too deep with it. We will probably have more of that in the upcoming sequels, but most of the scenes involving Katniss don't have to be spelled out for us. She delivers such a great performance that we can hear what she's saying without ever having to say anything. We can read what she's saying through her eyes alone. When I heard about the story I thought this was going to be a violent film, but it really doesn't focus on the violence as much as it does on surviving. I really enjoyed every second of this film and it is my favorite film of the year so far.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

I think this is because they didn't adapt it from the books enough. you can't just film scene by scene from a book and and expect it to work in a movie, just because it worked for the book doesn't mean it's how it should be done on screen. when a book is written, the story is told but with a movie it is different because the story must be presented completely visually more or less. although the ""The Hunger Games"" portrayed all the Scenes from the book well, it did not feel the way the books felt. I give it props for being in line with the books, but certain things have to be different from a book in order to be a good film. it just didn't feel right. I'm not saying to cut scenes out I'm saying there is a better way of making the movie flow, that is different from the book. for a person who hasn't read the books, who doesn't understand everything thats going on, this movie might not seem very good, this is the fault of the movie makers. I honestly almost wish I hadn't read the books, so I could see what impression I'd have gotten when I saw it. but I wish I could have both views...","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is both great as an adaptation of the book(which, for those who haven't read it, is pretty good, not brilliant), and as a movie(almost everything in this makes sense even if you haven't read it, you can enjoy this whether you're familiar with that or not). Going from a first person perspective written work to a visual medium requires decisions made; inner monologues that explain things are made into spoken lines, and they here show things that Katniss(Young Mystique Jennifer Lawrence, who is evidently sticking with her young, determined independent female disguise... to be fair, she wears it extremely well, so why mess with it), our lead, does not see or experience. This does mean breaking up staying with the wilderness, the hostile environment(that is not as deadly or dangerous in this as in the source material), once the Hunger Games begin. That, by the way, doesn't happen for about half of this(similar to the novel), giving room for development, plot and setup(the contest is massively built up, and it really pays off). The vital characters are present and matter; Caesar, you love from when you see him, Cato is vicious, Cinna is very sympathetic, etc. This has phenomenal acting, by pretty much everyone involved. Unlike his daughter(X-Men: First Class), Kravitz is convincing. With the talents of Wes Bentley(see? This is how you use him, not the emo crap in Ghost Rider) and Donald Sutherland, we have faces put to the totalitarianism behind it. It really gets to you, and arouses emotion. One bit could easily have been sappy, and instead, it is just rather tragic. This is quite well-edited and filmed nicely. One thing on that, however... and this is why I wouldn't label this an action flick(drama-thriller, more like)... those sequences, the fights and such, are disorienting, and they shouldn't be. Why is it chaotic when two people are wrestling? Shaky cam and close-ups, please, just... no. The wish-fulfillment is present(young girl who doesn't know how to be, just coming into her adolescence, suddenly adored, going from poverty to expensive, delicious food being thrown at her(and no weight gain!), love triangle(which they do disservice to) from her having no boyfriend...), if less obnoxious. FX are excellent. This works as a satire of reality television, and goes into different themes than Battle Royale(that's about growing up and going out into the merciless world, this is about brutality as entertainment) There is a little blood, violence and disturbing content in this, as much as they could fit in without losing the PG-13, and they choose the right times to put it in, so it's effective as can be. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, and anyone intrigued by the concept. 8/10","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

The movies itself is not, though. The movie might be seen as an attempt to despise the reality TV shows, and it progressively succeeds doing so during the first half, but then is reduced to being not more than a bad parody of the Big Brother where the quality of the relationships are so inexplicable. Nothing is said about characters' motivations for their actions (which I guess has happened during the adaptation phase. There are extremely good guys and extremely bad guys.Adding more and more characters helps only to worsen the ambiguity, and the increases this gap between the two extremes.Dialogues are generally poorly written in a way that even in the most dramatic moments, you could only try not to laugh. If you can ignore these rather big issues, Hunger Game could only be an entertaining film to watch with your friends. especially that the story ends with an acceptable twist, making you interested in (perhaps) getting answers to the unanswered questions, though one thing for sure is that I won't watch the sequels in theater!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film has a lean and powerful way with showing this. Going beyond strict adherence to the book it translates the story into a cracking cinema experience. The director got first class performances out of his cast, his vision of the books was spot on and I really did not notice the 'shaky-cam' camera work. I also have to commend the wardrobe dept, the fashions of the Capitol were truly bizarre and Katniss and Peeta's 'Fire Costumes' were just right. I in fact thought the red interview dress was better than the one described in the book. The killings in the arena were brutal and tragic. The death of Rue was just as heart wrenching as the book and I thought Jennifer Lawrence wonderfully conveyed her dilemma over her feelings or Peeta. I also really enjoyed Josh Hutcherson's portrayal of Peeta. He was great in a very difficult role to pull off well. On re-reading some of the reviews I find it so amazing that some people are still trying to say that Collins 'ripped-off' an obscure Japanese film that was never released in the US till after this film was in the cinemas. I just find it so difficult to believe that she 'stole' ideas from a film that never played in her country. It's just so hard to steal ideas that you don't know were made, and did the fact that Takami seems to have 'stolen' his idea for 'Battle Royale' book from a previously published book called 'The Knights of the Forty Islands' count as a rip-off' as well?","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Mostly from word of mouth and random commentary. This allowed me to view it as ""just another movie."" While I thought the premise interesting, I could never put aside the question as to why these events had evolved in this culture. I know the whole thing is a metaphor showing how media, left to its designs, could be the destruction of us. That said, I think that ""Rollerball"" used the same basic premise, the hero tilting at the oppressive gamesmen. Here we have the young woman, who in order to save a small child from certain death, finds herself in a fight for her own life. Everything is orchestrated as a TV show with smiling show host who have somehow managed to be put in positions of power. There is apparently a greater power which is never defined that has a stranglehold on the populace. Other than being chosen to be on the show, it isn't clear what their methods of control are. I guess they will starve them to death. Maybe they have weapons that could slaughter an entire population or something of this sort, but I never got the message. I thought the competition was also confusing. Why did the powers intervene at times? Was it just good television or did they have favorites? Maybe I'm dense, but I also had trouble understanding the point of some of the competitions. The acting is quite good and so are the special effects, and I didn't dislike the movie. I just felt that it left a lot of questions unanswered, and that most of the issues have been dealt with more effectively in previous films. A side-note: Other than their being visually interesting, is there any other reason for the wacky appearance of some of the characters who hold power. Are they like the people who dress up for NFL games in the most bizarre costumes, face paint in all.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Without the context of the book the whole premise of the movie is basically a big ""WTF"". A better script/director could have overcome this limitation to an extent - some of the Harry Potters managed to stand up OK as standalone movies (although not many of them to be fair). Of course, the tone of the movie is *deadly* serious telling me that I'm supposed to care about these 'characters' and the ridiculous predicament they find themselves in. Maybe I would if I'd read the book...The ludicrous premise could also have been mitigated by making the attendant violence compelling - after all the premise is that the masses are entertained by the butchery right ? Which leads into the other major problem with the movie. The violence is completely neutered in order to achieve the necessary PG-13 rating to ensure mass consumption and make as much money as possible. As many people have commented, the build up to the titular 'Hunger Games' took a fair while (all without establishing why the Hunger Games made sense at all). Once the games finally arrive I thought 'OK now for at least some good action'. Unfortunately what I got was an incoherent mess full of ridiculously quick cuts so as to avoid seeing any bloodshed at all. Where's the tension and excitement in watching completely incoherent action sequences ? There is none. I guess it must have been exciting in the book...A lesser problem is the special effects (the flames and the CGI dogs in particular) which are very poor and obviously done on the cheap. The girl on fire scene was laughable to me although I got the distinct impression it was supposed to be a big dramatic scene. I'm sure it must have been in the book...","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

With fan anticipation running high, I managed to check out the Canadian premiere of the film a few days early. And I must say, I came out significantly more impressed than I ever imagined.Set in an unspecified future, one boy and one girl are randomly selected as tributes from each of the ""Districts"" that make up the country known as Panem to take part in The Hunger Games – a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of District 12 volunteers in place of her younger sister to take part in the games. But survival will not come easy, especially when she faces 23 other individuals.I will confess, I initially thought The Hunger Games would be nothing more than a dolled up, Americanized version of the absolutely brilliant Battle Royale. Thankfully, it was everything but that. For Gary Ross has helped create a film that goes above and beyond a simple adaptation. This is a living, breathing, full blown phenomenon just waiting to break out. He hits the ground running after a brief explanation of the titular games, and makes the film more and more interesting as it trucks along. I hate that I will compare this film to Harry Potter and Twilight so often, but it does so much right that the first films in these franchises did wrong that you begin to wonder whether it is because of the source material, or because they just found the right filmmaker from the on-set to bring this epic story to life.Lawrence, an Oscar-nominee for Winter's Bone, proves her worth and undeniable talent as Katniss. She carries the film on her shoulders from the moment she enters the frame, and never looks back. You feel every breath, every tear, every ounce of struggle she goes through. We already knew she was an exceptional talent before, now we know she is a star and this was the role she was born to play. She is very in tune with this character, and never wavers; staying strong from beginning to end. While the young cast of Harry Potter and Twilight took 2-3 films to really find themselves, Lawrence already knows who this character is and how to play it. Granted she stays focused through the next two films, this could go down as one of the best character portrayals in film history. Whether she is on her own or interacting with the rest of the cast, you simply cannot take your eyes off her. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, the other half of District 12, does a fairly good job supporting Lawrence. There is a lot left unsaid about his character (although significantly more than Liam Hemsworth's Gale, who spends all too much of his screen time brooding and looking longingly into the distance), but he is more than up to the task of showing off the skills he has been praying would make him a star for the better part of the decade. He does a lot of the emotional lifting in the film, giving his best work to date. He even helps make the more love-centric aspects of the story not feel nearly as dragged out as they seem to be. While the young leads are all great, I found myself most fascinated by the supporting cast of adult character actors like Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley, and especially Stanley Tucci. All of them are sadly underused, but are all incredible additions when they do pop on screen. I just wish it was more often.But what holds The Hunger Games back from perfection is its distinct lack of flavor or personality. The film moves at a wildly chaotic pace, barely slowing down for character or story development. It just moves from beat to beat, to the point where you can sense the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. And in this chaos, you never get a sense of what style Ross wants to infuse the film with. It has all the elements it needs to be a dystopian masterpiece or even a poignant and subtle social satire (ideas I already know will be developed in the future films), but it never quite gels together the way it should. It thrills you, but at the same time leaves you incredibly empty. I am not sure if this is how the book reads, or even if this was Ross' intention. Is he holding back on purpose, or is someone pulling strings to make sure the film does not truly become its own thing? I feel like I may be getting to the point of nitpicking (I will leave out my reservations about how shoddy some of the shots involving fire looked), but days later, I still feel like the film is missing that one crucial element that separates it from being a simply book-to-film adaptation and the truly wonderful epic it should rightfully be. While it may not be perfect, I cannot help but applaud The Hunger Games. This is the best first book-to-film adaptation since The Fellowship of the Ring, and did exactly what I secretly hoped it would – made me want to read the books as fast as humanly possible to find out what happens next. While it hints at oh so much of more, the film gives you just enough to stay riveting throughout. Lawrence cements her status as someone to watch out for, while Hutcherson and Hemsworth should brace for stardom. With Harry Potter an all but distant memory, and Twilight hopefully fading into obscurity, it's nice to know we have a series we can actually look forward to continuing. Bring on Catching Fire!8/10.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Sourced from a series of popular young adult novels by Suzanne Collins, the opening weekend is expected to make bank if not rewrite records. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has volunteered to take her sister's place in the upcoming Hunger Games, a state sanctioned gladiatorial event for kids ages 12-18. Presented as a TV show that keeps the 12 districts involved from uprising, Katniss is trained in both survival skills as well as presentation. Her mentors consist of Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), and most importantly Haymitch (Woody Harleson).Sadly there's at least a solid hour of buildup for a rather lackluster blood sport. Blame the PG- 13 rating if nothing else. The entire film is shot with a disproportionate shot selection. If you're into seeing the wrinkles on Elizabeth Banks, The Hunger Games is your movie. I haven't seen this many close-ups since Speed 2: Cruise Control. If the audience is seeing nothing but a blur of faces, they sure aren't seeing violence. Another thing they're not seeing is set decoration. As the story develops it becomes painfully obvious how this tale panders to the female psyche, resulting in a concoction that drives them to theatres. There's Katnis, the working class yet stylish heroine. She's talented with a bow and arrow, though I wonder how this futuristic society has overlooked the developments we have in compound bow technology. The men are cowardice. especially Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is teemed with Katnis as her counterpart to represent District 12.In just the realm of cinema it's obvious there are two sources of inspiration. The gorific reality TV comes from The Running Man (1987). The kid vs. kid aspect is found in Battle Royale (2000). It's the latter that compares best. Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is a tighter, more action packed, more dramatic, even funnier film. A classroom of children think they're going on a trip, but land on a deserted island with orders to kill each other. They watch a comical training video instead of sit through days of flashy interviews, chariot rides, and jungle gym exercise. The wildcards thrown in to keep the game progressing are truly fearsome and endless more probable than a computer program's summed canines. With each death in Battle Royale emotions pour out. We learn that everyone is connected, that some feelings need to come out, the value of friendship, and the price sustaining one's life. With The Hunger Games there are some bounds forged, buy the adventure puts them through few tests.The casting of Academy Award nominee Jennifer Lawrence does so much for the film that I wouldn't be shocked in the least if she didn't receive and Oscar nomination. You'll note how Kristen Stewart leads the fangirl series that is being unseeded, and that no one has ever considered her Bella Swan for anything other than a Razzie. If not for the eyes that speak without words of Lawrence, The Hunger Games would be a complete disaster. I can't stop you from seeing it but I'd like to encourage you to check in on the true source material, the aforementioned films.You can check out my (some would say comical) video review at my site VaughnOnMovies.com","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

An outstanding cast including Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson recreate the star-crossed lovers from district 12 using their different talents to outwit the Capitol. Set in the future, all 12 districts of Panem are expected to offer up one courageous man and woman to represent their district in the annual hunger games. Twenty four 'tributes' go in, but only one comes out and Katniss Everdeen puts herself up to the challenge of testing her abilities against her other highly trained opponents. Peeta being a naturally welcoming person doesn't find it hard to fit in with the Capitol and being the heart throb of the lot, he manages to wriggle himself in to Katniss' life and when Katniss realizes what is valuable to her, she is left to depend on him.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An Adaptation That Delivers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2585155/?ref_=tt_urv","cadillac20","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2619078/?ref_=tt_urv","23 March 2012","There's hardly been a film I've seen in the past couple years that's been more anticipated than The Hunger Games. The beloved trilogy of novels has been in the works for the cinema for several years now and if you couldn't judge by the number of tickets in pre-sale, then just go online and search for the legions of fans eagerly awaiting this adaptation. With that said, this would have been an easy film to mess up. We've seen it with Twilight and Percy Jackson. Luckily, THG is more Harry Potter and less Twilight.For the uninitiated, The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic America renamed Panem, where The Capitol is home to the rich and powerful and lords over the 12 outer lying districts of Panem. Because of past transgressions, each of the districts is forced to give up a male and female between 12 and 18 to fight to the death in the titular Hunger Games.Where THG could have gone wrong, it mostly gets things right. The pacing is relentless, the characters are well acted, Katniss is a very strong heroine, and the film doesn't shy away from places it could. But let's delve into some of these. First, for fans, have no fear, this is the movie you'd hoped for. All of the truly important elements are translated well here, from the downplaying of the romantic angles to the action being brutal and justifying the source material. As a fan of the book myself, I am happy to say I was pleased. Of course, the soul of this is Jennifer Lawrence, who does Katniss justice. At times a strong, brave leader, and at others vulnerable, this is the kind of role model that should be painted in these films. In another review, she was compared to the main character of Twilight, and it's a just comparison. Katniss is a very well balanced human, done even better as embodied by Lawrence, who channels some of her academy-nominated role from Winter's Bone here. To call her inspired as the choice for Katniss is an understatement. Watching her, you'd think this was the role she was born to play.The rest of the cast fares well, though they seem to come and go in flashes. Josh Hutchinson is great as Peeta, standing his ground opposite Lawrence in a part that is almost equally as well played. The bigger stars here do their roles justice and are suitably entertaining, with Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch both stealing some of the show in their respective parts, which both add some humor to the film. Donald Sutherland also stands out, as he usually does, as the devious President Snow. He's a suitable villain and one that is actually expanded upon from the book, which is nice.The pacing is a bit of a double edged sword. The film does a good job of not lingering on anything. There's little melodrama here, and that makes for a good, fast paced, exciting film. At the same time, the film moves at such a pace, and provides us with so much info, there is rarely time to catch your breath. Even the early parts are so filled with information and detail, that you feel as though they don't quite reach the emotional peak you'd hope they would. We do get glimpses here and there, and it helps that Lawrence has such great range in here role that she gets the right emotions out. But it also feels as though characters are rushed through. Haymitch never quite comes across as the emotionally damaged character he should be, instead coming across as the necessary mentor/teacher figure. That isn't to say Harrelson plays him down, because he still does a great job. But the character just feels like it never quite goes to the places you might hope he would.However, the quibbles with the film are minor. It is, again, an exciting movie that translates well. The futuristic America designed by Suzanne Collins is fantastically realized and the games themselves are every bit as exciting as you'd hope. Fans won't be disappointed, and if you're not a fan, this movie should be a good way to turn you into one.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But obviously the depiction of the future was a little... inconsistent. The lifestyle of the people in the districts seemed like the 1850's, the clothes looked like the 1970's, a few aspects seemed futuristic, etc. So throughout the whole movie, I was confused in the temporal sense. Also, they stressed heavily on the idea that some would die of starvation, dehydration, and so on in the battle. But none did. Only one death was not caused by another participant. They also stressed heavily on the fact that getting sponsorship was important. But no scene explained why sponsorship affected the Hunger games. Only from reading the books afterwords was I able to know why sponsorship was so important. Although the movie had some flaws, it was very entertaining and didn't leave me bored for a second.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But to guarantee you increase beyond your target audience you need to smart up. Where Twilight sets the bar, you expect others to follow suit. You hire bunch of good looking dudes & girls (who happen to be extremely talented) and dumb them down until you think they are just sticks in good looking clothes. But little did we know, some of them were taking notes of the mistakes Twilight series committed and made sure there movie version of another book phenomenon does not make the audiences roll their eyes over and over again.How good was Hunger Games can be measured by the audience reaction to the anticipated scene they had read in the book and yet gasp on every scene that struck a chord by its penchant melodrama between all the bloodshed. Truth to be told, the bloodshed was minimal in the movie version compared to all the gory details of each death in the book. This was still a packaged product to attract young to very young audience and would not expect 'Battle Royale' kind of gore. But the movie still packs a punch amid all the melodrama.Even if you are not interested in the teen love triangle being played out, you would find the politics interesting. It's pretty amusing how the pundits from Left and right of American political spectrum came to the conclusion that the movie justifies their political stand against one another. All in all, an entertaining movie that provided something for everyone to enjoy. That said the success does make the maker's task easier and provides a loyal audience for its following sequels. One hopes they do not just concentrate on marketing and focus on keeping the quality of their product consistently good.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Having not read the books, certain scenes seem unexplained and don't fit in the storyline. The major thing that ruined it for me was the incessant shaky camera and panning shots in particular throughout the early part of the movie. Why do directors want us to have the impression that the story is being filmed by someone with a camcorder? When projected onto the big screen this is both irritating and annoying and personally I find it very off putting. Weren't steadicams beyond the budget because too much was spent on hairstyles and costumes? The movie generally seemed a bit disappointing given the hype leading up to its release. I would only recommend it to someone if there was nothing better to see on the day they decide to go to the cinema.Negative Points: 1. Shaky Camera and over use of panning. 2. Overly long build up to the 'games' part of the story. 3. Predictable and a version of In Time meets Logan's Run, Gladiator and Running Man. 4.Story not even logical, (why on earth would a young girl of about 10 be entered into a gladiator style tournament against a 20 year old man?) 5. Poor casting. 6. Bad ending (obviously Hollywood preparing for Hunger Games II). 7 It's 2 hours and 22 minutes long.Plus Points None that I can think of but it might encourage more people to read the book instead.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is a great science fiction picture because of its pacing, cast, and portrayal of a nation that governs its people through fear and fascism. The movie shows a society that has collapsed. While the average person fights for survival, the top class and government can basically do whatever they want. Included in this is a barbaric cultural show, The Hunger Games a bit like Celebrity Jungle mixed with American Idol, but the losers die. It makes you feel emotion for every person who is on the ""good"" side, and creates an atmosphere unlike anything you have ever seen. Jennifer Lawrence is totally awesome. Emotion runs on high through the movie and I was on the edge of my seat the entire way through.

Violence sells and adults being forced to kill each other is so overdone!Who ever thought this was a great concept for a YA novel has a sick mind, whoever thought of bringing it to the big screen is probably even worse. If the concept itself isn't despicable enough (but can somewhat get a pass because the greater the evil, the bigger the hero who brings it down), it's the tone that's particularly distasteful. Instead of naturally frightened young people who were forcefully thorn from their families and what they know and thrown into a nightmare, it all feels like your everyday high school or summer camp rivalry, complete with the token mean girls and best buddies... because it's not like they're fighting for their lives against absolutely everyone else. The off camera deaths and lack of blood is truly what makes this whole concept so awful, it lightens and makes it feel like a harmless game what is truly ugly. Go on, show children and teens being shot, cut, poisoned on screen and let's see the uproar because of how that's inappropriate! Instead, we get this, the same concept, but without the blood and suddenly it's ok and appropriate for teens! What's wrong with people?Nothing to say about the cinematography or acting. They're good enough.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

So of course I noticed all the subtle differences between the movie and the book. However, I'm smart enough to understand that books and movies are in two different mediums, and thus cannot be compared to one another. I'm allowed to say the movie was a great adaptation on the book, which it was, but you have to judge the book with one review and the movie with another review. That is the end of my little rant, now it's time to review the movie.I thought Gary Ross did an incredible job taking a difficult storyline and piecing it together without losing all the brutal and cruel elements of the story. What I liked:+ The tone throughout the movie matched the tone of the characters. Too many times we see dramatic action movies try to add comedic elements to lighten the mood and add some comic relief, which I believe takes away from the ""mood"" out of movie. The Hunger Games kept a consistent dark tone from beginning to end. + All the actors were terrific and more importantly ""believable"" special shout out to Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, and Woody Harrelson. I have never seen a movie where I felt so connected with the characters and beating to the pulse of Katniss and Peeta.+ The camera-work! I know some people may not like the hand-held camera shooting, but I think it gives the viewer a first-person view and I'm going to throw out the word again ""believable"" + The underlying Score! Music isn't featured as much in the Hunger Games as it is in most movies, but when it appeared, it added to that dark tone that I loved so much. Kudos to James Newton Howard.What I didn't like - There weren't too many things I didn't like about the movie. Actually there is only one thing, I wish they showed more of the districts and capitol citizens reactions to the Hunger Games. It wasn't a huge deal for me but it's something that could have added to how cruel the sport is and what the citizens are thinking when there loved ones die. Overall, I give this movie an A+. I don't give many movies A+ but this movie is well- deserving of an A+","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I am a huge fan of the book and when I heard about the movie I just got excited as anyone could possibly get. Of course I still had some doubt. Every time I heard someone say it would be the ""next Twilight"" my heart would drop because Twilight is by far not anywhere close to the standard set by The Hunger Games. However, I went into the movie with an open mind and was absolutely blown away.The cast that were chosen for the film was perfect. Jennifer Lawrence played Katniss with exceptional strength and even grace that made me completely buy her as being Katniss and could not imagine anyone else as the strong heroine. Woody Harrelson portrayed Haymitch with a respect for the character in terms of how the character truly feels about the Capitol and showing him as a man made bitter by his life, which in my opinion was pretty much what Haymitch was. And Donald Sutherland as the vicious President Snow was absolutely terrifying in the role. He brought on the same aura of malice and hatred that the character was easily able to create in the books. This is just the first movie and I cannot wait to see what else he brings to the table in future installments. Now I could go on and on about how superb the cast was because it is true. Everyone brought something great to the table but it was Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss that held the movie very high up. The action and violence was also pretty gruesome and done just right so that it didn't go overboard but was faithful enough to the book that the violence wasn't undermined. The outcome of having Suzanne Collins (author of The Hunger Games) work with director Gary Ross to write the script for the film version was probably one of the best things to happen for this film. It is superb filmmaking at it's finest.In closing, The Hunger Games is a faithful film adaptation to a great book that is superbly written, performed, and directed to create what will probably be one of the best films of the year. The action and suspense will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the film as well as surprise those of you who have read the books. This film is about two-and-a-half hours long but the pacing matches that of the book so that when it's over you'll feel like its only been an hour-and-a-half. It never drags on but is always on the move to something more exciting than the one before. This film will stay with you for years to come and will make you think a little more about what direction our society is going in.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I have not read the book but my daughter did and explained many things the movie glossed over or omitted. I believe reading the book before watching might have made some things better. The acting overall was nothing special and I hated that Elizabeth Banks was almost unrecognizable under all her make up. Lenny Kravitz was the exception and did great in his role. The use of shaky cam and close ups during fight scenes was distracting and a trend I intensely dislike.

The intensity of emotion brought to the screen by the actors playing Katniss and Peeta is truly commendable. They drew the audience in with their charismatic persona's, which were backed by an intriguing post-modern storyline. Some moments were heart-breaking, while others were inspiring. Not advised for little kids, as some of the actions scenes are quite brutal, and harsh. However, it is a truly eye-opening look at the human condition.Definitely worth watching!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

This year, in November, its sequel – The Hunger Games: Catching Fire – will hit the theatres world wide, and there will be even more sequels spawning in 2014 and 2015. So, I decided to sit down and re-watch the first movie, and try to analyse once more if it's really as good as everyone says, and whether it deserves/needs its announced sequels. Like many other people, I hadn't heard of the novel until I had heard of the movie, and I never actually read it; therefore, I can't say if this movie is a faithful adaptation or not.The Hunger Games is, amazingly, about the Hunger Games – an annual manifestation in which two young people (one male and one female) are chosen, from each of the 12 districts set in a dystopian future state, and put into an area where they fight each other to death, and only one comes out alive as the winner. In case you don't understand this concept, don't worry – the movie will go out of its way several times to explain you the rules. Anyway, in the 74th annual Hunger Games, two young people from district 12 are chosen as tributes for the game, one of them being Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteered as a tribute to save her younger sister from the same fate, and the other being Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).In a certain way you could call The Hunger Games a 'style-over- substance' movie, because it spends more time developing the environment/setting/premise in which the characters interact, rather than the characters themselves. While the premise of the movie – people fighting to death until there's only one left standing – certainly isn't original (Battle Royal comes to mind), it's still a pretty interesting premise that will keep you entertained. Being set in a dystopian future, the movie nicely executes the portrayal of this future – with shots of the Capitol and the districts, the portrayal of the everyday people, their costumes, fashion and, of course, their fascination with the Hunger Games.However, the movie falls flat on a technical and character level. The technical problems in the movie include the unnecessary shaky cam, which makes the movie sometimes hard to watch, and the awful CGI (scenes with fires and monster dogs). The situation with the characters isn't much better: the male lead Peeta should have been introduced earlier in the movie, some potentially great characters like Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) should have had more screen time, and some other characters should have been more developed – like the bland bad guy Cato (Alexander Ludwig) and the forgettable little girl Rue (Amandla Stenberg), whose death exceeds her importance. The character of Katniss Everdeen is developed just fine, but the actress portraying her, Jennifer Lawrence, has an unusually stiff delivery and doesn't show her true acting capabilities. That is a shame, since she is a talented actress and she even won an Oscar in 2012 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook.All in all, The Hunger Games is a flawed movie but is still entertaining and has an amusing concept. So I think I would like to see more movies from this franchise and, hopefully, the sequels will learn from the first movie's mistakes and be even more enjoyable. If nothing else, the director Gary Ross – the man responsible for all the shaky cam – passed the opportunity to direct the sequels. Thus, the movies will certainly be somewhat better, at least on a technical level.

But in the case of 'The Hunger Games' I feel the need to thoroughly pummel the film because of its lack of originality, weak character development, and abundance of predictability. What do I think of 'The Hunger Games'? In a nutshell, think 'Twilight' with a science fiction spin. I'll elaborate on that point a little later.First let's talk about the total lack of originality. A strikingly similar premise was penned by Japanese author Koushun Takami in novel called 'Battle Royale' which was published in 1999. For those of you who don't read much – probably all the same folks who just love this movie - look for the same title on IMDb as it was adapted to film in 2000.At first glance I was thinking 'Battle Royale' rip-off all the way, but the more I thought about it, the more another author kept creeping into my gray matterthat author is Stephen King. He wrote a couple of short stories along the same lines. 'The Running Man' in 1982, and 'The Long Walk' in 1979. Heck, you can even throw in pieces of 'Cujo', published by King in 1981. I won't spoil the film for you, but you'll get the 'Cujo' reference if you feel the need to waste your money on a viewing of 'The Hunger Games'. If you're going to write science fiction or make a science fiction film, you need to weave a story that is somehow original. 'The Hunger Games' seems to have pulled elements from various King novellas. So, in my mind 'The Hunger Games' gets a big fat 'F' for originality. Enough said! I'm not even going to mention the fact that the filmmakers must have run short of money because it appears as if they borrowed the wardrobe from 'The Fifth Element' for the ritzy city dwellers. WhoopsI just mentioned it.Let's move on to the 'Twilight' referenceOK, you know how in 'Twilight' the only Werewolf and Vamp in town both happen to be in love with Bella? Well, here we go reduxthe only two stud muffins - in the supposedly poor hamlet of Katniss (the heroine), both are in love with said female. So what about hunger? Those boys were both built and corn fed. And that's another problem with the moviewhere are the hungry people? Lol Not only that, but the character development was so weak I felt nothing when folks started to die off.I could go on and on about the holes in this film but I'll stop here. It's enough that's it's not original, lacks in character development, and is as predictable as the lingering smog in L.A. I'm giving this film 1 star – which may be a tad harsh – but I feel the need to counter all the salivating teen girls that evidently love this film as much as little chipmunks love packing goodies in their cheeks. If this is the future of American cinema we're in big trouble folks! Let the chipmunk's rule?I hope not.","78 out of 160 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Good popcorn movie but falls flat in several aspects","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2589921/?ref_=tt_urv","rbferre","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16931738/?ref_=tt_urv","31 March 2012","I confess I never read the books this film is based on. I also did not read any reviews before stepping into the theater and I was concerned whether this was a movie solely directed to teens or adults like me would also enjoy it.What really called my attention was the outstanding box office in its first weekend. In short, I came into the theater without high expectations as most of the people who read the books had.At the end, I left with mixed feelings:I think the movie counts with great photography (although I hate the shaky camera trend), costumes, good performance by the veteran actors like Donald Sutherland and the Sugar Monster Lady, and a good surprise with the young leading actress. And finally, a nice way to show a dark, hopeless future and a warning to the descending spiral we have been taking with the reality shows.What is bad? First, the pace was too slow in the first half of the movie. You would imagine they do it on purpose to allow character development, but the feeling is they fall flat. Little we learn about the district 12 boy (Peeta), the past of the main characters like Woody Harrelson's and how the country got to that situation. Second, not sure if either the Peeta character is bad or the actor did a bad job, but he comes across very weak, and the girl is definitely who wears the pants in the relationship. Third, the fights sequences had no suspense at all. Immediate kills without leaving the audience at the edge of the seats. Fourth,the plot: So, the idea of the government is to have the Hunger Games as a way to avoid riots by the masses? Really? After 49 years knowing that every year a friend or relative will be executed in national TV? Isn't this enough to start a riot? Fifth, the Cato character is not developed at all - spectators are not really led to dislike him, he reminded me the bad high school guy in the first Karate Kid movie. By the way, shouldn't the lead actress be looking less healthy/hot for someone who did not even had bread to eat?Finally, the feeling is that the book is much darker than what we saw on the screen, and the producers wanted to lighten it up and get PG13 rating to boos audience. That leaves the movie suitable only for teenagers at most.All in all, a reasonable popcorn movie. Given the outstanding box office though, I would not expect them to change the formula for the other two coming. A real shame given the success of the books.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It delivers well for its book fans.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2588364/?ref_=tt_urv","gillianjaplit","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32686683/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2012","I read the Hunger Games a few years back and instantly became hooked on the series. When I heard there was going to be a movie, I felt super excited and also worried because as we all know, most of the time it comes out crappy (for example: Golden Compass *sigh* so much potential).In this case, the movie came out great --- for an adaptation. Probably one of the best book to movie results I've seen so far. For those who have never read the book, it'll come off as action-filled and exciting (and not just another 'sexy-hollywood-mtv-teen-movie' bull). For those who read the book, it'll be more than satisfactory considering a lot of the dialogue and scenes are the same as the book, seeing as it wouldn't need editing for movie-sake. There are some subtle changes, but nothing to make you rebel against them.Cast is good. Lawrence plays a great Katniss: strong, awkward, but holds lots of presence. They're Peeta however didn't make me giddy like the book version did. Gale is Gale, all angry and bitter. And so on.The style of the movie is awesome, love the shaky cam and the minor score/soundtrack bits. But the shaky cam does get a little out of hand to make sense of what's going on in some action scenes. Note: I didn't see one Mockingjay though, which was weird.All in all, I'd definitely see it again, buy it on DVD, and then watch it some more. I am a book fan so I will say that it could have been better, longer if anything. But hey, even if the movie was spot on, we'd all say that anyway because we imagined it better in our heads while reading.Hunger Games, take my money.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Each one of the 12 districts that rebelled against the capital must nominate one male tribute and one female tribute to compete in a battle to the death. On the reaping of the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence)'s sister(Willow Shields)'s name is pulled out of the reaping glass. To stop this, Katniss volunteers in her place and must fight against the other 23 tributes to get back home.I think this movie was made primarily for the fans of the series(like me) and not for newcomers. I recommend you watch this movie but I recommend you read the books first. If you hate reading, I cannot blame you but screw you. This movie is fine but the book is far superior. Nothing in this movie is particularly impressive but everything leans more on the positive side. It's a mildly entertaining movie that I probably only like because I really like the books. I'll say you can watch this movie and get entertainment out of it but you don't NEED to. If you'd rather watch the movies before you read the books, I don't envy you but I can understand were you're coming from. If you watch the film first, you will probably be a little bit confused because they don't explain things the best and leave a few things out but I imagine you'll be able to understand eventually. The story is completely fine and passable but it is kept afloat by it's awesome premise. Again, the story is better done in the books but I can understand you not reading the books because you shouldn't have to. Thus, I will not say that I have issues with the story(because I get it) but I can understand non-fans not enjoying it.Jennifer Lawrence is more wooden than a tree in this movie but I can understand that she was perfect for the role because the character being pretty wooden as well. To be fair to Lawrence, she does express genuine seeming emotion at points in the movie and I can't say she's terrible as Katniss but I think some more emoting would have helped. John Hutcherson displayed worse acting in this movie than Mel Gibson did in his Anti-Semetism apology. I hated him in this movie and I can't really explain why. I just don't like him. I like the character of Peeta, but not Hutcherson's performance. Woody Harrelson's performance as Haymitch Abernathy was the best part of the movie. He was great and I just wish he was in the book longer. Elizabeth Banks was off the wall as Effie Trinket which isn't surprising considering she supported Clinton(points! and I can say that because I'm not American). The remaining performances were mediocre(Liam Hemsworth) to barbaric(Lenny Kravitz) with some impressive exceptions(Stanley Tucci).A lot of hate was thrown Ross' way for the cinematography for this movie and while I understand the need for tripods, I feel that the style he was going for was the documentary style which fits more in line with the first person perspective of the books. That's probably just my opinion and I completely understand why someone would hate it but I personally didn't mind it. This movie was released in 2012 but the effects were finished in 1875, or whenever George Lucas began his CGI fetish. The effects in this movie are barbaric and it's disgusting they were even allowed. The set design is also extremely bland and generic in this movie. I wanted to feel the awe and wonder Katniss felt when she first visited the capitol but instead I was vastly let down.The action in this movie is okay but could have been much better. The world building is fine but was done much better in the books. This movie is a perfectly disposable dystopian action/romance movie which I can recommend you watch but it's not something you NEED to watch. I'll rate it 6 out of 10 PEETAS!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I would have enjoyed it more if it was just a bit shorter... some scenes were not that crucial for the plot. But, never the less, 90% of it was enjoyable for me. Here's a breakdown of the formula according to me: Cast - spot on; Acting - good; Story - very good; Costumes - horrible; Make up - not good; Special effects - average; Idea - already seen but it was refined much better; Directing - Bad, not sure why these directors today like the shaky camera that much. One of the most important aspects of any movie is that the audience needs to be able to see what is going on without developing a headache. The camera is shaky all the time, even when there's no need for it. Apart from that it was OK.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I haven't read the books, but thought the story was interesting based on the one-line explanations I got from others.I went into this film expecting to see something similar to the Twilight films (teen obsession over book turned film), but better.What I got was much, much worse.First off, I want to say that I thought the acting was great. The actors did a great job of portraying their characters.What WASN'T so great was the lack of character development. The death scenes, even those meant to be emotional, didn't affect me at all. I am one who isn't afraid to cry like a baby at a movie, and I often do. But while the others around me were sobbing, I was just ready for the scene to be over with.Another reason I strongly disliked this film, has to do with my title. It seems like 95% of the shots in this movie were closeup on the characters faces. These are fine, to an extent, but you begin to wonder after a while if the actors aren't all just bodiless floating heads. The fight scenes were quickly cut together, which could work, if you weren't zoomed in so much that you have no idea what was going on.For a film with a supposed 100,000,000 dollar budget, this came across as a low-budget independent adaption of the book. They could have done so much more to improve the visual aspect of the film as well as make the characters more likable.Overall, I would give this film 4 stars, mainly due to the great acting and costume design. Everything else, was horrible.","97 out of 203 found this helpful.

Just like that other big YA series about dead people and really hairy men, I had never even heard of ""The Hunger Games"" until they started discussing the movie. But the hype certainly peaked my curiosity, strengthened by the casting of Oscar-nominated Jennifer Lawrence in the title role. Yep, March 23rd was reserved a long time ago for ""Hunger Games."" Due to the absolutely incredible response and pre-sales of tickets, seeing it on opening weekend didn't happen, but the few days of delay hardly hurt. With phenomenal reviews and most considering this one of the best book-to-screen adaptations in recent history, the monumental, record-breaking $155 million box office take over the weekend just flamed the roaring fire of anticipation.And yes, unlike most other films with this much hype, ""The Hunger Games"" is one of those rare films that should have been buried under it but instead, not simply rises above, but easily surpasses all possible expectation.We all know the general story of it being about a bunch of kids thrown into a televised reality show which pits them against each other to the death as a way of repenting for the war-like sins of their forefathers. However, it is not an exploitative film about kids killing each other, but rather an absolutely thrilling film about class, survival and the basic good and evil of people.Jennifer Lawrence proves that her Oscar-nominated performance in 2010's ""Winter's Bone"" was not a fluke. Playing Katniss with an absolutely even perfection of awkwardness, shyness, remorse and bitterness, she turned a potentially very unlikeable character into someone we can all relate to, whether you're the thirteen year old girl who devoured the books...or a thirty-seven year old man who had never even heard of them. She is, in a word, captivating.But not only does Lawrence shine. In a role that could have just been a waste of a cute guy, the extremely cute Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids are All Right"") as Peeta proves he has far more to offer than just an extremely handsome face but some real acting chops to boot. In a much more minor role, but still incredibly memorable, Liam Hemsworth is just a feast for the eyes as Gale Hawthorn as is the incredibly delicious Alexander Ludwig as the evil Cato.Lest we forget the adults in the film, all of which are played by outstanding actors in their own right, and every single one of them at the top of their game. Stanley Tucci reigns as the host of The Hunger Games, Elizabeth Banks shines as Effie Trinket, Donald Sutherland is statuesque as the president, and in a completely surprising left-of-centre role, Woody Harrelson continues to dominate the screen as mentor Haymich Abernathy. Not to mention, I don't think Lenny Kravitz has ever looked so handsome as he is playing Cinna.All this to say ""The Hunger Games"" is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it enraptured me completely. Are there aspects I wish I understood a little bit better from reading the book? Sure...but that's why one has literate friends. There are mild imperfections, but all are easily forgiven by otherwise strong storytelling, excellent direction, perfect performances, incredible costume design and art direction and astounding cinematography and effects.""The Hunger Games"" was like watching the merging of ""Survivor,"" ""Lost,"" ""American Idol,"" ""Big Brother,"" ""The Truman Show"" and the Academy Awards into one spectacular event. The mere grandeur of the film leaves me confused as to how anyone could walk away even remotely unimpressed when the execution is perfection.Certainly one of the best films I have seen in a long time, the easily the best """"hype"" film since ""Avatar,"" ""The Hunger Games"" has easily left me starving for more. When ""Catching Fire"" comes out next year, you can bet I'll be getting my tickets real early.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

With some truly thrilling sequences and acting from up and coming stars, the film oozes teen movie, But I do think generally that anyone can and will enjoy this. It's starts a series off well and you can already tell by the time you finish it that this is the start of something good. I felt it was solidly a good film, and here is why so.The story starts very slow and you may think ""Oh wow this is going to be dull"", but it then really gets into a groove. The pace starts to go along nicely and we are introduced to new and big things that provide an entertaining end. It probably is good to say that the film really gets going when they actually start to really do things(basically enter the game itself), yes the story goes well with such things going on and the movie really isn't afraid to shock the viewer, very entertaining though.I found Jennifer Lawrence here to, well she didn't actually seem at her best at times but she does what is asked of her, provides a strong lead character. Josh Hutcherson also provides a good supporting character and his role is very un heroic but of course it works in parts and really brings out the potential the man has. Donald Sutherland is only seen little but you remember his face quite a bit, same goes for Woody Harrelson and both stand out mostly because of there resume in film.Gary Ross directs this and well, with books yes they already have a script but I think he was able to add things in maybe for dramatic purposes and his sure hand of directing stabilises the movie in it's more slow parts. I wasn't a massive fan of some the effects on show such as the city and natural effects seen but I guess we aren't supposed to focus on them, and with the a bigger budget maybe they could have been done slight bit better.The main criticism really for me though is the way the film starts slow, it is just TOO slow paced and it really affects it in some ways, not enough happens and the dialogues doesn't do enough to draw you in. I also wasn't sure about some of the more dramatic scenes which seem well, over dramatic. The over dramatics don't make you hate parts but they damage it and chip away at it's rating. Fans of the book should be satisfied I feel, even if it may differ at all, it still provides a good show piece for the series and what is to come from the sequels. I think those less accustomed to the series should also enjoy, as alluded to many see it as a teen movie but it really isn't, has some good action but also some smart dialogue which I think can catch any movies fans attention and let them have some fun with it.Overall it is Solidly a Good film. I said about it being chipped away at and that is what happens, it doesn't end getting worse it kind of gets better as it goes along and you shouldn't be bored by the ending, that's the best part. I felt there is a chance you can have an emotional bond with the characters especially in certain scenes, you want to support them all the way through and only the most hardened of cynical people would want to see them fail.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had never been a fan of books that were turned into movies and found that the biggest turn off from a movie is a huge cult like following. I eventually bit my tongue and went to see it with one of my best friends, expecting a mediocre film that was decent enough, but not worth a second watch. I have to say that after I watched it I knew I was very wrong.As someone who did not read the book, I went in completely blind. I knew the general idea of the story and that was enough to at least fill in the small parts that the movie misses, which is unavoidable. What I thought would be another Twilight ended up being alternate world with oppression and triumph as some of the main ideas of the film. I feel like everything fit together perfectly and had all of the characteristics needed of a great movie.Unfortunately, some people did not enjoy it as much as I did because they already read the books and were unhappy of certain parts being left out or felt that they were too high and mighty to watch something that many others were fawning over, as I had been before, to watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is and they really missed out.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I haven't read the book this film was based on so I can't make a comparison and can only judge it based on how it fares against other sci-fi. That being said...The things I enjoyed about the film wold have to be the acting, which was strong enough to carry the film, especially the lead actress. Supporting cast was also entertaining. The effects and sets were good and not overdone. Decent dialogue and costumes as well. Things that set it back for me. Definitely the overuse of close up with shaky camera. Very distracting. Editing was also a distraction for me as well as it seemed choppy. But my main issue was the lack of violence.It would seem to me that to demonstrate the stark misguided nature of this society the main characters (very well developed too) would have to suffer great anguish. The film seemed too PG-13 for me and left it very unbalanced. The horror that is the violence of the arena, much less using children, is just not there so the film really lacks the hard edge it would seem this screenplay needed to be effective.All in all though it was an enjoyable film well made for it's target audience, young women. I rate it 6.0 compared to sci-fi classics that hold the deserved rating of 7.0 and 8.0.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The next BIG franchise to fill the gap that Harry Potter has left in Hollywood (and Twilight...thank God that's almost over). Does it live up to the hype? In short...it's a solid movie....but not the greatest movie ever made.The acting was pretty good, and you can really tell that a lot of thought, time effort and money went into the making this book a realistic world (for the most part). People complain that its slow for the first 40 minutes, but honestly that's called character development. It was laying down the plot, telling us everything we needed to know to comprehend the rest of the movie...and did a nice job of keeping it interesting.As a whole, the movie was well made, the actors did their parts well, the story was interesting, and it did a good job of making us care about the characters, and drawing out certain emotions when necessary. My only complaint is that the camera was way too shaky during action sequences (as if the camera man was trying to survive as well). I'm happy to say that this is a ""teenage book franchise based movie"" that isn't a pain to watch. Looking forward to the second one. 8.7/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games are on live TV, like a real life ""Survivor."" Only one of the 24 teens (two from each of the 12 districts) can survive.
In the poorest, Appalachian-like district, teen Katniss is growing up modestly when her little sister gets chosen at random to be in the annual Hunger Games. Katniss then volunteers to take her sister's place and heads to the Capitol city as a heavy underdog. However, She grew up in the kind of wilderness where the Games take place, and she is handy with a bow and arrow.
As for the plot, the movie has problems: A big development happens because of coincidence (overhears an entirely private conversation), there's an unlikely alliance, an attacker makes the mistake of giving a lengthy speech before finishing off a victim, and the villains are not impressive.
Fans of the book will be angered by the lack of development of secondary characters. (I was more annoyed that the primary characters do not come into focus either, despite the long running time.)
Just like the Harry Potter movies, however, this one is just a sellout, like most movie series nowadays.Rating: 3.6/5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm guessing it means that no one OVER the age of twelve should bother to watch it.I imagine that any twelve-or-under will be well and truly wowed at the terrible vision of a future gone bad, where the poor are hunted and laughed at by their evil rich oppressors. However, being a man in my thirties, I kind of found it all a bit patronising. The rich are portrayed as evil. The poor good. This (pretty unsubtle) message is then repeated for almost every one of the hundred and twenty minutes this film runs for.A girl (with a silly name) is selected from one of the noble, long-suffering poor communities and forced to compete (i.e. kill) another twenty-three kids from neighbouring noble and poor districts. If fact, she wasn't even selected. She was the first ever volunteer for certain death, because her equally (but slightly more weedy) noble and poor younger sister was the one selected, but this noble and poor girl offered to die on her behalf. All the time this is beamed across the world for the evil rich people to enjoy.Luckily, the film's noble and poor heroine is so noble and poor that, despite being a crack shot with a bow and arrow, she's too noble and pure to actually kill any of the other noble and poor kids (okay, she kills about one, but that's it). They kind of do each other in for her, making sure she stays noble and virtuous at all times.Anyway, the first half of the film shows us how badly the noble and poor people are exploited by their evil and rich oppressors and the second half shows us how the noble and poor girl with the very silly name runs about not killing people in order to win.I kept hearing other reviews talk about how The Hunger Games is 'the new Twilight.' And they're probably right. Twilight was 'vampires for children/teens' and The Hunger Games is sort of an action/romance film for teens. They'll love it.Remember: poor = good. Rich = bad (just in case you didn't get the film's particularly unsubtle message).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

To me, The Hunger Games has an interesting take on an already well known concept. The idea of kids fighting to the death in gladiator combat has been done before and thankfully The Hunger Games pulls off the fear and brutality of kids murdering each other quite well and makes the combat legitimately intense. However the movie does suffer from some problems such as a lack of explanations to what is going (which is probably explained in the book), the annoying wardrobe, and the made for TV style camera angles.The movie establishes that in the future there are twelve districts that compete in a contest called The Hunger Games. For those of you who don't know, The Hunger Games is a competition where two kids from each district come together to duke it out with one another in a giant forest. Fortunately, the people who run the games care very little about the lives of the children and see them merely as entertainment, so some elements inside the forest are controllable just for the sake of making things more intense. The main character is Katniss, who is a quiet and responsible girl who knows how to use a bow properly. I will say that the acting is quite good in this movie, though I feel like Katniss should've looked a little bit more poverty stricken since she lives in the poorest district. The other actors all do a fine job, while I will say that Peeta kind of annoyed me a bit. One small annoying thing in this movie is that the wardrobe is ridiculous. I understand that it is the future, but it looks like the future of style was designed by Nicki Minaj. It just doesn't make any sense why the wardrobe is so goofy.Now there is something about this movie that I like and don't like at the same time: the camera angles/atmosphere. The movie is all about a show where kids kill each other, so naturally it makes sense to shoot the movie in a way similar to a TV show. There are a lot of facial close-ups, shaky cams, interviews, and stuff like that. This makes the movie feel like you are watching a TV show about a world with a violent TV show. While this is good in one sense, it also means that the movie is kind of pointless to watch a second time and in the long run the movie doesn't really feel like a... movie. That is why I can't ever see myself ever paying to watch this movie or its sequels because it feels more like I'm watching a television show than it does a movie. Some people may like that, I thought it was interesting but not exactly good.Overall, The Hunger Games is a good movie that does have some faults here and there but is still worth watching. Ironically the movie is talking about violence in entertainment and yet it is a movie where the audience is enjoying the violence in it. Still worth watching, though it isn't anything too deep or engaging.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was pretty thrilling and edge of the seat. The characters and the emotions were well depicted. But the movie could have been lot better. I felt as if they started it quickly and ended it just as. But some portions were better than the book though. The reaping scene for example, then the district 11 riot. Jennifer Lawrence delivered an effortless performance for the movie. Josh Hutcherson managed to look different from his usual chocolate boy teenage roles. Woody Harrelson was also in his usual standard. Other than the Rue's farewell score, there was nothing much on the film that makes one remember the hunger games.

So I can't comment upon the faithfulness shown to the work by Gary Ross, the director. However, as the script writers included Ms. Collins herself, I can assume that the movie is a fair resemblance of the book. I have been intrigued by the trailers of the Hunger Games for the past 5 months. I have read and seen Stephen King's the Running man and read the Long Walk which are also post apocalyptic books about the fascination of the Americans with deadly games. Here, the US is Panem. There was an uprising by the 12 ""districts"" and as an act of repentance, one young man and a woman from every district has to go and participate annually in the Hunger Games. 24 people go, one comes back. The first half is sensational. The buildup is laced with truly great moments showing the tense selection process for the Games (called the Reaping), the training, and the hunt for sponsors by the participants and then trying to woo the crowd either by their stylish entries or by their swashbuckling interviews. It is in the ""Games"" themselves that the movie falters. The violence is minimal which was, I believe, done for the PG rating. But that takes away the greatest element of surprise from the movie as you see the protagonist not even breaking a sweat for the victory. There is no character development for any of the other participants except the protagonists. The acting is generally competent but a bit wooden in places. Donald Sutherland as the President of the republic stands out in his chilly act. Woody Harrelson is wasted as the drunken mentor. The direction in the first half is very good as it is backed by very strong screenplay. However, if only the director had decided to take a few leaves from the director of ""Battle Royale"" on which this seemed to be loosely based for the action scenes, this would have been a total winner. This is a tale of two halves. For the first half, I give 4/5. For the second my rating is 2/5.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When the story reveals to us that young men and women would have to slaughter each other for survival's sake, we cannot help but be reminded of the infamous Japanese cult classic, ""Battle Royale"". And later, when we learn that the bloodshed is to be controlled and televised by a game master, ""The Truman Show"" comes to mind. We can sit here and try to draw parallels between these different worlds, but no. Any discussions regarding the film's possible influences would end in useless futility. ""The Hunger Games"" is independent in its desires and ambitions. It has a life of its own.This adaptation of Suzanne Collins's bestseller takes us to a dystopian future where the North America of today has become, in a word, kaput. Wars have destroyed democracy, and out of their wreckages the nation of Panem comes into being. The poor and powerless are distributed in the destitute 12 Districts while all the douchebags and oddballs can be found in the thriving, dominating Capitol. I like how the movie ignores the common vision of how people in the future dress in bland costumes. The citizens of Capitol have fascinating taste; their daily lives are spent with hairstyles and clothing that would startle cosplay addicts. The fashion trend there is so perplexing that if Lady Ga Ga lived during that era, she would easily blend in.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some die-hard fans of the books may be angered that Katniss wasn't narrating every step of the way, and we weren't trapped inside her skull; to this I respond, ""It's a movie."" Very few things were cut from the plot, and absolutely none of them were major. Gary Ross did an amazing job of converting the dark, immediate tone of the book to the big screen, and though some will be annoyed by the shaky camera shots, I personally liked them; they captured Katniss's very distracted, flighty view of the world. Suzanne Collins also did an amazing job of showing the back-story and logic behind the Hunger Games through scenes highlighting the Gamemakers, Seneca Crane and President Snow, highlighting that this twisted spectacle is being put on not only as entertainment for the Capitol, but also as a political tool to keep the Districts in line. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing; she captured every one of Katniss's emotions perfectly, really bringing her to life. The rest of the cast also gave amazing performances, and I am really looking forward to the prospect of seeing these actors again in the sequels. I strongly predict that The Hunger Games will become the next film series to stick in mind as a hallmark of this generation.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

However I had a lot of apprehension about it – with the hints of it probably becoming the next 'Twilight.' My conclusion 2 and a half grueling hours later, is that it is a stupid movie, made for a stupid audience. And it is bad cinema. Its target audience is most definitely the twilight fans lost at the end of the saga. Every single moment that might not have been 100% clear to the audience, was spelled out even further by a voice over LITERALLY telling the cinema what was going on. For example 'I wonder if they realise that it's a booby trap,' and then 'It looks like she has worked out how this booby trap works.' The reason that I felt that this story was completely unbelievable, was the explanation of why they have this class system and why they have these 'hunger games.' It was explained that it is a constant reminder of war, and so that there can be a winner that people can support. This is all well and good, if the movie had structured a society around this that worked. Perhaps if they had gone the way of propaganda and brainwashing, pushing the society to see these horrendous games as warnings to the people. This would have fitted in nicely with the media. That the media controls the world and the classes, entertaining the rich by the slow destruction of the poor. I just did not believe that a society that can create trains that travel at the speed of light, and a cream that can cure any cut, that they will treat people so cruelly that they can cheer when children are slaughtered with an axe. The constant use of shaky close ups, gave me a headache as well as confusing the hell out of me. In the two most important fights, the use of constantly jolting close ups left me unaware who was winning or losing, or even what was happening. It also didn't help that in these two fights, the two people fighting look EXACTLY the same. And was it just me, or did anyone find this movie a little racist? The whole notion of there being one sector that was mainly black, with black people representing them in the game. This is the sector that starts the rebellion. Also, I found it insane that one of the African American characters spared the life of Katnis because he had saved the life of another young black girl, we see no connection between them previously, and must assume they are on the same team because they are the same race. Also, another huge racial thing I noticed was that the entire upper class were white, there were no Asian's or African Americans, no one from any other race than Caucasian. And the fact that it is a fashion statement that everyone in the upper class paints their faces white, is just way too KKK for me. Maybe I am reading too far into it, but its something I could not ignore and it really offended me. This movie left me feeling really angry, because I know I cannot just walk away from it and forget about it – there is probably another 5 movies to come – and if the first one is horrible, who knows how truly horrible the others could be.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

But I was hopeful that it would deliver on thrills/suspense, and in this regard, I was slightly disappointed. The idea of teenagers in a contest to the death, though repugnant, is ripe with suspense - a potential mix between Lord of the Flies and The Most Dangerous Game (the original versions). The fact that many of them possessed special skills (spear throwing, knife throwing, archery) and such diverse views of the contest (some predatory, others almost pacifist) should have resulted in many hair-raising life-and-death moments. But, instead, the film seemed to defuse many of these moments with a choppy, almost disjointed approach in places.Add to this the over-the-top ruling society in which this takes place, thus straining the story's credibility, and I found myself having to suspend belief a few times too many, which is never good when the goal is to draw the audience in and bring them to the edge of their seats.On the other hand, the two main teen characters - played by Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson - were a lot stronger than suspected, which at least gave me an emotional stake in the story, which frankly saved the film from being a much bigger disappointment.All in all, I'd say that if you rent this to watch at home, you'll probably be satisfied, but if you like to save your movie theatre dollars for only top films, you're better off to wait for the DVD.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Perhaps it was Peeta who was miscast. There is nothing wrong with meat on the bones...but casting should be accurate. She could have done a better job of conveying her inner conflict and her defiance as well. Also... The cinematography was out of control. A Dramamine is highly recommended. They had such amazing scenery and set design and such psychotic photography. The costuming and casting is, in many respects, excellent. All in all, I wouldn't want the task of taking this brilliant novel and trying to turn it into a film... So ultimately it warrants my undying respect and approval.

But considering how extreme shows have to go to get an audience and one has to be more extreme than the next, who knows. Too nervous camera - OK, it adds to the dynamic, but in the movie theater it is a bit too much. The movie is otherwise well made and I will go see the next installment.

This movie really offers little new.The maniac played by Sutherland is without motivation, but honestly, he is a grown up beaver and butt head.

I found the books compelling in their narrative of horrific events, in the end delivering several shocks with the deaths and betrayals of characters I liked, but also some ingenious turning points. I felt the final outcome could have been more redemptive / uplifting, especially in view of the epic forces of good and evil this story deals with.The forces of evil in this hypothetical future America are spiralling decadence, selfishness, obsession with glamour, image and celebrity, and inhumanity – and looking at our own world, if these forces were to reach a certain pitch we can see they would indeed lead us to some such outcome as the Hunger Games. In Panem, the inhabitants of The Capitol revel in the ultimate reality TV, entertained by the violent deaths of randomly drawn teenage ""Tributes"" from the oppressed Districts. Those Capitol citizens behave just as the crowds did in the ampitheatres of Ancient Rome. The fact that the young people drawn by lot then sent out to fight to the death are first glamorised, feted and paraded in front of the cameras alongside an oily TV host, makes it even more chilling. Another strong motif is the vacuous sentimentality of the massed audience, leading them to gush at a possible love affair between the main protagonist Katniss and her fellow-tribute Peeta whilst being equally ready to watch them meet a horrible death at the whim of the Gamemakers under the merciless direction of their Chief, Seneca Crane.What stood out for me in the movie was Katniss herself. Played by Jennifer Lawrence she was totally absorbing. Her compassion, her courage, her survival skills and her subtle resistance of the evil in which she was forced to take part shone out. The intense concentration on Katniss's every move in the Arena made me feel I was there with her. Our attention and our hopes were 100% on Katniss. The empathy and support she won from her allies Haymitch and Cinna also made a strong emotional impact.The premise of the story, and narrative flow of the movie was highly unusual and intense. The cinema audience sat in silence throughout, a silence to match the silence behind the action for the first part of the film – save for a few moments in the last half of the film when emotional reactions were inevitable! Brilliant, unforgettable and a sharply-focused portrayal of some of the worst excesses of the western world taken to their logical conclusion.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, the concept of a televised people vs. people contest always reminded me of Arnie nostalgia-classic The Running Man. In retrospect, it's a pretty cheesy movie, but its execution with all its 80s gritty excess makes the idea chilling and believable in its dystopian world. My biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that never once did I feel the concept fit the world. I think it's a pretty good setup with the idea of a uprising that didn't work and that the upper class would punish them but with a kid v. kid battle to the death? There's something about the film that never once convinced me and it lost me right from the outset.Perhaps this is because the film so far removed from our world that there's no relatable one. On one hand, there's the districts which feel like a cleaned up Deadwood then there's the Baz Lurhman does Dr. Seuss civilized world. There's no believable sense of time transition from how it can get to its opening written setup to this world with its infrequent odd sci-fi flashes. It's trying too hard to have social commentary. Above all there's no heart beyond teenage angsty feelings and no sense of a morality we can relate to - albeit, Stanley Tucci was a delight and I wish he could host everything ever. Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence's protagonist is brave and I supported her but the writing was so underdeveloped that I found myself confused at what she was or wasn't doing a lot of the time.The film is just so contrived to try and force the concept to belong in this world. The plot is relatively easy to follow but there's way too many times when I found myself asking ""why are they doing this?"" without explanation and ""why don't they just do this?"" without ruling the alternatives out. I feel like the film never took a moral stance on the killings. Sure, the civilized world find it entertaining/punishment and the Deadwood world finds it tragic, fine, but I'm interested in the internal feelings of the ones actually involved. It just felt like their plan was ""to win"" but strategies were never revealed. Why didn't they just slaughter everyone while they were ""training"" with all the weapons? If they weren't allowed, why didn't the film demonstrate it beyond the few words ""don't fight here""? I never bought it.Maybe their plan was to just survive the best they could and stay hidden, but this was never stated. Why were people making alliances when there could only be one winner? It never made any sense, especially when there was absolutely no character development. Perhaps this is what you get with a film that's about the one thing it can't show with a PG-13 rating and shaky cam. I imagine these kinds of morality and strategy things are in the book and fans are just filling in these gaps by themselves, but The Hunger Games movie just confused and bored me with its slow plot-hole ridden script, unpleasant hook and unsatisfying climax. Give me The Running Man for the dozenth time instead, at least it has a bit of balls when it comes to its action.4/10","15 out of 25 found this helpful.

It had amazing visuals, the character development pulled me in, and everything about it was well written. The only problem I have, is that the author says that they had never seen ""Battle Royal"" until after publishing their books. I'm sorry, but that's a blatant lie. Just like thousands of movies and books that have ripped off another countries version, this is no different. The author saw a way to make money by ripping another movie off. It wouldn't be that easy to tell ""Battle Royal"" was ripped off by this, if not for the fact that it's so very similar. Next time the author decides to steal the idea of another, way better movie, they should probably at least credit it. Overall it is a great film, but the Author needs to be a bit more honest with their fans.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

With the good in every movie follows the bad. Although the movie has its very few bad clips in the end the good out weights the bad. Although there are many different point of views to look at all of the good one very interesting topic is the twisted romance. Peeta and Katniss were thought to be ""star crossed lovers"" to the audience. Although Katniss dose not love Peeta, she some how manage to convince the Capitol into her plot.In Addition, the action is a big part in the story. Beside story the blood and violence, which may intrigue part of the audience, it is a great aspect to put into the book. It is a great attention grabber to show the seriousness of the situation.However, the few clips may be non-appealing to some select groups. One group and reason is adults and the violence. Many adults may think this amount of violence is inappropriate for the younger generation and the consequences of seeing this much violence could be damaging. Last but not least, a great thing about the book is it was helped directed by the author of the book. This is a great aspect of the movie because many movies based off of books derails from the details that make the book a great book. The ""Hunger Games"" is a great book for so many different reasons that have gone unmentioned. Although the movie has its bad parts, there is so much more good things than bad.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Plot: There are 12 districts, there is a drawing to pick 2 contestants from each district to play in the Hunger Games( A killing game).I thought the acting in the first Hunger Games movie was really impressive. Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job as Katniss. She was able to Convey so much emotion and depth into the character. I also thought Josh Hutcherson played the role of Peeta really good. He brought a lot of depth into his role, and i thought his chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence was really strong. Overall, I think the acting in the first Hunger Games movie was a big part of what made it such a emotional story.In my opinion, the first Hunger Games was really well-done adaption of the book. I think the film makers did a great job of bringing the world of Panem to life. They made the movie feel real and emotional. I also like how the movie tackled some really big themes, like the power of nature, the effects of trauma, and the importance of standing up against injustice. Overall, I think the first Hunger Games was a great example of how to adapt a popular book series to a big screen, and a movie i would recommend to others.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have read quite a few of my fellow reviewers opinions and predominately they are folks that say the movie compares poorly with the book. I have no doubt they are probably right, in my experience only about 10% of the movies are as good as or better than the book (my one big exception that was Jaws). I cannot watch a movie based on a Stephen King novel, I thoroughly enjoy his books but they rarely, if ever, translate well to the screen.I had very low expectations for this movie. My take on it was that it someone trying to cash in on the Twilight series craze, and maybe it was but in my opinion this was not a bad movie. This was my first exposure to the young Ms. Jennifer Lawerence and I am here to tell you, she is going to be back in more and more movies, she literally carries this movie. So if for no other reason I glad for that.If you are looking for something to watch that won't hurt your brain and won't make you think too much this is good movie for you. It is fairly predictable, in ways that it mimics other ""future Earth"" movies. My only complaint on that score was that it reminded me too much of ""The Running Man"" which was not a good movie, but the concept was very similar.As I said, if your looking for something that's entertaining and you don't want to have to think too much, give this a watch, if you want a movie that changes you and in substantial way changes how you view life, don't think that you are going to get that here","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was refreshing, brilliantly played, and even had Takeshi Kitano in it. And then came the cash cow makers, yearning for fast-money franchise. Makes sense though, you wouldn't work for the lesser salary either. Their job is to make huge profits, and this usually comes with a total absence of feeling. Fair enough!But 'Hunger Games', really... It is the diet version of entertainment. A terrible actress to begin with. And if you have seen American Hustle or the recent X-Men movies, you know it is not ready to change. Jennifer Lawrence has no acting, no understanding of her roles, and to be true, millions out there are still trying to make sense with her Oscar...Then come the Art Direction... Again, no creativity, everything being taken from more glorious creators from the past. Make-up just looks like Ziggy Stardust had more offspring than we thought. Costumes look like 'The Shindler List' VERY unfortunately met 'Zoolander' with a failed attempt to ""Jean-Paul Gaultier"" the overall look. And let's not talk about the boring settings... Even if creativity rides along with inspiration, there is a huge step between referencing and raiding. This is clearly the latter.And yet, there is ONE beacon of hop amidst all this terribly annoying waste of time: the next 'Hunger Game' movie. Stanley Tucci alone gives more credit to the franchise than any other previous actors. Then of course Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. Obviously. Let us just hope that the mediocrity that transpired through the first movies will be washed away by this brilliant cast.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

It is not so.The Hunger Games is the first book in a trilogy (I know, they are either a trilogy or a saga nowadays) and the subject is nothing if not socially and politically deep. You see, in a fictive country named Panem, there is a Capitol, something very reminiscent of Rome in a technological Roman empire and 12 districts that are ruled with an iron fist. Each year each district provides a boy and a girl, randomly chosen, as tribute in order to fight to the death for the pleasure of the people in the Capitol.Now, the clichés that you would have expected at this point make their absence obvious. The main character is a girl, the games do not result in the destruction of evil and the win of good, nor does every character act like a piece of cardboard.Without revealing more, I urge you to watch this. The main actors play well, the story is interesting, the effects are nice, but not extraneous to the plot, while the overall feeling is of observing great injustice and being almost powerless against it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

One would imagine that since the author was involved in production, the movie is to some extent an accurate rendition of the author's intent. The story is well known so I won't summarize it here. There are two parts to this movie, the events prior to the actual hunger games and the hunger games themselves. In the preparatory part we get to know about the world this takes place in and a tiny bit about our characters.The world of The Hunger Games is emphatically separated into two classes- the working class and the wealthy class. The working class has nothing and lives in a colorless misery comparable to those living during the Great Depression. The wealthy are a colorful, depraved and repugnant bunch and look like something out of a Mozart musical combined with a gay parade. They don't seem to do anything other than revel in opulence. A whole lot is made in speech about training the candidates and about them gaining sponsors although for the purposes of the movie and the hunger games all this doesn't really amount to much in the end. Our heroine, Katniss is your typical Hollwood powergrl- like a CEO wanna-be with rabies. She treats everyone around her like dirt and we are suppose to admire her for it.Fortunately during the hunger game, Katniss becomes human and develops weaknesses, fear, and a heart. We learn almost nothing about the other participants/districts. One of them seems to house plenty of black people, and their candidates are also the good guys of course. The bad guys are the kids who represent some Sparta-type district that actually prepares their children for this monstrosity. They of course are the blonde blue-eyed devils. Fortunately we don't get to see a whole lot of child-on-child violence except earlier when a video of the games of the previous year is shown. The ""games"" themselves are terribly unfair by virtue of the random choosing of the kids. As a result you have adolescents fighting against children.Performances are overall good in this movie. Stanley Tucci stands out the ludicrous fake TV host of the games' broadcast. His fake ultrawhite over-sized teeth, his nasty laugh, his colored hair that's not fake black-blue but blue blue, is a delightful mockery of the fakeness of the media and its worms with their larger than life personalities.But the star of this movie is the story and how it maximizes social injustice to clarify it to audiences who probably don't understand that it exists. The vile and depraved upper class with its garish taste is not too far from what they look and act like in their gated conclaves. It's not enough that they have it all and that the workers and producers have nothing, they have to humiliate and debase them every year with this absurd ritual that sacrifices 23 children to discourage any future uprisings that could threaten the unjust status quo. There is some romance as well, which is tasteful, and well done and given Katniss' caricaturesque action heroine attitude, downright welcome. We also learn something about the thinking of those pulling the strings of the world. They don't want to offer much to those who have nothing, but a little bit of hope, but not too much. Direction is pretty good, but they could have cut some scenes short, and I'm sure there more background story, perhaps we'll learn about it in the sequels. It's good to see a movie aimed at young people that isn't entirely stupefying.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This week's flick I decided to check out was the Hunger Games, the movie based on Suzanne Collins' book. Now despite the international sensation that is the book, I wondered just how well the movie would live up to the hype and excitement that has built up over the past few months. Right now I'll tell you it is a decent movie, but for me did not live up to the craze. Perhaps the first thing I should say in this movie is how spot on the acting was for every character. As we saw in X-Men first class, Jennifer Lawrence's acting ability is incredible and very believable. Lawrence seems to have a knack for playing classic characters, and she managed to fill the very big shoes of the main character Catniss. Starring opposite of her is Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta. Hutcherson was a good pick for this role as his work in the past has required him to play that quiet, awkward, nice boy who seems to get caught in the most unfortunate situations and still come out okay. The duo seemed to have a natural chemistry for their roles, and their interactions mirrored what they read in the book. The mentors of Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) were also well done. Harrelson in particular captures the drunk, desperado quite well, yet portrays the concerned and caring tutor at the same time. It still surprises me how much of a chameleon he is as well. As for the other contestants, the casting did their jobs well and managed to select the right people in both look and attitude, especially Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Yes there are plenty of other actors to mention, but I only have limited space so I'll end this part with saying Stanley Tucci) was the perfect choice for Caesar, and his cheesy smile fit right in with the setting. But Robbie did they stick close to the story? Yes, they did, for the most part anyway. The crew in charge of this movie managed to adapt the book well, especially with the scenes and sequences focusing on the games. A lot of the man vs. nature element, or in this case woman vs. nature is captured with the camera work in the right angles to make one feel as if you were right there with Catniss. Most of the character interactions are shown as well, though a few of the extra actors have some laughable moments where they overact. What the movie lacks from the book however is a lot of the memories and internal thoughts that Catniss has, which as we know is kind of what the book focuses on. Parts where she is sitting in a tree, combing through the woods, or even sitting in a cave were a little less interesting without realizing what was going on in her head. Had they had that internal conflict it would have probably brought a little more understanding to some of the scenes, but again it's a movie and there is only so much more you can do. What else do I have to say about this movie? Well for one thing let's talk about the action. Depending on what you consider good action will determine whether or now you are impressed with this movie. Those looking for exciting, fast paced, weapon on weapon action will not be impressed with this movie as there is very little combat between the contestants. The little amount of combat there is a little difficult to follow, as the camera shows only glimpses of the fighters as it zooms around like a chicken with its head cut off. I suppose this is to avoid showing graphic kills on young kids, which is a good thing, but if that were going to be the approach I would have just skipped this scene. However, those who are looking for more the survival action and clever use of environment for killing, will be satisfied with this movie. Regardless of the action, the pace of the movie is good, not too fast and not too slow. All of the emotions you read in the book are in the film as well, and there were plenty of times I saw the audience quiver, cry, and cringe at the various scenes in the movie.To wrap this up, Hunger Games is a good movie that is definitely one of the better book adaptations I have seen in a while. With its fantastic acting, beautiful scenery, and accurate representation of the book, this film definitely deserves some attention. However, it still wasn't worth the hype for me and still has some things I missed from the book. Action wise it was okay, but again I'm more for fast paced action as opposed to the survival action seen in this movie. My final scores for this movie are as follows:Action/Sci-fiction: 7.0-7.5 Movie overall: 8.0I would say it's worth a trip to the theater and a good movie to see with friends, significant others, or even by your self. Until next time though this is Robbie K signing out.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Interesting film that fails to engage","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2656888/?ref_=tt_urv","tomgillespie2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3741220/?ref_=tt_urv","10 August 2012","It could be argued that we are living in the last decades of Western Civilisation as we know it. The connotations of our popular culture has all the elements of distraction from what actually matters within our society. Reality television is now the most watched entertainment, with it's collection of delusional contestants vying for their 15 minutes of fame, along with the populous need to both humiliate and celebrate people of little worth. This format of mass-distraction is mirrored in the fall of the Roman Empire, which had its Gladiatorial Colosseum's as both a form of distraction and control. In the 21st century, television (along with other forms of media communication) is used to control and sedate the masses, and foment apathy in the population. It is also a form of contagion that infects those who believe they can also be rich and famous with little or no ability or talent. This seems to be what The Hunger Games is attempting to comment on, within the context of a distopian future.Set after an uprising during a war, North America has been divided into 12 districts controlled by its centre, The Capitol. Each year one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected by a lottery from each district to fight to the death in a televisual show. From district 12, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), volunteers herself for the event after her younger sister was selected. Along with male contestant, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), are transported to the Capitol, which resembles the Roman cities that the film is attempting to align itself with. After training and attempts to get sponsors, they are let out into a forest world to fight.I really can't be bothered to explain any further the plotting or character narratives within this film, as you will more than likely have seen it before: The Hunger Games has similar themes, and has an incredibly similar storyline to both Battle Royale (2000) and The Running Man (1987). Whilst it's central character is played well by Lawrence (she has a slight presence on screen with her ordinary beauty), she has very little to do in a weak script, and obvious plotting. The films iconography is lifted wholesale from Roman history, and its depiction of a vapid elitist population fails to enlighten the initial premise (that admittedly could have been good). Within the first hour the film also manages to insult the spectator by repeating certain scenes of dialogue only 20 minutes after it was initially shown (""We are totally aware that that happened, cause not much has happened since, and it happened moments ago"").Writer Suzanne Collins has stated that the inspiration for the book came from channel hopping between reality TV and the Iraq war, but she fails to find a voice strong enough to contextualise all the information into a credible framework, and simply seems to use the idea to speak only to the idiots who watch the reality TV that she seems to want to criticise; in other words the idea has been produced in much more intelligent ways elsewhere, whilst The Hunger Games decreases its concepts to feed it to the masses. Back to the 2010's, it has been suggested that around 90% of teenagers desire fame. In this narrative world, this desire simply is not there. In conclusion, interesting idea which fails to interest - the film is too long, and it simply does not engage.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The box office sold over $200 million in tickets in the first week of the movie release. Did the movie really deserve the millions of views it got? The Hunger Games is about a game in which 2 tributes from each of the 12 districts compete in a game to the death. When Katniss volunteers for her sister as tribute, she tells about her feelings and the process of being a tribute in the Hunger Games, emotionally and physically. The Hunger Games movie is far less powerful than the Hunger Games book because it didn't give deep detail about the personalities, events, and emotions of the characters.The Hunger Games movie doesn't show the Character's personalities as in depth in the book. From chapter 15-18, the book talks about Rue and her relationship with Katniss. Particularly on pg. 208 when Katniss says, ""Rue has decided to trust me whole heartedly. I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes, she snuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings about her, as I take no particular precautions."" The movie doesn't show Rue's relationship with Katniss, which makes it seem that Katniss was exaggerating when Rue died. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting in comparison to the book because of the deep connection between the characters that we are able to witness. In chapter 2, Katniss talks about her Dad and how he died in a coal mining accident. On pg. 26, Katniss says, ""My father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my body with sobs."" She also explains how her mother ""shut down"" which left her the responsibility to feed and take care of her family. This describes Katniss and how she came to be a great hunter and resilient young woman. The movie scarcely mentions her dad at all, which makes Katniss's personality seem different from what it truly is. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting because Katniss's life is interesting, and if you leave out a big part of her life, she isn't as interesting. Chapter 1 explains Gale and his personality and relationship with Katniss. On page 6, Katniss says, ""In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale."" This shows how Gale and Katniss are close, and not just strangers. The movie shows short scenes of Gale which makes him seem different from what he is really like. The movie makes the book seem far less powerful. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting because without the personalities of the Character's, the story would be confusing and dull.The Hunger Games movie fails to include crucial events that happened in the book. One example can be found on pg. 49 when Katniss throws away the cookies that she received as a parting gift from Peeta's dad. She says she doesn't want them to fool her by being nice so Peeta can plan a strategy to kill her in the arena. The book doesn't show this scene, and doesn't really show anything about Katniss thinking that Peeta is a threat to her. This proves that the movie fails to include crucial events that happened in the book. Another example that proves that the movie fails to include crucial events can be found on pg. 38 when Katniss gets the Mockingjay pin from Madge. She later thinks about her friendship with Madge in the arena which gives her hope and pushes her to keep going and not give up, unlike the movie. The movie doesn't include Madge at all, which proves that the movie is far less interesting than the book because the crucial detail is very important in the story line. The final example can be found on pg. 168-171 when Katniss almost dies from dehydration. When she is in this situation, she thinks about Haymitch and if he really cared about her enough to send her some water so she wouldn't die. On page 170 when Katniss says, ""I have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of helping me at all."" In the movie, Katniss gets water immediately. She doesn't have to ponder about Haymitch and if he really cared enough about her to save her. This event was very important in my eyes, which proves that the movie is far less powerful than the book due to the fact that it failed to include crucial events.Although the Hunger Games movie was nothing in comparison to the book, it was a fun, action-packed, and interesting movie. I would recommend that you see the movie, but I also recommend that you read the book. The Hunger Games movie was far less powerful compared to the book because it didn't include some of the characters' personalities, crucial events, and Katniss's emotions. The book was more engaging and interesting because of its deep detail, so I STRONGLY believe the Hunger Games movie is far less powerful than the Hunger Games book. I can confidently say the Hunger Games movie was far less powerful than the book.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was a lot of subtext, in a lot of ways like the James Caan movie, Rollerball. It had, good acting and a good script, BUT, the director??. What is with this constant moving camera, extreme close-ups and fast cuts??? Whatever happened to the long shot. It all seems to have started with the Bourne movies and Paul Greengrass. Every director thinks it is cool and realistic for close-ups and moving camera. It's a crock. Its confusing in a lot of scenes as you spend half your time trying to work out what Is going on and in the action sequences looking for the sick bags because you are getting vertigo. Even in the scenes with more than 2 people, close up and fast cuts were used.Like when Peeta throws the weight in the training area. He picks up the weight, CUT to see the strain on his face, CUT to see the concern on Katriss's face, CUT to see the look of disrespect on Kato, CUT back to Peeta OH the strain, CUT to again see the concern on Katriss's face, CUT to see Kato laughing with his team mates, CUT as Katriss looks with disdain at Kato _ _ _ THROW THE DAMN WEIGHT ALREADY! A lot of people do not like 3D, Hunger Games wasn't 3D, but if it was it may have saved the movie from being edited like a gunfight in a spaghetti western. Directors of the world enough, bring back the long shot.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was impressed that they were packaged for a slightly younger intended audience than classics like 1984, The Lord of the Flies and V For Vendetta. As with Lord of the Flies, the actions are all the more disturbing as they are being performed by and on children.The premise is a little shaky. There does not seem to be any reason why holding The Hunger Games is the best way to keep the rebellious districts in check. However, if we accept that this *is* the way that The Capitol wants to do it, the way that they manipulate the population and the competitors is very well executed.The suspense is palpable throughout although the shaky camera that is one of the techniques used is irritating in the beginning of the movie. It is used to better effect during combat when it obscures gratuitous violence and conveys panic and disorientation. The violence was greater than I expected for a film aimed at young adults but the themes mean that it is not in vain and it is used to further the story.I must admit to liking films with bad guys who I can get truly angry at. Although I did restrain myself the urge to throw popcorn was quite high in parts. It is possible to get emotionally wrapped-up in the story and a few tears were shed. In some of these parts it was quite obvious what was going to happen and the suspense comes from observing when and how. Perhaps that is the inevitable problem with stating from the beginning of the story that most of the characters will die.Although this is the first of a trilogy and there are some loose ends, the major plot elements have been wrapped up by the end of the film. I did not feel short-changed as I have with others, but it did leave me wanting more and I don't intend to wait for the next film as I have not read the books yet.I came out of the movie thinking about a lot of things, and comparing it with the great works I have mentioned before. If I thought for certain that this movie belonged in the same echelon as those I would have given it a 10 but by virtue of conveying the message in the way it did, to new audiences, and making me leave the theatre deep in thought it deserves my high rating.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's definitely a movie aimed at younger people because the content is very emotional, but there is nothing noteworthy about the plot, the actors, camera or soundtrack. Everything is done by the book and the result is effective but predictable and ultimately shallow and clichéd.I want a movie to surprise me, either with its story, or effects or any other cineastic means. None of that happened here, and I even glanced at my watch half-way through... never a good sign.So... hooray for teen angst, but not much for the more mature viewer in there.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a matter of fact, I am quite shocked at how good it is. In my head it was somewhat of a ""Twilight"" phenomenon, so I discarded it immediately. However, it was misguided. ""The Hunger Games"" has an interesting premise, and a rather well thought out idea. The screenplay is well written and it achieves to keep one fully immersed into the film, and provides necessary thrills throughout the entirety of the film. I was so absorbed and intensely connecting with the characters, I got acid reflux from all the tension. Oh, no, I am not joking. Anyhow, the technicalities of the film need no discussion, really. A film with such a huge budget will make sure to clean up nicely and ""The Hunger Games"" is no different. The performances were, surprisingly, quite convincing and were not forced. Jennifer Lawrence is pitch-perfect as the leading lady, and all the supporting cast does a good job. I was especially stricken by the emotional connection with, and performance by the young Amandla Stenberg. It is sad we will not be seeing her in the second instalment of the series, but what can one do.Overall, it was a real pleasure to watch this film. Not only did it deliver unexpected thrills (at least unexpected to me), but it also managed to take the audience into that dystopic world of the future. How dystopic it really is is another question to be asked, especially in light of reality television and its ever-brutal entrance into the real lives of people. Quite often with dubious ethical, moral and taste breaches that leave one baffled.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I knew what was coming, and that is the reason that the excitement and surprises were less fun. If you expect that it will be action, then that's right, it will, but I have to admit that the action was really on a middle scale, you just know that the people behind the desk can do everything on the arena so it will be harder for the survivors to survive, and all of that things make everything less surprising. The story did have a problem, too. It wasn't as holding and suspenseful as I expected. Like, you know the main heroes, right? They look with wide open eyes and wonder if they are going to be picked up to be in The Hunger Games, but for the people that are watching, it is no wonder, because obviously, everyone knows they are going to be picked up. As for the pros of Hunger Games, I have to admit that they did a very good job with the music, character development (Even if it could be more of it) and some good action sequences, that was enough to hold my rating higher than expected. When the good enough action mixed with epic music did come together, I think they did a very good combo. Jennifer Lawrence played just good enough for the character she was presenting, she can do her job right. Rest of the actors were decent, and nothing I focused on in particular. But what the movie delivered very good is the moral about human value, and that everyone should be treated equally. It reminded my also on some old time Gladiator stuff. When innocent people were put on the area, so others could have entertainment. With a nice cliffhanger at the end of the movie, The Hunger Games were just ok, and nothing more than it. Could be way better, but for what they deliver I think it is just fine.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film avoids the pitfalls of previous best-sellers turned into films that lacked a sound structure for the uninitiated readers (as in The Da Vinci Code); it works quite well for newbies. The filmmakers have kept the main storyline compelling and emotional within the framework of an action film.In the not too distant future, a group of twelve districts has been punished for 74 years for a failed rebellion. Each year, they must participate in a random lottery or 'reaping' of their youth for a lethal competition, a fight to the death with only one winner. The games are grand, lavish events that are in essence, public executions in the guise of entertainment. There are specific rules and boundaries except when they suit the whims of the game masters. Food, weapons, and supplies are made available but not without an accompanying danger, and there are sponsors who can provide life saving assistance and support in timely ways.In one district, Katniss (Lawrence) is a teenage girl who is good with a bow and arrow and dotes after her younger sister, Primrose, and their mother. She is close to a boy, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who has strong feelings for her. When Primrose and a boy, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are chosen for reaping, it sets off a surprising series of events including a desperate sacrifice by Katniss as the chosen few must train for their lives in a competition that is televised nationwide. The contestants are feted like celebrities and are mentored by a former survivor named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) with support from Cinnas (Lenny Kravitz effective in a brief role). When these modern day gladiators are released into the wild, loyalties are tested and survival instincts take over, and a grand spectacle is replaced by a grim fate that awaits all but one survivor.Director Ross (Seabiscuit) knows how to tell a good story and he is aided immensely by a strong cast that melds newcomers with seasoned veterans like Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. Special mention goes to Elizabeth Banks as a macabre emcee. Lawrence (Winter's Bone) shines in a physically demanding role, but she never shortchanges her ability to show feelings and angst in a convincing way. You root for her and feel her pain. Her portrayal of Katniss has a genuine decency and soul which, despite the savage nature of the games, reveals her humanity for the world to see. Might her actions and deeds register among the masses and have far reaching consequences? This brave new world of deadly sport (that plays like a perverted version of TV's Survivor), is authentically realized by impressive set designs and costumes which contrast two disparate worlds-a pauper class of citizens and the gaudy elite. If much of this film's storyline sounds familiar, it draws from pop culture sources as Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery, and films like The Most Dangerous Game, The Truman Show, and The Running Man. Even elements of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984 come to mind with its oppressed societies and ever watchful video screens, and when cannon fire signals a fallen victim, it echoes moments from Capricorn One. The sacrificial humans are dubbed 'tributes', a contradiction of terms not unlike Orwellian propaganda and its mixed meanings e.g. ""War is Peace"".While The Hunger Games ends in a manner that could be considered a conclusion, it does leave events open to a followup. Strong, emotional ties that are formed during the games have powerful implications at home, and the outcome sets the stage for the germination of a movement. I for one am very curious what will happen next.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie was emotional when it needed to be, action packed, and stayed VERY true to the book. The readers of the book will most definitely love this movie. The only time when small details were changed were only in three scenes. Those who did not read the book will also enjoy this book immensely(don't know if I spelled that right).

I also feel a huge disconnect between the movie Gary Ross thought he was making and the material he was adapting. The result is a tone that works at first, but falls apart once we get to the Capital and the games begin.A rare blockbuster that I can get behind for its characters, themes and ideas rather than its spectacle. It's a concept that requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, but if you go with it there's lot to latch onto and contemplate.Katniss and her relationship with her younger sister is set up quite well, you feel they truly care for each other, even before Katniss volunteers. The camera is really shaky, and it does eventually become annoying, but I enjoyed how it was used at first. It made this world feel tangible, lived in.Oh boy, once we get to the Capital though, B-movie film making. Bad CGI, crowd scenes, make-up, etc. I get that it's supposed to be tacky, but you can make the content of a film tacky without it coming across as cinematically tacky as well. The arena is boring, and as I said earlier, the violence is glossed over so it could nab that PG-13 rating. Stanley Tucci is pretty awesome, but he's mostly there to explain to us the absurd rules. Peeta The Rock is an unintentional laugh out loud moment. Those dogs aren't explained well enough and they look ridiculous. The ending is pretty good, but it feels rushed. I don't know how big the books were before this film, but it's easy to see how this ending could have inspired millions of new readers who needed to find out what happens next without actually loving this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One thing I kept wondering was, ""How in the heck are they going to do this in the movie?"" I just couldn't picture how the film could capture the imagery and storyline. I was very impressed with the movie. The casting was spot on, the acting was excellent, and the settings were perfect. So much of how the movie was filmed was exactly how I imagined it in the book.Obviously, the biggest hurdle in any movie adaptation from a book is trying to encompass everything that happens in the book into a 2 hour time slot. Let me just say that NO movie can do this, and no movie ever has recreated the entire story of a book. It just can't be done in such a time frame. Had they done that, people would complain that the 6 hour movie was too long. Despite these restrictions, the film did an excellent job of capturing the feel of the book, and the emotions of the book.In my opinion, anyone who is a big fan of the books should watch the movie twice. Once to learn about what is kept, edited in the movie and to digest the differences; then a second time to simply enjoy the movie, knowing already what has been cut/added, and just enjoy the feel of the movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I actually wanted to see it because it sounded like more, and something interesting in a year over populated with remakes, rehashes, and sequels.Set in the not to distant future, ""The Hunger games"" sees a complicated world split up into districts. Where 2 children from each district must compete in ""The Hunger games,"" a nasty game off survival where only one will survive. Think ""The Running man"" meets ""Lord of the flies."" Now I'm going to technically stick up for this flick. Some have dismissed it straight away because off its love story or because off its restricting PG13 rating. But I've got to admit that a majority off the movie had me glued. Its just a shame that the unpredictable direction I thought it was going in (which made me want too see it right through to the end) takes the easy way out, which just so happens to be the most unlikely way.Overall, I think it's better than what adult men would assume from it, but not the work off genius that teenage girls will be making it out too be.

To my personal opinion the 1st book is an absolute masterpiece so i had a lot expectations from the movie. From the very firest second it was obvious that they would go it by the book. Very good location, very good actors and actresses. Jennifer is amazing as Katniss, same goes to Josh and Liam! Speaking in generally i'd say that for someone who is fan of Hunger games the movie is good enough but i have a huge objection about the script. Very weak script. First of all i think they shouldn't change the way Katniss got her pin. Secondly they forfeit the best lines from Peeta and Haymich. Lines such as Haymich's Stay alive and Peeta's You came here to finish me off sweetheart?, should remain while it's not clear if there's a romance between Peeta and Katniss cauz in movie it's Haymich who's throws the idea to Seneka in order to protect katniss. Despite the negative points you still feel the spirit of the book, while everyone, from first to the last cried at Rue's death scene!

Only a story of how the elite in the society suppressed these 12 districts, by allowing 24 youths between 13 to 18 (?) years old, kill each other in a speculative reality television series to the delight of the master race. It all ends with a slightly sad love story, where we can see that the female lead actor loved another.If the 24 youths along the way in the ""sick"" game had seen it pointless to kill each other, and had initiated a revolt against the master race, the history would have a much more meaningful content.So - Great movie production, but the story was so thin, that it for my part, came out as speculative violence.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was so excited for it before hand because there is a lot of action in the book that would be better seen on a screen. The book made the story exciting, intense, and it really drew the reader in. The movie was the complete opposite.There was almost no character development. If I had never read the book, I feel that I would have left the theater asking who was Katniss, Peeta and everyone else. In, face this is what my boyfriend experienced. The script writers did not include any dialog that demonstrated the bonds that the characters shared such as the bond between Katniss and Peeta, between Katniss and Rue, and between Katniss and Cinna. For example, Rue's death was supposed to be a heart-wrenching moment and the events leading up to it happened so quickly, that I did not feel that Katniss felt anything for Rue. This made all of Katniss' actions after Rue's death seem superficial. Also, President Snow did not come off as dangerous and imposing as he did in the novel. There are many other examples that illustrate this point.The dialog in general was very little and very lacking in sophistication and explanatory detail. I realize that the novel was narrated in first-person and thus there was not going to much dialog to begin with but they could have had better music to fill in all of the silences. In fact, because there was so little talking and music, I found the movie incredibly boring, something to book was definitely not. Maybe they should have had Katniss narrate some parts of the movie especially things that happened in the past, like her father's death and her family's struggle afterward. She could have been telling the audience the story as looking back on her experience. This would have been a huge change from the novel's present tense, but it would have provided the audience with more entertainment that just watching a camera follow people around the woods.Also, people who did not read the novel, like my boyfriend, may be very confused about some parts of the film. The movie skimmed over many events that were very important to character development or the story. These include Katniss's father's death, her mother's depression, and Peeta's kindness when he gave Katniss a loaf of bread. I know that a lot happened in the novel and that a movie cannot show everything, but they glazed over too many important things that were needed to give background for the story and thus depth to the movie. This includes that everyone outside of the Capital were starving. I did not feel this or how hard everyone in the districts' lives were from the movie at all.While there were some special effects, a lot more interesting things could have been done with the cinematography. Also, the shaky camera shots that were frequent at the beginning of the movie were distracting, unnecessary, and made the movie look poorly made.The one and only thing that the movie brought that was a great addition to the book was the behind-the-scenes information provided by the commentators while the game aired, the gamemakers, and the scenes with the Head Gamemaker and President Snow. It was interesting to see why the things that happened to Katniss in the arena took place.Overall, the movie lacked depth and intensity. This was primarily due to the serious lack of character and relationship development, the lack of dialog/good music, and the skimming over of major background story building. It was a poorly constructed movie that felt rushed 90% of the time and dragged on in unnecessary ways the other 10%. I would not recommend seeing it...","51 out of 104 found this helpful.

Amazingly, they have.I've just finished watching The Hunger Games with my 11-year-old daughter (who kindly gave me a running commentary on exactly how the film compares with the book) and was amazed at just how much I enjoyed its grim dystopian vision—a post apocalyptic world where freaky future-folk with crazy multi-coloured hair happily watch a group of kids killing each other with a variety of sharp/pointy things in an arena where genetically altered killer wasps, computer-controlled forest fires, and mutant man-eating dogs also present a very real danger.With decent direction from Gary Ross, a fine central performance from the rather lovely Jennifer Lawrence (who reminds me of a young Renee Zellweger, which ain't a bad thing), plus memorable supporting turns from Woody Harrelson (so cool), Isabelle Fuhrman (so scary), and Donald Sutherland (so loathsome), I have to admit that the film was a lot more fun than I expected it to be.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

We start off with very little empathy for the characters - esp. the well dressed heroine who does not look emancipated. There's no sense of dread when they get called because I'm wondering WTF is Tim Burton's Willy Wonka doing in this apocalyptic film. And then when we reach the ""city"" - its filled with a whole bunch of Willy Wonka type of characters - and munchkins as news commentators.At this point I'm really struggling to imagine a modern world where all the citizens of the greatest city in the world are dressed as Willy Wonkas. Sorry, I can't get that image out of my mind.By the middle half of the film - however - I'm warming up to the characters. Partly because we see very little of the Willy Wonkas. And it goes up hill from there on.I was pleasantly surprised that the dashing boyfriend does not make a surprise appearance. And that it did not end with a V for Vendetta style ending.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was pleased to find that while not by any means perfect, the film did a more than decent job of depicting the Hunger Games universe.The film is set in a dystopian future in which young people are made to fight to the death for the pleasure of the government in the titular reality TV show. It follows the struggle of Katniss Everdeen to survive alongside her male counterpart, Peeta, after she takes the place of her younger sister, Prim, in said competition.There were a lot of things that I liked about the film. First and foremost would have to be Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss. Lawrence proved once again that she isn't just a pretty face with her strikingly authentic performance which conveys determination, fearlessness, and yet also vulnerability. Other elements which stand out include Stanley Tucci's crowd-pleasing TV show host, the clever 'news broadcast' mechanic that Ross uses to adapt the first-person written story into a movie format, and the look and feel of the Hunger Games arena and the beautiful scenes within the high tech Capitol. However, my main gripe with the film was Ross's over-use of the shaky hand-held camera effect which disrupted at times my immersion into the narrative. I was also a little disappointed by the fact that some scenes in the games themselves were neutered to cater for the 12A target demographic, but despite this I still got a sense of their brutality and its implications. I would thoroughly recommend that both fans and non-fans of the literary trilogy check out The Hunger Games at the cinema for an exciting and also thought-provoking experience.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence delivers a nomination-worthy performance, Woody Harrelson does the same, and everyone else was great as well.

In fact, I really enjoyed it, and while it's not as great as Harry Potter, I think 'The Hunger Games' is something pretty great.'The Hunger Games' takes place in a post apocalyptic America where, instead of states, we are divided up into districts. Every year, the government chooses one boy and one girl from each (12) districts and they are forced to fight to the death in an arena, like a sport. We follow the main character, Katniss, as she struggles to stay alive, and fight her feelings for her opponent.One of the main criticisms this film has received is the concept of children killing children. I, for one, am not the type that is against movies and their content, mainly because it is an art form. So the concept really didn't bother me in this film, and I can say, it was really good. The leads are likable, the dialogue is good, and the action is fun to watch. There are a few tense moments, but that leads me to my problem with the film. Sometimes I felt the direction was a bit shaky, and it kind of distracted me from the experience.Overall, I think 'The Hunger Games' is a worthy adaptation of a great novel, and it lives up to the hype, and I can't wait for the sequels.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I paid more attention to it the second time watching and realized that every time someone dies the movie goes silent and cuts away. There is actually only one killing death shown, and it's by accident. The movie did do a good job at not making that noticeable, but it's still a big flaw. And also, why do the tributes have to be teenagers? There was no explanation to that at all. I hope the book explained that somewhat. I thought the end of the tournament was ridiculous. First there could only be one winner, then they announce there can be two, then psych, there can only be one, and then the last two are going to commit suicide, so the government decides two is fine again. If you want to see a far superior movie with practically the same plot then watch Battle Royal.

Not only are the main plots of the films intriguing and sound as a concept of its own, but there's a larger commentary surrounding just the hero, Katniss, and her journey.The scope of the story begins pretty small. The setting is in District 12, a poor, mining state where food can be slim and is described as the least important to the Capitol, home of the government and ruling elite. The color palette consists of bland neutral tones, depicting a dim life full of monotony. Over every scene before Katniss leaves her home is covered with a blue tint that sombers the mood. The primitive nature of District 12 is evident in the shaky camerawork and small flashes of small animals like squirrels and rabbits being consumed as food- unlike American society as we know it.The chaos of the reaping in which Katniss volunteers for her sister, Prim, is emotional though lacks a soundtrack. As an individual film, this aspect may not be glaring, but as a part of the Hunger Games series, this moment sticks out like a sore thumb against the iconicity of its successors. However, the film easily makes up for its few lackluster soundtrack absences with setting up a vital plot device: the four notes whistled to the mockingjays in the games. As someone who did not read the books, I feel like it would've been hard to imagine what it was to describe them on paper, because the ones chosen for the film fit perfectly.Having enough time with the tributes is vital to the plot. It's a bolder choice to use that world building in what could've been made as an ""action film"" because it could be perceived as just delaying the actual games. But I view this as a significant indicator that the franchise was in good hands that cared about a faithful adaptation, humanizing the other tributes, building anticipation for how they will all interact in the arena...Once the games begin, the cuts between the children in the arena and the game makers in the room designing the threats they will face underline the cruelty of the Capitol and of Panem. In terms of cinematography and colorization, there was a distinct change in camera style between District 12 and the Capitol and then the Capitol to the arena. Shaky camera styling makes a great impact in the cut between the Capitol and the arena specifically. The shots showing the tributes feel as if they are homemade from just feet away, running through the woods alongside them, while the cameras on the Capitol are smooth and reminiscent of the talk shows we see on our own TVs every night.Stanley Tucci may have the most difficult character to nail in the series, and he is the unsung hero of the first installment by far. Since there are very few names or faces assigned to the citizens of the Capitol, he is tasked with bringing an entire elite ruling class to life just as one person, Caesar Flickerman, and he nails it. It takes a great deal of talent to have a character that continuously, on a yearly basis, popularizes and shows off children just before they're sent off to their death as entertainment, yet still be a likable fan-favorite. It seems impossible, but he executes it flawlessly.So as not to spoil anything about the film, the review will stop here, but this is a great first step in the story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence (X-Men: First Class) participates as Katniss Everdeen, a mentally cool sixteen year old heroine who volunteers in place of her younger sister to take part in a periodic competition of survival and wit called The Hunger Games, a game of anonymous youngsters killing each other until they are whittled down to a champion. Selection is highly documented, the process is simple and unsystematic, one boy and one girl brawling in an unprecedented, just to make money and provide entertainment for the voracious masses. This journeying rampage has been seen in Japan with Battle Royale, and the nauseating fierce interpretation of the contest in The Condemned starring ex-wrestler Steve Austin alongside Vinnie Jones. Beyond this, games of survival have been part of the ethos of life since the ancient Roman and Greek sports. Survival sports have been overwhelmed with a new design, new combating technique and warfare, establishing itself upon the terrace with such mêlée films as Gladiator.Collins' novel poses a ravishing and penetrating energy; it's a stirring fantasy with copious abundance of themes, with innumerable avenues to explore character development and situational circumstances. Katniss is a character of riding emotions. She comprehends with the intricate notions of the game, the impending sincerity of death but also accompanies an astonishing warrior psyche, believing in the decisions she makes and the philosophy of survival techniques. The earthly feel of Katniss' hiding in the trees whilst she plots her safety or her next move really provide the story with a eccentric feel of the location. The futuristic tones of Collins's writings offer an alternative diversion to the aggression, providing us with an eccentric fairytale feel to it with an enchanting soundtrack.For once there are no sexual implications surrounding a female persona on the big screen. Instead we revel with the composite temperament of the mind as the violence has been stripped back from the novels; readers may find themselves a modestly disenchanted. A full catalogue of pointers such as cynicism have been toned down by themes of lighter tenor of selfishness, defiance and imprudent teenage pronouncements. There is a distinct thesis of the division of class. In District 12, Katniss' home village scour for food, clothe themselves in grey overalls, whereas the brightness of colour surrounding the mighty rich encompasses the differentiation between each district.The leisurely pace of the tale allows us to appreciate character growth, effectively giving us the opportunity to understand the notions of the trilogy. Not only do we feel the emotion of Katniss we instantly feel attached to Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) devotion and affection for his counterpart despite the two barely crossing each other's paths in the village. Hutcherson bright performance really tells the tale of Peeta's frail characteristics exploring his nervous qualities but knowingly suggesting he possesses great loyalty and honour to the sword. There is more than an inch of primal impact on the audience as the mystery of the battle increases the eventual showdown by using striking cinematography and resisting the push to provide the audience with an action packed beginning. The build up of tension is quite electrifying, giving a reflection of the various moods that encompass the temperament of the lead up to the ultimate clash. Truly encapsulating.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

In watching THG, I had hoped to learn more about the fictional time period that our characters are living in, who they are and what their lives were like before being thrown in to main event. Sadly, I was disappointed.The story line is an intriguing idea: In a post-apocalyptic society, 24 teenage children are culled from 12 poverty-stricken communities and are tossed in to a survivor-like arena where they are expected to fight each other to death purely for the entertainment of the ultra-wealthy class. And that is about the plot right there. No back-story. No character development. Nothing about Katniss' background, how she became such a good hunter, what family life is like for her or her relationships to Peeta (the other tribute) and Gale (the boy she left behind). THG desperately needs to fill in these gaps to round out the story, but the director chose to ignore these aspects and focus on the main event. Did he assume that every movie-goer watching this film had read the book? Truthfully, one shouldn't have to read a book in order to fill in all the plot holes that a lazy director deliberately avoids. Don't you think?It should be noted that this is not a kid's film. The idea of kids murdering kids for entertainment purposes is pretty sensitive material for any age let alone adolescents and young teens. However, they did manage to subdue the violence enough to garner a PG-13 rating. Thus making it quite easy to target the younger generation with THG's branded toys and trinkets. Now don't get me wrong here. Despite it's lack of character development, The Hunger Games is not a bad movie overall. The climatic battle for survival is pulled off rather tastefully. As I said earlier, the violence is subdued to a level where it's not thrown gratuitously in to the face of the viewer. And, for me, that's not a bad thing. I don't really want to see gory battles of children murdering children anyway. As for the rest, the visuals are quite nice. The District 13 city is beautiful. It's citizens are as plastic as you would expect - right down to their monochromatic clothing and hair. Some of the acting is predictably cheesy such as Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic drunk, Haymitch Abernathy, who in 4 days turns in to a supportive mentor. I was actually surprised by Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. His heartfelt sincerity towards Katniss seems believable. So I gave THG a 6 star rating. As the movie is definitely not bad and certainly watchable. It just feels like something is missing. Does that make sense?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That being said, I had high expectations for this movie and I am generally very critical of movies that are based off of books. I was mainly concerned with how they would manage to portray much of the content which takes place within Katniss' head as the book is written from her point of view.I was not disappointed. Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job in portraying Katniss, and if you read the book before seeing the movie, her facial expressions and reactions to each event throughout are EXACTLY what they should be.I would say the book-to-movie ratio in terms of quality is comparable to Harry Potter.

I saw the trailer and thought it looked just like a rip off of one of my favourite foreign movies, Battle Royale.It had it's similar parts, but in the most part it made the story it's own.The film is about a TV show called the Hunger Games. Every year 2 people from different areas have to compete in the games... they have no choice. 24 people are in an area and must fight to the death until there is only one person left alive.The film centres around one character from District 12, Katniss. She is a talented hunter which definitely helps her with the Games... but she has a nightmare along the way.The acting was actually quite good. There were a lot of good actors in this movie... some I had heard of before and some that are new to me. Katniss was played by Jennifer Lawrence. I had only ever seen her in X- Men First Class. She was good in that, and she was good in this also. Other cast members are Woody Harrelson, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci & Donald Sutherland.I am a big Woody Harrelson fan... he is in one of my favourite films ever... Natural Born Killers. I didn't know he was in this until I watched it... it was a good surprise.The characters are great. I love the look of the film and the characters. Their make-up and costumes were awesome. They reminded me in a way of a Tim Burton movie. They were colourful but creepy. The effects were really good too.The action was really good, but a bit gory for kids. My 12 year old daughter watched it and I thought it was a bit harsh for her. She was fine though and loved the film. I really enjoyed the action. There was some amazing fighting scenes. It was well choreographed and put together.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It was very enjoyable and I am looking forward to Catching Fire.If you would like to read more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=tn_tnmn","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not a heartwarming nor easy film to appreciate as it's dark and sinister tone punctuated with brutal violence(even for a PG-13 film) and callousness towards fellow human beings is enough to give anyone watching chills. All the acting, especially from Jennifer Lawrence is simply incredible. With such raw emotion and pulsating intensity, she's grabs your attention(along with the well-written script and dialog and plot) like wet rope and never lets go. She was simply born for this role and her performance will really resonate with audiences who had the chance to experience this dark epic. My only peeve is that some of the characters were not developed. The audience never got the chance to see things from the point of view from the other characters. But that's not enough to enjoy this film which is overall very dark with very little in the way of humor. I hope the next film will delve more deeper into the world and characters that inhabit it and judging by the phenomenal box-office results, I have become a new fan to this franchise. A second viewing is definitely not out of my league.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","This Film Continues to Impress Me with Each Viewing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3125826/?ref_=tt_urv","caseynicholson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29348863/?ref_=tt_urv","17 November 2014","I recently watched the first installment of ""The Hunger Games"" again in preparation for the upcoming third movie in the series. This was my third viewing of the movie, having first seen it in the theater and then having watched it once again before its ""Catching Fire"" sequel.That said, this most recent screening convinced me further that this movie is something really special. And I say that as someone who was very slow to warm up to the franchise at all. I almost didn't go see the film when it was in theaters in 2012, simply because the subject matter sounded gross and silly to me. That was partially due to a misconception. I had heard that the film was about a group of teens that are forced to kill one another, and it is indeed just that. However, I mistakenly took the title of the film to mean that there was also cannibalism involved, which there is not. In fact, the title is a bit misleading, as the ""hunger"" aspect of things doesn't play a major role in the plot of the film.That said, the film is actually very far from anything of the horror genre, and certainly is not a gory ""torture porn"" flick in the style of some popular horror movies of the last decade (""Hostel""; ""Saw""). Instead, what we have here is a dystopian story that blends sci-fi with fantasy, all while staying relatively down to earth. The characters are human and relatable, even while the plot is far fetched.In fact, the out there aspect of the film's plot is perhaps the biggest hurdle one might face in enjoying it. When I first saw the film, it was the bizarrely unbelievable element that was hardest for me to appreciate. In summary, far off in the future (or perhaps on a different planet--we're not really told if this is the earth we know), a peasant revolt against a ruling class of nobility is ultimately squashed. The punishment for the revolt is mass enslavement coupled with a grotesque annual bloodsport in which contestants are drafted from the country's various ""districts"" to compete in a winner-takes all fight to the death. We soon learn that this contest is televised and seems to be mandatory viewing for the entire population, and that the event has been going on for 74 years now as a yearly reminder of the cost of the rebellion.That scenario is hard to appreciate if you tend to not appreciate fantasy, and as such the film suffers from a similar problem that other films in the dystopian genre suffer from. Films like ""Red Dawn"", ""V for Vendetta"", and ""Clockwork Orange"" all ask us to suspend critical thought for a moment so that we can imagine life in a strange world where common sense seems to have fallen by the wayside. ""The Hunger Games"" is no different, and it can be hard to imagine a world that works so strangely as the one Katniss finds herself in. But then again, common sense doesn't always reign in the world we actually live in, and perhaps that's part of what makes stories like this so popular.Whatever the case, once you get past the oddity of the plot, the film is a masterpiece. Granted, it's a masterpiece in a very different way than classic films might be. It would be wrong to assume that ""The Hunger Games"" is the same sort of film as ""The Godfather"" or ""Gone With the Wind"". But ""Hunger Games"" nevertheless is masterpiece material in the way that it draws you into its bizarre world. The film both tells its story convincingly, but also makes you care about its characters in a way that is rare. You empathize with the characters in the film, in spite of their world and their situation being so very different from your own.All that said, I've given this film a 10/10. I really think that in twenty years time, this film will stand out as an icon of its genre, perhaps akin to the way the ""Terminator"" films stand out for those of us who are children of the 80's. It's certainly worth your time to watch this film. So, go watch it.....and may the odds be ever in your favor!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, even if not abundantly graphic, violence reigns. Much is due to the beautiful photographic work, the consistency of the young actors and Ross' detailed directing; a true orchestration of action, drama and tension - the support to this movies' dynamic. Here we have a thought on how natural violence lives with us everyday and the way we accept it, almost indifferently.

Every year, the Capitol hosts the Hunger Games, a tournament where a young man and woman from each district fight to the death until there is only one survivor. One young woman named Katniss Everdeen is forced to enter the Hunger Games to protect her little sister from entering. From there, the plot keeps thickening into an excellent cream sauce that makes up this film.Writer-director Gary Ross does an excellent job adapting the key plot of the original book into film. He fully captures the drama and the thrills of the text and translates it into a visually masterful piece of film. From the desolate area of District 12 to the lavish Capitol city to the intimidating forest of the arena, Ross puts the viewer in a world of thrills and chills.Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence once again proves her acting excellence by putting on a flawless performance as Katniss. She fully encompasses the honest emotion, strength and fear of the character that readers have come to know. In fact, every member of the cast from long-time acting veteran Donald Sutherland to newcomer Josh Hutcherson help bring the book to life in the best ways. The novel's message about class warfare stays completely intact and is even expanded by the varied narrative. It may not be the EXACT same thing as the book, as there are a lot of differences, but translating a book to a film takes a lot of creative liberties and I still thought that they did the best they could with this film. As of right now, I'm dying to see it again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I liked that there are more adventures and unexpected plot twists, and some moments in the ""arena"" - the place of the Hunger Games - are really scary, quite disgusting, and what is also important for many female viewers is that there is a romantic line, although it is not clear until the end of the book how the relationship between Katniss, Pete and Katniss's childhood friend Gale will develop.The plot is very well thought out and well in the course of the film we see the characters, who they are, what kind of ripe or rotten berries they are.

It is based on the first of a series of books no doubt written by a group of people (not just a Suzanne Collins) with the idea simply to cash in on children. It has the perfect recipe, popular actor/actress, watered-down violence and an unoriginal premise. There is nothing in this that hasn't been seen before, think The Running Man (1987) without the fun, or Rollerball (1975) without the originality, or Battle Royale (2000) without any good bits. It's made for 12-year-olds who have never really seen anything else other than maybe a Marvel movie or a Disney cartoon. To the movie, it's long, tedious and filled with unnecessary characters, wooden acting and you feel that's it's just trying to build up to the next one (which I shan't be watching). What's worse though is the fact it's fuelled other awful series such as The Maze Runner and Insurgent.I genuinely went into this thinking that it's the next big action series and that I might like it, but no. I hate this film, I hate what it stands for and 6 months after the last one has been released on DVD and Blu Ray, it'll be forgotten about like Twilight and it's audience would have grown up and started watching ""more grown up"" things.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

I hoped from that day on that the story would be picked up by one of the cable networks and turned into a 3 season series, or 3 mini-series. I was convinced that there would be no way to tell the story in a 2 hour or so movie. I was right that a lot of the back story would have to be left out of a movie, but the writers, director, and especially the actors (Jennifer Lawernce is outstanding as Katniss) were able to pull the story from the pages of the book and put it on the screen. The only reason I did not give the movie a 10 rating is because it was impossible to bring everything over. This may be the best movie adaptation from a book I have ever seen. If you have read and liked (or more)the book(s), I cannot help but think you will like the movie. If you have not read the books, do not worry, the movie has everything in it you need to know to understand the world in which the story takes place (and I suspect you will want to go get a copy of the book for yourself.)

The Society was set up with 12 Districts under the control of the state. At some point, there was an uprising against the Government in the past. The rebels lost their fight and as punishment, the Districts are strictly controlled. They are only allowed a small amount of food and resources. The surplus of goods are sent to the Capitol City where the inhabitants live a lush lifestyle. As a reminder not to start an uprising again, each Distict is forced to enter their children into the Reaping. At the Reaping, two children (a boy and a girl) are chosen too participate in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a no holds barred fight to the death. Only one participant is allowed to win, so children are forced to fight to the death. All of this is televised live in the Capitol City and the other Districts. Capitol City is beautiful with large glass buildings and beautiful scenery. Everything is very high tech and fashionable. All the inhabitants have to do for food is push a button and food arrives fresh, steaming, and delicious. Their showers are equipped with lovely smelling shampoos and soaps with a touch of a button. The people in the city are dressed outlandishly in bright colours and garish outfits. I got the feeling that they are supposed to be extremely shallow and only concerned with fashion and gossip. In sharp contrast to this are the other districts. The people in the Districts are literally starving to death with not enough food. They quite often have inadequate shelter and the clothes they own are old and worn. They have to work hard for anything they have and they value their family. Family is the most important thing to them.Katniss Everdeen is a skilled hunter with a bow and arrow. She sneaks under the electric fence surrounding the city every day and hunts for food all day long to feed her family. She trades in her daily catch at the market downtown for anything her family might need. Without Katniss hunting everyday her family would soon die of starvation. Gale is a good friend and helps her hunt and they share everything they catch. It is mandatory that Katniss and her family attend the Reaping. Katniss' younger sister, Prim is chosen as the Tribute in the Reaping. Katniss is appalled and offers herself up as a volunteer to go to the Hunger Games in place of her sister. Peeta, the baker's son, is chosen as the other tribute from District 12. Katniss and Peeta are whisked away to the modern and outlandish Capitol City where they are trained and scored to get ready for the Hunger Games.I was impressed with how the movie closely follows the book's description of the Capitol City and it's inhabitants. There are some things that are changed, but I think it was in order to let the story flow nicely. Even with all this, the characters don't seem as well developed as they should be. The relationship between Peeta and katniss seems forced, like there wasn't enough time to develop it properly. I think the movie didn't adequately portray what was going on between them. Also I didn't feel as if they got the point across clear enough that people in the Districts were starving to death. The opening scenes in District 12 seem bleak but not lethal.My biggest problem with the movie was the shaky cam used when it came to the fight scenes in the Hunger Games. I think they had to gloss over the really brutal and inventive death scenes that were so vividly described in the books in order to give it a PG-13 rating. It was hard to focus when the camera was shaking and blurry during any kind of fight scene. Maybe this made them seem more action packed to the audience? Maybe this helped gloss over the fact that 12 year olds were killing each other? I am not saying that I am disappointed with the level of violence shown because I wasn't expecting anything more graphic, I just think they down played it a bit too much. When a major character dies during the games, it seems too rushed or forced with false emotions. As is if the audience never got to know that character in the first place and then the grieving seems excessive and out of place. I could tell they were setting this movie up to be the first in a very popular series. But, I enjoyed the movie for what it is...A futuristic Sci Fi Action movie. If you are expecting a Horror genre movie, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are expecting a nice action movie with a bit of romance in it you will enjoy it. So I would recommend going to see it with an open mind and no pre-conceived ideas of what it should be. Do not compare it to any earlier movies, because it has it's own unique story, characters, and setting. Happy Hunger Games and may the odds be ever in your favour!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The emotional beats just don't work as they should here, coming across as matter-of-fact and distant. Thankfully, the film becomes much more affecting once its eponymous game gets under way, with one of its deaths actually having quite a strong impact. It's during this segment that the piece is at its best overall, too, as it shifts gears into the horror-adjacent and does a good job at portraying the hopeless brutality of its forced teen-on-teen violence. Ross' over-the-top shaky cam lends this segment a slightly faux-documentary feel which boosts its grittiness and hides the flaws in its staging. For some reason, the technique is applied to the whole affair, causing even the most static scenes to bob and weave more than a rickety boat. It sometimes borders on provoking motion sickness, and the far-too-fast cuts take away from the reality of quite a few static scenes. Still, the direction works during the so-called game and this is where the movie is at its best. This extended sequence is as exciting as it is suspenseful and you care about the fate of the core characters despite their previously underwhelming development. A lot of this is probably due to the strong performances from all those involved, especially Lawrence, Hutcherson and Harrelson. That trio adds a lot of gravitas to what could otherwise be a forgettable affair, anchoring the experience in some twisted form of dystopian reality and giving genuine weight to the oppressive events within it. Overall, the picture is uneven, yet mostly successful. Its first half is weak and its second half is strong. As such, it emerges as a solid experience. It's a little too long for its own good and some of its tertiary players don't seem like actual characters, but it's an admirable effort with plenty of compelling elements.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had been waiting for this movie for as long as it was announced it was coming out. A year? I am a huge fan of the books and I know many others who are as well. This is a brilliant reflection on the human species, our society, and our government.I can't stand people who try to compare this to other movies, because this isn't trying to be another movie. This is telling Katniss' and Peta's stories. And the stories of the struggles of the districts.Anyway, the cinematography is great. The make-up and clothes of the capitol are right-on. The differences in the quality of life of the districts and the Capitol are portrayed very well. As far as I can remember, the action at the Games seems about right. I was glad to see that they didn't focus on the gore. That's not really the point. I'm glad there was time spent on Rue and District 11.Now my gripes. Why did you half-ass the CG of the dogs?!!! WHY!? I wanted to see that SO bad! For those who don't know, the bad-ass dogs are actually supposed to be some kind of man-made mutt, where each dog resembles an individual dead tribute. It royally screws with Katniss' head, and she has trouble killing them. And I wanted to see what a make-up artist imagined them to look like. So boooo! I had a couple minor gripes about little things that happened differently in the book. I imagine that they were changed for the movie because they don't have a major impact on the plot or story, and there really wasn't time to develop another character just to give Katniss the Mockingjay pin. Just little things which weren't a really big deal (that I noticed anyway) What carries this movie is the story. The people are being oppressed and controlled by the Capitol. I'm glad Katniss wasn't made up too much in the movie to be too beautiful (with make-up etc). The mood seemed right. Everything was pretty dark and dreary. Everyone seemed oppressed and depressed. That was right on. There were some quick scenes that reveal Katniss' past and that of her family and District. I'm not sure if someone who hadn't read the books would have noticed what they meant. I don't think it was pointed out that the Mockingjay became the symbol of the previous revolution, and Katniss was wearing it during the Hunger Games.I went to see this at IMAX with a bunch of friends. Must of them hadn't read the books. They seemed to enjoy this movie the most: probably because they didn't know how it would end. They had wide-open eyes and big smiles after the movie. Then, we all had a great discussion afterward. Unfortunately, my friends are perpetually tardy, so we had to sit so close, I couldn't fit the entire screen in my peripheral. I'll have to go see it again to appreciate it better.In closing.... Go see this movie. You won't be disappointed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Was it going to be a mediocre PG-13 film with a bad plot and with bland performances like that of the ""Twilight""- franchise, or would it lean more towards uncompromising violence and a story of the human condition when faced with the extreme like in ""Battle Royale""? I left the theatre thinking it was neither of the two and perhaps that it was a bit constrained.Finding the dystopian look on future North America to be compelling though, I decided to give the book a chance at reading, curious to see if it was any better than the film. The book instantly got me hooked and I realized I needed to watch the film adaptation over again. To my surprise, it was better than the first time.The film is very true to the source material and director Gary Ross envisions the different milieus of Panem perfectly. The locations in every scene are in absolute compliance with those in the book.Jennifer Lawrence, playing the lead character Katniss Everdeen, delivers a great performance as a vulnerable adolescent girl with a tough exterior. Although her character could have developed a bit more, she is in no way devoid of emotion. Emotion she shows aplenty throughout the film. I also liked Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Haymitch. He was funny, believable and easy to like. As for the rest of the cast, their performances were good in general so kudos to the casting director.Another thing I liked was the score by James Newton Howard, arguably the best composer for cinema these days. It really set the mood for the various scenes and I especially loved the song Rue's Farewell.One of the things I disliked about the film was the shaky camera during the battle scenes. It did perhaps add to the sense of suspense, but one could see fairly little of what was going on at times. Understandably, this was to be able to reach out to a larger crowd of movie-goers. Additionally I found it slightly ironic and puzzling how little actual hunger there were in the games.So overall ""The hunger Games"" was enthralling and quite excellent. It is satirical and in many ways, it surpasses most films aimed at a younger crowd. The film series will be worth looking forward to in the years to come and the prospects for the upcoming sequels are looking bright I would say.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Before you ask: Yes, I AM a fan of the books, and I can say that the Hunger Games movie, directed by the great Gary Ross, is one seriously good movie.In the country of Panem, the 74th Hunger Games - a yearly event where one girl and boy between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of twelve districts compete to the death in an arena - is taking place. Katniss Everdeen of District 12 volunteers to compete in place of her younger sister, traveling to the Capitol of Panem with fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark, a boy with ties to Katniss's past. As the tournament looms closer, Katniss and Peeta begin training and preparing for what will come in the arena, fighting against kids from other districts who've trained for this their whole lives.As a director, Gary Ross' visual style is impressive. He's an expert at structure and staging, pacing the movie perfectly, and making it look and sound fantastic, especially Tom Stern's involving cinematography. But beneath the flashy aesthetics is also a film of genuine depth. If you're watching for full on action, look elsewhere. Any action scenes are lucky if they're longer than two minutes, but what I appreciate is that action is entirely not the point. The movie is more interested in building intensity and emotion to match the huge scope. Surprising depth also lies within the ideas the story presents. Themes of corruption in politics and government, social inequality, as well as society's disturbing thirst for exploitative reality television is explored very often. If I have any major complaints, I guess I'd say that the ending definitely rushes things.As far as talent goes, look no further than that of the lovely Jennifer Lawrence, who fits the role of Katniss like a glove. Katniss can be thought of as an enhancement of Lawrence's fantastic Oscar nominated performance in Winter's Bone. Her emotional range and confidence adds so much to this character. Tough, fearless, and highly likable, Katniss is one of the greatest movie heroines in years. A fine young group of actors that play tributes from other districts are exceptional, and there's also a stellar cast of supporting adults that includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, and a virtually unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks. Scene stealer notice must go to Stanley Tucci. With razor sharp comedic timing, charismatic enthusiasm, and unexpected warmth, his Caesar Flickerman rocks the movie.What can be expected of the inevitable Catching Fire? Well, My anticipation will be sky high. On a side note, a little fun fact: Second unit portions of the movie were directed by master of versatility Steven Soderbergh. So Hollywood, if you're reading this, please get Soderbergh on board to direct the sequel.****1/2/ *****","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With its genre, the audience should feel the fear of being in an unknown territory surrounded by blood-thirsty teenagers and the compassion as the characters develop throughout the story.I haven't read the book so I don't know what the movie lacks or what elements were overrated but based on what I've watched; the story has something the movie wasn't able to show maybe because of the rating or maybe the people behind the camera are just ""playing safe.""Because of the theme and genre similarity, people who have watched Battle Royale can't help but to compare the 2 but for some reasons, I can't say that The Hunger Games is a Battle Royale rip-off. However, Battle Royale left me thinking; ""If I was there, how will I survive?"" while The Hunger Games left me thinking; ""If I was there, how will I change the game?""The acting was nice and the main protagonist was true to her character; I especially liked how she showed her emotions with her eyes. The cheesy parts were forgivable and probably moved me if I'm 10 years younger.Seeing Woody Harrelson as a mentor and a drunkard adds color to the movie's ""environment"" and I wasn't able to recognize Lenny Kravitz until the credits.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Let's not forget that even the ""kids killing kids"" situation was clearly taken from the much better, original work, Lord of the Flies. This story was not original which definitely showed throughout the simplistic production. The action was missing with a terrible attempt to hide that fact.

"6","/10","A slow and frustrating film that is held together by its strong and capable cast","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2597146/?ref_=tt_urv","dalelawson-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20146447/?ref_=tt_urv","15 April 2012","Because of all the hype surrounding The Hunger Games (Dir. Gary Ross, 2012) I presumed it was going to be heavily entertaining and enjoyable. But on the contrary, it was slow and frustrating. I found little empathy for any of the characters and struggled to understand what should have been a very simple plot that somehow became more and more complex as the film dragged on. I will firstly point out that I have not read the books and so I went into the film with only the understanding that The Hunger Games focuses on a yearly event where children end up fighting other children to survive. By the end of the film I discovered that The Hunger Games was essentially a desensitised Hollywood adaptation of Battle Royale (Dir. Kinji Fukasaku, 2000) with a greater back story. Also because The Hunger Games is based on the first in a series of books I was able to tell that nothing bad would happen to the protagonist, which perhaps helps in the films slow narrative progression.The Hunger Games rushes the beginning plot in order to reach the games, and therefore a lot of the story is lost. This rushed first hour forces a sense of mild confusion onto the spectator, as we are unsure of the significance of multiple characters and symbols that only fans can relate too. The camera-work of the opening twenty minutes before Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is swept away to the capitol is fantastic. The uncomfortable camera angles followed by quick cuts or jump cuts create a sense of fear and uneasiness. This same effect is used when the games finally get underway to emphasise the violence that is taking place, without focus on the blood and gore. However the games also drag on for another hour. Many of the scenes within this section feel overextended and a few of them unneeded. Surprisingly, in the last twenty minutes of the film it increases pace and enjoyment before rushing through the final few scenes, in order to reach the two hour mark.For an expensive and high grossing blockbuster one would expect the CGI to be believable and realistic, which in majority they are. But in one scene in particular where Katniss and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are arriving on chariot into the capitol, they are both wearing suits that are supposedly on fire. Whether it is the audience superimposed onto the green screen behind them, or the fire that doesn't even look like fire, this scene was sickening to watch in what was otherwise a beautiful and creative film.Acting-wise, Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks exceeded my expectations as they provided a surrogate mother and father, to an extent, for Katniss and Peeta. The characters presented in The Hunger Games are all very different as they have individual traits. Unfortunately because of these differences there is almost no attachment created between the audience and the characters, except perhaps Katniss as she is the protagonist. However due to her cold nature and bland facial expressions Katniss is also not entirely relatable to.When a film mentions its own title almost every minute it is never a good sign and The Hunger Games was no exception. The lack initiative or common sense used by the majority of the characters throughout the games is heavily frustrating – look out for the tree scene or a scene with Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Many characters are introduced and then forgotten, which can only be preparation for a sequel, a flaw that The Lord of the Rings trilogy managed to avoid. All in all The Hunger Games was an enjoyable watch with many avoidable flaws. Perhaps its sequel will be more entertaininghttp://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A smart, thought provoking and entertaining success.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2672510/?ref_=tt_urv","Case1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35122238/?ref_=tt_urv","12 September 2012","The Hunger Games gives us a fascinating glimpse into a dark dystopian future society. Here an oppressive government exercises it's power each year by forcing 24 children to fight to the death in a massive battle arena, purely for the sake of intimidating the 12 districts of Panem. This setting stimulates many ethical questions about survival and inequality that resonate across the entire story.This was simply a very well made movie. Despite the occasional dodgy camera angle on the whole it was brilliant. There were aching moments of suspense along side the deeply saddening. All of this was weaved together with the help of a fantastic director and cast. Jennifer Laurence gave a respectable performance as did Josh Hutcherson which made for a strong relationship between Peeta and Katniss. Many of the other characters seemed to be brought to life even better than I expected, my personal favorites being Caesar Flickerman and Effie Trinket. The director also seemed to encapsulate the maddening, over-intoxicating colors and fashion of the Capitol in a way that was just spot on.If you have read the books you may have mixed feelings about this film but I would just advise you to keep an open mind. There are some small areas where bits of the book have been taken away and others where extra scenes have been added to better tell the story and the result is highly enjoyable. The detailed, gripping story is surely the main factor that has brought this film such wide success.All things considered this was a smart, entertaining and though provoking film that sets the series off to an excellent start.The of the must see films of this year.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Solid Adaptation of a Great Book","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128626/?ref_=tt_urv","jacobclark512","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51142198/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2014","Any devoted fan of a book series would be delighted to hear that their favorite book was going to appear on the big screen. For me, however, The Hunger Games was different. As a novel, it dealt with intense political themes and was a very well-rounded story. Then it became a film. Like every adaptation of a book, The Hunger Games changed some things, and I knew this entering the theater. The book, to me, seemed too complex to fully develop in a two hour running time.But then details started coming out, like the casting decisions, the crew, and their experience in film. This made me think that Lionsgate was really trying to make this a good film. Hiring actors such as Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, and Donald Sutherland made me excited. I knew these names, and other people did too, making this movie more attractive to outsiders that were not already fans. But names don't make a movie. How would this adaptation of a book beloved by millions turn out?The first key to nailing a book like this on-screen is the script, and The Hunger Games has a good one. The dialogue has an appropriate balance of plot exposition, comic relief, and serious emotion. This also makes the pacing of the story better. The film is not just one long crescendo; rather, it rises and falls in a similar way to the novel. There are also very few notable omissions from the story: those there, while some are considered important, do not change the characterization, the essential message of the film, or the end result. These aspects of The Hunger Games are due to Suzanne Collins, the author of the novels, participating in the screen writing process. When the author of your source material has a say, things suddenly go better in the script and story.Thematically, The Hunger Games is intense but never seems to nail one specific message down. Some say it is a commentary on the class struggle. Others, an anti-authoritarian film. Still others claim that it is a feminist take on the sci-fi genre. It could very well be all of these at the same time. There is so much room in this film for good themes; however, I personally see it as a commentary (and sometimes satire) of our culture's glamorization of violence. The way the Games are televised and promoted in the Capitol show that they are immune to the effects of immense and immoral bloodshed. At the same time, we are also shown a former victor committing suicide after he wins. This juxtaposition shows us that what the cultural center believes is permissible is not always beneficial.The visual aspect of The Hunger Games is a solid depiction of Panem, a nation with twelve districts and a central Capitol. When we are shown District 12, Katniss's home, it is portrayed as a poverty-stricken mining community. This aesthetic is done beautifully, with very rustic buildings, landscapes, and costuming. When we arrive in the Capitol, however, it is clear who is on what end of the socioeconomic scale. The extravagant buildings, clothing, and makeup both mesmerize and depress the viewer because, while they are visually impressive, they are also reminded of the depravity of the outer districts, bringing the class warfare discussion back into the ring.The first less-than-stellar part of The Hunger Games is the acting. Granted, with names such as Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, and Donald Sutherland, it can't be that bad. However, the biggest flaw in the acting is not the quality, as we see stellar performances from Harrelson, Sutherland, and Elizabeth Banks: it is the on-screen time these roles get. Harrelson's performance as Haymitch Abernathy, a drunken mentor to Katniss and Peeta, would be Oscar-worthy if he had more time to exploit his character. The major chunk of screen time is given to Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence as Peeta and Katniss, respectively. They are both solid choices for their roles, but Lawrence is clearly the better talent, as Hutcherson seems uncomfortable for most of the film. Lawrence also has a command of the film and is not afraid to carry it on her back single-handedly. This unrelenting determination she has suits the role of Katniss well, and it is because of this that the film gets its tone largely right.Speaking of the tone of The Hunger Games, this is one thing director Gary Ross gets right. His down-to-earth and simplistic style suits the nature of the novel. His use of traditional film over digital is also well-noted; however, it is his cinematography that is the most divisive part of this film. He employs a hand-held camera for most of his shots, and while this can work well for portions of the film where the perspective of the characters is needed and appreciated (i.e. Katniss boarding the train to the Capitol after the reaping), it doesn't always add up. Many times throughout the film, this hand-held camera work is trying to capture a running character with a running cameraman. This looks very shaky and can be almost nauseating, detracting a lot from the film. This shakiness permeates other sections of the film where it has no place whatsoever, tainting the beautiful scenes otherwise present.Overall, I enjoyed The Hunger Games. Though it has its rough points (especially in the cinematography), it nails the tone, plot, and themes of the novel. The acting also keeps us invested in the characters and is solid in its own right, with the actors interpreting their characters well. This is a rare type of film: one that isn't necessarily the best but will appeal to all types of people. Action fans, dystopia fans, sci-fi fans, and some romance fans will be at least partially satisfied by The Hunger Games due to its broad narrative scope. Yes, its rough around the edges, but in the end you'll look past that to enjoy a good movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A highly enjoyable and promising start to the series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2660672/?ref_=tt_urv","DubhDoo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29045991/?ref_=tt_urv","18 August 2012","Gary Ross' film begins with Jennifer Lawrence living in a rural community, being the glue keeping together a fatherless, almost- penniless household, with the camera-work intimate and indie-styled, and the music sparse. But wait, this isn't a sequel to Winter's Bone, is it? No, instead what we have here is (as I'm sure you're aware) the much anticipated adaptation of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games (Collins also serves as one of the film's three screenwriters), set in a post- apocalyptic US entitled Panem, where, in order to keep the youth in line and civil order maintained, 24 randomly selected 12-18 year olds are forced to fight to the death until one remains.Of all the good things about the film, its shining star comes in the form of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen; from the moment she steps on screen she exudes a magnetic, presence; her performance is strong, convincing, emotional, and at times, vulnerable. She's a firm and consistently engaging central figure, who only benefits the film, bringing it to heights it may not have otherwise reached. But it's not all that surprising when you take into account the fact that she's the second youngest actress ever to receive a nomination for the Best Actress Oscar. Lawrence is also backed up by a terrific supporting cast, including a shabbily charismatic Woody Harrelson, and even if he's only Basil Exposition, he's still enjoyable in the part; Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks are entertaining as media-minded Caesar Flickerman and Effie Trinket. Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland also make memorable impressions in significant roles with small screen time. However, Toby Jones barely utters a word. I was taken aback by Josh Hutcherson, that while he may not be a astounding actor, he works quite well as Peeta Mellark, in the occasionally damsel-in-distress-like role, being believably vulnerable against Lawrence's resilient Katniss and even if their chemistry doesn't sparkle just yet, there's three more films for it to catch fire (wocka wocka).While the film does indeed plant the seeds of love triangle, it is more focused on the Games themselves; And while Ross doesn't take the material's satirical promise as far as it could go, it's still laid on the table; making a statement about exploitation, the class divide, government distrust, repression and reality television. Because when you boil it down to its most basic, it is about kids killing kids. This could all have come across as strikingly tasteless on screen, but Ross works in the confines of a PG-13/12 certificate, effectively delivering violence that makes you feel the pain. He does this without making it overly gratuitous or alienating the target audience. The intense and frantic start to the Games illustrates this as we witness all the Tributes against each other, with bodies falling like dominoes and the horror of the carnage retained. The film is not without its flaws – Ross' frequent use of shaky-cam in the film's action sequences is understandable, but it makes the action somewhat confusing and dizzying (maybe that's the point), but in a particular fight, each blow is delivered in hand-held flashes detracting from my enjoyment of said scene. The pacing in the second half is also uneven, at times it feels brisk, at others overly slow; not that I have a problem with slow pacing, it's just that the briskness of the first half's pacing is slightly at odds with the second half's, where Ross appears in no rush. One last gripe I had was that the finale was anticlimactic, (it was obviously designed to lead into the sequel) but I'll say no more to avoid spoilers. Yet these are minor flaws that can be ignored as it didn't destroy the experience of the film, because from start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed it.Many have made this clear and so will I: this is not the new Twilight, nor has it ever been - shoddy visual effects, stilted performances and cheesy dialogue are nowhere to be seen – instead this is something much better. More sophisticated than Twilight and darker than Harry Potter, this is a grounded, thoughtful, very well-acted and at times emotional film, which is also a very promising start to this franchise. Let's just hope the odds will ever be in its favour.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Because I'd already read numerous reviews from friends who had told me how sh*t it was.So instead, I went into this movie trying to see the good in it..Sadly, there wasn't much.The execution is just poor. Whoever directed this should not be put in charge of any sequels if they hope to engage any further.. Edit: oh, it's the Pleasantville guy, well that must be his once off! The acting also is not much better, some of it very forced!This is.. a survival movie, based apparently on a book (part 1 of a trilogy) but at no stage did it really give a sense of urgency, or real fear for one's existence. There was no feel of attachment to any of the characters, including the main pair who made Anakin and Padme's wooden romantic engagement in Star Wars look positively the greatest of all time (please note sarcasm)Some actors of T.H.G, read like a cast list from Marvel movies: Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique from X-Men: First Class) who by the way, acts almost identical in both movies as an outsider.. Liam Hemsworth (ok, not Marvel, but brother of THOR) ;) The two German scientists from Captain America: Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones (the latter, I don't think utters a single word!)A redeeming face amongst the latter cast is Woody Harrelson. I actually sat up and started to take notice somewhat of what was going on, til I realised he wasn't going to get much more.. Another highlight is: Amandla Stenberg.. who plays Rue. Her only other appearance of note so far, being the young ""Cataleya"" in Columbiana. In both she doesn't have enough screen time!The rest are pretty much, no names or TV actors. The guy who played the pervert son in American Beauty, the mother of the Cyclon in Battlestar: Caprica. Oh, Donald Sutherland is in this.. but he's such a by product of the film, that he's out of place, or out of touch with what is going on, muttering through his scenes as his wades through the greenery doing nothing much.. Equally, there's Elizabeth Banks who just looks and plays a ghastly personality.The bloodshed truly feels PG, and the NYPD Blue (showing my age) camera work is so disconcerting.. Used to cover up (in latter Transformers it was lazy CGI) but in this film horrific killings, that were most of the time unseen, and barely heard. Apparently this film is banned in Vietnam due to the violent scenes (wtf?!)IF you want to see real survivor films. These are the ones to see: THE TOURNAMENT, PREDATORS (PREDATOR is on a whole other level) and the ultimate school Japanese thriller: BATTLE ROYALE.Please just read the book, and perhaps wait til someone accidentally hires the movie (acquires it) and you're caught out watching it. Or let your youngin's watch it, as it really is, I guess made for them, and I can see why. Poor Jennifer Lawrence, actually RICH Jennifer.. This film was a BOX OFFICE smash??p.s What the hell is Lenny Kravitz doing in a movie?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, I thought it got off to a promising start and enjoyed the first part, up to when the village girl volunteers to take the place of her sister in the Hunger games, but after that, the movie went downhill and became increasingly boring and routine. The story line didn't have any twists and turns and was uninteresting, and the acting was just ""OK"". The only character who I thought had any spark or interest was the world-weary adviser and mentor to the kids, played by Woody Harrelson. He should have had more screen time and that would have made the movie more interesting.Besides him, I thought Lenny Kravitz did a good job in a small role, and didn't recognize him until after looking up the credits. But the other characters didn't make any impression and were all pretty much flat and one dimensional, including the stereotypical villain played by Donald Sutherland.That said, the movie did have nice wilderness scenery and some suspense when the kids are stalking one another, and is not a terrible film. Though I also didn't like how the ending was so blatant in setting up a sequel, I dislike it when movies do that. Still, overall it is a passable entry in the action-adventure genre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was reading through the reviews and couldn't help but feel slightly angry especially since majority of the haters hadn't even read the books, so who are they to judge possibly the biggest young adult movie of our generation. So I was writing this to give the general public a reliable source.The movie was definitely not as good as the book, but then again a movie never is. Considering the book and a lot of the hype the movie had to stand up to it did excellent. An annoying thing was that it was rated PG. I can understand and all but Hunger Games did/still has a lot of older fans (18+) I myself am only 15, but an M rating would have given the movie a little more justice with a little more violence. Though considering this was a PG movie I was actually fairly pleased with the violence.Another great thing was that they fitted in almost all of the storyline and all the major one. There were a few things I did miss was a lot of the emotional impact. I found the movie to be silent a little. I found that there wasn't as much dialogue as you would expect in them movie. Majority of the book is the main character, Katniss thinking and ellaborating things which made the book in my mind a lot more realistic. And because this was majority of the book when it was cut it made it seem... weird? One thing that really, really annoyed me was that they had such a great soundtrack yet failed to use it correctly in the movie. A lot of the songs were perfect for the movie but they didn't put the music in. In fact the only music they had was instrumental pieces, which I think I can speak for the general public when I say that instrumental doesn't exactly interest us, especially young adults, the target audience. The only time when you hear music with words in the movie was when Lawrence sung ""Rue's Lullaby"" and in the end credits. THE END CREDITS? Why on earth would you put songs on the end credits? Let me guess to give it that emotional impact, because it is so emotional seeing a few hundred strangers names flying upwards with music.Overall though I really did enjoy the movie and somehow it only got better when I saw it the third time in movies. Maybe my mind was more relaxed and exposed to the movie. Anyways I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","""Although it stayed with its flawed points, ""The Hunger Games"" is still completely decent.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3062607/?ref_=tt_urv","Clockwork_Orange55","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32748045/?ref_=tt_urv","5 August 2014","An attempt to switch ""The Hunger Games"" into ""Katniss Everdeen"" would be very lame. You couldn't think of the film without thinking of Katniss; and too you can't imagine Katniss without having a fixed thought on the movie either. The two artistic creations are impossibly separable from each other, just like United States of America and her idea on democracy. I think it is fair to purchase an opinion that ""The Hunger Games"" series starts on a high note. The first instalment of an ambitious 4-movies series is far from being weak or ineffective. Although it stayed with its flawed points, ""The Hunger Games"" is still completely decent.Set in a dystopian future in the nation of Panem. Panem is likely to be located in North America of today's world-map; to match with an imagination of an empire that covers the lands of Canada and USA, or probably Mexico too. The nation consists of a wealthy state named Capitol, and 12 poorer states which are just being called as District 1, District 2, District 3and District 12. Every year, as a punishment, one male and one female from the age of 12 to 18 will be selected from each district to participate in the Hunger Games, where the players will fight to the death in an arena, and the sole survivor will be the victor. In the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) reluctantly volunteered to replace her sister to be the female tribute (female participant) for District 12, as her undying love for her family overcomes her self-ego that possibly contains her. Her choice on not saving her sister from the Games was actually not an option at all.Gary Ross's vision on Panem is very close to what my personal discovery on the modern society or humanity would be like; or at least, a tease. In the poorer states, which are the 12 Districts, the people are being dressed in a very natural, humane-style. But on the other hand, the wealthy people in the Capitol are very eccentric looking, or simply an image of absurd investments by them to provide paths for ugliness. My view on the mentioned points would be related to people in general who are merely slaves to anything that is modern or 'fashionable'. The rich from the Capitol are likely belong to that group of people, as they are easily exposed to and influenced by the outside world; whereas the poor from the 12 districts have less exposure to anything that would lightly bring destruction upon them.""The Hunger Games"" too was pointing out on the righteous humans- sensitivity that is slowly draining out from us; perhaps the assumptions are false, but undeniably the facts do stay in the characters of the story. The sense on it withered; the slightest acts to consider on containing a person's heart are buying less. It is too dense, it is relentless. I am in reluctance to indicate the scenes which would unveil the assertions that I made, but one of the moments would probably be on the humiliation that Katniss faced by the wealthy when she is merely trying to fairly display her capability to prepare herself for the games. Their brains are dead, and sensibility is long-gone.The performances are responsible for setting it apart from other ordinary teenage-dream movies. Many big-budgeted over-hyped young adult fiction pictures are absolute failure, but thankfully, 'Games' is pleasant. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific, Woody Harrelson is terrific, Elizabeth Banks is terrific and Stanley Tucci is terrific. The characters' personas, on either side, are so well captured by terrific stars. Great thanks to the talented cast, which occupied personal-charms in its own level.'Games' hits on frustration through its self-obsessed editing and the overused employment of shaky hand-held. Gary Ross sure has his own idea or reasons on the practice, but it never gets me. My animosity for the vision is not deep, but the touch of admiration that I would have for it is not a success either. Firstly, the work on shaky camera gives a pain in the head. Secondly, especially during the earlier parts of the film where The Reaping Is taking place, have failed to establish a connection between me and the poor in the state (District 12). Therefore, personal emotions that should have been carried out to audiences, are not reaching.The characters are flat out dumb and laughable at times. It aims at the forgettable bad guys specifically, who act on not wanting to be humans, but to behave in accordance with an unfavourable writing that even a horror is mistaken for a comedy. Peeta Mellark? He is one of the worst characters to have ever appeared on screen. It is a weakness when a dumb and insulting character is overshadowed by a far more superior heroine. Take Peeta out, and the movie would fare better.""The Hunger Games"" is one of the few films that really bite me. I am not referring to its characters, but the reflections that were being addressed. The voices are essential, but only in my thoughts, hinged from my personal experiences. I firmly believe that ""The Hunger Games"", as a whole, is a tragedy. It gets to a stage where leadership completely devours its society, and with support, it stands with hypocrisy so terrible that it lies with a talent of only causing pain. A very powerful fiction though.Score: 2/4(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Set in a futuristic time when all human rights activists had been wiped out and the world is ruled by fashion designers, we are presented with a story of hope, courage, romance and adventure.As a reminder of the treason the 12 districts had once conspired, the Capitol enforces each district to send a teen girl and a boy as tributes to take part in the yearly event 'The Hunger Games' where all 24 of them have a death match that is promoted as reality TV. This is the story of Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) from District 12 who volunteers in place of her selected sister and she pins hope on her intelligence, maturity and hunting skills.The movie boasts of super hype from the books, terrific cast and high production values. But what it really has is a wafer thin story line and themes that have been hashed out numerous times. Most characters perform with conviction as they play roles that go through desperation, fear and display of primal instinct. Apart from this, nothing stood out for me. Most of the aspects felt generic like the special effects, background score, screenplay void of any twists etc. With not having read the books, I couldn't see where this plot could ever lead to spawning 3 more sequels.Lawrence gave her best and is worth watching for her. Nothing else stands out.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They selected two players from each of the 12 districts every year. The second half is all about the adventures that follow as these games proceed. The thing that makes this film not so good is the part when the games actually start. The supporting story is much more interesting than the actual games ceremony. Nevertheless this was worth watching once.PROS:The storytellers are not in a hurry and before they reach to the actual games, they have maintained enough interest and story so that one can truly be into the film. The film does not include too many visual stunts and is simple in that regard. However it employs a good and working story even when the games start, not just any mindless violence.CONS:The first thing that irritated from the starting was the shaky camera pattern. It looked weird in most of the cases. The story lacked twists and surprises. The ending was horrible for me.MESSAGE: ""Never lose HOPE""VERDICT: ""A onetime watch.""","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Blockbuster Season Get's Underway With The Hunger Games","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2585718/?ref_=tt_urv","LoveYourMovies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30068741/?ref_=tt_urv","24 March 2012","With award season over, movie fans seamlessly movie right into blockbuster season. These are the big budget pure entertainment films that make summer exciting and tend to get blood pumping. Blockbuster movies over the summer tend to be the action movie and comic book movies and phenomenon movies and this year looks like it will have a plethora of choices for everyone.Blockbuster season got off to a roaring start with the adaptation of the first of the wildly popular trilogy of books, The Hunger Games. While they are already projected to be as popular as the Twilight series and some say possibly even Harry Potter. Set in the distant future world of Panem which is a remnant of the United States the story revolves around a 16 year old girl named Katniss from the poorest district of Panem known as district 12. In Panem all children aged 12-18 from all districts are entered in a lottery to be chosen to participate in what is known as the hunger games. In the hunger games, one boy and one girl from each district is chosen to play a survival game in a wilderness arena where only one winner emerges and that is the last one living. When Katniss' younger sister is chosen in her first year of eligibility, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the hunger games. She is then put through various training scenarios and put on somewhat of a media tour in order to gain sponsors to help provide her with needed supplies during the competition. Along with her fellow district 12 tribute, Peeta, she sets out and changes the outcome of the games and the way they are played much to the dismay of those in high power.Not having read the books I am forced to look at the movie strictly as that, a movie. Hunger Games is a fairly well told story with great background on characters that aid you in gaining feelings for Katniss and Peeta. With a fairly basic look at what a post apocalyptic world may be it still emits it's own taste as to what upper class is like in Capitol City. While the acting is, like in the majority of blockbuster movies, is nothing to rave about, Jennifer Lawrence solidifies herself as an up and coming star of film. Lawrence already has one academy award nomination under her belt for the haunting and brilliant, Winter's Bone. She is joined by one of the best actors working right now and commonly underrated, Woody Harrelson. Harrelson feels somewhat out of place in this type of movie but begins to fit the character better as the film goes on. Hunger Games does a fine job of bringing the intensity of the action that is the hunger games to life. While the movies tends to run a little long for having been a story geared towards a younger audience, the time does move rather rapidly and I suspect this is the film maker doing his best to do true justice to the books. With some visually stunning scenes and a decent amount of action it is not a movie that will leave you feeling unfulfilled. The film makers leave a fine opening for the follow up film. On a pure entertainment level, Hunger Games doesn't miss at all. It has all the elements a summer blockbuster looks for and an originality that has lacked in recent years. It does all this with minimal CGI or special effects, although it doesn't lack in that department for fans of this. Hunger Games has something for everyone and is quite refreshing to not see a vampire or supernatural creations of some kind which tend to be an easy out to try and be creative. It is the perfect start off for the blockbuster season which looks to be one filled with highly anticipated movies with the likes of The Avengers, Spiderman's reboot, the final installment of the Twilight series and the crescendo of all these movies looks to be The Dark Knight Rises which most likely will shatter any record any of these movies will set beforehand.

It can be seen that there are many events that are not shown in the film. Very interesting film, has some flesh backs, has never bored while watching it, but I have a feeling that a lot has been left out in the second part of the film itself. Since I know it was filmed by the book can feel that the good parts of the novel stripped. So, what we see is very good. Drawback is that (as usual) the first part of the movie still have many gaps and areas that would be much better look that the film is divided into two parts and take at least 3 hours. I wish that the characters are described in more detail. I have the impression that this movie is just warming up for the rights of the events have to come...

It almost looks like each district was comprised of few hundred, maybe thousand people. However, the ""Capital"" itself was much more grand so the whole the concept of ""few"" vs. ""many"" was upside down.The people who are constantly battling hunger, should they really be this strong and powerful? There was dialog about how ""too much hope is dangerous"". That is correct.However, in battle of good vs bad, unless at least one or two so called ""Elites"" could start to question themselves, and realize they lack the basic human traits, there is no hope.In a movie that touches the subject that this movie does, I would have liked some hope.Now getting away from the bigger subject, and concentrating on the plot itself, in the end the two ""tributes"" from the District-12 are encouraged to fake love (at least the girl is) so some ""Elites"" would root for them. In the end the ""Show Master"" tries to turn them against each other, but fails.Why not have them be true lovers? Why not let the movie also be a true love story? Why not have the ""Elites"" not only try and break them, take away their basic humanity, but also try to extinguish their love. That would be way more powerful.Finally, I appreciate that people of District-11 have had enough and at least rioted. For sake of humanity, I needed more.Maybe the movie's real purpose is to simply acclimate us to what is coming.We are not in Kansas anymore ladies and gentleman.Real hunger games are coming, and they would make the ones depicted in movie look like picnic.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Roger Ebert's provides a good review of the film. Don't believe one was better than the other. Both were about a 6/10 for me. The Hunger Games was just better marketed and less philosophical. A real summer blockbuster one could say. I could have a used a lot more of the philosophical and political underpinning for the games existence. Not sure there would be a logical reason for the games other than to sell movies tickets to the mob. Liked Clove, about it.

Elizabeth Banks was excellent. Jennifer Lawrence was too tall and well-fed for the book's smallish Katniss. I thought the young actors, except for the tall, tough-looking blond actress, Leven Rambin, who played Glimmer, looked too small and soft, especially the actors who played Cato and Clove. Cato and Clove were huge in size and ferocious-looking in the book. Cato was especially a major presence in the book, but much less so in the movie. I thought the tough-looking Mr. Hemsworth should have played Cato, and the tall, tough-looking Ms. Rambin should have played Clove. Too many times pretty boys and girls in Hollywood don't look and talk tough enough, and that's why they can't transition to adult action roles. I was disappointed in the book and movie that religion was left out completely, especially Christianity. Latinos were non-existent, yet they are the fastest-growing minority in the U.S. right now.

You can tell how much everyone involved in the making of this movie cared about the story, as it showed in every one of the scenes they chose to keep. It is very easy for a film based on a hugely popular teen franchise to turn into something completely different (Eragon!) but Gary Ross was adamant that the film would stay as true to the book as possible. I am so glad he was on board because after a recent piece of news of a new plot piece that was almost added to the film, I'm not sure it would definitely have turned out perfectly, even with Suzanne Collins helping the whole way through. There was a lot of hand-held camera-work and it was very distracting at times, but I can't say it ruined the film because most of it only occurred during the District 12 scenes and intense fight scenes. The shaky cam made it feel as if you were running along with Katniss and it felt very intimate and made you feel really small amongst the surroundings. I think the style fit the story very well and it certainly did its job. At least no one can say it's like Twilight now! No one can say it was too 'Hollywood"" either! That's what the hand-held cam was for - to very clearly define the poor districts from the Capitol and show that there wasn't even a hint of Hollywood in District 12.One thing that I was a bit disappointed with, though, was that the whole thing seemed far too short. Even though it was 2 ½ hours long, everything in the Capitol seemed a bit rushed. There were loads of scenes that I would have liked to see and I don't mind that they were missed out but it just felt like some of them should have been there just to pace it a bit more. I wasn't really sure whether people who hadn't read the book would fully get to know Katniss or Peeta either. I really hope they did because Jennifer Lawrence just IS Katniss! I would happily have sat through 3 hours or more and I'm sure that would have fixed most of the problems with missing scenes and pacing! The acting was superb throughout the movie! Especially from Jennifer Lawrence because, as I said before, Jennifer Lawrence just IS Katniss, despite being too old and too naturally blonde! The child actors were amazing too! When they were cast, I never thought about whether they would be good at acting or not. I don't know why but all I thought about was their looks and I just thought that if they had been chosen, they must be good! It was only when I saw the trailer, though, that I realised how good Willow was, despite it being virtually her first film! Josh Hutcherson was perfect too and he seemed exactly like Peeta. I loved all the tributes too. I really look forward to the next two to three movies and I hope they'll be as good, or even better than this one!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Lacks character development.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2614236/?ref_=tt_urv","chase-guymon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33845874/?ref_=tt_urv","20 May 2012","I can be the first to admit that The Hunger Games novels were around the bottom of my list of things to read. I had in previous years read many other sci-fi/fantasy books that seemed to mimic the idea brought across in The Hunger Games general premise. The Hunger Games novels were suggested by my wife, a frequent sci-fi skeptic. And when the reading began it ignited an old flame for the love of science fiction that I thought I had lost.Where Star Wars dwindled in quality and remakes are a dime-a-dozen, Hunger Games brings a subtle yet intriguing environment similar to that of Logan's Run or THX-1138. Where poverty runs rampant and imperialist dogma leaves breadcrumbs all over the gov't, Hunger Games takes what's good in your average sci-fi and keeps it fresh. Where many look at this as a blatant rip-off of Takami's ""Battle Royale,"" one must come to understand that Battle Royale itself was based, albeit loosely, on Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" where the first chapter is about killing for others' pleasure titled ""Battle Royale."" Good sci-fi always bases its premises on others works.Hunger Games does just that. Its ideas are based on those who have come before it, but that gives no reason to pass it off as garbage. The games themselves are a thrilling place of dog-eat-dog intensity. the movie is a unique take on America's mainstream cinematography.Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job as a girl who has no desire to be in this depressing world, but will try her hardest to make it better. Stanley Tucci does a wonderful job as a deluded and wealthy newscaster living the naive lifestyle in a power-hungry empire. But where these characters are well-studied by the actors themselves, it seems what the film lacks the most is still development in character on the large scale. Though she is honorably mentioned, I doubt Suzanne Collins had much sway in the writing of the screenplay, as there are many times in the film where the audience could gain a lot from learning more about the characters involved, but Gary Ross and Billy Ray leaned the opposite direction and decided intense action was much more important than character: in my opinion a huge flaw in most novel-based films. Why do we love books? We learn about character. The same frequently goes with films.With that said the only other con of the film would be visual effects, at least on the CGI side of things. The ""girl on fire"" scene came and went and what could've been a potent and powerful expression of character for Kat and Peeta became a ""Oh, yeah, did we mention this is supposed to be cool?"" moment.Overall, the movie brought a ray of hope for the sci-fi industry. With films like JOHN CARTER of Mars falling short and AVATAR being considered the cat's pajamas, Hunger Games flips the coin of chance and brings the old sci-fi style back into perspective. Something that I, for one, am very grateful.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games movie is one of the worst book-to-film adaptations of all time.The potential that this movie had is indescribable. I was ecstatic with anticipation for this book's adaptation, and to say that I was let down is the understatement of the year. It practically seems like the screenwriters just read the SparkNotes version of the book and decided to fill in the blanks themselves. Details seemed to be changed every where you look, and it's usually for the worse. Despite the fact that the runtime of the movie is well over 2 hours, the characters are extremely poorly developed and important points of the plot are omitted every which way. Even as I sit here writing this review, myself and the people with whom I saw the midnight premiere with are coming up with more and more things from the book that were either altered, or omitted from the movie. Although I could sit here and list an endless number of erroneous plot points in the movie, I'll just say the single thing that ticked me off the most: THEY DIDN'T EVEN SHOW OR SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE RED HAIRED AVOX GIRL FROM THE BOOKThe further I get into this review, the more infuriated I become. It just seems like everything is wrong. The ""muttations"" weren't ANYTHING remotely close to what they were described as in the book. The final action sequence was untrue to the book and – in my opinion – was boring and had no rising action. It just happened. No climax. No falling action. That's actually pretty much how the whole movie was. It was like a straight line from start to finish.Personally, I love going to midnight premieres. The crowd is lively and hyped — ultimately creating an awesome viewing experience. The Hunger Games has been dubbed the new generation's Harry Potter, and if that's true, I fear for the new generation. If you've ever had the privilege to see a Harry Potter midnight premiere, you will know that there are innumerable times when the audience erupts in thunderous applause when a big plot point happens. That didn't happen with the Hunger Games. Not even once. I'm beyond disappointed. I'm not entirely sure I want to see Catching Fire if they decide they was to do a movie for all three books. It is completely perplexing to me as to how a Harry Potter movie can be more true to the book in the same (or less) amount of time, regardless of having 400+ more pages. The ending is completely baffling. What happened?! In the book, Peeta and Katniss are already growing distant and mistrusting of one another, yet in the movie it seems as if everything is peachy. The screenwriters actually screwed up the story to a point where I can only wonder how they will even attempt to transform Catching Fire into the big screen. In the end of this movie, Peeta and Katniss are all smiles so how are they supposed to turn to sudden conflict in the sequel? The Hunger Games prospective movie trilogy has only set itself up for failure in the future, if it hasn't failed already.So often from people you will hear ""the book was better."" Usually, such people are just being snobby, but in this case it is true. Rarely, if ever does a movie exceed it's literary counterpart, but it should at least be considered a standard for a movie to be just about on par with the book in terms of quality. Thinking back on the movie now, just 30 minutes later, I am unable to recall a single memorable attribute.This I recommend to you: read the book. Even if you have seen the movie, read the book. Let your own imagination create the scenes. Do not allow yourself to be let down as I was. I do not anticipate recommending this movie to any of my friends who have read the book. In the hearts and minds of so many, The Hunger Games books are sacred.

After reading a few reviews,I decided to give the movie a chance. Firstly,I found it much too long. For the first hour and a half,I felt like I was watching American Idol,or America/Canada's Got Talent. I could just see Ryan Seacrest up there as MC before the games began. It was so predictable at that point,even boring. Also,the people in this dystopia looked very weird and not believable. When the games started,I was getting very dizzy with the shaky camera work. I imagine this was to give it a PG rating so as not to show too realistically any of the teens killing each other. It was just touched upon,not that I would want to see too much violence either. When the Hunger Games were in full swing,I really kept thinking of the reality TV show,""Survivor."" There were a few inane twists at the end but all in all,I never felt fully immersed in the movie.For the last hour,I kept looking at the time.This doesn't take away from the great performances by Jennifer Lawrence,Woody Harelsen,or Donald Sutherland. All in all,I wasn't moved by this movie. What were the reasons for the present state of affairs in the future North America.And show us some depth in the main characters. Forty years ago,in 1972,I saw a very intense movie about a future dystopia,""Soylent Green,"" with Charleton Heston and Edward G. Robinson. I have never forgotten it. We saw people starving,begging for food,etc. There was deep emotion and you could identify with the characters. This was not the case for me watching The Hunger Games. By tomorrow,I will have forgotten most of the movie. Wait for it on DVD is my advice or go on a day when rates are reduced.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The only gripes I have about this film is that shaky cam is used to much a bit and they need to work on the ""romantic"" part of the book between Katniss and Peeta.

And may the odds ever be in your favor!""Recently I got some time and decided to read The Hunger Games. I must say, Suzanne Collins' novel was ingenious and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I finished the book in 3 days then went on to watch the movie, here are my thoughts.Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss and I must say, she embodied the character so well as her performance was strong and captivating. If it was one thing that was adapted perfectly it was bringing Katniss to life with this great actress. Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch, a drunk who was a former winner of The Hunger Games nailed his role! He was spot on and did a great job with the role. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Liam Hemsworth as Gale, Willow Shields as Prim, Amandla Stenberg as Rue and Alexander Ludwig as Cato, all did excellent jobs with their roles.However I'm not sure where I stand with Josh Hutcherson. The love-struck Peeta from the book did not transfer across in the film. For instance, in the book Peeta and Katniss kissed at least 5 times and were so much more romantic in the book than in the movie. He did a good job with the role but I think he could have done better. For those who have read the book you would have noticed that certain details were not included and the ending wasn't exactly the same. However the scenes that were vital in the book as well as the imagery - The awe of the Capitol in contrast with the poverty of the Districts - was so well done.All in all I enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a movie about hope because ""Hope. It is the only thing stronger than fear.""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","And the odds are indeed in this opening's film's favour- a tense, thrilling and smart science-fiction thriller with a brilliant lead performance by Jennifer Lawrence","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2584336/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2012","Not since the Twilight franchise first hit the big screen in 2008 has there been so much fevered anticipation for a print-to-screen adaptation, but that should be expected for a book that spent 180 consecutive weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Envisioning a post-apocalyptic North America named Panem comprised of a ruling Capitol and 12 enslaved districts, novelist Suzanne Collins' 'The Hunger Games' was a smart dystopian sci-fi thriller which also served as darkly satiric commentary on a world gone mad on spectacle.The premise of the titular Games is intriguing- as penance for their rebellion against Capitol rule 74 years ago, a boy and a girl from the ages of 12 to 18 are chosen by lottery from each district to fight to the death in a televised gladiator event. It's the Capitol's means of ensuring subjugation from the districts- 'we own your lives' is the message the sinister President Snow (Donald Sutherland) wants the Games to convey alongside a glimmer of hope by allowing that one triumphant individual to return home victorious.That winner for the 74th Hunger Games is 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) from the coal-mining District 12, a strong-willed independent girl who has been providing for her grief-stricken mother (Paula Malcomson) and her younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) ever since their father died in an accident. Ever the protector, Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place when her name is called during the Reaping and- together with fellow tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)- is abruptly whisked off into a surreal world of pomp and pomposity very unlike their home.It's only a temporary reprieve before the survivalist Games, just enough time for Katniss to pick up some useful tips from her drunken mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and make an impression to both the Games keeper Seneca (Wes Bentley) and the sponsors whose contributions may mean the difference between life and death. All too soon, Katniss finds herself released into a densely forested arena- that is really a tightly controlled space rigged all around with cameras- and made to fight for her life alongside Peeta and 22 other Tributes while the citizens of Panem and the districts watch riveted.While the concept plays like an amalgam of 'The Truman Show' and 'Battle Royale', director and co-adapter Gary Ross has chosen a Bourne-like style with hand-held camera-work and quick cutting to inject urgency to the proceedings. Like Bourne too, our heroine is a master of her environment, making keen use of her terrain and the resources it offers to stay alive- even as the movie plays up the fact that the confrontations between her and her potential opponents are ultimately rigged by Seneca and his team for maximum viewing excitement.Fans of the book will no doubt be making mental comparisons with key plot points in Katniss' harrowing struggle- desperately hunting for water at the start; confronting an uneasy alliance of well-trained Tributes from wealthier districts; outsmarting them by unleashing mutated wasps known as Tracker Jackers on them; infuriating them by destroying their food supply; and of course allying with Peeta when the rules change to allow both a chance at survival. Ross, who co-wrote the screenplay with Collins and Billy Ray (of 'Shattered Glass'), ensures that none of these crucial elements are lost, even as the order in which they occur get shuffled around.At the fore of both the movie as well as the book- and played with remarkable clarity by Jennifer Lawrence in a performance of genuine grit and emotion- is Katniss' winning combination of intelligence and humanity, despite the dehumanising state of affairs she has been thrust into. Just as adeptly as its source, Ross conveys Katniss' ingenuity in the way she outwits her attackers as well as her indignation when an unlikely friend and ally, Rue (Amandla Stenberg), is abruptly killed. There is confidence, steeliness and vulnerability in Lawrence's brilliant turn, just as- if not more- outstanding than her earlier Oscar-nominated performance in 'Winter's Bone' where she also played a young teenager thrust into adult circumstances. Not surprisingly, there are nuances that are evidently lost from the movie, some though more significant than others. Chief among them is the made-for-TV romance between Katniss and Peeta, key to understanding the climactic outcome at the end- whereas the first-person narration of the book allowed for a keen understanding of Katniss' ambivalence, the movie's portrayal opts for a much more straightforward portrayal that doesn't do justice to Katniss' complicated stirrings for Peeta vis-à-vis her hometown pseudo-boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth in a small but crucial role when parts two and three roll by).Ross also skims over the significant role Haymitch plays in their mutual survival (presumably to ensure tight narrative momentum), as well as the bloodshed of the actual Games (quite surely in order for the film to be able to play to a teenage audience). But in compensation, there is more emphasis on the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring by a quietly menacing President Snow- not simply setting the stage for later instalments, but also underlining the callousness of the Capitol administration in treating the lives of children as mere pawns in a psychological game of dominance and submission. Yes, if there is one aspect that comes off more strongly than the book, it is undoubtedly the allegory behind the dsytopic world of the Games.Kudos then to Ross, who may have seemed an odd choice for the material given his past works 'Pleasantville' and 'Seabiscuit, for boldly taking the creative liberties with the material while staying largely faithful and delivering a tense, thrilling, intelligent science-fiction thriller with sharp social critiques that will resonate with grown-ups. Indeed, don't let the comparisons to Twilight mislead you for thinking that this is only for kids- thanks to a fearless performance by Lawrence, Katniss is a heroine that everyone of all ages can look up to.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

I can't help but feel as if the majority of the people who take their time to write such deterring reviews for The Hunger Games might be influenced by peer pressure. There were so many people out there with bad reviews for the movie that it almost seems as if they wanted the movie to fail so that they could slam down some pretty harsh insults on the lack of the character's emotional depth and how it wasn't violent enough.I thought the producers showed excellent work with the cinematography (especially the shaky camera feeling) because it made the audience feel immersed in the desperation and fear the tributes experience from the Hunger Games. Now I know that any popular movies that have received great reviews will also receive negative reviews, but if you honestly feel like the movie was a waste of cinematography, then watch the Academy Awards next year and see how people with a professional opinion feel about it.The movie was absolutely fantastic and I believe that about 90% of the people who went to see it would agree with me.As for it being a huge waste of money and time as mentioned by arunspurs, well look at the amount of money it made in less than a month. Movies like these do not simply make 300 million dollars because the books were so famous, the movies actually have to be pleasant and entertained enough for people to see. I don't what it is with all of these negative reviews, but at least I can take comfort in knowing that there is at least one person out there who wasn't unreasonably critical of the movie. The only thing I found out from reading all of these reviews is that there are tons of people who either feel good about writing bad reviews or they simply cannot appreciate a good film with incredible depth and emotional movement.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Perfect performance by Lawrence, and an exciting movie to boot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2586435/?ref_=tt_urv","dfranzen70","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0543054/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2012","I was very impressed with The Hunger Games. Sure, you have to suspend a little bit of logic, and the great old tradition of a dystopian future is revived, but overall it's an excellent film with terrific camera-work and editing and a knockout performance by the soon-to-be-a-huge-star Jennifer Lawrence.So there was this big war, and the world was divided into 12 districts, and as a reminder of its vicious past the Capitol decreed that each district send two children, ages 12-18, to participate in a fight to the death. Somehow this is to remind them of not only their past but humility and the fact that they're likely to die young. But it seems like a post-apocalyptic society with a blend of technology and rustic charm, so who knows. Anyway, 24 kids, chosen randomly at ceremonies called Reapings, and it's all a Big Deal. They've been doing it for almost three-quarters of a century.District 12 is a hardscrabble, coal-mining community whose mine blew up. So people are pretty destitute. They (barely) live off the land. When the Reaping comes, Primrose Everdeen and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are chosen. Poor Prim's just a little girl, so her older sister Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers in her place. This has apparently never happened before, which seems implausible, but you can go with it.The two Tributes are then taken to the capitol city, where they are judged and evaluated in order to gain sponsors; sponsors can help you when you're in the middle of the forest. Preparing Katniss and Peeta for the Games is Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), who's actually won the games and can offer advice, and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) whose job it is to make the two Tributes look good when being presented in the parade and the talk show and so on and so on. And then the games begin.Imagine you're in the middle of a field within a semicircle containing 23 other young people. Some of them are athletic. Some are tiny and may never have left the house. Some have been preparing their entire lives. There is a cache of weaponry and food near the semicircle. Your mission is to survive longer than everyone else. You're under a lot of stress already, and now it really sinks in - you will certainly have to kill one or more of those you see, kids with whom you have no quarrel. Kill or be killed, as they say.The entire Games takes place in a huge climate-controlled dome. In fact, everything can be created/controlled, including fire and animals. As in the TV series Survivor, some of the kids form alliances, led by alpha males. Katniss isn't that kind of creature. She doesn't even want to be there. Who does? The ones who have been training all their lives, of course. The cinematography is riveting. It's sometimes tough to get a read on a situation when all you see are people running through the woods, close up. Not here. The director of photography, Tom Stern, does a miraculous job of keeping us in the story, involved with the main characters, without losing the edge of heart-racing action. I thought Lawrence was amazing in her gritty performance in Winter's Bone. This cements, in my mind, her standing as a tremendous talent. She is perfect for this role; her Katniss is tenacious, willful, and both terrified and determined. She's a skilled archer (has to be back home in order to find any food) but lacks a certain, shall we say, charm. Although she's not unattractive, she never smiles, seems resentful, and as a result is tough to get along with. Before the games, anyway. Through the tutelage of Cinna and Abernathy, she's able to show enough grace and poise to win some people over.It's a knockout performance. Sure, you're supposed to be rooting for her anyway, even though she isn't the underdog in the fight. She's the one with the compelling backstory - young sister and distant mother at home, father killed in mine accident. She has a lot to fight for. Lawrence can evoke respect and fear just by her expressive eyes. And, of course, the role itself is physically very demanding, and she's well up to the task. But Lawrence's great skill here is in engaging the audience to the point where even if they believe she will win, they desperately want to know how she'll accomplish it. Will she kill? Will she not kill someone? (Remember, only one can survive.)I like it when movies that seem to have a certain predictability about them - a predetermined finale, for example - throw in a twist that makes perfect sense but still isn't really foreseeable. As long as a seismic character change doesn't occur (such as a ""good"" person very suddenly becoming ""bad"" to further the plot), this is a welcome change - and it's tough to do. Big praise to The Hunger Games for throwing in twists that weren't laughable and to leaving the ending a little open ended in some regards. Not all loose ends are tied up. They often aren't in real life, either.So, as long as you don't closely question the movie's overall premise, you'll be very pleased with this film. It's well acted all around, immaculately shot and edited, and has intense, action scenes that will leave you as exhausted as the participants.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It reminded me of Norman Jewison's ""Rollerball"", which also depicts an ultra-violent sport that constitutes the entertainment in a totalitarian future.The movie itself isn't any kind of masterpiece, but it should force the viewer to stop and think for a minute. Much like Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", it poses the question of how any society came to be what it is: everything may look fine and dandy, but how authentic is it? I had never heard of the series until the first movie came out (and that weekend I went to see the Polish movie ""In Darkness""). Now that I've seen it, I can solemnly recommend it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

This movie, which also holds the special memory of being the first film I saw in the cinema, stands out for its compelling story and creative concept.The film's strength lies in its engaging and thought-provoking plot. Set in a dystopian future, it introduces us to a world where the Hunger Games, a brutal competition for survival, is a central part of society. The concept is both original and chilling, drawing viewers into a narrative that is as much about the characters' physical survival as it is about the moral and ethical dilemmas they face.What makes The Hunger Games particularly noteworthy is its successful adaptation from the book series. The film manages to capture the essence of the source material, bringing the harrowing tale of Katniss Everdeen and her fight for survival to life. The portrayal of the dystopian world is visually striking and immersive, making the cinematic experience even more impactful.The performances, especially by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, add depth to the film. Lawrence's portrayal of a strong, yet vulnerable character is compelling, making her journey through the Games something viewers can emotionally connect with.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When I first saw it in April, I wasn't too fussed by it, I felt it skimmed the book instead of going into detail and it was a fairly forgettable film. When I watched it again, it was pretty good. The setting is decent and the score is also really good(James Newton Howard, Dinosaur and Peter Pan, 'nuff said). If there is one criticism I would make about it, it would be that it doesn't go into the detail the book did. But they did what they could to remain it as a 12 and for what detail it does go into to, it's not bad. It was close to being a 15 anyway so I would have put in the depth and rate it 15, but that's my opinion. Overall, fairly decent and not the worst book-film transition I've seen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Those who enjoy dystopian stories may find the Hunger Games to be similar, and yet the style and voice are fresh enough to appeal to the youth. So where does this film fit in? Somewhere in the middle; you don't have label yourself a critic or a fan or a casual viewer to enjoy this movie-it stands on its own.Our protagonist is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). She is neither acidic nor saccharine in behavior; she is simply naturally reserved, and perhaps a little sullen (with good reason). Her character is well-played and strikes to the core as realistic; for that alone the audience is able to cheer for her. If she's is genuine, so too are her dire circumstances, and so too is the weight of her success. The supporting (and talented) cast fall into place comfortably; not once did I cringe at an ill-spoken line or a poorly-cast character. Certainly there were changes made from book-to-movie, most if not all were to aid the audience's comprehension, as we no longer have Katniss' first-person narration to explain plot points to us. The art direction was in most areas commendable, and in others simply adequate, the music score was unique and subtly haunting, and the camera work to be honest flipped between lousy and decent. I recommend you sit a fair deal away from the screen since most of the intro scenes are choppy. I assume this was done to hurry things along and add to tension but I felt that swift, steady shots would have sufficed. The violence in this movie is sensitized at just the right level (which is refreshing, since most film-violence is usually melodramatic or mindless), and is a unique blend of toned-down bloodshed with an intense feeling of moral disgust. As for my complaints, there is the aforementioned shaky-camera in some scenes, the too-rushed character interaction/development (at least on behalf of characters who won't return for the sequels), the omission of a few bits of back-story and artistic design that I felt would have enriched the story more for those who haven't read the books (and a few times their omission made the film seem a little too edited), and there were a handful of scenes that could have used dramatic embellishment and yet went without.All in all I give it an 8 out of 10; it stands the test of translating from one form of media to another, it gives us a taste of both the love and the humanity within such bleak settings, and it wets our appetite for the chaos to come. Let the games begin.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I've yet to read any, so this was the first time I was exposed to anything Hunger Games related. I actually dug this movie for the most part. It has stylish direction, as well as excellent acting, especially from Jennifer Lawrence. Her strong performance as Kitniss was a main reason as to why I enjoyed this movie so much. I must also commend the somewhat audacious subject matter. Other than Battle Royale, I can't think of any other films that have dared to have teens killing each other. The Hunger Games also has some solid character development. I dug the subtle relationship between Jennifer Lawrence & Josh Hutcherson. It did a good job of making us care about them, and their fate. Credit must be given to the action scenes as well, which were quite enthralling at times. The Hunger Games has plenty of tension and suspense. I didn't expect much when going into this one, despite the rabid fan base. I ended up being very surprised by how much I liked it. It is flawed and a bit overlong, but overall I enjoyed it very much. I'm looking forward to Catching FireRating: 7.5/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not a review of how good an adaptation of the book Hunger Games is.The Hunger Games is clearly a film with a primary target audience. So any criticism should be mindful of that. The fact that it is a targeted film yet remains eminently watchable for people outside that demographic is to its huge credit.I think most people by now know the basic story so I won't go into that. The strengths of the film lie in its tremendous premise and the back story around it (accusations of plagiarism in relation to Battle Royale are harsh). Also the performance of Jennifer Lawrence is a powerhouse and she has a wonderful career in front of her. The action scenes are filmed very sympathetically, leaving you in no doubt of the horror that is happening without really showing anything to compromise the target audience.The film does fall down in a couple of areas though. It seems completely unaware of some of the powerful themes it has at its disposal. Not nearly enough was shown of the relationship between the populace of the Capital and the outer districts. Perhaps this is dealt with more in later instalments. The characterisation of the tributes was also thin on the ground, and the idea of the games as a true test of skill, endurance, psychology etc was massively underdeveloped. Perhaps this was deliberate to show that the organisers were obsessed with controlling the action. If it was, then I would say it was a mistake.Overall I think the film is quite a rarity. It has some wonderful ideas and although enjoyable, it feels like it was reined in to ensure it met its target audience. It's arguable that in movie making, there are few greater crimes.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having not read the book or even heard of the series before seeing the trailer, I was surprised of how wrong I had been. When walking home from the cinema, I kept asking myself the question, why, why it wasn't great, what made it bad. And I found myself unable to answer my own questions. Other movies adapted from books, where I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie, I hated to ask the question ""but, why did he say that or why did that happen?"" and getting the answer ""you gotta read the book to understand that"". But after watching the Hunger Games, the question I have is, what's gonna happen next?

The movie did portray the scenes quite well, many of them looked just like how i had imagined them in the book, however it lacked the feel that i got from the novels, most, if not all, of the scenes from the book that had a lot of feeling and build up felt completely flat in the movie, they did not have the significance or feeling that they were meant to have.If you have read the books, and enjoyed them a lot, i don't believe you will like this movie very much, for the reasons i have stated above.If you have not read the series, i believe you will enjoy it quite a bit and i encourage you to go and see it.

I can still remember the blog post I wrote on the day Lionsgate announced purchasing the film rights - not to mention the excitement! For this reason, I approached the cinema with some trepidation - so often a film I've been excited about has fallen short of my expectations. However, 2 hours and 20 minutes later I dragged myself from the cinema, already planning my next visit at the weekend. Lionsgate have truly achieved a feat of film making with this title. Even for someone like me who knows the books inside out, it was an emotional roller-coaster. Any doubts I had about the casting were blown aside and the incredible attention to detail were enough satiate even the hungriest appetite. The adaptation - presumably helped in some extent by Suzanne Collins's involvement with the screen writing - is beautifully done, coping with the time constraints that have so often proved the downfall of a book adaptation being dealt with with great panache and style. For those of you worrying that the film maker might have foregrounded the love element between Katniss and Peeta, rest assured, there is nothing Twilight-y about this. It is represented almost perfectly from the books. Instead of the love story though, the really important themes are brought out in grand style. The modern ""game show"" influence is clearly shown through cut scenes showing the game makers manipulating the arena to force the contestants together and force conflict. The mechanism of the games is much more clearly shown than in the books, and for me (one of those people who reads books and watches films for their themes!), this is really what I wanted out of this film.However, please don't misunderstand me. As a visual spectacle the film is remarkable and would be a great ""popcorn and Pepsi"" viewing. Also the sci-fi subject makes it great for kids who will not understand or care about the deeper undertones of the story.There are also a couple of places in the film where it is set up for the sequels and the significance of Katniss and Peeta's actions for the dominance of the Capital are clearly shown.In summary, this is a remarkable production. It will work on all levels for any age group or breed of film-goers. Whether you want to come away feeling some great epiphany about our (and I have to say this at great risk to my reputation, particularly America's) society works, or just with a stupid look on your face at the quality of the graphic detail, this is a must see film.P.S. If any responsible parents are out there reading this to try and find out if it's alright to take their 10 year old to see it, there are no real bloody moments. There is some close up of a burn wound, an injury to Peeta's leg, and a corpse disfigured by 'wasp' stings. Also there is a scene in which a young girl is killed, but again, this is not graphic and is more emotional. I do not think it likely to perturb most children. However, I'll withhold my address in case you find me to be wrong!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Yes, they toned it down a little but only a very little. Is it really a surprise that it's not an exact replica of the book? Hasn't this been happening for decades? Hollywood is Hollywood, the day they make a movie exactly like the book, it will be one of the signs of the apocalypse. What I always do in situations like this is just separate the two or see it as a preview of the book and just enjoy it and this movie is entertaining! It's suspenseful, action packed, visually interesting, well cast and worth the price of the ticket. What more could you ask for in a movie? The one thing I liked as well is it jumped away from katniss from time to time and you got to see haymitch behinds the scenes trying to help, and see how the gamekeepers operate to make the games more interesting, why they make the moves they do instead of just guessing at it when you read. Except for a little here and there, they kept Very true to the books, the things they left out weren't important to the plot at all. You have to realize many people who went to see the movies never read the books, so they film makers have to make it understandable to them as well. So, to sum it up. It's a very entertaining movie, for those of you who have read the books: go into it knowing it won't be exactly the same thing and just try to enjoy it! Pretend you're watching a very long, well funded commercial for the book. The movie is the movie, the book is the book! Fight the urge to compare and just enjoy!!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Starting with somebody instructing me not to go and see it unless I had read the books! What tosh. It's always a risk seeing a film after you enjoy a book, on this occasion it didn't affect me. Not read the books, not a teenager, neither are my kids anymore and I loved it. I am fussy and don't watch rubbish, I prefer high end intelligent films and not the ones for the masses.I was in two minds about this and only went as we had nothing else to do. Very glad that we did. I didn't need to know the story to understand that they were living in extreme poverty, I managed to work that out for myself. The acting has been criticized as 'shallow'??!! Unbelievable. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic. I also don't agree that the special effects were poor, I thought they were great and a big part of the movie.Maybe some people are unable to suspend their disbelief and that is why they couldn't enjoy this film. I found it totally engrossing as have some of my friends and really enjoyed it and recommend it as a couple of hours of good entertainment.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

There is just something about them that makes them enjoyable to me, even though I see them as highly flawed. Maybe it's the actually good acting, maybe it's the concept, maybe it's the world, but I see this movie as a good fun time.Katniss is a young woman in a world where a capital has taken over the world. They have assigned people to districts that work for them. As a punishment for a prior rebellion, the capital host the Hunger Games, a tournament where kids kill each other. When Katniss sister is assigned to join the Hunger Games, Katniss takes her place.What feels the best written here is no doubt the world, and then again. The one aspect I simply can't make sense of is that it is for this Hunger Game that the people start to rebel again. Why now? Why not before? Sure compassion but come on man. The idea of districts, the capital, the Hunger games and its aspects, the sponsors, public appearances. It all creates this very interesting would where surviving and killing is only the half of it and the political and crowd aspect is as important. I liked this stuff, it's awesome.Although I feel like the first half dragged to me. When the games begin, I was far more invested. Maybe I felt the movie a bit too focusless for its own good.We really needed more time with other characters, such as Haymitch played by Woody Harrelson and Cinna played by Lenny Kravitz. These characters seem more important in later scenes, even though they have barely had any screen time. This will also carry over to the later movies, where we really needed them more established to really have impacts with them. There is a lot of great performances here. I loved Donald Sutherland as president Snow and him together with the game master Seneca played by Wes Bently are hilarious as Snow really makes him look like an idiot. But the most incredible performance is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. She really gets to flex her acting muscles in some scenes. And there is so much great subtle acting here as well as great emotional scenesA problem I have with Katniss though is that she is too perfect. A common problem with these young adult books. Sure, she gets hurt but she is in a tournament where she has to either survive until everyone is dead, or kill people. She is never really faced with a hard decision about taking a life, and that would have really made the character and her later PTSD so much more apparent. She is a bit too good of a good guy in a murder tournament.The movie has a brilliant sound design and really uses silence a lot, very effectively. It is something I forget the movie does well every time I rewatch it, so it's a pleasant surprise every time.I have praised how well I think the concept is, and I really wished this movie was miles better than it is. It is one of those movies where I really want someone to do the concept justice to it's core, not that this movie is bad, but I need someone to really sell the full potential.One problem the movie has is the shaky cam. There is a lot of handheld camera in this movie, and it has no idea how to use it. It starts out find a clearly a style choice, but then so many scenes has it for no reason. And the action looks terrible because of it. You can use shaky cam to show chaos, but we as the audience still need to have an idea what's going on, and the movie does not succeed at that.Overall, Hunger Games is your typical young adult story but with an interesting and cool coat of paint. I liked a lot of aspects of it, but it still has its downsides too. It is an enjoyable watch every time, but nothing that really screams great to me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The brutality was NOT described exaggerated. (Like in the Battle Royal novel - this is truly a horror Book) So please, research in the internet before you write things which are wrong. And to the people who don't know if they should watch the movie: Book and Movie complement each other! That is what Gary and also Suzanne said about it. Please, don't believe poor reviews.Here is my Review: I was impressed by the books. These novels are the most impressive books I have ever read. Such a powerful and frightening story with many very important massages.The acting was very powerful. Jennifer is the perfect Katniss (in my eyes) and she embodied her fear, courage and her strength perfectly. Josh: He is Peeta! I always liked him in previous movies and when he got the role I watched interviews on you-tube and I saw Peeta! Willow as Prim is just so cute and she got a lot of talent (Prim is one of my favorite characters). Liam, Elizabeth, Woody, Lenny, Wes, Donald were so great! I'm happy that they are in the movie. But one actor in this movie is very special to me: Alexander Ludwig. Cato is one of the most brutal Tributes. No, he is the most brutal! I could imagine Alex playing Cato, but what I saw on the big screen was much better and more frightening than I imagined. Especially the final scene.The look of District 12, the Capitol and the Arena were much better than in my imagination. Especially the Capitol! These massive buildings, the lights and all these people. Impressive and frightening at the same time.So, the movie has not missed its goal for me. It was like a bomb attack. For a long time I have not seen such a heavy and intense film! (I mean like The Road or Changeling). I think I've cried 4 times. Every day I have to think about all this what happened in the story. May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor. Someone here wrote that they need a better writer for the next movies. Suzanne Collins was involved in writing on the Hunger Games script! AND she was involved in the Casting choices! She is not just one of the producers!And here is something from Miss Lawrence for those who don't get the point of The Hunger Games: ""I took away that, over time, we're just becoming so desensitized to death. Humanity is becoming dulled to itself. We can watch people die on TV; we can watch a snowboarder fall off a mountain and die. We see dead bodies and blood on the nightly news. The things people can find on YouTube are crazy! We've become so numb to the shock factor. The world is obsessed with reality television, and in a world where history repeats itself, it's plausible, really, that our world could get there."" – Jennifer on what The Hunger Games say about humanity.And here something from Gary Ross, what he says about the movie rating: ""I don't think it has to be violent in order to be urgent. For the majority of the movie Katniss is being pursued and it's a violent universe she's in. But that doesn't mean the violence has to be depicted gruesomely or exploited in any way.""","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

An inordinate amount of time is invested in world building and scene setting here, which makes for some great, functional locales, but also relegates the plot to secondary status. Jennifer Lawrence is well-cast as the brooding, bow-wielding introvert Katniss, but the rest of the cast underperforms - especially Woody Harrelson, in a role he was seemingly perfect for, as her pathetic, booze-drenched adviser Haymitch. Readers with a fresh memory of the novels will get the most out of this interpretation, which assumes its audience knows most of the finer points of what's going on and summarily neglects any form of deeper investigation. It's gorgeous, though occasionally a bit too eccentric (some scenes in the capital look like they were ripped right out of a Final Fantasy cutscene) and non-fanatics will probably find it too narrow and fluffy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That being said, I thought the attention to detail was amazing from the color of Katniss reaping dress to character descriptions, hair color, skin color, etc which a lot of movies leave out. The group I was with contained people who read the book and people who did not. The people who did not read the books understood everything that was going on. The games themselves could have had alittle more time dedicated to it but I understand since the movie was already 2 1/2 hours long. The acting was incredible and was completely satisfied as a previous fan.Also, for those that said they sold out by the PG-13 rating, you have to remember these books are written for YOUNG ADULTS, so therefore that is the audience that is targeted, not just to get more money.Overall, for the rating, the amount of time, the director and actors did an excellent job of adapting such an incredible,detailed book.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

On the whole, loyalty to the original, but lead to a pale film story; plot development is slightly delayed; the ending of the second episode is limited to love triangle, should the president do something at the end? Moreover, I hate the vulgar scenes that are not enough to make up for. P.S.

I also have to say that a combination of that and having seen the movie ""Battle Royale"" first may have affected my opinion of the movie. This is very good and I am interested to see the other movies they are making but this is defiantly geared toward the young adult ""Twilight"" type crowd and after seeing ""Battle Royale"" this was just to tame for me.

The Capitol is a luxurious Rome-like place economically supported by activity in the districts. The higher the number of the district, the lower class it is. Annually there Hunger Games are held for which each district supplies a randomly chosen boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18. In the Games, they fight to the death over several days. The ""arena"" is a large forested area containing both resources and dangers for the ""tribunes."" The sole survivor from the 24 competitors receives many riches and acclaim for his/her district.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is from District 12, a poor mining area. Her 12-year-old sister, Primrose (Willow Shields), is randomly chosen in her first year of eligibility. Katniss, who is 16, volunteers in her place. The baker's son from the district, Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson). In the film's first half, we also get to meet her boyfriend, Gale (Liam Hemsworth).Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol to prepare for the Games. We meet the Games' organizer, Seneca (Wes Bently); the host of the event, Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), and the people who help Katniss and Peeta prepare. These include Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a former winner.The second half of the movie is the fight for survival by the tribunes. Katniss enter a partnership with the girl from District 11, Rue (Amandia Stenberg). The relationship between Katniss and Peeta also evolves during the film.The Hunger Games books were trendy in the early 2010s. I enjoyed the action, though they're not exactly literature. I had seen none of the films. This one is well done; I'm not sure if someone who hadn't read the books would figure out the storyline solely from the movie. Jennifer Lawrence plays a powerful protagonist. Some of the secondary characters are more cartoonish.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Pity about the Apple-loops excuse for music. Nice to have it all so predictable - perfect watching for Alzheimer's patients. What a horrifying film, though, far, far, in the future and humanity hasn't evolved beyond 'reality' plebvision....Isn't it fortunate that, as Yogi Berra pointed out, 'It's difficult to make predictions, particularly about the future'.Pathetic, really. They don't even know what 'star crossed' means. How sad, they could have made an interesting film, instead of this tosh. I thought, for a while, that it might be anti-fascism, instead it was a bad modern re-make of 'Triumph of the Will'. Yankland Über alles in der Welt'. Well, I suppose that you have to accept that it reflects the Zeitgeist. I think that Neitzche, if shorn of all his aesthetic sensibilities, might have liked it.What is worst about the whole thing, really, is that such a badly made, fascist film is so popular - if it had just gone straight to DVD, where it belongs, it wouldn't be such a sad indictment on popular taste and popular sentiment (sentimentality, really). I suppose that we have to accept that, like the depression in the 1930s, this depression has, almost inevitably, led to an adoption of fascist mawkishness. Wouldn't it be nice if humanity was capable of something better.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Unfortunately this just doesn't seem to be the case. The film isn't bad it's just that it really hasn't lived up to the hype that has been circulating it for months. I hadn't read the books but I was intrigued by the format, it's different and not like anything else at the moment.What I like about 'The Hunger Games' is that it really IS refreshingly different! It's not your average teenage novel turned movie; it's actually really quite interesting and it draws you in with the mystery and captivity of it all. It's intriguing to say the least and I found that I had to keep watching it.Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) shows little to no emotion throughout the film. Whether or not she's supposed to be like that is yet to be heard, all I know is that she was incredibly boring to watch. Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) is only OK and doesn't really bring anything to the film... Liam Hemsworth has been cast as one of the main characters (Gale Hawthorne) yet you see him about three times in the film? He has fewer lines than some of the minor characters and you barely see him at all throughout...Overall the film was pretty good; it had an all-star cast and an intriguing plot. It was let down by the cast who were really quite boring. It was also massively over hyped which doesn't help when someone is trying to be critical. I'm definitely going to be buying the books, not only because I'm curious to find out what's next but also because I just don't see how you could fashion a good sequel off the back of this film...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Despite Jennifer Lawrence presenting (in my opinion) the best performance of her life, Gary Ross tried too much and too little at the same time. Diverging from the violent nature of Suzanne Collins' original story put a big damper on the overall feel for the oppression of the Capital (all to keep profits up by keeping the movie PG-13). Overall though, the movie stayed true to the book as any adaptation I've seen prior. The energy output of this all star cast is amazing, despite the lack of ""action"" in some sequences. All and all, a great movie that begs the question: ""What will become of Katniss Everdeen?""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A decent adaptation of a teen fiction novel to movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2996925/?ref_=tt_urv","blaynebittner","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45423339/?ref_=tt_urv","12 April 2014","When I first picked up a copy of The Hunger Games to read, Mockingjay had yet to be released. There wasn't as huge of hype about the movie at the time. What made me interesting in reading the novel was Stephen king's review of it.I picked up the novel and had a lot of trouble putting it down. I figured, ""this would make a good movie"". A month or two later, the announcement was made that the series would become a movie.Not nearly as many people spend time reading these days, at least in Alberta. The book wasn't extremely long. Adults seem more used to easier reads. I read this book in two sittings because I forced myself to take a break half an hour into the first sitting due to work. I read the entire rest of the book on a weekend evening in about 5 hours, which is still somewhat slow in my opinion.The book series is written with the intention of showing how horrible war actually is. Its designed for teens to enjoy. There's a lot that a teen can legally read which they cannot actually see in a motion picture.I believe it was a good decision to make this fit for pg-13. The movie wouldn't have been so successful as an R rated movie. It wasn't necessary to make into an R rated movie. The book didn't have curses, nor sex scenes, so why go that far if it wasn't there in the first place? The book takes a lot of influence from an Asian gem, which we all know. I do not believe at all that it is a replica. Its quite similar, but follows its own storyline.I'm not going to ruin anything in what happens in the movie or book, so pardon me for being vague.I rate this movie a 7/10 because of the camera work. If it wasn't for the shaky camera, I'd rate it a 9/10.Movies have never and will never be exactly the same as the books. While this isn't a perfect adaptation, its worth watching and enjoying throughout. There were some poor casting choices in my opinion, but the lead role was exactly how I pictured her, same with Peeta. I believe they were a little off on how they presented Gale's character, but this is the movie and not the book.The sequel, Catching Fire, is a much better adaptation in my opinion. I believe there is a lot of potential in making two movies out of Mockingjay.The book is entirely in first person point of view, while the movie shows other character's points of view. Mockingjay is a lot more complex with a lot more room to extend the length. It makes sense to me to make the third book into two movies because it would be hard to follow and miss too much of the book being in one movie made for teens and older.The Hunger Games movie itself I enjoyed once through. I was not interested in re-watching after I saw it in theaters. However, I could take a younger nephew or niece to enjoy this movie.Action movies have become a lot darker in modern times. People always enjoy violence on the screen, especially men and children. Its nice to have a movie like this where we can include a younger audience.There's a ton of haters on the movie, but it does not deserve any rating below 6. Enjoy it for what it is, and rent or buy it for your kids.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Across the board this movie was far from spectacular with both actors and set rather bland and the costumes not much better. IF it was hoping to match the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, LOTR, Underworld, POTC etc then it failed in epic proportions. None of the actors really generated any emotion that should have drawn us in, leaving one feeling rather detached from the whole debacle and wondering exactly how brain dead those whom have been applauding this trash really are. PLEASE Hollywood, bring back REAL actors with REAL talent and stop fobbing us off with trash like this! 1/10 only because I can't give it the ZERO it truly deserves.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

I like this movie for what it is in itself. It's dark, it's exciting and it's breathtaking. Katniss Everdeen is trying to survive a life of poverty in District twelve. She lives there with her little sister and mother struggling to be the breadwinner in the family when the worst thing that could happen, happens - her sister is being randomly picked to fight till death in the 74. annual Hunger Games, a game of which only one out of 24 young kids can survive. She enters the games and from there on out it really is ""game on"".This move is critical to our society, were we use and abuse the less fortunate to be able to live our luxury lives in the western, modern world. And if your thoughts about that subject reaches further down than a thimble you will also see that connection. I like the way they have portrayed The Capitol (the city that runs everything), it is a superficial world where appearance is on top of the list. There are a few sci-fi elements, and that is because the filmmakers wants to make a point out of the fact that this is a setting in the near future. Some of the scenes are majestic, and makes you hold your breath. The cast is very good, although I hope I get to see Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss, relaxes into her role a bit more in the sequel. And that is also why I gave 7 out of 10. It could have been and eight if she was a little better at portraying Katniss Everdeen, but in that case it really helps that the very talented Woody Harrelson plays one of the characters closest to Katniss as her coach.All in all, it's great entertainment on a Saturday night tucked under the blankets with some chips and coke to nibble and sip on. Enjoy!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is based on the first book of the saga ""Hunger Games"". It's set in Panem, a futuristic country organized in twelve districts, where the Capitol controls everything and organizes a ""competition"" annually, the Hunger Games. Each district has two teenagers between 12 and 18 years old in the killing competition, that the winner is the only one alive.There are many memorable characters including Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a really brave girl that safes the young sister from the competition, entering in her position and Peeta Melark ( Josh Hutcherson), a guy from the same district as Katniss, representing it in the Hunger Games, has a long-date crush on her, and shows your force to fight and work in hers side.I am not normally keen on actions and science fiction movies and I 'm glad that I decided to watch it, it's the best movie I've ever seen.

I was concerned that the story itself was just too long and in-depth for the time constraints of a movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Casting is genius, particularly with Donald Sutherland as President Snow and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. Jennifer Lawrence plays an acceptable Katniss. The setting is well done without taking over the film. The Capital's garish clothes are perfect and contrast visually with the bland poverty of the districts. Surprisingly, the violence is not particularly watered down. It is instead inferred with the camera only viewing the before and after. This works well in a story where the violence is integral to the plot. The Hunger Games themselves are well done. The brutality is emphasised by the switches to the control room and the concentration on the 'game' aspect. There is thankfully very little obvious CGI which could have been overdone. My only negative comment about the film and the reason I did not award it 10 stars was because the lack of focus on the 'hunger' aspect of the society. In the novel, Katniss and Peeta gorge themselves on food. Unfortunately in the film, they do not. This means that the poverty of the districts is not viewed as extreme as it is supposed to be. The viewer cannot believe any people who have lived on the edge of starvation their whole lives would sit in a dining car full of food without eating it... In conclusion, The Hunger Games is an excellent adaptation of the novel. Actually one of the best film adaptations I have seen. Worth a look whether you have read the novel or not.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now, at last, another is breaking into their ranks, a sixteen year old girl with a braid, a bow and enough spirited determination to conquer the world: meet Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire.As Harry Potter's legacy officially ends with the eighth and final movie of the franchise having bowed last year, cementing J.K. Rowling's landmark series as the cornerstone of the childhood of a generation, and the world eagerly anticipates – or dreads – the release of the last Twilight movie, Gary Ross offers us his fine cinematic adaptation of The Hunger Games, the first chapter in Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy about a dystopian future where teens are forced to fight to the death by a government that controls its citizens with an iron fist. The director of Seabiscuit brings Collins' story to life with a serious-minded verve and intelligence that distinguishes it from other young adult-oriented fare, assembling an almost pitch-perfect cast and treating the source material – and its fans – with a respect that feels increasingly rare in an industry that often seems to value easy money and marketability over true quality, especially when it comes to potential franchises.The temptation to churn out a cheap, lazy cash-grab a la the Twilight movies must've been there, given that audiences would've flocked to the theaters regardless, but the filmmakers evidently cared about the movie beyond its obvious box-office potential. They take the pulse-pounding intensity of the books and successfully translate it to the big screen, staying true in spirit but displaying a great willingness to tweak and embellish the story when necessary. Among other changes, by expanding the point of view beyond Katniss, the movie offers a wider perspective, something new that could not be found in the book. It feels like a genuine, standalone movie rather than a paint-by-the-numbers adaptation, a distinction that the Harry Potter movies, for all their artistic merits, never quite mastered. Aside from some memorable performances, those films never provided anything that the books didn't. Furthermore, though as someone who has read the books, I could be wrong about this, The Hunger Games does a good enough job of establishing its characters, story and tone internally that it should work for those coming in cold as well as long-time fans.Instead of going for sweeping and epic, Ross smartly focuses on the intimate, human aspects of the story, using a sometimes shaky camera and concise editing to create an almost documentary-like feel. He pays as much attention to the quiet scenes, such as a moment near the very beginning where Katniss comforts and sings to her younger sister Prim before leaving to hunt, as he does to the action scenes, which are sporadic and avoid self-indulgence, neither glorifying nor glossing over the violence. The music, composed by T. Bone Burnett, eschews the bombastic punk rock one might have expected in favor of a sparse, folksy vibe that reflects both the rustic simplicity of Katniss's District 12 roots and her inner desperation as she fights for survival; a few techno beats are thrown in as well whenever the action moves to the more advanced, futuristic Capitol. The costumes and sets also help realize the world of Panem in vivid detail while toning down the more outrageous elements of Collins's descriptions, particularly when it comes to the over-the-top fashion tastes of the Capitol residents.At the center of it all is Katniss Everdeen, played by a forceful but artfully restrained and nuanced Jennifer Lawrence, who appears in nearly every scene and, coupled with her Oscar-nominated performance as the similarly strong-willed and independent Ree in Winter's Bone, is establishing herself as a consistently compelling actress and a screen presence to be reckoned with. Passionate, complex and quick-witted, Katniss is willing to do whatever it takes to protect the people she loves, even if it involves violence or means putting herself in danger, but she doesn't descend into the emotionless, sexless (or sexed-up) killing machine cliché that seems to pass for a strong female character in action films nowadays. She's a heroine worth rooting for.Though Jennifer Lawrence is undoubtedly the star of the movie, she's joined by a host of talented, well-chosen supporting actors. As Peeta Mellark, Katniss's fellow District 12 tribute and sort-of love interest, Josh Hutcherson displays the appropriate amounts of charisma, sensitivity and conviction; he's come a long way since he first appeared in movies like the mostly forgettable Will Ferrell vehicle Kicking and Screaming and Zathura and continues to prove himself to be one of the most promising actors of his generation. Elizabeth Banks is almost unrecognizable under heavy, purposefully crude makeup as the shrill, peppy Effie, and Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci are both as magnetic as always as, respectively, Katniss's and Peeta's perpetually drunk mentor Haymitch and Caesar Flickerman, host of the Hunger Games telecast.Movies geared toward young adults or teens tend to be dismissed as escapist, mindless fluff not worthy of more serious consideration. Though it's hard to tell whether The Hunger Games will break this mold and be embraced as fully as the Harry Potter series, which found admirers among the young and old, critics and general audiences, was, it has an edge and intelligence that make it hard to resist. Sure, there are more pointed, hard-hitting social critiques out there, and it isn't as bleak or gritty as some might have liked, but as engaging entertainment that doesn't just ask viewers to turn their brains off, it more than delivers.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

These adaptations have ranged from the outstanding (Lord Of The Rings) to the downright abysmal (Twilight) with more than a few straddling in between (The Golden Compass, I Am Number Four). Thankfully, The Hunger Games is significantly better than a lot of other young adult adaptations, but not entirely flawless.The story revolves around Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl living in the dystopian district of Panem, who is thrown into a large scale fight to the death with 13 other teenagers from different districts. Those familiar with the Japanese satire Battle Royale, will notice more than a few similarities, with the movie often feeling like a watered down version. Still, it is quite intense fare for a young adult film, with a number of young children engaging in some fairly brutal violence and political allegories not normally associated with teen movies.As is often the case with literary adaptations, it feels like director Gary Ross is trying to fit as much information in as he possibly can so as not to upset fans of the book. Take the opening, which has the unfortunate task of explaining the book's lengthy exposition before we can even begin to think about the games themselves. The problem with this is, as a casual viewer, you are eager to see what all the fuss is about and after just over an hour of build up, it is perhaps inevitable that the games are slightly disappointing. After a suitably brutal opening brawl which claims the lives of a number of participants, we follow Katniss as she survives in the harsh wilderness like a futuristic Bear Grylls. There are some moments of inspiration, such as Ross' decision to almost completely strip the soundtrack during battle sequences, giving them a war movie aesthetic rather than an all action blockbuster. There is also a wonderful moment involving a key characters use of make up, which has to be seen to be believed but throughout the 2 and a half hour runtime, one can't shake the feeling that, given the source material, it could have been so much better.A dark and disturbing teen movie with some interesting political messages about class and the media. A fantastic central performance from Jennifer Lawrence elevates it above the likes of Twilight but it also suffers from trying to appease fans of the book and subsequently feels a little bloated.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'd normally sit watching the film picking out parts that have been done differently in the book and complain to anyone that will listen. HOWEVER believe me when I say the hunger games is different.The main problem for me in films of this line, e.g the most recent Harry Potter films and even the twilight saga, is the awful, awkward dialogue that is near painful to watch. It's hugely refreshing to see none of these forced, clichéd lines in this film. Gary Ross and Billy Ray do a great job writing the script whilst not losing the essence of Katniss. Bringing in Suzanne Collins was also a great idea, I'm sure she helped in changing the story slightly to suit a film yet keeping all important details the same.The imagery in the film was just fantastic, my favourite part in the whole film was at the start, where your given a brief tour of district 12 as Katniss ventures through the district out towards the woods. It's more perfect than what I'd imagined whilst reading the book and really shows the desperation and poverty of these people. The Reaping was the other part I loved, the way it was done was brilliant and it helped you to identify with these people, the graveness of their situation and the cruel, threatening dominion the Capitol exhibits. The costumes were also notably well picked out in this part, the best outfits of all the people were all a dull, faded grey colour. This draws parallels with concentration camps in Nazi Germany and creates this sense of despair which even as part of the audience you feel and you pity these people.The Acting in this film is almost flawless also, I'm such a sceptic when it comes to child/teenage actors but pretty much everyone in the cast plays their role brilliantly. A huge amount of credit to Jennifer Lawrence who fully embodies Katniss Everdeen and personifies every thing written about her in the novels. After pulling off a brilliant performance in Winters Bone and now this, I fully expect her to grow from strength to strength and have a very bright future ahead. The other mention-worthy performance in the film was by Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman who stole the show in each scene he was in. The cast all gelled exceedingly well together and it was an all round great performance from everyone which made the film a much more pleasant 2 and a half hours.The only complaint I had was the violence. I feel slightly cheated by how much we actually get to see. It is avoided with clever camera shots which dart around but in my opinion not enough. I'm not looking for excessive gore, I just think a little more may have been useful in keeping the audience drawn to the seriousness and desperation of the tributes. However I do appreciate that they obviously wanted the film available to a younger audience and adding in this violence may have increased the certificate.All in all it's a very good film and even better when you consider they've adapted it from a successful book with a cast full of young, teenage actors. It's definitely worth a watch and I recommend it fully.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Having not read the Young Adult novels of Suzanne Collins, my comments will be limited to the movie only and not a comparison to the books. The screenplay was a joint affair from Ms. Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross (Seabiscuit). Whether or not you read the books, you surely know that this has been an anticipated film version in the vein of Twilight and Harry Potter. My analysis is that it falls short of Harry and is superior to the vamps.What this film definitely is ... proof that Jennifer Lawrence is for real. She burst onto the scene in her Oscar nominated turn in Winter's Bone and once again, her squirrel recipes come in handy. Lawrence plays Katniss Everdeen, a tough as nails and very resourceful resident of the dirt poor District 12. She provides for her little sis and their emotionally vacant mother, and does so by honing her bow and arrow skills hunting in the vast woodlands.Without going into too much detail, the dystopian world of Panem is divided into 12 districts and a Capitol. As a combination entertainment and price for a previous rebellion, an annual lottery is held to select a boy and girl from each district ... ""tributes"" to their community. Those drawing the proverbial short straw are entered into brutal fight to the death, where 23 are to be killed and one left standing. In the 74th annual Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take the place of her little sister. So she and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, The Kids are All Right) are whisked away to the Capitol to meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a one time winner who celebrates daily by downing as much alcohol as possible.In stark contrast to the hopeless community from which they arrive, the Capitol is a gleaming, bright-colored land of enchantment filled with wildly costumed residents seemingly bored by the atrocity of the annual event. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, American Beauty) is the man in charge of staging and manipulating the event for the highest possible ratings and entertainment value. He carries out his duties while sporting a very unique satanic beard, unlike you have seen before.After prepping, the tributes appear in front of a futuristic Ryan Seacrest played by the flamboyant Stanley Tucci. His Caesar Flickerman is charged with interviewing so as to help the audience make a connection. Lenny Kravitz plays Cinna, a futuristic Tom Ford clone whose duties are to make Katniss and Peeta ""presentable"".It takes a full hour, but the actual Hunger Games finally begins. Quickly the faceless characters disappear and the game of brutality and brains begins. Lawrence is truly a standout here since she has tremendous ability as an actress, and sells her athletic ability quite well. I can't say I was as taken by Mr. Hutcherson, who spends most of the film looking like a wounded puppy.While the PG-13 rating keeps it from becoming a gore fest, I found the action sequences to be quite entertaining. More interesting to me was how the story and characters are posed so that a viewer might interpret meaning in just about any manner one cares to twist. There are political views and human nature traits and commentary on the Reality TV world that are primed for claiming ... regardless of one's opinion. To me, that's a weakness. I would rather the story take a stand and make a statement. But then I remind myself that this is the first in a trilogy of Young Adult stories. It's not designed for deep thought. The movie succeeds in reaching the goal of producing a strong young female character in a world run amok.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The world and the story completely lacks subtlety. The subtext is as obvious as it could possibly be. The production design also totally lacks subtlety, the depiction of future higher class society is obnoxious. The portrayal of the working class is equally stereotypical. The concept that the upper class are evil and the lower class are heroes lacks the intricacies of real life and the moral decisions are less believable because of this. Some of the visual effects are not the best. The night scenes are a bit too dark. The shaky camera is too intense and generally the cinematography is disappointing. I really didn't like the costume and makeup design of the aristocrats. But through these faults there is an engaging and shining beacon in this film. The character writing. The characters are so well drawn and their motivations so believable that you can't help but get drawn into the story. The lead character is especially believable, she is vulnerable, strong and a hero. The sound design is good and I especially liked the composed music. It's not the most original, Battle Royale (2000) is one example of a similar story but the characters and how they are acted make this worthwhile.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The performances are pleasantly orchestrated, an Oscar-nominated Jennifer Lawrence does strike a memorable and convincing embodiment of our heroin, imbues her a role-model paradigm for the young generation around her age, she is invincible in nearly all her scenes, grabbing all the attention and only a polychromatic talk-show host spoofer Stanley Tucci could steal some meager thunder from her. Among others, Josh Hutcherson is controversially add some juice to the flavor, I haven't read the novels, so his character maybe have more space to show off his personal panache in the sequels if he is supposed to be the male leader. The killing is much diluted by the scratchy editing, but the ideal here in the novel and film may ring a bell of the violence-etched backbone of our society, especially for youngsters, the wackily colorful future (for the rich area of course) depicted in the film is too Utopian to be worshiped, and a female-dominated love-triangle has been slickly formed near the very end of the film, a wishful thinking is that the second one will not veneer too lachrymose like a TWILIGHT facsimile, as for the likeness with Japanese BATTLE ROYALE (2000), I haven't obtained any say-so by far without watching the latter. Anyway writer-turned-director Gary Ross (notably for SEABISCUIT 2003) is catching his fire to the next chapter, may it will break the sequel curse and we will be desperate in a hungrier condition after HARRY POTTER, TWILIGHT all come to an end.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was NOT one of those upset people. I really enjoyed the movie. i was actually surprised of how much i enjoyed the movie.If you haven't read the books or don't know what this movie is about, here is a basic summary: In a futuristic society, each district must send one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 17 to compete in annual televised game show, called the hunger games, to compete to death until there is one teenager standing. In my opinion, the movie was everything i expected and more. i read the books two years ago and anxiously waited for the movie to come out and i was not disappointed. The acting was incredible, the story-line was well thought out, the costumes were amazing (and even Oscar-worthy), and the setting was a sight that was breath-taking.And Rue's scene was so powerful. That was the scene i was most looking forward to. The only big criticism i is the camera-work. it was little shaky at times and didn't make the picture clear. Although, i understand it was like that for the purpose of the blood and gore. in order for the PG-13 rating, he had to find some way of making it so there was still a lot of violence and blood but maintained that PG-13 rating. so i could live with that.In conclusion, i will say it was different. Some people are going to really criticize it and others will think it was brilliant. in my case, i thought it was brilliant. I will be seeing it again in theaters, which is something i rarely do, and maybe own it on DVD. When you go see the movie, don't point out every little thing that was different from the book to the movie. they got the key points and thats what matters.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I honestly liked this movie - its the best I've seen so far this year, and better than most of the hogs-wash that came out last year.I did not read the books before seeing this movie, I didn't have the time or the interest. I've decided to give them a shot now. I loved the emotions this flick brought out in me. There were many times that I wanted to turn to my companion (who had read the books) and beg to find out if my favorite character was going to die in front of my eyes, the child/teen actors were that inspiring. But I would like to address two things: If you go into any movie expecting it to be EXACTLY like the books (or how you picture them in your mind), I frankly don't see how you can like any movie adapted from a book. LOTR was the only one to ever pull it (mostly)off and there were still things left out. Learn to see it as a different take on the same thing. With this movie, the screen writer was the author (Did you scroll up to check?) and that is very obvious from how much I've read of the book. Anyway, after fuming over the earlier Harry Potter movies due to book inaccuracies I've learned to see movies as themselves rather than rips off a novel - I've come to like them better. In comparison to HP movies, this movie was very understandable if you pay attention to what is said - I was not left confused at all. I was interested to find out more. The HP ones seemed to leave a lot of lose ends - I went with people who had not read the books and they were confused by things that were detailed in the books.For those comparing it to battle Royale - even if it is like that movie, does that mean it was really so terrible to rate 1 and 3 stars? I saw Battle Royale a year ago and loved it. Frankly after leaving this movie I felt this one to be pretty good for what you could call a spiritual successor to that foreign film. But... most of the people I've tried to describe this movie to compare it to running man. So what if this plot has been used before? If they do it well, who cares? Pot Lids or Bows, I don't care; when the movies are this thought provoking. I rate this nine stars - One star off due to the abundance of shaky cam running and super close ups, though I understand why they was used. Honestly when ever it was extremely close up I feared for what the main characters and I couldn't see. On the plus side, shaky cam during some of the battle seems probably helped to keep the movie PG-13, which was the demographic the book was aimed for. Helpful that.I hope this is the lead in for a year of good movies - if they are this top notch then we are in for a pretty good year! :D","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

HAPPY HUNGER GAMES! The odds are in the favor of this film adaptation of The Hunger Games. Not only is Ross' Games a faithful adaptation, but also an extremely well paced wonder - The Hunger Games ramps up, gets tense and never really lets up until the very end, just like the novel. The book to film adaptation is extremely solid; while much character development is lost (as well as some of the characters themselves) the movie still makes you root for the main characters. The rising action is quite tense because the movie has to move at a brisker pace to cover the major pivotal plot points - this works in favor of the film...mostly. What truly stood out to me as both a fan of the books and of film was the way that the sets and moments of the book were imagined, filmed, and displayed on screen. The stark contrast between the drab District 12 and the Capitol, the humor and personality and lifestyle of the Capitol citizens compared with those being initiated into the Games. But most of all is the Games themselves. Ross, thankfully, did not lighten up on the actual Games segment of the film. The Hunger Games is a dark and very violent novel; the movie follows suit. The scenes, especially the very beginning of the Games, are just as I imagined as I was reading the novel; the scenes themselves are as descriptive as Collins' writing. What The Hunger Games is known for is also the underdog protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. Similar to the novel, Katniss' character is one to root for and to enjoy. The acting across the board is strong; Lawrence is a perfect Katniss, Huthcerson (who I couldn't stand in earlier films such as Journey To the Center of the Earth) plays a surprisingly good Peeta, and Woody Harrelson steals the show as the drunk and lovable Haymitch Abernathy. The other characters (Caeser, Snow, Effie, and Cinna) are great characters in the book are also well acted and well adapted for the screen. (side note: Although Effie's name is never said. That's weird!) From a fan perspective, the scenes that were left out (such as further explaining the dogs, the tracker jacker and mocking jay history, the whole Avox backstory and others) were great source material that I wish would have made the cut. I understand that things had to be cut (especially since the film itself was already 144 minutes), but considering the adaption is pretty strong, I can live with the cuts. There were also some scenes that were altered that I wish had played out like they had in the novel, but what happened in these scenes (in the film ) was still coherent and understandable. There were also scenes added (the District 11 scene in particular) that were well done - artistic leeway payed off. Small side note on sound design: very well done in this department. While the film remains fairly quiet, the few orchestrated tracks that are played are for emphasis - and they create a very tense mood, especially at the start of the Games. The sound design is also fantastic; the forest in the arena is very lively and watching it in the movie theater was a treat. The sounds truly create an enveloping atmosphere. What I can really be proud to say is the adaptation is actually good. It's a very fine film that people who have never read the book will most definitely enjoy. And for those that have read the novel, the payoff is large: to see a very clear and well planned imagining of an extremely good and well imagined universe is rare. And with the film actually being good, well acted, and not cheesy (except for one scene - you know what I'm talking about) it will hopefully encourage a greater following of the series - not that the fan base isn't bursting at the seams or anything! The only negative aspect of this film as a film - not an adaption - is its panicked feel. Not the whole film, but rather the beginning and part of the Games. While it gets the job done, It feels like the film at certain points comes out at breakneck speed and maintains it. Never letting go, never letting up, and never getting the audience a chance to breathe - and stumbling in the process. It had to be extremely difficult to direct The Hunger Games. Even at 144 min. runtime, the film still felt rushed. All in all, The Hunger Games is a phenomenal start to the film adaptations of a very respected series. While much is cut in the transition from movie to book (the book is definitely better folks - but thats always a given), the movie doesn't cut what makes The Hunger Games an extremely interesting and intense piece of fiction - underdog hero, intense relations, and a drive to come out on top and win the Games. ""The Hunger Games"" comes highly recommend - especially because it is a standout adaptation as well as a pretty darn good film in itself.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's exactly what The Hunger Games is about. The Hunger Games is a pg-13 movie with the genres, thriller, Action film, Adventure film, and Dystopian. The Hunger Games is produced by Gary Ross and John Kilik. However, this movie is based on the book version, written by Suzanne Collins. With the majority of people loving the movie (84 rotten tomatoes), there are still some others who hate it ""WORST MOVIE EVER. IT's TOO LONG(Drew McWeeny)"". Here are some reasons why viewers would love The Hunger Games.
In the movie, The Hunger Games, there are a lot of reasons why viewers love this movie. The first reason why viewers would watch this movie is that of the cover. Since most of the heroes in movies are mainly male, people were in love when they saw a woman on the cover. After watching the movie, viewers would love to watch the next film or even the same one because of the amount of detail the movie gave the viewers about each character, and how much the people got to know the characters individually to find out how relatable they are to people today. Another reason why the viewers would watch the second movie is that of how action-packed the film is. At one point of the movie, there are fight scenes, and then the next is a romantic scene. ""This movie is really for everyone. They added a bit of everyone's taste(Katie Lees)"".
Even though The Hunger Games may seem like the best movie ever created, some of the viewers hated it ""I came into the theater thinking it was going to be the best film. However, it was not! (Savannah Macbeth)."" Reasons, why people wouldn't like to watch this movie ever again, is because it is over 2 hours. Since people today are so busy, no one has the time to watch a 2+ hour movie, and if it is above 2 hours, it's normally going to get the audience bored. Another reason why people hate this movie is because ""This movie places us a post-apocalyptic world, though is no sign of how the end came and no trace of toxic aftermath(David Thomas)."" To put that into words, viewers do not like this movie because it makes no sense whatsoever, and the setting is off.
In conclusion, The Hunger Games is a great movie to watch if you love action-packed films and love a movie that will keep you on your feet. However, if you have children under the age of thirteen, watch movies way too seriously, and have no time on your hands, this movie is not for you.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is interesting to see so many supporting characters played by big actors (Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, etc.) while the main characters are played by lesser known actors. I thought all the actors played very well to their characters.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The romance of the two actors is also so cute.The action is very nice because it is a different story and you never see it in normal action movies.The make-up and the animation are also very good it was perfect with this subject.

I rather liked the movie. I'm not going to talk about the actors. No one made glaring mistakes and I haven't read the books, so can't compare. I'm going to discuss the movie style a bit, then the story itself.The handling of the camera and the general cinematography aspect was rather ""fashionable"". The shaking during the action and the lots of close-ups are all the rage nowadays. The shaking was a bit overdone. Especially in the beginning. Luckily a bit later it calmed down, because it sometimes makes me nauseous. The close-ups were good, just the right amount at the right moments. Especially because it wasn't 3D. You can't do so many close-ups in 3D nor shake the camera, because the mind can't keep up.The story was good. I knew to expect a dystopia. As a genre they are usually defined as portraying the worst of all possible worlds. They are also usually critiques of the present society. I could see that very well. I have to constantly change the channel from the various idiotic reality shows that are mostly just porn and a bunch of people pretending so that they can be the most popular. Of course, in The Hunger Games it's their lives at stake. In dystopias, that is usually the case.Katniss is the archetypal protagonist of dystopias. She's the kind of person who is playing along to survive under awful and impossible circumstances. She is generally a good person, someone who doesn't subscribe to the popular culture. However, the fate of these people is to have their lives changed in a way that they can no longer sit idly by and have to go against the establishment. We could already see that towards the end of the movie and I'm assuming in the following two that is going to be the theme. The only thing I'm wondering about is whether the author followed the genre to the end. The sad thing about dystopias is that the protagonist inevitably fails. The odds are just too great against them. I'm curious to see the story to the end.All-in-all, I did enjoy the movie from an intellectual standpoint. I do have to admit that I like dystopias as a whole, so that was my bias.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The first scene grabs your attention: It has a promise of substance and it's not your typically manufactured eye-candy popcorn movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2794871/?ref_=tt_urv","jukangliwayway","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40070691/?ref_=tt_urv","9 May 2013","WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:Story/plot/characters are underdeveloped, but then again so is the book.There are some scenes (like the parade of the tributes) which felt like crappy CGI work. But I decided it's just part of the dystopian look, and i let it go.The relationship of Katniss and Rue is also underdeveloped that it made Katniss' reaction seem unbelievable. That partnership in the book was one of the more important highlights for me, and I didn't see that in the movie. Disappointing.While it's okay for the book to have only mild violence, it's different when it comes to movies especially if you packaged it as an action sci fi movie. Audiences will expect violence, fast-paced action, and a bit more blood and gore. But they're kids so I guess the tone-down is a must. I appreciate that the movie pretty much stayed close to the book, but they could have turn this average novel into something substantial and kick-ass. They didn't. What a shame. What they did is they adapted an average book with a somewhat unique plot into a mildly interesting average movie with a somewhat unique plot.THE VERDICT:The cast and the visuals categorized this movie as a somewhat serious dystopian sci-fi flick, but it retains the Young Adult feel of the story. The plot is not something to boast about and I blame that on the writers (the author and director both wrote the screenplay) for sloppily handling it. 2 hours and 20 minutes is more than enough to infuse some substance and they didn't do much about it. But i did enjoy it, it's fast-paced enough albeit lacking in action, and the cast gave this movie spine. MY RATING: 3/5 - I enjoyed it. Although I'm not sure if the reason why I enjoyed it is because I read the book - seeing the scenes/narratives come to life was part of the entertainment I got.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Katniss Everdeen who goes in for her sister. She and another boy about her age from their hungry poor village in the outbacks of the capitol. The future looks grim and depressing in Catniss's community. Once she is selected, she and the other guy are sent to the Capitol. I have to say that the make up, hair, and costumes are outlandish, strange, and even bizarre. The people in the Capitol seem to relish the hunger games. While the future has the inevitable society catastrophe of wars, drought and famine, the Capitol city seems untouched. What bothers me about this movie is the violence and children caught in this horrific game of survival viewed by the world. I wonder why others didn't volunteer to enter the hunger games instead of children who stood no chance. It's a brutal film. I am becoming a fan of Jennifer Lawrence who does a terrific job here and deserves a second Oscar nomination. She reminded me of her role in ""Winter's Bone.""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is better then twilight but not as good as harry potter. It was not exactly like the books but its hard to make it just like the books. Most people that I am seeing that are writing reviews on this movie have not read the book so they don't understand why so many people love it. They thought the whole movie was weird, like why make kids fight to the death. It's explained so read the book. In this movie things were not right there in black and white some people did not get that as well, you have to think a little bit why things happened they way they did just because its not directly said does not make it bad. The one thing that bothered me was it just did not show how gruesome it really was. The games are bloodthirsty, sick, psychotic. Did not show that as I thought it would. It did not to be rated R but it just needed to show how the kids suffer in the games. A few things were changed that did not bother me minor things. It was not the best it could be but when you read the book you will understand that they can't do everything exactly like the book. Also Gale was not talked about enough. Gayle would always call katniss, katnip. He liked her and you knew it. Gale plays and important part later in the story so why they cut him out, Idk. The movie was boring at the beginning, like the book but it is showing you who katniss is. Before you see the movie read the books otherwise you will not understand the point of the book. You would think the book is okay because of the movie which is wrong. READ THE BOOK THEN SEE THE MOVIE.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was definitely an emotional roller coaster that will be able to touch people of all ages. Not everything was perfect about the film though.

Most of the movie takes place in a forest-like arena where enemies and allies get knocked out one by one in a guerrilla warfare scenario like those classic Scwartzenagger and Stalone Extravaganzas from the 80s. It has a similar vein to the classic movies Predator and Rambo.The story is rather ridiculous and hard to swallow only to be digested with the understanding that this is a total fantasy and despite the characters being humanoid we must understand this to be another world in some way.Its about a futuristic society that pulls children's names out of hats essentially to be sacrificed. One out of 24 is supposed to survive the competition where the combatants fight with each other to the death with primitive weapons. And the oddest thing and purposefully hard to stomach is that that a small 11 year old girl must compete against a strong fully grown 18 year old male. It is a hard to swallow story. The world is so barbaric that our mind had to sense it in the middle earth realm and not this world. It is somewhat interesting to understand the reasoning behind this all powerful insecure government that runs such an event to keep the subjects in subjugation by fear yet teasing them with the smallest iota of hope. The expansive evil society and government will clearly play a larger part in the sequels but the movie wisely focused on the thrilling action packed training, build up to the competition and the game itself. Making a dumb, very entertaining and engaging action movie was beneficial over dwelling on another evil government movie. The charismatic actors gave the movie its edge and appeal.There are some parallels to the world of reality TV. The competitors go on stage and are made up in their best outfits to try to win appeal and gain favor from the audience. The competition is shown to the public on screen. It was very reminiscent and hauntingly satirical of the reality shows in our world.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But instead is an adaptation of a Susanne Collins book of the same name. As for the film, regardless if you have read the book or not, everything is placed in a clear and concise manner that will play to your enjoyment and amusement throughout. Granted, seeing as this is a book adaptation, there has been some artistic leniency in which to cover some material in the book in a different way, but that should only really bother only the most die hard of fans.The only aspect of this film that I feel detrimentally works against it is the cinematography, it is panicked and quick moving between different distances. Artistically, I feel I understand the effect that they were attempting to go for, seeing as this is a post apocalyptic film, they went with an established camera style to help convey this overall theme. (Look at most apocalyptic zombie films and the like, and the camera moves the exact same way.) However, the consistent camera movement has little to contrast with limiting the viewers ability to sit and absorb the scenery. This is what I personally found that this constant movement made some parts of the film visually and mentally exhausting.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

A book can be a basis for a movie, but it is NOT a screenplay and it never will be.It's an interpretation of an artist, and his point of view is subjective and restricted - so is a photograph, that portraits somebody (literally) in a different light and so is a movie. This includes:But about the 'focus': A story that takes days to tell in a book can never be completely 'converted' into a movie, unless it's something as dull and shallow as 'Twilight'.So forget about the book for once and enjoy the impression that Suzanne Collins and Gary Ross are giving us. And yes, she also wrote the screenplay, so blame her for the adaptation :)I haven't read the book and I have a lot of unanswered questions. But that doesn't matter. The movie is just amazing - and the producers' decision to avoid the R-Rating is completely understandable in my opinion, because I see a lot of educational value. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into detail, but it's a movie that portrays a likable hero, which a lot of the movies are lacking nowadays.You find yourself in the protagonists point of view a lot and you really start to root for the good guys. The movies portrayal of entertainment, the power of television and the media over people (and how to take it back) is only a small glimpse of what the book might have to offer.I am definitely going to read the book now, because I want to know the rest of the story.A must-watch on my 2012 list, definitely Top 3. Ignore the bad reviews that refer to the books. People need to get that books are not screenplays - not only for this particular film, but for all the others out there.Enjoy an amazing piece of work.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Although it slows down in spots, but still a good film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It did match the book in the best it could possibly do, that was the best part, there was a couple changes, but understandable why they were changed. The camera work however is another story, it was not very stable at all. Very shaky work, and some of the focusing on closeups were very fast and not very good. But other than that i did enjoy the movie. Another thing is if you are Obsessed with the book, like i mean read it like 5 times and no everything down to the last button, you are not in for a very good trip to the movies. Because you know way to much about the book and are expecting the best of the best, but the movie is NEVER the EXACT same as the book, the little details that they changed are going to make you mad. So you shouldn't of read the book 30 times. I only ready it once and i loved the movie!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

In this film, 1984 meets The Truman Show and explores deeper themes of class inequality, totalitarian government and society's insatiable consumption of reality entertainment.Initially seeming nothing more than a sadistic exploration of human depravity, the film instead resolves into an unpredictable, gripping drama of resilience, sacrifice, loss and the expediency of love.

Unfortunately, it sorta felt like I was wasting my time. The movie seemed like equal parts ""Running Man"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""Battle Royale"", but with all the clever elements from either of those movies removed. I don't get a kick out of gratuitous violence or something, but spending the first hour on build-up that will barely have any effect on the plot is looooooooong. Take for example all the scenes where they have to impress possible sponsors (to provide outside help) with their fighting skill, sponsoring comes into play so rarely later on that all those scenes are completely cuttable. During the actual hunger game/battle royale, you still don't get much of an action or adventure movie. They're after pulling heart strings mostly, including the incredibly stretched-out death scene of a character we literally know NOTHING about (a full action-free hour wasn't enough to establish some traits?). The most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything is. Our main cardboard cutouts (granted, Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the material) are up against highly trained manhunters, heavily bleeding and leaving traces all over the forest. How do they not die on the first day? How does nobody spot them when they stand there crying and screaming in a wide-open space? Some other character lights a small fire and is killed within about three seconds, but I guess you can't act stupid if you're not important to the plot. The main characters don't survive because they're so strong, so creative, so quick or so fearless: they survive because the script says so. Therefor there's barely any tension, you can predict everything beat for beat. Given its massive success this movie's got to have lots of appeal, but it must have missed me by a mile.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

If you're expecting violence from this movie you're not going to be satisfied. While the story was well executed, and the acting was nothing to complain about, the main problem is the the camera work. The camera is extremely shaky in this movie. The reason for this is 3 reasons: one to save money, two to cover up the gore and violence, and three to build up tension. Probably the goriest visual in the movie is a close up of a cut or two. I am only complaining about that because many people that have read the book have told me how violent it was. Because the main audience of The Hunger Games trilogy is young adults they made the horrible mistake of making this movie PG13. The books, so I've heard, should get a solid R. They purposefully toned down the violence making for a relatively boring character story. Don't get me wrong the character development was superb, but due to the lack of scenes with actual visible violence it is hard to see that the characters are in any real danger. Also without the violence there isn't that sense of disgust towards the antagonists. It all seemed like a game show and the acting does not provoke terror into the audience. Because the characters do not look like their terrified. The actors made the horrible decision of not going past their limits. In other words these were actors who didn't take the emotional part of the film and run with it for the fear of looking stupid. Since the actors didn't want to do more than they wanted to, the main way to instill suspense is through gruesome violence. But no you can't have that because the director thought it was suppose to PG-13. By the way what's so horrible that you can't market a movie that's rated R towards young adults? ""I would really want to go see The Hunger Games but it's rate R and my parents would have to come and then I wouldn't look cool."" No! If you are not willing to go see a film with a guardian than you are not mature enough to watch the film. I honestly think they could've made this PG, that's toned down the film was. On the bright side though some of the characters do have humorous lines, and there some very interesting characters. If you like the book rent this movie. My Verdict: 6/10: To rent and watch once.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm an avid book fan, having read everything from Jane Austen to Twilight, and since the Hunger Games series is one of my personal favourites, I was eagerly waiting for this day for three whole years. And it didn't fail me. The acting was brilliant; Katniss was bold and Jennifer Lawrence's acting chops were truly displayed in the more emotional scenes. You could sense her fear and nervousness when she was about to enter the arena, when a character died or in all the big moments of her character. She's the highlight of this film and a delight to watch; such an honest, human performance that surpasses expectations. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was adorable, kind, honest and sweet. He exudes a natural air of confidence, but his character's vulnerability was portrayed perfectly. Willow Shields was lovely as Prim, as was Amandla Stenberg as Rue. Alexander Ludwig, Isabelle Fuhrman, and Leven Rambin were fearsome and brilliant in their roles as Cato, Clove and Glimmer respectively. Moreover, I loved Woody Harrelson as Haymitch from the first moment he spoke. He was funny, and brought a beautiful balance to Elizabeth Banks's Effie. I loved the direction and the special effects. Some scenes, especially the ones involving fire, were impossibly realistic and powerful. I loved every little bit of it.My honest opinion? A perfectly casted film, with a magnificent director and great special effects. I've loved this series for so many years that now, it feels brilliant to finally be able to watch what I've envisioned in my head so many times. I truly wish this would be nominated for an Academy Award; if any film deserves it, it's this one. There's nothing bad about it.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I will say right off the bat, that it does not live up to the hype. The ending noted this, as it was rather anti- climactic. As for the shaky cam and choppy editing, it did get a little annoying at times. Not as annoying as Woody Harrelson's hair of course, but definitely distracting. What I found rather odd is why the people in the Capitol were so privileged. Did they work for the government? I guess you could assume that, but the film doesn't bother to explain much of the back-story to the Hunger Games and the new government order. I will say one thing: the costumes. Since everyone looked like either a Lady Gaga impersonator or a Who, the fact the Americans are so openly against gays and transvestites, there is no way that anyone in the future would dress like that. Plus, the visual effects were a little off. Even the fire looked like an FX effect. Yes, it is, but it should't be so obvious. The ending is rather anti-climactic, and I felt that we didn't get much insight on Katniss (Lawrence), as apparently her ----- died in a mining accident. But this is discovered with shaky cam, choppy editing, and in the middle of a tense situation that is completely irrelevant to the reveal. I felt information was sort of shoved in between the battles. There are a lot of problems with this film, and I definitely don't think it's the next Harry Potter franchise, (in quality terms, anyway) but it does have its pros. Jennifer Lawrence was good, and the film did offer some very high tension scenes. The violence is kept at a minimum, so if you want a death game movie with gore and blood throughout, I suggest the Asian masterpiece, ""Battle Royale."" The only good thing that will come out of this film is a better franchise than the current ""Twilight"" and a high hope that American producers will cancel their remake plans of Battle Royale, as they fear people will express distaste for it since it is so similar to the current Hunger Games franchise. It's like trying to remake ""Paprika"" when ""Inception"" was just made. People won't like it. This movie is worth watching in the theaters, but definitely not something special. Unoriginal concept is already driven by stuff we've seen before and the inevitable romance sub-plot. I do like it's stance on the current day media towards the end, and how they eat up all that crap with celebrity marriages and what not. Although, that's its only true saving grace, as the film came off as pretty average. C+","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

A simple story of a fight to the death between twenty-four kids between the ages of 12 and 18 may seem like a gory blood fest, but the story never glorifies the violence and is more about survival rather than killing. Director Gary Ross keeps the story with heroine Katniss Everdeen through a clever use of close ups and out of focus background, rather than often revealing what is transpiring all around her. This is not an entertainment, and it is not intended as such, but rather as a harrowing journey of wills that ask the audience members to often wonder how would they respond if they were forced to kill to live. Overall, The Hunger Games is a well made sci-fi thriller that features larger than life situations with genuine suspense that does not let up, and really expands and visualizes the world of the novels by Suzanne Collins in a satisfying way that makes The Hunger Games worth watching for the thrills and thought it provokes.I give The Hunger Games a 10 out of 10!","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Now that was like waving a red flag in front of a bull. You've gotta be wrong, it cannot be. PRETTY WOMAN, I wanted to yell out almost instantly, but that one is Richard as well as Julia.But this sports thing is the big moneymaker, the big people's choice is this film with the waver-thin plot? There are so many holes in the plot, you could idly coast a Zeppelin through it. But this is the big name? I kept thinking of BAYWATCH. This might be without the beach, and the bikinis, but it's an activity show, with too little characterization, and a weak storyline that serves as an excuse to get on with what it is all about: mortal combat presented as televised sport. All the time we do not really get into the head of the main character, we mainly see her reacting. The movie is thus far more empty than you lot will ever realize. Everything of it is geared to the sequel, with many plot threads hanging loose, clearly they knew it was going to be hellishly popular, so let us do it this way. But why? Why? It isn't really that good, it's very basic, yeah, that's what I am trying to say. A winner it is not, it lacks a whole lot of finishing touches.I am not just critical. I am not knocking it. I am saying THAT FOR ITS REPUTATION I EXPECTED THERE'D BE MORE THAN THIS.I loved the fire dress, as impossible a notion as it is.Noticed all those close-ups. Movie is filled with close-ups. Jennifer Lawrence is young and can fill the screen with her facial features. By MOCKINGJAY, no longer, I surmise. Only while you are young, my dear.I will be watching CATCHING FIRE pretty soon, I have the 4-in-one boxset, thanks to having won it in a local review competition held by Raru South Africa.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thoroughly enjoyed it!! I must point out that I have not read the books so I can't offer an opinion on whether they were true to the books etc. What I can say is that this movie takes you to a wonderful trip into a new world and that even though the main actors are not well-known, they make you like them... heck, I even shed a tear or two!!I would have liked a little more background in general as I kinda had the feeling the movie went off on the assumption that most viewers would have read the book. And also, the shaky camera was really, really, really annoying and dizzying. Other than that, I loved it. It was fast paced, did not bore you and was to the point. I can't wait for the sequel.. and I will probably go buy the books now.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Probably not the best approach, but no big deal right? Not exactly.I thought the movie was good when I first saw it, not great, but good. After reading the book the movie was diminished a bit but still good. Hunger Games did a fairly good job adhering to the book. There were some changes, but I could see that the majority of the changes had to do with time constraints more than anything else. To stay completely true to the book the movie would have had to be four hours long or so. After reading the book I found myself being overly critical and longing for certain scenes to be more detailed. I was looking to capture the same emotions I had when reading the book.As movies go, this is a nice dystopic film. The tale is not over the top with heroism but rather subtle heroics. The action is moderate and enough to keep the movie lively. Ultimately, your attention is held by your desire for the main character to survive because that's what the Hunger Games are all about.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Plot is very enthralling, there was not a dull minute in the movie. It has elements that will please both the guys and the girls. An excellent movie for a date. The special effects are pleasing. Some of the elements are hard to believe, that is to be expected from this type of movie. Only downside is, once it gets going, it never slows down long enough for a bathroom break. Can't wait for the next two in the series.Overall, I give this movie two thumbs up. It is worth the trip to the theater or at least renting / Netflixing. I would not recommend that you take the little kids to it (below 10 years) due to some graphic scenes and an overall gloomy mood.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It seemed to me that a huge investment was made in the assumption that the audience that would see The Hunger Games movie were familiar with the book series and were knowledgeable fans, and I think that if that were not the case you would not understand some of the images like Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) in the rain and the loaf of bread encounter with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). The film did in fact do a good job of making the whole dynamic of their relationship clear, although it did not make it so clear the nature of Katniss' relationship with Gale (Liam Hemsworth). I was really interested in how the final battle would appear, since much of what was discussed in the story specifically relative to the train, the capital and the final battle would be difficult to showcase without very strong special effects. The special effects in this film were nicely done, but the final battle was not as intense as I had imaged it would be. However a pleasant surprise was witnessing the control room as the games unfolded, which was a nice touch. The costuming of the citizens was useful in making it known that the flavor of the Capital City is eccentricity, which is somewhat made clear from the trailer with the over the top appearance of Effie Trinkit (Elizabeth Banks) and Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci). The film made the presence of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) more accessible so that you get a feel for the type of person that he is, no warm and fuzzy from this character. I liked the film, but more so because of my having read the book, I don't feel as though I would have been as understanding of the running time and the lulls in the action sequences, otherwise. It's not possible to unread a book and have that fresh unbiased perspective but aside from the strong performances of the actors and the special effects I would have found the film to be sluggish and I didn't really get emotionally invested until actually experiencing the Katniss interaction with Rue (Amandla Stenberg). For the most part the film was very true to the book, but if you don't know the book, you will be left out in the cold on this one, I give it an amber light.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

In any fantasy world this just isn't plausible. The film takes ideas from various other films, most notably ""The running man""And the costume design although spectacular reminded me of ""The fifth element"" There seems to be a spate of movies these days that specifically aimed at 12 to 15 year olds ie:""Insurgent"" ""The maze runner"" and The hunger games movies.

While certain scenes were rushed and aspects from the book weren't developed as much as I would have liked, I was still completely captivated and loved the movie. In terms of performances, everyone (and I mean everyone) knocks it out of the park. I will list the main roles, to save us all the reading time: Jennifer Lawrence carries her role as protagonist Katniss with grace, vulnerability, and fire (pun intended); Josh Hutcherson (someone who hadn't even crossed my mind to play Peeta, and, when cast, made me apprehensive) truly did Peeta justice, with spot-on facial expressions and a quiet ferocity; Liam Hemsworth played Gale wonderfully in the small number of scenes he had; Elizabeth Banks made Effie annoyingly likable (you want to hate her, for she is essentially an archetypal Capitol citizen, to say the least), plus everything I'd expected and more; Lenny Kravitz was fantastic as Cinna (the moment before launch into the arena is truly touching); and Donald Sutherland is wicked yet subtle as President Snow. I have to commend Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, too; his performance was honestly exactly how I'd imagined Haymitch, and one of my favorites. As for the direction, I applaud Gary Ross; he truly knew what he was doing. The designs and atmospheres of each scene were impeccable, and further enhanced Collins's world. Granted, the pace felt a tad rushed at times, but it wasn't anything major enough to truly take away from anything. One of my major directorial complaints (though I understand it to an extent), was the camera work, especially near the beginning. It was almost nauseating. I do understand, however, that it was meant to mimic the intimacy between us audience members and Katniss, for the novel was written from her point of view. It does go on to (for the most part) level out, though certain scenes later in the film (during the Games, namely) practically require this sort of shooting style. The violence was one of the major aspects of the book I was wondering how Gary would handle. For the most part, it is implied and shown only in bursts when necessary, though there are still disturbing scenes and moments, some, ironically, including no violence but truly highlighting just how violent this country actually is. Don't get me wrong, though--there is still an abundance of thrills and action. All in all, THE HUNGER GAMES is a solid, thrilling, and dazzling film, one fans of the novel will likely enjoy and a truly telling spectacle concerning how far we're willing to go to be entertained.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games is a nationally televised event that forces twelve districts to choose one boy and one girl to compete and fight to their death for the prize of living in a mansion and getting free food for you and your family for one year. Katniss is one of the tributes. She has to rely on her hunting skills and sharp instincts to survive and choose survival against love.If you love adventure, romance, action, and suspense, The Hunger Games is a movie for you. It is a well thought out unique storyline and keeps you waiting for the next scene. The acting is amazing and very real. They make you feel like you are apart of the movie. The Hunger Games is a movie for any type of audience. Preferably, girls might be more interested in the movie because they can relate to Katniss much more.One of the negative points about The Hunger Games is that it is not an original movie. The Running Man, another popular motion picture starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is the same storyline instead the main character is a male instead of female. If the storyline was more original, the movie would be more likable. Also, the movie is very predictable and you could guess what was going to happen at the end. The rising action is also very weak. The Hunger Games has some weak points and strong points throughout the movie. The movie is very bland and does not seem to stand out from any other movies.Overall, the movie is decent. It has a balance of great points that stand out and also some weak points that need to be changed. There has been a mix of bad and good reviews. Instead of judging the movie from other people's opinions, everyone should watch The Hunger Games and get their own perspective on the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I would first like to say that I believe the plot is very well done in the movie, and some of the greatest parts are actually leading up to the games, and not during the battle itself. That being said the battle scenes, and many other scenes during the battle is excellent and very attention holding. The acting in this movie is also superb lead by Jennifer Lawrence, whom I believe is a very strong up and coming actress, and has been very impressive in not only this, but in x-men first class as well. All the cast though compliment each other extremely well and do a great job keeping the viewers interest and making a good emotional tie. My personal favorite aspect of the movie however though is the soundtrack. The music really stands out in many scenes, and really gives a push in some of the larger scenes. It is probably in the top 5 movie soundtracks I have ever heard. The only problem I have with this movie is the camera angles. Through most of the movie it isn't a problem up until the games start. When that happens they do a lot of fast moving and scrolling that is hard to follow. In some scenes I enjoyed it as a simulation of adrenaline rush or stunning. In some bigger scenes though its hard to follow the action though based on some of the characters looking similar in the fights. Overall though it is a movie I will be seeing again, and cant wait to see how the sequels turn out. So let the games begin and may the odds always be in your favor 9/10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This has exceeded my expectations of how effective and impactful the film is. This film is so engaging, you constantly try and put yourselves in the characters position and try to imagine how they would be feeling and how you would deal with the situation. The pre-game part of the film has a steady pace, nothing riveting but a good enough pace to set up the main characters etc. But as soon as they enter into the arena....It goes up a whole new level. It is so tense, whilst I assume watching it a second time it may not be as tense, you can never stop thinking, ""what would I be like in that situation?"" Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant in this film, I knew that this film would be good because she can act. Josh Hutherson wasn't bad, he fitted well into the film. The camera style was very modern, fast paced and had a lot of quick editing. I can't give too much away but I can say it will keep you at the edge of your seat! The murders were very quick, but still effective. It was quite shocking but yet again, you keep thinking to yourself, ""would I kill people?"" or ""how would I feel knowing I can be killed any minute?"" It is a really engaging film with the right amount of pace and action at the right time. They made it feel real, not manufactured emotions or clichéd moments, but it was very gripping and enjoyable. Don't be sceptical just because of all the hype, it actually has a reason and has the right to receive all the hype: Because it's awesome.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I went to the movie watching the previews excited that the previews created pretty good build up to the real story but sadly for me the whole movie was just the set-up for greater things to come ..which never came. I sat through the whole movie expecting something exciting to start any moment..but that moment never came and i left disappointed in the end. I have never written a review for a movie but this one just stirred me up a little. A movie these days runs on either CGI or an exceptional story or brilliant presentation. I found this one had none...the performances by the actors were not bad..but it was as monotonous as seeing someone running on the treadmill for an hour and a half. The movie promised some stellar action..but it had very run of the mill action sequences. This one reminded me of a movie 'the condemned' probably a little on the similar lines..i didn't like that movie when i saw it a few years ago, but this one makes it look better now...it at least had better action. CGI ..i don;t remember if they had to use any for this movie. Even the fighting was minimal and the action was left to the audience's imagination ( you will find out what i am saying when you watch the movie and IF you watch the movie ) It makes me think how these days we are sold to what we see a hundred times a day and hear a hundred times a day and will find even sh** glamorous if a starlet is using it to brighten up her skin. This movie might not be bad overall , but it betrayed the audience ( at least me ) because it promised me a diamond ring in a shiny package but all i got was a well packaged empty box. And the diamond that i found was probably lying neglected in the dirt in the shape of ""the raid: redemption"".and what money it made ? $ 200,000 ! I am giving it 2 points because i love all the movies and it's more like a ZERO for me.","47 out of 101 found this helpful.

The fact the other side of the audience enjoying the hunger games were in the downside, they could have been given some role, that would have made things more interesting to the viewers.

Thats pretty much impossible cause the film is actually the director s vision of the book and obviously not everyone feels the same things reading a book or watching a movie. Now I have to admit that every bestseller turned to movie is suspicious to me ( we have things like Eragon ( uninteresting) The Golden Compass ( it ends when its starting to get interesting) or Twilight ( unbearable unless you are a hardcore fan) so I was expecting a so so movie with The hunger games. Thats why I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It has an amazing performance from Jennifer Lawrence to start with, the custom design is awesome, the score is excellent and there are some lines in the movie that really caught me. If this was an R rated movie probably it could have been a little better but the final result is an entertaining and well worth movie","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Only criticism is the fact Katniss and Peeta together end up only killing one other member of the games, seems pretty convenient wolves, berries, wasps and other team mates do all the dirty work for them!

""They cut so much out"" words that have become somewhat a tradition in book-movie blockbusters and Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games was unlikely to be an exception to the rule. But rules are made to be broken I hear you say? not it in this case. Unfortunately I am not a die hard Hunger Games series fan and saw the film having not read the book, but after being pleasantly surprised by a somewhat intriguing story line and an (almost) original idea,I found myself delving into the book for a better look at the Hunger Games world. I'm pleased to say the film stayed true to the book with only a few tweaks here and there (minor story altercations, no doubt to make the film a bearable 142 minutes long). As a huge fan of post apocalyptic movies I went into the film with high hopes and came out with them still intact and non-trampled. Apart from a few hand to face cringeful moments the film was a solid 7 out of 10 and is an impressive start to a hopefully impressive trilogy.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are so many similarities (in part) to other films it's hard to know where to start. I guess 'Battle Royalle' is a pretty good start, although I could see influences from; 'The Truman Show', 'Rollerball' (the original one) and 'The Running Man' in there too. I did get the impression that there is a lot more explained in the book than there was time for on the screen because I did feel I had missed out on a few plot points here and there. These particularly surrounded the relationship between Katniss and Peeta; I won't discuss it here as I don't want to go putting down spoilers. Over all though, the 142 minute running time seemed to pass quite quickly (always a good sign) and so I'm happy to deem this one Recommended.My score: 8.2/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 56,220 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 85/100 (based on 239 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 87/100 (based on 84,278 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film is able to capture not only the main story and important details, but the feeling and aesthetics described in the book. The dialogue, characters and scenes feel like a translation into visual media, without any need for re-imagining or reworking. The novel is what captivated audiences and launched the story to its lofty heights, and so an accurate representation was necessary. Unlike many films in the past in which directors can take many liberties with relatively less popular novels, The Hunger games follows on with the trend of young adult literature, think Harry Potter and Twilight, which is so universally well-known that nothing can be changed without provoking the ire of wanting young audiences. In this regard, The Hunger Games has done its job and given the people what they demanded.One interesting, but not entirely novel, problem faced with a film adaptation was the first person narrative in the novel. Katniss is the narrator and main character, and much of the exposition happens in her head. The novel is relatively sparse on dialogue for a large chunk of it, but we have Katniss to help guide us through the various newly introduced details. In the film, however, we don't have her inner monologue. Instead, the film opts to have Caeser Flickerman and his co-host act as elucidators during the Games, and the intermittent flash-backs inform us of the backstory for Katniss and Peeta. The film is not over-the-top with its backstory, giving us only the bare minimum of what we need to fill in the blanks. This is okay, because they know that many of those who come to see the movie have already read the book and know the details. However, any new fan coming into the series starting with the films might have their work cut out for them to understand the finer points.The visual representations are also stunning. On one side we have the districts, garbed in 1940s style clothing as a symbol of living under totalitarianism mimicked from our own often sad world. They are lacking of all luxuries and indulgences. We get a short glimpse of this austere world in Katniss's household and the depressing village she lives in. Then suddenly we are shocked by the image of Effie Trinket, a fluorescent china doll in a gray world. It is like coming out of a dark room and seeing the sun for the first time, it blinds you. The contrast between the people in the Capital and those in the districts could not be any clearer. It is hedonism versus survival. The pastries and parties and petticoats and an insult to the lifetime of struggle faced by the peasantry, and that comes across astutely in the film.Despite the nearly two and a half hour length, the film still feels as though it were somewhat rushed. The important setup is skimmed over in favor of getting to the Games quicker, but still arrives there at the one hour mark. This is sensible from a marketing perspective, you want the action to take up the majority of the film. It is somewhat of an unsolvable problem. The film must necessarily be the entire plot from start to finish and not broken up into two parts (leave that to the final installment after your audience is already emotionally invested). Yet it still needs to summarize a relatively complex plot with an entirely new world in a short amount of time and satisfyingly display all of the important action. There isn't enough time to flesh out certain things, like Katniss's love triangle, or Haymitch's true character, but the film does as best as it can. In this regard, it gets a passing grade.Another limiting factor is the desire to make the film available to all audiences, that is to say, to tone down the violence and allow for a PG rating. This story is another unfortunate casualty of the MPAA and the need for as wide a reach as possible. What is this story about, really? It's about teens tearing each other apart in bloody gladiatorial conquest. It is violence to the umpteenth degree. If ever there was a film that deserves as much blood and gore as possible, this is it. This is not the fault of the filmmakers, they did their due diligence in trying to show as much as possible. This is more of a ""disgruntled critic shaking his fist as the system"" type of situation.The film is not perfect by any stretch, as it comes from a rather imperfect book. The novel did not reach its zenith on the back of Collins' stupendous ability to create lifelike characters. Nor was it on her convincing ability to make a romantic subplot. These faltering details are present in the film too, though somewhat compensated by the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson, among others. The story is amazing because of its premise. It is a collectathon mixed with a battle royale with an intriguing political subplot of fascism and cultural revolution. It feels like something that can inspire us and give us refuge from our own world. Despite its fantastical elements, it feels like something you could place yourself into, and it almost makes you wish you could be there to see if you could survive.Where this film succeeds is in its ability to take an already successful and interesting novel and put it into visual terms that everyone can enjoy. Where it fails is paradoxically in the same way, where it was too true to the book when it could have improved or reinterpreted. Dialogue that works in text doesn't always feel lifelike coming from a real person, nor does an exciting action sequence look as exciting on screen. That being said, The Hunger Games should not be overlooked in the ever-growing genre of teen-fantasy novel adaptations. It is not a masterpiece or a hidden gem, but it is fun and worthwhile. Not everyone can be Peter Jackson and create something as monumental and consistently lauded as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but we can hope not to go too far and become The Hobbit. Settling for a solid middle grounds of Harry Potter is a pretty good place to be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It has issues, though. Without nitpicking at the little things, the biggest short-coming is the lack of character development. It's hard to get emotionally invested in any of them because there's very little effort made (or maybe just very little success) to give the characters any real depth or characteristics that a viewer can really identify with. There are just too many holes in the story.... How the world got where it got and so on... You practically have to have read the books to fill in the holes in the plot.So, in short.... The movie was watchable, but it obviously fell very short of what it could have been. I really feel that they should've gone with better, more extensively detail in their adaptation of the books and taken the R-rating that would obviously have come with it. The teenage drama they tried to make believable just didn't work given the movie's context and the lack of character development.While I can't call this type of movie ""entertainment"" given the context, it does make one think and question the depths of depravity people can fall to....

It's a series that is marketed for the 'young adult' market, and it does have a strong female protagonist and a romantic love-triangle and things like that. But it's far less in the tradition of Twilight - Suzanne Collins can right and craft characters and make a strong, interesting point of view (Katniss narrates all three of the books) - than it does stuff like The Running Man or even The Long Walk (the Bachman books set in dystopia) or of course 1984 and things like that. It's grim, it's desolate, it's pitiless, and the ""Capital"" is a place where people there (under President/Dictator Snow) create a sense of pageantry and pomp and colorful dresses and of course TELEVISION all while the Hunger Games are a series of death matches pitting teenagers against one another from 12 different districts.We know from the moment we see Katniss she'll be fine - this IS more than one book that we know of going into this first film, after all - but what is exciting is seeing how she gets out of the predicaments she gets in, how her hunting background and being a hunter on her own time, and just having a thickened skin from years of oppression and mind-screwery from propaganda, and the ways that people DIE. And sometimes these deaths of people are really miserable and rather wild; the one that stuck with me from both the book and the film involved a particular breed of bees/wasps, and that's all I'll say about that if you haven't seen the film.From the start the real strength in this film is Jennifer Lawrence in the lead of Katniss. She makes the center of the film so strong and captivating - a lot of it is what she holds back, has to internalize, which is always interesting when an actor can do that well - and so around her she gets actors that vary in quality from really tremendous (Sutherland, Banks, even Stanley Tucci in an over the top TV personality performance), and maybe OK ones, adequate ones that can get the movie rolling along (Hutcherson and Hemsworth really). But what is the weakness is that the filmmaking isn't that strong; Gary Ross and his DP Tom Stern and his three editors have taken an R movie, or what should be that due to the quality of the violence (it is vicious, just a step below its Japanese step-cousin Battle Royale), and made it into a PG-13 flick. It's still brutal at times, but it's in such a way that feels cheating and jarring, like Ross watched a bunch of Bourne movies to prep and doesn't really know how to shoot this stuff coherently.In other words, The Hunger Games disappointed me on a technical level, and sort of rushed through a few points that the book made more heartbreaking (a character named Roo gets a moment but not quite enough), and yet the acting saves a lot of the experience and there's a sense of satire that sneaks up on you where you don't necessarily expect it. It at first appears to be a much darker experience than mainstream audiences - I mean the MALL crowd, not just genre fans, this is meant for as many people as possible - but the sense of play with the world, how it doesn't steer away from the reality TV aspect, that it sort of embraces the conventions reality TV creates while skewering them, is creative and cool.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Indeed, more than that, it's gripping and far from stupid, its use of computer graphics unobtrusive (you could have made a version of the story without any, but it still works in its current form), and there's no attempt to over-romanticise the story or laden it down with uneccessary sex. It's Hollywood, of course, so the most beautiful and stylishly dressed people are the heroes (including heroine Jennifer Lawrence, who to her credit is not only lovely but also good in her role); the ridiculous and ugly the bad guys; but this aside, one might even call it a serious movie. The only thing slightly disappointing is the ending, in which the heroes appear to choose individual salvation over raising class consciousness, and the tone of the movie implies that this is actually a good thing. I don't know how the book worked, but there's something slightly limp in such a finale, and disappointing after a generally well-put together film.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Most movies that take time to develop the plot put you to sleep until the action kicks in, this movie was the exception. It did take time to develop the plot, but the entire time it kept you involved, something very lacking in the crap that comes out of Hollywood lately.

The things left out were minor details when it came to the series as a whole, and if those things were added the movie would of not have as good of flow. One of the best things about the movie had to be the cinematography. It was extremely raw and not touched up during certain scenes, while in others it was extremely touched up and all blemishes were removed. This was one of the many ways they were able to show contrast between the settings. The action scenes were very fast paced and at times it was hard to tell what exactly was going on, but this was expected so the movie wouldn't be rated R. The actors did an amazing job at their roles and acted just like their book counterparts. The set and costume design made the movie appear mostly how I imagined it when I read it. I would not recommend taking young children, due to the amount of violence and because they will not understand the deeper meaning of the work.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

They rock. This conecept is so unbelievably good. So much props to suzanne collins for writing this brilliant work of fiction. Great story, really emotionally charged and executed really well in this film. Interestingly i found myself covered in goosiebumps a lot in this film, and even getting choked up at times. Which is interesting indeed considering i rarely get emotional in films. Shows the power of this story!This film has got a great cast. Seriously great. It brought out some real actors and actresses in the spotlight. Without this cast this movie may have fallen apart. And they ought be glad this film cast the spotlight, because they wouldnt have been able to afford them if the world knew how good they were. Yes, this movie seems to have some budget issues. It looks bad. The color grading is bland... just awful really. You can create a dark bland dystopia without making it look like a student film. It is possible. I swear I have made films with better colors then this. Also the way the camera works in this film just feels cheap and lazy. I understand what theyre going for but it simply doesnt work here.Great film, and great start to an awesome series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is a well made movie though. The story is these people are broken up into 1-12 districts (there were 13 but the capitol destroyed it). They did to keep wars and uprising from happening again. In order for this not to happen, 1 person from every district must participate in a a battle to the death called the Hunger Games! We see the district 12 which is where our main characters our from is very dirty and we see the people our hungry. Each district serves its purpose. District 12 is a mining for coal district. The people who make the kids who are 18 and under in the games are very rich and silly looking. They live in riches while people starve. They view the games as entertainment not realizing the damage it is causing. Our main love interest is played by Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and for some reason there is Liam Hemsworth. It a very intense and emotional story and I would not take anyone under like 13 to 15 and the youngest! Even though the story is a disturbing it is very creative and well made! Pros: Creativity, costuming, hair, cast, script, camera geography, storyCons intensity, story, love triangle","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Advertised heavily with similarities towards Battle Royale which never received an American release with the controversy surrounding the subject after the columbine school shootings. This film takes a far more delicate approach to conveying the violence contained in the film making it more appealing for a larger audience.The world that Suzanne Collins created in her novel comes together on film like I imagined,with the exception being the Capitols guards look like the stormtroopers from Spaceballs. After getting past that, the stage is set for why the Hunger Games exist and how it is a form of entertainment for the Capitols citizens, and a cruel reminder for the districts past transgressions.Once the Games begin the film starts to fall apart. Having such little knowledge of tributes killed off early leaves you feeling no emotion. The weapons that are available for the tributes are far too shiny and elegant and lacked the crude nature I had envisioned. An important concept that seemed lost in the film was survival, not just from those who mean you harm, but the environment; Starvation, dehydration and desperation. The psychological aspect of the reality of their situation never really settles upon any tribute. That is where it falls short, and the characters become less believable. Sadly making this film more violent would have created a stronger emotional impact, it lacked pain, both physical and emotional. The games themselves should have made the viewers feel uncomfortable. If the second book is made into a film it will have issues showing why the characters act they way they do in a believable manner.While I liked this film, I still believe the games themselves could have been better portrayed. This is however difficult with a younger audience as its intended viewer.7/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Is it better than the book? No, not really... Is it worthy of the book's legacy? Hell yeah it is!Katniss Everdeen lives together with her mom and sister in District 12, Panem. Each year, the Capitol of Panem holds a famous television show called The Hunger Games, where two tributes from each of the 12 districts must fight to the death in an arena. Unfortunately, Katniss' sister is picked as the first tribute, but Katniss saves her by volunteering. Now Katniss has to do everything she can to survive The Hunger Games.The book is great, and this movie adaptation is also brilliant. It stays true to it's source material and doesn't try to change the original story for the purpose of changing the original story for the purpose of ... you get the idea ... NOTHING!There are some brutally violent moments in this movie, all containing teens, and there is one really sad scene that I won't spoil.I also like that the movie is pretty pure. Most of the movie is CGI-free, so it isn't a CGI overload movie like most other big Hollywood films.Overall, The Hunger Games is a brilliant movie, and it follows the book greatly. Let's just hope that the next movie, Catching Fire, will be good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought this cos such little effort was put into it and the filming was so mundane. I thought OK, they had to rush, but when I found out the budget was $80 million I couldn't believe it.

The worst aspect of the film in my opinion is character development as it is lacking and as you're watching this film or even after you have commenced watching this film, do yourself an ask yourself this, how many characters do/did I care about? For me, it was only Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Peta, played by Josh Hutcherson. In saying that, I didn't mind the likes of Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and surprisingly Lenny Kravitz providing support to the two leads but do I care about them, the supports? Not as much as the leads. although the weakness is that the actors playing the kids from the other districts rarely get speaking lines and don't feel important enough to the story even though technically they should as they are contestants in the Hunger Games, no background into them whatsoever which gives the feeling they're nothing more than automatons and should have been better developed. The shaky cam didn't seem to work as well as you see more of that in low budget movies like Donny Darko and Paranormal Activity, not movies with a $50 million budget like this one. Story seems to suffer a bit as there is not much of a background to it, it's sort of like you're thrust straight into it without an explanation as to why it is what it is and so forth. Positives for the movie are the chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, the setting in a dystopian society and being in front of an audience so to speak a la Truman Show, having a female as a lead action role in a change from the typical male lead action role and great support from the likes of character actors Wes Bentley and Stanley Tucci. Negatives were the shaky cam, lack of character development for the contestant characters as well as Liam Hemsworth which I have already summed up in detail, origins of story could have been further looked into and some quick cut editing in some battle scenes. All up, it's a decent action movie but not a great action movie and I think my headline sums up a bit of my feeling.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

With these words a huge adventure begins for Peeta and Katniss who are the main characters. In Panem the fictional state in which the movie takes place everything changes for Katniss and Peeta as they take part in the Hunger Games, where tragically only one can survive. You never want to leave the cinema, even after 180 length. In this blockbuster, Katniss volunteers as a tribute so that her sister doesn't need to take part in the brutal, inhuman games. She and another tribute from her district try to survive and come back alive which seems impossible. In my opinion this movie definitely deserves 11 of 10 stars ;). As soon as ""The Hunger Games"" film starts, the tension, happiness, sadness, and many more feelings don't stop for one single second. It's the most amazing movie in this decade. And if you have seen other good movies like Avatar, you know that this means a lot. I simply cannot deny that this fantastic dystopian horror thriller is a piece of art. It even has a heartwarming love story in it with one of the greatest actors of our time, Jennifer Lawrence. But I have to warn you that you will lose a lot of money because you are probably going to see the movie at least once a day in the cinema.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film is very faithful to the book (even though it obviously has to cut a few corners in terms of narrative) and this is both to it's credit and to it's detriment. On one hand the book is great and veering away from that would be a mistake...on the other hand if you had read the book then it felt a little bit like a dramatisation of the novel scene-for-scene and as I imagine most of the audience would have already read the book it becomes somewhat predictable. There is also the problem that the romantic stage play that Catniss is part of is very much a battle of conscience for her in the novel but is portrayed as a simple love story in the movie.That being said I liked the way the film was shot and the sombre colour palette used - that was a bit of a surprise. I thought the acting was very good and the realisation of The Capital and the actual arena were skilfully crafted and well thought out - they were almost as I imagined them. It's just that I can recall a few novel adaptations that enhanced their origins; Harry Potter, Misery, Blade Runner, The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest - all were adaptations that resulted in films that were very watchable whether you had read the book or not...because they were great films. I still remember being shocked, surprised and delighted watching these films even though I knew the story. So although this is a very, very good film it is not the best book adaptation I have ever seen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I don't even hate every adaptation (Mainly because I haven't seen them yet or read the books). So my expectations for this movie were... nowhere to be found. This movie is littered with great actors (Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, etc.) who don't get to show their best. I am not saying their performances are bad but they are rather not as good as they could be. This movie also has Lenny Kravitz for whatever reason... that's odd. The camera work (While not the worst I have seen) is not good. I know you studios want more money and therefore want to keep a PG-13 rating... but don't put the shaky-cam in every f***ing scene. It is annoying and not well done. If you wanted it to be good you should have gotten Paul Greengrass who is a master of shaky-cam usage.The music is generic (But good).The story is a blatant rip off of ""Battle Royale"" (Which I for the record haven't seen but I am familiar with the story). The execution isn't that bad but I would rather call it sloppy than masterful. Also, what the hell is up with the movie taking like and hour and a half to get to the games themselves? I know you need build-up but the pacing in this movie is so awkward and inconsistent that it annoys me.And why does every dystopian future thing need crazy hair and clothing... it is getting annoying. And they managed to make Elizabeth Banks unattractive... thanks... ass-hats.Overall the movie isn't very good but it is at least worth a rental.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was expecting another action-centered movie based around a sadistic game show that, for some, reason manages to be highly accepted and liked by the society, without raising the question ""Wait, isn't that wrong""? The film makers, however, took their time to rationalize such behavior and to explain why the game participants actually try to get the audience to like them. The characters are quite believable and some of them have sufficient character development. Still, I think the character of Woody Harrelson is highly underdeveloped and he appeared to be the most interesting and promising one. I really think the director should have put more screen time and emphasis on him.Now for the bad: The initial pace was OK, but the culmination came and ended to quickly. In the end I was like ""Duh, was that it?"". At some point in the movie there was a hint that the plot will continue also outside of the Games (the riot at district 11). This, however, was just a teaser. The action in the whole movie was very limited, but that might be a good thing because the shaky camera made those scenes unbearable to watch.Overall, the Hunger Games had a lot of potential but it was never fully realized.

Now, to start this off, I did not read the books. I will not make any remarks on adaptation.On the whole, I thought this film was generally good. I didn't get the hype, and quite frankly, I was afraid it was going to be another teen hype, with Twilight as its ancestor. However, I saw the trailer, and I heard a variety of comments telling me that it was nothing like a classic teen movie. Voices told me it was suspenseful, it was good, and it was in a way, terrifying.Now I'm not sure about the terrifying part, although I must say, seeing films, reading about historical events and reading experiments, I'm always surprised by the human mind. People would go into all ends to save their own skin. This story portrayed this well, though maybe that's more to thank Suzanne Collins for than the makers of the film.I believed that the story was indeed, suspenseful. It started off, introducing the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and the district. From this, you could conclude that district 12 is poor in comparison to the rest of the world, and you could see that Katniss was a tough, young and adventurous young woman. This didn't last in my eyes. The character development was in some ways not very strong. Katniss went from a strong, independent, young woman to a woman who'd trust too quickly. In the end of the film, I believed her to be weak. Furthermore, you didn't get to know the other characters at all, save from Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Rue (Amandla Stenberg). I didn't care who died and who lived, save from the latter (Rue), who in my eyes, did a wonderful job of portraying a strong girl, brave until the very end.I did get amazed by the reality of it all, considering the story. People going crazy on the outside, publishers doing anything to keep it interesting and tributes who'd do literally anything to save there own skin. I was content to see that this was not merely a love story, and that it actually involved some visible killing (since that was where the hunger games were all about wasn't it? Killing and survival). I also like the cinematography. The camera-work was wonderful, creating that shaking effect whenever something was happening (think running, bombs and killing). However, occasionally, it was too rushed, too shaking. Even though you did get to see the killing, it left loads of it up to your own imagination. Bit pitiful, you didn't get to see what was really going on at that exact moment.But overall, I think this was not a waste of my time. It isn't always the case, but in this film, the suspense weighed more than the faults. - That's why I've given it a royal 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Here, we have a bleak, yet accessible adventure novel that doubles as an intro to social critique, something that can't be said for recent YA efforts where ponderous teen angst masquerades as human drama. Its path to bookstore ubiquity came with many familiar potholes; romantic entanglements and haphazard plotting seem, at this point, par for the course. But along the way, The Hunger Games managed to invest readers in a world with characters and stakes that raise questions reaching far beyond ""which boy do I like?""Of course, using young people killing each other is a pretty blunt, but undeniably effective, way to establish a sense of urgency. Author Suzanne Collins brings to the post-apocalypse a disturbing revision to coming of age rituals; the surviving nation of near-total cataclysm demands 24 young people, ages 12 to 18, fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games. Each of the states' twelve districts offers up one boy and girl to do battle in a vast arena, where the only way out is to be the last ""Tribute"" standing. In district 12, the drawing for the 74th annual games forces 16 year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) to volunteer as Tribute, in place of her sister. It's a pastiche of evocative ideas, a sampler menu of other, undoubtedly, more challenging works. The fingerprints of 'The Lottery', '1984', and even 'Logan's Run', are unmistakable in their influence. Those ""in the know"" have been touting the Japanese thriller 'Battle Royale' as the real source of inspiration (if not outright conceptual theft), but that film's use of blood sport as social metaphor is replaced here with a more deliberate approach. We do, after all, have two more books to set up, so it's not surprising that roughly half the run-time of 'The Hunger Games' is spent establishing the world surrounding them. Even at a lengthy 140 minutes, there's no time for light touches. The gulf between Katniss' Ozark-ian District 12 and the opulent Capitol that hosts the games is presented in broad strokes befitting names that creative. The American Idol-inspired training period for the Tributes offers equal opportunity for easily recognizable satire. A takedown of voyeurism and artifice in reality programming would have had more bite, say, ten years ago, but here it manages to float thanks to a healthy dose of self-awareness.Playing the game outside the game requires cunning and popularity (fittingly, a dystopian future lets the high school experience live on). For once, getting a makeover is a justified plot motivator, as Katniss catching the eyes of influential viewers is all part of the long-term strategy. How the condemned react to the hand they've been dealt is as close to a deft touch as the film manages. Director and co-scripter Gary Ross keeps the gruesome reality of kill-or-be-killed as mostly an undercurrent in the early goings, letting momentum take hold of what could have easily become maudlin.Ross's strength lies in the quiet moments, which benefit from being just that. James Newton Howard keeps his score tactfully reserved in the opening half, letting you soak in the big moments through looks and gestures. Even in blockbuster filmmaking, a buzzing fluorescent bulb will let you know the air has gone out of the room better than any orchestra. The silence that accompanies the start of the games makes for what is perhaps the film's most accomplished moment. From that point on, The Hunger Games kicks into its high gear back-half, one no less prone to bouts of sputtering. The only thing messier than an underage bloodbath is trying to film it within the boundaries of a PG-13 rating. Persistent shaky-cam is a practical solution to keep the nitty- gritty of murder safe(ish) for youngsters, but the sense of discombobulation it can produce is aggravating. It's a good thing Katniss specializes in the bow, because the fracas of close-range combat would have robbed her actions of their necessary impact.It is, after all, Katniss' story from word ""go"", leaving the non-fodder supporting cast as either thinly sketched, or relegated to simple introductions. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth form the base of a requisite but mercifully contained love triangle, with Hutcherson as fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta, getting the lion's share of the pair's screen time. Woody Harrleson gets the most love of the secondary players as a loutish former champion, who's tasked with training Katniss and Peeta. The kinds of sponsors he wants for Katniss, and the ones he could use himself, are quite different. Though well-established as a ""wildness girl"" following her revelatory performance in Winter's Bone, Lawrence proves more than capable at mixing stoic resolve with the emotional heft required in the occasionally forced tender moments. Survival is a pretty utilitarian personal journey, which is somewhat limiting, but Katniss doesn't need a grand arc because she's given credit as a compelling character from the start. The great economy of the film's early scenes can't undercut how effective Collins is at crafting a heroine worth investing in. The 'Hunger Games' has plenty of traits that are easy to nit-pick over; the climax is rushed, and life-saving plot devices abound, but it's tolerable because there's so much appreciable at its core. No, it is'nt high-art, but there's something encouraging, if not downright exciting, about a mature, well-executed piece of popular fiction that plays to the fans while staying inviting to the uninitiated. A week ago, I wouldn't have given 'The Hunger Games' more than a passing thought. Now, I'll include myself in the ranks of those cautiously optimistic for the next serving.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In my opinion this is surprisingly faithful adaptation, which manages to capture the essence of the original story yet still managing to stand on its own. Is it helpful to have read the book before the movie? Yes, as with most adaptations, but the movie does a good job providing us the backstory and exposition. Not perfectly, mind you, but I don't think that many people will be confused by the plot.That being said, the best part of this movie are the actors. It is rather rare to see a movie starring young adult actors, who are as talented as this bunch. Jennifer Lawrence especially shined as the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, managing to portray both her tough, survivalist attitude and her fear for her life. Easily the best performance in the film. Though I have to commend both Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth for their roles as Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne, respectively.The movie isn't without flaws, unfortunately. The biggest problem is the shaky cam that every reviewer is sure to mention. Rationally I can realize that it was used to maintain the rating, but it was still a bit annoying from time to time, though one grew used to it after a while. The other problem that I had with this movie was that while it is a faithful adaptation and a good story in its own right, there was that final spark that was missing. It's a good movie, but not something that I will surely see again in the future.And that's this movie. It's good, but not great. Faithful to the source material and surely enjoyable to pretty much anyone, but not much more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It introduces Panem, a region split into twelve districts who are all ruled by the Capitol. In retaliation for a historic uprising, the Capitol holds an annual Hunger Games in which a boy and girl from each district fight to the death in a custom-built arena. The victor gets glory for their district, and all citizens are expected to remember Capitol's strength and provision.This first movie sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) enter the arena alongside Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) on behalf of District 12. It's very faithful to the book, and fans will approve of the treatment. The only significant change is the expansion of Seneca Crane's (Wes Bentley) role as as Head Gamemaker. In my view, this is a sensible and necessary change, allowing the audience to see the deliberation that Katniss presumes in the book, deftly switching from a first person narrator to an omniscient audience.The movie does well to incorporate the backstory of the Games, and Katniss, with relative smoothness and clarity. It also does extremely well with the setting, with district, arena and Capitol all transposed brilliantly from page to screen.Due to Katniss' standoffish, independent nature, it's difficult for the audience to connect with the lead. This is through no fault of Lawrence's, but is a challenge presented by the character's personality. Where Collins used first person to get us inside Katniss in the book, the movie offers no real way to get closer than arm's length of her, threatening our investment in her future.The characters are very well cast. Not just Katniss, Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth), but other key supporting characters like Cato (Alexander Ludwig), Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and Rue (Amandla Stenberg). In fact, the only surprise was Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who was slightly more dashing and less Father Jack than expected. Having said that, he played the part well.Though the movie covers all of the main plot points, what it's missing is the brutality of the source material. Though the violence was necessarily toned down to comply with age ratings, you can't help feeling this is a sanitised version that lacks the same bite.The ending fails to inspire. It's abrupt but unsatisfying. Either a more rounded climax to close this first chapter, or a cliffhanger to lead into the next movie, would have strengthened it. Instead, it rather suddenly stops.Overall, The Hunger Games is a sound adaptation of the book, with excellent casting and setting, but the change in media erodes the connection to Katniss and the brutality of the Games, which are so very important.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Anybody who has read a book later turned into a film is naturally going to be biased concerning the story. They know how much deeper the material goes, the character back stories, and the scenes which did not make the final cut. They may still critique the filmmaking objectively, but not the story/plot.I read The Hunger Games before seeing the movie. I know that in Panem, an all controlling fascist regime based out of the Capital controls 12 districts in an extremely oppresive manner. In District 12, the proletariat meagerly scrapes by through mining coal and make up for the rest of their harsh existence through scavenging and bartering. To atone for a previous rebellion, every year each District must send one male and female aged 12-18 to the Capital to fight each other to the death. These are the Hunger Games.Katniss Eberwine (Jennifer Lawrence), at 16 years old, is her family's breadwinner. After her father was killed in a mining accident, her mother sunk into a sort of catatonic shock, so Katniss was forced to use her hunting and archery skills to eke out a minimal existence for her mother and her younger sister. It is technically illegal to hunt outside the District's wire perimeter, but Katniss is adept at evading the sensors and also has a partner in crime with her friend Gael (Liam Hemsworth).On Hunger Games selection day, known as the Reaping, Katniss's small 12 year old sister, Primrose, is selected against all odds. In an act of selfless protection, Katniss jumps forward to volunteer in her place. Joining her on the stage as the male representative is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the baker's son and somewhat of an acquaintance of Katniss. Also along for the ride is District 12's Capital representative Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and a drunken former Hunger Games winner, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who will serve as the mentor for Katniss and Peeta in the games.This plot description sounds a bit thin but it is truly intriguing. The idea of 24 teenagers running around the woods spearing each other with swords, arrows, or even their bare hands has a particular voyeuristic element to it. Unfortunately, to make sure they wrenched all of the millions they could out of the audience, the filmmakers kept this at the PG-13 level. The violence and ensuing deaths just look silly at this sanitized level. Unlike the book, the dread is absent. Furthermore, the characters are stock and one-dimensional; yes, as opposed to the book.In the novel, Peeta's motivations and back story concerning Katniss are finely woven into the story and given a lot of weight. However, in the film, you cannot guess if he is sincere or just trying to play the game. In the book, little Rue (Amandla Stenberg) is a very young and tiny waif from the agricultural district whose impact is deeply felt by the reader. In the movie, Rue fills her requisite squares, but fails to make anywhere near the same impact. I am not sure quite where to put my finger on it, but there is something really missing from this movie.No character gets their due. What I mean is, the plot is faithfully followed, but there is no oomph, no driving force. Katniss comes the closest, but that is just because she is in almost every scene. Jennifer Lawrence has done a very good job here bringing Katniss to life and making her appear scared for her life, which she truly is. Just before her platform rises to begin the Hunger Games, she visibly shakes with fear. Lawrence was even better in Winter's Bone where she really turned in a mesmerizing performance. The biggest disappointments are Panem's dictator and Peeta. These two characters could have added so much depth to what is actually a very light and breezy Hunger Games. If you are familiar with this story, light and breezy should be the last two adjectives which come to mind.A film should be judged on its own irrespective of whether or not you have read its original material. In that respect, The Hunger Games is a very creative story which is underserved by its meek script and borderline boring filmmaking. Material of this caliber (and budget) deserves so much more.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

I'm not going to go into the mechanics of the film, only the thoughts and ideas which I had from reading reviews and of course the film itself.What you get a sense of immediately is post apocalyptic authoritarian future and divided societies, the oppressed and the blood hungry rich, which hold no real new significance. However it serves to remind us that disconnected societies can turn into hateful enemies. Our sense of right and wrong can be shrouded in anger and (possible) vengeful atrocities only send society back into the social dark ages. AhhemcoughsplutterAMERICA!What comes to mind and many reviews have said is that the contestants would just not fight. That might be the case in some societies but an undeveloped society which is about survival would contain people of this nature and this is the way that the districts are depicted. Of course they have to come across as lovely people and that it's not there fault in anyway so you cheer for them. Thats the boundary at which Hollywood, a politically controlled puppet, will never go beyond and where this movie and so many others lose gravitas. I find it astonishing that everyone argues about realism when talking about movies but never this point.This takes me into my final intrigue. Some people have mentioned a relevance to Lord of the flies when the games begin and in a small way it does. The loss of innocence and the violent primal nature of selfish individuals against the rational best for all ideal. In turn what I find ironic is the large amount of people complaining about the hand-held camera work so they can't see the violence and killing. The people who have watched this film, gone to the trouble of writing a review about it and have no recognition of their behaviour gives this film even more weight which I find bitterly amusing.I just flicked this film on when I was bored and I enjoyed it. Of course it's a film for teenagers but a good one. I just find it hilarious that the hormonal viewers thirst for violence only fuels the irony of it's ideology. A bunch of violence hungry people watching a bunch of violence hungry people watching young people fight to the death. It couldn't be more poetic.Enjoy!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had a very similar reaction to this movie, an indication of the faithfulness of the book-to-film transfer.For a basic plot summary, ""The Hunger Games"" sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) & Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) thrown into a battle-to-the death with 23 other young people as a result of a ""1984""-like dystopian society bent on total population control. Living in a society completely controlled by ""The Capitol"", Katniss & Peeta struggle to survive in the deathly competition while at the same time sending a message of hope to the thirteen districts watching the Hunger Games event.In terms of being faithful to the book, this movie succeeds tremendously. Director Gary Ross takes a great written story and adeptly adapts it to the big screen. All the major events happen as written by Suzanne Collins, while even the minutiae is, for the most part, accurate. There's really nothing to get upset over in the translation, besides (of course) the usual pairing down of some background dialogue to keep the film from going even longer than its 2 hours, 22 minute runtime.The casting/acting is also quite well-done. About the only cast member that didn't potentially live up to the billing was Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Other than that, I really enjoyed the two leads as well as the auxiliaries such as Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, & Elizabeth Banks, to name a few.Basically, ""The Hunger Games"" movie succeeds because of the strength of the original story and the faithful adaptation of that story. Because this is (at heart) a young-adult story, a lack of deeper character development & plots prevents me from giving it a full five stars (fair or not). Other than that, though, there is nothing else negative I can say about the experience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film is no different. It is competently directed and acted, though it has some very cheesy scenes.Some parts of the film have so much cheese that they manage to make me feel nauseous. However, even though it is a deeply flawed film, it still managed to entertain me.One interesting thing about the film is the fact that it is very violent, though it doesn't show much blood and guts, but it still is remarkably violent considering it appears to be a film made for 13 year old girls! These days the increasing degree of violence in films has affected even these girly films. Compare this film with Kiki's Delivery Service, a Japanese film targeted at 13 year old girls made in 1989, there nobody gets seriously hurt in any scene!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can't count how many pointless scenes with shaky-cam this movie was stuffed with. It's extremely overused and ruins a lot of the scenes with it's sad attempt at being ""realistic"", maybe it is when your having a seizure. Also the CGI looks cheap in a few scenes. Now to address the acting. When she isn't sad or worried, Jennifer Lawrence delivers boring lines devoid of any color. The supporting characters aren't that likable and don't have much of a purpose. When in the book you get to know them and how they think and act. Overall the acting is pretty bleak for the most part, you'll see a few good characters, but thats about it. Another problem is that the film gives you too many unanswered questions that most likely will never be answered in the next few films. The action in this movie is OK, music is fine. Overall, the film is disappointing and pretty dry, its sad to know the author of the book helped with this film. I hope the next movie is better.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

First of all they should have never have made it PG-13, the gory scenes would have made the film much better and not trying to make this a Disney movie. The Hunger Games film was so shallow, especially when it came to the characters. You didn't really get the story since there was no motivation for the characters, you didn't get there personalities well and there backgrounds.They only character that I related with was Cato from district 2. He told us of how he lived in district 2 just when he was about to die.

Yes I have read all the books and they were pretty darn tooting close. The acting was superb, all the young actors did an amazing job, and all the adults were spot on. I wish there was more screen time with Lenny Kravitz, but perhaps that's because Cinna from the book was my favorite character. Stanley (Cesear flickerman) was great!The cinematography was wonderful, shot in fast sequences and gritty. A few slow-mo shots, a few which could have been dropped but was amazing.Yes there was a little violence, but it was not gratuitous. And most of the sound for the battle scenes were muted. Interesting take on it.My husband came with me, having not read the books and could follow along, and really liked the movie, even though going in, he didn't want to see it. This movie is definitely not filmed for teens, and isn't even filmed like the generic block buster (which it is).

Until they fight each other to death, the rule is kill or be killed.The story of the film is really well thought out.

I stumbled into the theater as a result of schedule change with the movie I wanted to see having being shifted. The hype though still succeeded in affecting my curiosity so I went to see this.I haven't read the books no. Though I have taken a word or two from past reviews knowing its a first person narrative organized in a post-Apocalyptic future, written by movie writer and Author Suzanne Collins.Though set in a post-Apocalyptic world, its not your regular post-Apocalyptic movie. You'd have had residual damaged cities, sparse population and..... maybe flesh eating zombies as they usually do. The beginning of the movie was promising I must say.There have been mention of poor characterization of the tributes with the exception of Woody Harrelson's and Elizabeth Banks' characters respectively. Then there's that of physical portrayal; Katniss and the tributes from the other districts do not seem to be going hungry- and then the exploitation of the districts, haven been a major plot point in the books is barely seen in this motion picture.In my opinion Effie Trinket was captivating. Elizabeth Banks really does justice to her. Woody Harrelson was especially brushed up as Haymitch. His lines kept me laughing at times but it was Jennifer Lawrence who stole the show even though its said she is not starved enough. The fears, inner strength and purposefulness she shows all seem very moving and quite carries the movie on its own but Josh Hutcherson's Peeta was quite flat. Though I haven't read the book, it seemed unconvincing and lacked emotional depth affecting the dynamic between him and Katniss. If he had been lost in the games, I doubt anyone would really miss him save for the fourteen year old girls with the buzz of ""guy loves girl loves guy"" triangles in the air from the twilight sagas. Even Katniss' chemistry with Liam Hemsworth's character, though not in romantic terms seemed to carry a lot more weight.There may be a lot more to the entire story than shown in this movie and its a pretty average made huge budget blockbuster compared to the hype all over it. Apart from the opening scenes that portray a hungry society that seems to have lost hope, the rest of the story lacked depth. The arena battle lacked any tension. It was like watching chronicles of Narnia without the magic.I don't want to start on the stereotypical tributes of the other districts even though there was a fine attempt to minimize the on-screen violence for the sake of the much younger viewer understandably to attract a wider Audience. They seemed like they were all having fun in the jungle.For Katniss and Amandla Sternberg's character as Rue, I give this movie a 7 and I'd recommend a few bucks for it. Don't expect much. Maybe the sequel does better. Enjoy","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this book translated to the big screen. Although many of the finer points and nuances in the book had to be skimmed over or removed, I didn't think that detracted from the bold ideas of the story or the detailed nature of the characters.The casting was spot-on, in my opinion. Although Wood Harrelson is not usually one of my favorite actors, I think he did an excellent job in the role of Haymitch. The rest of the cast was perfect, with the standout, of course, being Jennifer Lawrence. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket was genius casting. Banks took a character that begins a bit two-dimensionally in the novel and transformed her into something effervescent yet heartbreaking that burst from the screen. She became my personal favorite through the film (and the films that followed).There are sweeping statements that could be made about this movie's critique of society and commentary of the state of human nature, the nature of politics, and life in general. Those are very obvious from even the dust jacket of the book, and even the first few minutes of the film. I won't attempt to expound upon that here. Take the movie as an action-filled fun-fest or as an in-depth treatise on the decline of American society. It's equally enjoyable as both. Also, I found it best to watch the movie after reading the book first. I'm always hesitant to recommend that as it usually leads to disappointment knowing what could have been. In this case, it adds enjoyment being able to fill in some blanks and mentally add back in some omitted details and subplots.This movie and it's sequels are some of the best I've seen in the genre. Highly recommended.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The kind of book you just can't put down. I am also the kind of person who doesn't compare books with its movie adaptation. Changes makes it unpredictable and offers new possibilities from the books I read already. However in the Hunger Game, I was utterly disappointed of the lack of emotions the characters in the movie are as compared to the books. Specially the part where Rue was killed by another tribute. The was a sad epic scene in the book. Its one of the scene where I truly felt heartbroken. But in the movie, it was truly lacking, not enough emotion from the main character, Katniss. And the lack of emotions goes on in the other parts of the movie. The movie doesn't have the atmosphere where the viewers would truly believe that they are being a part of a world where the rights of humanity is being oppressed.

"7","/10","The Ultimate Reality Television Show","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9510062/?ref_=tt_urv","JamesHitchcock","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2955724/?ref_=tt_urv","22 December 2023","At the centre of ""The Hunger Games"" is an idea also found in other movies such as ""Rollerball"" and ""The Running Man"", namely that of an authoritarian government using violent entertainment as a means of distracting the attention of the populace away from its misdeeds. It is an idea that probably derives from memories of classics lessons at school and that quip from Juvenal's satires about Roman emperors providing their subjects with ""panem et circenses"" (bread and circuses), although it is not one that has been generally borne out by modern totalitarian states.The film is set at some time in the distant future in the Republic of Panem, a state situated somewhere in what is today the USA. (The name of the country is an obvious reference to Juvenal's quip quoted above). The Hunger Games of the title is an annual event which commemorates an unsuccessful rebellion 74 years earlier against the country's central government. Each of the twelve districts which participated in the revolt is compelled to send two teenagers, one male and one female, to the nation's capital. These young people, known as ""tributes"", are forced to fight to the death in an arena. The event, televised for the entertainment of the people of Panem, and is hugely popular; those who regard the idea as unutterably cruel are afraid to voice their opposition publicly as the despotic government does not take kindly to any criticism.The main character is Katniss Everdeen, a working-class girl living in the impoverished District 12, an area of small farmers and coal miners. (Despite modern concerns about fossil fuels and global warming, it would seem that coal mining is still a major industry in Panem). When Katniss's younger sister Primrose is selected as one of District 12's tributes, Katniss selflessly volunteers to take her place. The film then follows what happens to Katniss when she travels to the capital, and the complications which arise when she falls in love with Peeta Mellark, the male tribute from her district. (That's how the name is spelt in the cast list, although when watching the film I assumed he was called ""Peter"").Both the original ""Rollerball"" from 1975 and ""The Running Man"" from 1987 were made before the current vogue for ""reality"" television. (I put that word in inverted commas because ""reality"" shows are one of the most phoney and unreal things on the box. Much more unreal than good honest fiction). They can, however, be seen as prescient in the way they seemed to predict it, especially ""The Running Man"". ""The Hunger Games"" was made after the ""reality"" revolution, and the satire against this genre is quite obvious. ""Reality"" shows might not involve ritualised killing, and for the most part they do not involve physical violence, but they often involve verbal violence and public humiliation, and pander to milder versions of the sadism and voyeurism which motivate the spectators seen in the film.In my view ""The Hunger Games"" is better than either the original ""Rollerball"" or ""The Running Man"", and far better than the dismal ""Rollerball"" remake from 2002. (About which the less said the better). ""Rollerball"" is OK as an action movie about a violent sport, but works less well as a political satire, which was its main raison d'etre. ""The Running Man"" falls into the trap of becoming the thing it is satirising; the film is supposed to be a satire on violent and exploitative entertainment, but ends up becoming violent and exploitative entertainment itself. The main characters of both films, Jonathan E in ""Rollerball"" and Ben Richards in ""The Running Man"", are little more than ciphers who exist because the film needs a hero in order to make its point.""The Hunger Games"", by contrast, gives us two well-rounded characters in Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, characters who are more than just ciphers and with whom we can sympathise and identify. There is also a good performance from Donald Sutherland as Coriolanus Snow, the cynical and autocratic President of Panem. (To stress the link with the Roman Empire, most of Panem's social elite have Roman-derived forenames; we also meet a character called Seneca Crane). Unlike ""The Running Man"" the film does not idealise or romanticise violence; the organisers of the Games might talk about the ""courage"" and ""sacrifice"" of the tributes, but the film shows the Games for what they are, the savage and completely unnecessary slaughter of frightened young people. I am not normally a big fan of ongoing film franchises, but having seen ""The Hunger Games"" I might give the later episodes a chance. 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Why Wait?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2726597/?ref_=tt_urv","piratecannon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4155019/?ref_=tt_urv","27 December 2012","When a friend mentioned to me a trilogy of novels that she'd recently gotten into—yes, Brittany, I'm talking about you!—I didn't know what to think. These books (the first of which is titled The Hunger Games) were an odd mixture of teen romance, brutal gladiator-style death match, and satire of the widening gap that separates those of us who are wringing as much out of every paycheck as we can with those who own toilets made out of solid gold. Okay, so that's an exaggeration, but I quickly discovered something about these novels that seemed to appear out of nowhere and take popular culture by storm: they're great.I mean that. Even though I might have a quibble with a plot point here and some piece of character development there, The Hunger Games series as an intelligent—and often stark—exploration of the reality TV culture that defines our society.Fast forward two (or so) years. It was inevitable that the books would be turned into movies, and the world held its breath as news of controversial casting choices and what appeared to be questionable alterations to the fabric of the source material surfaced. And here we are: the movie has been released, the dust has settled, and we've been given the opportunity to lay our eyes upon the finished product. And guess what. It's great.For director Gary Ross and everyone else involved, they were working with a story so crisp—so inherently engaging—that the whole thing seemed to be a paint-by-numbers affair. If they could stick to the narrative and add in a little directorial flair when the occasion called for it, everything would be just hunky dory.For better or worse, that's exactly what they've done. Some people might complain about the implementation of the ""shaky cam"" technique employed for the full duration of the two and half hour film, but I found that it to add to the sense of dread that's expertly built from the very first scene. When we're introduced to the twisted world inhabited by the evil Capitol and the corresponding Districts (who exist only to provide said Capitol with resources to keep it going), it's clear that The Hunger Games is a good old-fashioned David-versus-Goliath death match with clear lines drawn between the good guys and the bad.And the conflict proceeds just as it should. It's a fast-paced, gladiator style bloodbath that keeps its audience coiled in their seats. Even if you've read the novels you're still waiting for some of the marquis moments from the story to unfold just as you'd imagine them (and, familiarity or not, most of them turn out to be just as shocking as the first time you re-read the same paragraph over and over to try and process what you've just seen was actually taking place).Success though it is, The Hunger Games isn't flawless. For my taste, Haymitch isn't portrayed as the binge drinker that I'd envisioned (he's an alcoholic, sure, but he seems a little too I don't know ""with it""), and a few scenes seem to have scaled back for the sake of keep the runtime reasonable. Of particular note is Katniss' introduction in the Capitol; the grandiose spectacle described in the book turns out to be little more than a fleeting ""hurrah."" The final moments in the arena also feel somewhat rushed.Still, there's emotional gravity to spare, and even the stoniest heart will find him/herself practicing the three-finger salute on the way home from the theater.The future of the franchise seems to be in good hands, and I'm primed and ready for Catching Fire to be developed. If The Hunger Games is any indication, it'll be one of the great sci-fi/action sequels to come along in the last few years.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However in this case I have to admit that ""The Hunger Games"" manage to take a scenario that seemed outlandish, tacky and lacked context in the original film (""Battle Royal"") and provided it not only with a plausible background story, but with real depth. What appeared as cheap and almost pornographic in the Japanese adaption is turned into what amounts to valid social commentary on how authoritarian societies manipulate the masses by instilling just enough hope to foster initiative yet enough fear to keep them in their proper place, promoting simplistic mantras as eternal truths and endorsing all sorts of escapism and infighting to keep people from questioning assumed authority.

I was very disappointed with this movie. I will keep this short, but here are my reasons.The film feels like a synopsis of the book. So much of the story was cut out, the film is maybe 1/2 the content of the book. It was rushed so much so that the characters were not believable at all. The acting was good yes, but the characters were very poorly adapted to the screen. I felt no connection with the characters whatsoever.The books are violent and bloody. The movie, not at all. The most violent death is near the end though nothing is shown. The most gory thing is a cut on one of the character's faces. It's just a line of syrup to give the impression of a cut.The film felt low budget. It was shot guerrilla style. The camera was very shaky in some parts and the special effects were very poor. I feel like the film makers were simply trying to make a quick buck on a successful book.Overall the movie was awful. The acting was great, don't get me wrong. But the telling of this amazing story was terrible. It was not believable in the slightest. The special effects were awkward and the characters were flat (at no fault of the actors). Don't waste your money. Go see something else.","53 out of 119 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games has taken world by storm ever since its sort out to the Next Twilight Franchise. I've read the first chapter of the novel and I must say it's indeed one of the best foam of literature I've ever read. Now back to the movie, The Hunger Games starts really fast and within minutes it establishes the New World for us & the reason behind conducting the Hunger Games every year. Once Katniss Everdeen volunteer herself as a tribute to save her sister the movie gets little slow as we expect the hunger game to start sooner but in that time director took time to establish the new world and people of the Capitol. Who have become heartless & cari-creature of the nature, they enjoy in suffering of the young adults. The movie really picks up once the Hunger Game starts and from there till the end there is not a single dull moment. I also think that by not showing a single scene from the Game sequences in the promotional campaign has helped the movie a lot. As we don't have a single clue what will happened in the movie once they enter the arena. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is a perfect choice, she is innocent, naive yet strong hearted. There are moments in the movie when you see how incredible artist she is ... whether at the Reaping, when she volunteer herself or when she remembers how Peeta had thrown burnt bread at her in the rain when she was starving or when she attacks Peeta after he says he had crush on her or when she climbs the tree to save her life from other tributes or when a young tribute dies in her arms. There are many moments like these which showcase her enormous talent. Now let's talk about Josh Hutcherson Aka. Peeta, I think Josh is a one note actor who always played lonesome/misfit whether it's Bridge to Terabithia, The Kids are Alright or now The Hunger Games. I wanted Peeta to be someone who can stand next to Katniss at least in physicality... at times he looks really shorter & immature in front of her. Though he played his part well so I won't say he was bad but a perfect casting for Peeta would have taken that actor to stardom like R-Pattz. Liam Hemsworth had rarely any screen time but he was very calm & settled. Alexander Ludwig, Leven Rambin & Isabella Fuhrman as villainous tributes were great. Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz & Wes Bentley were great. Overall, the Hunger Games is a good movie which stands strongly upon Jennifer Lawrence's shoulders. It's not a typical formula love story and the ending doesn't leave a single clue for the sequels so it would be really interesting to see how story progresses with these characters for those who haven't read the books yet.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have this thing where I sometimes resist a largely popular project simply because it's buzzing so much hype. There's a word for that that I resist even more, which starts with H, but good luck getting me to admit to that. Anywho, I did watch it one day on netflix, loved the hell out of it, and have seen every subsequent entry, up til last year's final one. It's damn great storytelling that soars on a brilliant extended performance by Jennifer Lawrence, who is the actress of her generation and a genius of the craft no matter what anyone says. People called this a slick version of Battle Royale, and while that may be true, it's certainly not a bad thing, and not the sole extent of what the franchise achieves. There's stinging social commentary which both condemns and makes satirical light of modern North American culture. It examines the power of propaganda for both good and bad ends. It looks at the abuse of power, and the potent rise of fascism and fear tactics, and how quickly they can become commonplace. And this is all in a young adult orientated film that stars a strong, unhindered female protagonist. Gives you hope for the world. Lawrence is powerful as Katniss Everdeen, a young woman chosen from her district to compete in the much celebrated and very violent Hunger Games, a death tournament which serves as a purge and reminder to the citizens what it cost them to rebel against their oppressors years before. This is all at the behest of mega villain President Snow (Donald Sutherland oozes quiet malice with every articulate and icy syllable), who lives in the wealthy and decadent capitol city of Panem, a dystopian version of North America. Along with Katniss there's also Peeta (but no hummus) a local baker's boy played by Josh Hutcherson, who really struggles to match the skill level of almost everyone around him, especially Lawrence. They are thrust into the posh and stylized razzle dazzle of Capitol life as they train for the ruthless games, watched over by previous Victor and proud alcoholic Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), as well as preening diva Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks channelling Marie Antoinette crossed with a poodle). The film takes some time to ramp up to the games, but as soon as it does the events unfold in breathless fashion set against a lush wilderness background, each and every member fighting tooth and nail to stay alive against both each other and the obstacles which games masters have placed in their way. Anyone with an intense fear of wasps will want to be warned. A clever riff on the talk shows of our climate is shown, as the competitors are quizzed by Ceasar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) a manically hopped up pop personality with a hairstyle that would make a samurai jealous and teeth so white they get accused of stealing Oscar nominations. Tucci is truly a well of energy and the proceedings go electric whenever he's around. Watch for Paula Malcolmson, Liam Hemsworth, Wes Bentley, Toby Jones and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, a kindly fashion guru who takes a shine to Katniss and designs her a dress to end all dresses. Lawrence carries the entire thing on her mockingjay wings, making Katniss a spirit of unrest, a true symbol of hope and above all, a scared girl tossed into events she can't possibly imagine navigating. Her performance is most of what makes these films so solid, and they couldn't have made a better casting choice. Be sure to stay for the credits to hear 'Abraham's Daughter', a fittingly grandiose original song by Arcade Fire.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games is a unscrupulous photocopy of the masterpiece BATTLE ROYALE, and should be avoided, if not boycotted.Some will claim that The Hunger Games is a 'tribute' or a 'remake' of the BATTLE ROYALE. To them I ask one question: ""What kind of filmmakers make remakes of a movie when the original came out two years ago and has been selling DVDs very well internationally?"" It seems that this particular brand of Indian cinema has decided that it is quite content making money off of other people idea for free. And though it is impossible for the original filmmakers to sue the filmmakers of The Hunger Games (on the account that US copyright laws does not allow for such suit), The Hunger Games should be remembered as a true stain on the development of American Cinema.Because it has photocopied a great movie, The Hunger Games avoids being an absolute terror of a movie. However, this does not excuse Gary Ross and the section of 'Bollywood' that has involved itself in The Hunger Games's production. Because of the blatant plagiarism, and the The Hunger Games's makers absolutely refusing to apologize and reimburse the original filmmakers, I must say The Hunger Games deserves 1 star, if not 0.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is just soo overrated and not even exciting at all"". That was exactly what my friend said when we watched The Hunger Games"" in class. Well, opinions might differ in this point but there is no doubt about how successful the movie was. More than 600 million dollars were gained by people watching the movie in the cinema and Katniss Everdeen, who is the female main character, is said to be one of the most successful heroines in American cinema history. The Hunger Games"" is a dystopia playing in the future. The world is divided into 12 districts (that used to be 13) and the Capitol, that can be seen as something like a capital. While the people living in the Capitol and the first districts live an easy life having everything they want, the people from other districts live in extreme poverty. In Panem (this is how the districts and the capitol are called) a TV show called The Hunger Games"" takes place annually. For this show two teenagers from each district are chosen by chance to fight against each other in an arena in order to survive- only one can win and receive fame and honor. When 16-year old Katniss' sister Primrose is selected, she decides to volunteer to prevent her from having to take part. Personally I have to say the film surprised me in a positive way. I have never really been a big fan of fantasy movies, but this one really fascinated me. Besides, the blockbuster does also also have aspects of typical romantic movies or dramas. Even though it has a lenght of round about 140 minutes it does not get boring at all. For some people the movie might be too brutal and some scenes might even be inappropriate for younger people watching it, what I can totally retrace. I would have recommended to make an R-rated version and a normal one so it is your decision whether you want to see those scenes (like where people are killed and you see lots of blood) or not. Furthermore, the actors are well chosen and able to play their roles convincingly. Even though The Hunger Games"" is a dystopia, I could really put myself into the actors' position because of the realistic portrayal.To summarize, the film really convinced me and I would definitely recommend you to watch it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Just about everyone cast was wrong for the part--with the exceptions of Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Donald Suthlerland as President Snow, and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark was all wrong. In the novel, Peeta was handsome, very blonde and blue-eyed. I am sure he was taller than Katniss, too. He was also brave, considerate, strong in deeds as well as heart. Hutcherson plays Peeta as a whiny little (and I mean ""little"") troll. Jennifer Lawrence was equally offensive as Katniss. Again, all wrong! Katniss was dark, mysterious, attractive, but hollowed from hunger. In fact, hunger seems to be present only in the title here, not in the story line. Why not just call it ""The Hollywood Games""?Well, I thought that I could overlook the casting gaffes, and just watch the movie. ""Perhaps it will work anyway,"" I thought to myself. In this, I was the one who was all wrong. The movie missed all of the important aspects of the book, and dumbed it down drastically to reel in more moviegoers by giving it a PG-13 rating. The book was most definitely not for kids. What a terrible disappointment this movie was.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The writers have devoted half of the running time to exploring, albeit only skimming the surface, the social and cultural ramifications of a nation hosting an annual televised bloodbath as punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol. The result is a surprisingly deep action drama that does so much more than offer predictable fan service.With such provocative subject matter and an engaging script, director Gary Ross could have quite easily been complacent in his approach, but he instead raises the games with two contrasting shooting styles; one a blend of extreme close ups and long shots that give the first act the edge of a documentary, the second an aggressive 'shaky cam' that that is wholly appropriate to the action that takes place when the eponymous games finally begin. If the inevitable sequel is shot in an equally suitable manner, we can anticipate curiously what tone might be captured in 'Catching Fire'; until then 'The Hunger Games' succeeds in delivering action for the PG-13 crowd while its unnerving subtext plays to viewers of more refined tastes.Stars Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, playing Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Malark respectively as the 'tributes' chosen to represent District 12 in the 74th iteration of the Hunger Games, have a refreshing dynamic that complements the female character's unusual physical prowess over her male counterpart. Hutcherson faces a similar discrepancy acting against his co-star, who undoubtedly has the greater emotion to toy with, though it appears something central to establishing him as a more interesting character may have been lost in translation between the novel and the screen. Regardless, the pair accomplish an endearing chemistry that will cement their status as Hollywood's new 'power couple' in the wake of the final instalment in the 'Twilight' saga, which this series looks set to eclipse with the deserving success of this film.'The Hunger Games' will undoubtedly garner a legacy for itself as being amongst more credible adaptations, its uncommon wide appeal ensuring an extensive audience as is only fitting for its brave efforts. Finally a studio can (and will hopefully continue to) fill cinema seats nationwide with a film that caters towards a spectrum of demographics.9/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

With a very famous cast like Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hamsworth and Donald Sutherland, Gary Ross did an awesome job by implementation of the novel by Suzanne Collins. The cast acted very convincingly which made the film very rousing. As the audience you could easily identify with the performers, particularly the heroine Katniss. Although the film is less violent than the books, it is still bloody and exciting at the same time. In the movie, the directors use incredible authentic costumes and landscapes, which make the action and the movie even more convincing and real. All in all, the film is absolutely worth seeing. The action in connection with the amazing actors and the great job the directors did makes the film an extraordinary experience you should not miss.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Here it's presented as though the main characters are completely ignorant of the central fact of their existence, an annual event that everyone watches. It's clumsy and annoying exposition, and it's the *best* written part of the film. From there it just gets worse, with contrived situations and deus ex machinas falling from the trees.All this is set in a world that seems like a fifth-grader's concept of a centrally planned economy, a poorly conceived dystopia which makes no sense physically or economically. Nothing is ever fundamentally explained, except for an occasional ""Oh, by the way, we forgot to tell you this exists and there's conveniently one nearby, or we'll whip something up through apparently magic."" It's all frustrating and never coheres into anything resembling a believable world or society.Worse yet, there's no story here. It's pure melodrama with a predetermined outcome. The cardboard characters have no arc, no growth, no anything but having survived. It's just an empty, morally repugnant spectacle, with no real point to any of it.I imagine there are probably apologists who claim, much like the later Harry Potter films, that ""Well, you have to have read the book to fully understand everything."" If that's the case, then the film is still a failure. I shouldn't have to bring along supplementary material to fill in the gaps, inconsistencies, and just plain stupidity of a movie like this.I gave three stars because the film was mostly professionally shot and produced. I just wish they'd spent some of that money on a professionally written script. This movie is a complete disaster and an utter waste of time.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Every year, Panem organizes the Hunger games, a ritual which shall remind the people of war and to show them that the Capitol of Panem has got the control. For this, they elect two teenagers from each district, one which is the richest, and 12 that is the poorest, who have to fight against each other. There is only one winner who will get honor and a lot of money. Katniss is living in District 12. She lives in extreme poverty. Her relationship to her mother is not really good, but she loves her sister. Because of her father's death, she has to take the role of the man in her family. She is hunting nearly every day and is very well trained with the bow. To save her sister from getting killed in the games, she volunteers as tribute. Together with Peeta Melark, she travels to the Capitol, where they get trained and presented to the sponsors, who are very necessary to win the games and can save your life. Peeta and her know each other. His family has a bakery. He did not treat Katniss well and she hates him at first. But they pass much time together and get to know each other.Their relationship is getting very wired. Will they have a happy ending together? I really like the movie because there are so many different feelings in it. It is exciting, sometimes brutal, long but never boring and even a love story. The main character Katniss is well chosen. She is a girl who has got nothing except of her best friend Gale, played by Liam Hemsworth, and her little sister, for whom she is even ready to lose her life. The movie has got a great statement. You can do everything as long as you believe in it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As fans of dystopia swept away the shelves, they went to watch the film with great interest.Maybe The Hunger Games by Gary Ross is not an exemplary youth dystopia and has its own optional, time-consuming moments, but it's still an interesting story that attracted the attention of a huge audience for a reason.The Hunger Games is a survival game in the real world where every second you have to fight, fight and even kill. Therefore, in order to be able to stay alive, they united. Thus began their close relationship, but the girl already had a ""friend"" who loved her. And so their love triangle developed, where Peeta and Katniss during the games became someone closer than just allies. Fear for their lives, for the life of their ""comrade"" gave rise to a feeling of affection in them, which flowed into love.Even though there are chases, battles and murders in the film, it's not an action movie, shooting action scenes is not up to par, like in some cool mega-modern blockbuster of the latest generation, but it's not scary at all, because the film is not really about that. With these goals, you can watch films with Vin Diesel and other brutal actors. The Hunger Games, on the other hand, tell about relationships between people, about relationships between sisters, friends, the older generation and the younger, between the leaders of the state and its citizens, and where without it between lovers.If you stop specifically for shooting. That being said, at the time it was a very good film. The picture is nice, special effects are quite realistic. The cast is perfect.In my opinion, this film should be watched by everyone, because then a person will have an idea that will show him a resemblance to our real world, that everything is not so smooth with us, as the TV channels broadcast. This work is a dystopia, which is not too different from the existing orders in our lives.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film exaggerates the system in the modern world. The essence of that universe is as follows: There is a center, a city in which the elite live, and there are 12 districts (cities, regions), each of which supplies something to the main city. The first three or four districts live normally, they are hardly oppressed, but the rest live in slavery. In that universe, there is an annual event that serves as a reminder of the districts' failed rebellion against the government and keeps the districts in line to this day: the Hunger Games. It is an event at which only one person out of 24 survives each year. Two people from each district are selected each year for the Hunger Games, and one year, in place of her little sister, the main character Kitniss volunteers, who becomes an idol and role model for many. This movie tells the story of a brave, strong and self-sacrificing girl who proves time and time again that nothing is impossible, you just have to put in the effort.

I saw ""Hunger Games"" on the on-flight guide and I figured what have I got to lose? I'm stuck on a plane for the next 5 hours anyway. I never even heard of the books until my other half mentioned she read them, so I had no idea what it was about. All I knew was there was a huge buzz around it and the critics raved and blah, blah, blah... Despite all the hype, expectations were low.Mindset after movie: Wait a minute... I've seen this before, except it was called ""The Running Man"", and instead of Jennifer Lawrence it had Arny. I like ""The Running Man"" more and it too wasn't nearly as good as the book(which was ghost written by Stephen King). In this version of ""The Running Man"" I felt very conflicted; I didn't want to root for the hero, Jennifer Lawrence, because it is what the rich people involved in this production (the kind of people loosely portrayed as the 'bad guys' in this movie) wanted me to do but, I felt I had to root for her because the character is probably gonna start a movement that will help the underdogs of the story take down the cash chuckers, you know what I mean? Beyond that, I see a bright future for Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, I will always love Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson no matter what they do. I honestly think the major killer of this movie was all the hype around it and that nobody seems to remember ""The Running Man"". They should have just remade that instead. With that said I can tell you that anybody who likes this movie is probably still in their teens and are more than likely rolling with the hype or they love the book series so much that it has subconsciously put them in a temporary state of denial.If you're like me, have matured beyond your teenage years and have seen/read ""The Running Man"". This movie will make you angry because they just ripped off ""The Running Man"" while ignoring its existence instead of remaking it. However, if you're a pop-culture sheep who just likes everything that is hyped to death, like ""Twilight"" or Lady Gaga you'll probably like it. Oh ya, my girlfriend read these books and she hated this movie too...she also forgot that ""The Running Man"" existed...WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOCIETY THESE DAYS?","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

I wanted to read the books, but I decided it would be worth it to watch the film first. I LOVED the film. It is not the next harry potter/ lord of the ring/ twilight. It is BETTER than all of them put together. The film starts brilliantly. After a rebellion, the world has been split into 13 districts (this confused me during the film though, it seemed to swap between 13 and 12 districts. As a point of explanation, the barely mentioned district 13 was destroyed before the events of the film.) district one are the rich people, people who live in luxury, whereas district 12 are poor, a third world country, to put it simply. Each year, a boy and a girl from each district are forced to compete in ""the hunger games"", basically a fight to the death in an arena that the government controls, until there is a victor, the one survivor. The whole thing is turned into a massive event and TV show. The Main character, katniss, 16 years old, is from district 12, what a surprise. Guess who gets picked to take part in the hunger games? The main characters 12 year old sister, who wouldn't last 5 minutes in the games. So, in a heart-breaking scene, katniss volunteers to take her sisters place. Now bear in mind I NEVER get emotional at films if I haven't read the books first (or is about animals) I was almost in tears at this point, 10 minutes into the film. And I was amazed, at the emotion I already felt for these characters. Then is the juicy part, in the weeks running up to the ""games"", the tributes train, katniss training together with her fellow district 12 tribute, peeta. And these 2 have a past, as he once saved her from starvation and it turns out he is in love with her or seems to be. Throughout the film, it does seem uncertain whether peeta loves katniss, or if is an act. During the games, the tributes can get help from sponsors on the outside, weapons, food or medicine. And during the weeks running up to the games, the tributes are watched, given scores, and the tributes do interviews, and katniss gets the persona of katniss the girl on fire. It is a great set up to the games Now I don't want to go into the games themselves, too many spoilers involved, but I can tell you that it is an emotional roller-coaster that will have you on the edge of your seat from the second they get into the arena, if not from the start. Just suffice to say that katniss suffers injury, loss of friends, betrayal, traps, danger, a fearsome alliance, a trained warrior determined to kill her, and the people in charge of the games who do NOT want her to win and are prepared to play dirty. I will say that there are 2 AMAZING scenes that are still with me, above the rest. There is a part where a friend dies, which is done beautifully, and the climax is epic remember, there can only be one victor... Also, I have now read the books. Usually, my advice is that if you have read the book, don't expect the film. To be fair, there isn't much new, and all the new parts are covered, at least in part in catching fire. I have to say that for once, the books and film are almost equal. I mean, a film can never match a book, but this is the closest it has gotten, with it being VERY similar to the books, with just enough improvements to make up for the bad changes (be fair, readers, how on earth can the hounds be any good on screen with the whole eyes part, I love that part of the books, but it would never have worked and most of the removed parts are for the best, other than that they got rid of the avox. They also downplayed gale, for now.) I would HIGHLY suggest watching it. If you do, all I have to say is happy hunger games and my the odds be ever in your favor","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

There is lot of potential to have good analysis of human mind and actions in desperate situation which this movie lacks. There is lot of potential to give statements about our current societies problems etc. which this movie lacks.This movie is not well directed or acted. I am not an expert in this but after seen over 600 films and some of the best ones multiple times I have something to compare to. I think the closest to this film is Battle Royale what I have seen. Of course many compare these two films I think. In Battle Royale you really can see the fear and chaos from the characters in the situation but in Hunger Games there is none of that. These movies are also good example in the way that the actors are equally unknown and I guess equally inexperienced actors.Only character you know something about is the protagonist Katniss. But as I watched I did not really care about her and I cared others even less because I did not know any of them. This movie is very predictable and shallow. Still movie has some entertainment value that I watched it trough. Maybe just to see how bad it actually was.

The pacing for the film is excellent, especially for its run time of 142 minutes. The performances from Jennifer Lawrence (WINTER'S BONE, X-Men: First Class) and Josh Hutcherson (Journey to the Center of the Earth, The Kids Are Alright) were great and gave the characters of Katniss and Peeta so much depth and memorability. The directing is great and even though the camera work was a little too shaky at times, it made the violent scenes more dramatic and horrific. Not only was the film thrilling, but it is also the only film I've seen where no one in the screen spoke a word. The film didn't just engage my attention, but everyone else's too. With fast intense, edge-of-your-seat action and an emotionally filled script makes ""The Hunger Games"" a captivating action drama thriller. If you enjoyed the trailer, you will definitely enjoy the film. 9/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"8","/10","My first movie in 5 years!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2586244/?ref_=tt_urv","IloveBeaubeau","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4177333/?ref_=tt_urv","24 March 2012","First of all I am a cheap skate with a 4 year old, and I haven't been to the theater in 5 years. I waited more than a year for this film after I read all 3 books in the series in one week when I first bought my Kindle Christmas of 2010. True, the movie doesn't develop the characters' relationships as well as the novel does, but what can you expect for a 2 hour and 20 minute film? It would have been better if AMC had developed a year long novella for book one alone. You don't really get to see the depth of Katniss and Gale's relationship and the romantic tension that was in the book. Same goes for the angst and romantic tension that Katniss and Peeta shared for days in that cave. Oh, well. The relationship between Katniss and Rue was rather abbreviated also, but the emotion of the death scene was so powerful that I was choking on my tears and trying to keep quiet.I have to admit that I have never seen a Harry Potter or Twilight film in full. I have either fallen asleep or simply changed the channel. I have never been able to get into those films ever, especially Twilight with their cheesy plots, corny romance, and terrible make-up and lighting. I did catch the last Twilight film, and fast forwarded most of that movie. I liked this movie because it did highlight the main points in the book, but in order to showcase the characters and their relationships they would have had to make a 6 hour movie, which would have been impossible. My husband also read book 1, and was riveted by it and both of us are not really readers. He was disappointed in that there were no guts and glory as he's a 53 year man and ex-killing machine by way of the U.S. Army so he would have given the film a 6. However, I thought the actual killing scenes were adequate enough without all the gruesome guts and blood. The last fight scene should have been more climatic as it was in the book. The overall look of the film was rather colorless and dreary. Reminded me of Twilight and the Potter films. Didn't like it. I expected District 12 to be cloudy, drab, and colorless as it was portrayed in the film, but when they got to the scenes of the Capitol, I expected more vibrant colors. There were too many purples. Should have been more greens, oranges, blues, and reds. More primary colors and more sunny days. Same for the scenes in the open fields during the games. I wanted to experience the hard sweat and heat of the day that I imagined as I was in when reading the book. I am tired of colorless films. Real life has sunny blue skies, movie directors! Last movie I saw that portrayed the beauty of sunny days and heat was the Rum Diary with Johnny Depp. Even the last Star Wars movie with Natalie Portman had more color and beauty. In the book, Cinna was alive and flamboyant. Lenny Kravitz was a huge fail. When I imagined Cinna when I was reading, I always pictured someone big and cheerful like Sam Champion, the weather guy from Good Morning America. Kravitz was dull and lifeless. Johnny Depp would have been perfect in a cameo role! What were the casting directors thinking? And what happened to President Snow? He's supposed to cry bloody tears? I like Sutherland, but a more sadistic looking actor and someone whom I always envisioned to play Snow would have been Malcolm McDowell who is totally creepy in a good way. The casting of Katniss and Peeta was perfect. Jennifer Lawrence is like a young Renee Zelwegger. She doesn't have to say much, but every look conveys what she is feeling. I wasn't so sure about Josh Hutcherson, and had read that Alex Pettfer was being considered for Peeta, but Josh did an excellent job and comes off more likable and amiable than Katniss as it was in the book where you end up actually rooting for him rather than the handsome and studly Gale in books 2 and 3. All in all, very satisfied with Suzanne Collins' film adaption, and can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd installments. I am expecting the second film to be very political and civil war-ish as the books, which I won't be looking forward to as much. However, the 3rd installment I am excited for and hoping that they really showcase the angst and love that Katniss has for Peeta. I hope movie two really emphasizes the unrequited love that Peeta has for Katniss. Hey, after all I am still a female.Anyway loved the film, but loved the books more. I was shocked and a little embarrassed that I had fallen in love with the Hunger Games Trilogy after finding out it was in the children's' section. I hadn't read any type of book since finishing grad school 13 years ago. Makes me want to read another trilogy again! I was so excited to find out shortly after reading the Collins' trilogy a movie was being made that I wanted to travel from D.C. to North Carolina to check out the scene like a teeny bopper! Can't wait for the 2nd film.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Well cast. story line is followed very close to the book. Some characters not included though that would have made it better over all which is one reason I kept my rating as a 9. It is hard to but a book into a 2 hour movie and not lose parts of the story line that prove to be important especially if there is to be a sequel or two which I am sure there is being as how this is the 1st book of a trilogy. The relationship between Katniss and Peta and Gail was not fleshed out enough which is a mistake because it is so central to the book series. This is perhaps my biggest disappointment. I think the theme however is too adult for the 14 and under crowd although the violence is kept very mild by most standards. It is played out but not overly graphic. The language is mild and there is no great sexual overtones which is refreshing. My summary is go and see it. It is well worth the cost of a ticket.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence who had an art-house success with Winter's Bone, has just put down such a role. Afcourse not the same, but sort of the same elements. A person who refuses to please and more dominated by here stubborn intransigence than by here beauty. The hunger games, two and a half hour film that alternately touching, exciting, and visually overwhelming is. The scenes where Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) comes from is a poor neighborhood in the woods. But where Katniss gets as she arrives is a colorful and original surrounding filled with beautiful scenery and costumes.Dictatorial style architecture and 18th century forms makes the image of the capital: Capital.Even actors like Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones play their supporting roles with contagious joy.Director Ross takes the viewer seriously: not a moment is the public inundated with information, because he was confident that we can think for ourselves. This is beautifully done! The film shows merciless the cruelty behind reality shows. The film shows a connection between inequality and riots, and that the theme of the movie very actual is in the world. This movie is going to be one of THE movies released in 2012.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I will say that the movie itself was very well acted, the special effects were awesome, and the overall cinema was outstanding on par with any other major production, with standards well above most films. But my dad use to tell me that you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear! I find the subject matter deeply disturbing at a moral and ideological level. I'm not going to spoil this film, but suffice to say that the author has some serious psychological issues and everyone in the movies food chain including the publishers promoters, teachers, and school administrators should seriously justify why kids killing kids is an appropriate theme for adolescents or any one else for that matter! In addition to murder, butchery, and mayhem, there are scenes of dictatorial state run lottery to kidnap innocent children from towns and subject them to an annual gladiatorial game from which 24 children ages 12 to 18 are forcibly removed from their families and sent to battle among themselves to the death for the honor of the state. This is without a doubt the most blood thirsty and morally bankrupt story I have ever witnessed. No matter how well crafted or technically written the premise is still flawed by the sycophantic wonder that would make even Adolf Hitler blush! I find that I truly hate the post-apocalyptic ""Panem"" culture to such extreme that were I a citizen of that land it would be non stop war with all their inhabitants from the central city of useless idiots and deviant corrupted socialites, to the victimized out-lands which blithely accept their fate to auction their children to the butchery and death of the games. It would not take 74 years to realize that the state and the games are an affront to any civilized sense of decency or humanity. The fact that the story justifies the killing of 1,700 children in their history as a form of healing or reconciliation for the sins of the father is an amazing tragedy of enormous proportion. Yes, it is just a story, but a sick one! Where is the outrage? Yet all through the story the characters are as quietly resigned as the sheep that watch this film. I should hope that I live in a real world that would defend our children from this brutality with more courage than the actors or audience could muster. Or at the least be among the few that would gladly eat the grapes of wrath to deny the state its victories much like the tales of Masada. At least to have death with dignity and the right to define ones own life if not in death with the personal destiny that does not benefit the state. But far more preferable it would be to serve the state its hemlock. Far better to destroy the madness than to let generations suffer a fate worst than death. To hell with Caesar! As for the author she needs to seek professional counseling and along with her all her co-conspirators. This book and film are a subtle form of child abuse and corrupting young minds with this filth ought to be a capital crime. To all the sick twisted freaks that dreamed this insanity - ""May the odds ever be in your favor""! P.S.: I am known for liking almost anything Sci-Fi, but this story is the exception to the rule. I will read all three books, borrowed of course! And I will definitely write more extensively against its failings wherever feasible. If need be I will be the sole dissenting voice against this insult. Who knows there maybe even an ""Anti-Hunger Games"" book. Certainly a manual for the liberation of Panem and all her Districts! A dissident's guide to District Freedom! Or a Guerilla Freedom Fighters Field Manual! And a message for everyone else, Wake UP!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The build up to the action was great, you start rooting for the main character in the movie. I also thought the movie was well acted, with Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lawrence, and Donald Sutherland doing great jobs. I wish they would have just done a rated R version of the movie, or release an un-rated DVD. Some of the action scenes in the beginning they have the shaky cam going which gets annoying. The love story drags a little. The people comparing it to Harry Potter or Twilight probably haven't seen Hunger Games. Besides a the love story, and the fact there are some teens in the movie, Hunger Games is completely different. Hunger Games much more violent, suspenseful and raw. It is actually closer to The Running Man.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm a middle school Language Arts teacher, so for some time it has been hard to ignore this series. I enjoyed the books, and looked forward to this movie.The reviewer who said he reacted badly initially to Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss had obviously not seen her in ""Winter Bone"" - odd since she was nominated for best actress for the role. The reviewer said Lawrence wasn't ""hungry"" enough, or gritty and poor, I guess, though she was fantastic as a rural Ozarks teenager with a drug dealing father and abusive family, caring for her siblings and a catatonic mother in a two-room shack. Go figure.I thought ""The Hunger Games"" was a terrific adaptation. The cast was outstanding - Harrelson was perfect as Haymitch and the actors for the two male love interests were just right. There were minor differences with the book, but that always happens as you try to make a 2 hour plus movie out of a novel. Katniss' backpack was supposed to be orange, she was supposed to go last when the judges were rating the Tributes, Katniss and Peeta's scene on the eve of the Games was supposed to be on the roof... but none of that really matters. For me, the director brought the book to life almost perfectly. I loved it, and judging from the absenteeism in my classes on Friday (students who went to the midnight premiere the night before) this movie will do very well.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

They were so all-consuming, so gripping that you just had to continue reading on until the end. Going to see the film was almost another way of being able to read the first one again. All the cast were fantastic- just how I imagined them to be, Peeta and Katniss were perfect, and once again, the whole story pulled me in within minutes.I know there are a lot of people coming out disappointed, and complaining about the 'shaky hand cam' etc., but I think you have the option of going to see the film in two different ways- with or without reading the books first. IF you've read the books, then you'll know that the shaky camera is portraying how Katniss felt in the woods, the intensity of her time spent in the hunger games. I can see how for those people who haven't read the book will come out a little confused, but they've just seen the skinny version of the full-fat book that we've read. It was fantastic. My expectations were high, and they were exceeded! If you've read the books, you MUST go and see it, to relive what you read. If you haven't read the books, just go in with an open mind, and remember that it's based on a book- with so much detail, they didn't have time for everything, but it didn't matter.I was so happy when I came out of the cinema,; I thought it was brilliant.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

What it did do was make me want to read them, so that was a good thing! However, the movie itself was terrible! The actors and actresses all did decent jobs. No blame on them! But the movie starts terribly slow and continues to be terribly slow all up until the last 1/3 part of the movie. I mean, it's like an hour before they even get to the place where the action is supposed to take place and when it starts off Katniss spends the next half an hour hiding in trees! The action scenes are very lame, I'm not the type that needs to see blood and gore all over the place, but if you make a movie about kids murdering each other in cold blood then at least the poor victims deserve to have believable death scenes, even if they are not the major character! Besides, most of the kids got killed off so early there wasn't much point having them there in the first place! And the main character really got very little action. The little she got was annoying. I felt most of the movie was talking, hiding and napping. This was supposed to be about hunger, survival, etc. But no. Technically it seems all you have to do is hide in the trees and you'll be all good! No seriously, I couldn't care for any of the characters, except Rue, none warranted any attention, no character development. Very little emotional depth, tt was all very fatigued and uninteresting. What a shame, because the concept was interesting and it could easily have made a great movie. Then it annoys me seeing the high score it's getting here on IMDb. It's like seeing this juicy hamburger on a commerical poster and getting served the miniature dry version on a plate. The focus shouldn't have been on these two people and the issue with their ""pretended"" love affair. Timing was all wrong in this movie. Ineffective. If the makers had made a timeline for themselves as to where it should peak up, where to climax, etc, they should have seen that as far as how movies, books, etc, are supposed to progress this failed miserably. Besides, what do I care if the woman has a ""burning"" dress and looks awesome on a red carpet. Hunger Games, people, seriously! *Frustrated* I wouldn't even let my 13 year old sister see this movie. Gotta keep some sort of quality control.This all annoyed me because the trailer seemed exciting, the movie plot sounded good. Me and my sister (21) were excited about seeing it, but it fell terribly flat.

First of all, Jennifer Lawerence was amazing and did a great job. Elizabeth Banks was also really great as Effie, and those two stood out the most for me. One thing that I would have liked is if the movie was a bit more graphic, and violent, like the book, which would have added more emotional impact, in certain areas. Like, I wanted her to say she was going to ""Cut up Katniss' pretty little face,"" or whatever the line, because it made me hate her, and then there was more impact when Trash killed the girl. Stuff like that. It's not that I am looking for violence or gore, actually, I'm not into that stuff, but that is what me feels so desperate to know what happens to Katniss, and hate the Capital, etc. But, someone made the point that they needed to tame it down to keep it PG-13, and since my friend took four 11-year-old boys to see it, I can understand the ratings concern. Even though they were also a little bummed it wasn't as graphic as the book.I did think the way they portrayed District 12 was really good and that did set up some emotional aspect, but I did think it could have used a little more, so you would get more of a sense of what you felt in the book. Though, I did still cry when Rue died, but not quite as much as when I read the book.Also, I pictured Cinna a bit more feminine and less macho. It almost made it seem like there was some sort of romantic link, which you did not get in the book. I also wanted to see her other groomers. I thought it would have added something to show how ridiculous the Capitol was, but also give some sympathy to show how oblivious they are in the Capitol. Some guy saying they need to hose her down twice, in the movie, didn't really work for me. Just did not have the same impact.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

At the time of writing this review The Hunger Games had an average score of 7.7 from over 84,000 ""users"". I find this score of 7.7 hard to believe after watching the movie, and especially after reading other written IMDb user reviews which all seem to be negative (so is there a bot at work here or some other manipulation going on?). Generally in the past I've found the IMDb average rating a reliable indicator of the quality of a movie, but that is simply not the case for this movie. I think I being generous in giving this movie a score of 4. This is a long tedious predictable bore of a movie. Sure, I'm 36 years old so perhaps I'm not the target demographic, but I am in no way a movie snob. I enjoy science fiction, but I came out of this movie feeling that this movie was a lost opportunity - it could of been so much better. I've never read the books, but after reading many of the user reviews here I plan to, as it sounds like the books treat this story with a lot more depth.

I will try as hard as I can to show you exactly why I love this movie. My first reason for adoring this movie is the cast. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) is such a great actor. She portrays that while Katniss can be tough and brave, she is also passionate, loving and determined. Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) is also a character with lots of depth. He shows that Peeta is smart, clever and obviously very passionate about Katniss. Also other characters with less experience did amazingly well. (Rue and Prim.) Another reason I loved this movie was because of the way they made it so unique. It follows the book on a lot of really important details. The book was so different than anything I had ever read. The way that everything fell into palace amazed meThis movie was definitely not all hype, in my opinion. This movie was one of my favorites. If you want a completely real, thrilling, emotional adventure, go see The Hunger Games!!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I read it, enjoyed it even though it was gruesome but the movie was as good, if not better. The screen adaptation from the novel was superb and the cinematography exceeded all expectations. I thought I was able to visualize THE CAPITOL in the book but was wrong. The film's portrayal was absolutely mind-blowing. I can think of no one more perfect to play Katniss Everdeen than Jennifer Lawrence. She was to ""Games"" what Vivian Leigh was to Scarlett O'Hara. PERFECT MATCHES. Someone else who amazed me. The character named Caesar Flickerman,the Master of Ceremonies of the televised orgy of death, Stanley Tucci. Come Oscar time in Feb.'13,he's gonna make some noise. One thing for anyone who hasn't read the book but will see the film.You already know it's all about sanctioned ""kids murdering kids"" supposedly for the entertainment of all in the 12 Districts of Panem.However where does ""Hunger"" come in? Why not call it, ""The Competitive Games"" for example. Remember Malthus's theory about population outlasting food supply? It causes mass starvation.But if 24 tributes fight to kill each other and one is left standing, isn't there more food to go around? And if those tributes are of child bearing ages (adolescents and teens) and they propagate, then their children must eat too. Hence, just one of 24 must be allowed to survive to preserve that vital food supply.I did not mean the aforementioned to be a spoiler--I do not think it is--but that title ""HUNGER games"" had to be clarified. That ends my clarification without any film details divulged. See this movie. It truly is brilliant.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first 40 minutes is all character development where we get to see the characters have deep profound conversations and flashbacks while giving each other meaningful looks. Sort of like Eat, Pray, Love, but with less action.Pacing: Somewhere between a snail on weed and glacial movements.Direction: Awful. The director is in love with power-point, as we see 2- second shots through the entire movie. The camera man is presumably seeking treatment for parkinsons as every single shot was done in the Blair-witch style shooting by having the cameraman jog while shooting, making for very shaky footage.Overall: My reason for giving one-star is because this site does not allow me to give zero stars. The movie induces motion-sickness via all the shaky camera work, and as I already said it's hard to see anything when the shot changes every two seconds (I timed it - there is one sequence of the movie which is composed of around 25 consecutive shots of less than two seconds each). Both these issues contribute to feeling nauseous when watching the movie. As far as I am concerned, any movie that makes the viewer physically ill doesn't deserve any stars. Bottom-line: see this movie only if you're a fan of Suzanne Collins.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

I've read the book and am currently half-way through Catching Fire. I must admit, my expectations grew higher and higher every-time I read a positive review on this movie, and, unlike many other movies I had been highly anticipating, I can happily say it delivered on all fronts. I saw the movie yesterday (Thursday) and I loved it. Whilst I took all the negative criticism thrown at the movie into consideration, most of that is nit-picking and no one should expect a movie to be exactly like the book. What you get in The Hunger Games is an amazing story, lots of suspense, a small sub-plot (that being love) and most of all, terrific acting. The movie is great, Jennifer Lawrence was perfect as Katniss, and frankly I don't think any other actress could have taken the roll of Katniss as well as Jennifer did. Everyone's acting was sublime and it came together so well.Whilst I had a few moments in which I was thinking 'why did they leave that out?' That did not take away from the overall experience and you can tell this movie has been made with love and care, and when Suzanne Collin's (the books writer) co-wrote the screen-play for the movie, you can expect it to be good. I'm not one to sway anyones opinions, but this movie has really proved to be on a ground of it's own and can really take the helm as being another big blockbuster franchise. Bring on Catching Fire!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

So to serve as a means of contrast with these negative reviews, here's a positive review of the first 'Hunger Games', directed by Gary Ross.Now I'll fully admit that this film did end up getting out-shined by its far superior sequel, 'Catching Fire'. But that doesn't mean that this film is as bad as some have put it out to be. Through Gary Ross' solid direction, the film does its job of establishing the universe of Panem and its characters and overall both the story and characters are well-written, especially when compared to other 'Young Adult' franchises like 'Twilight' and 'Divergent'. It also helps that the film has a terrific ensemble cast highlighted of course by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, who pretty much carries the film by herself, even in a film that also features names like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, and Elizabeth Banks. A lot of criticism towards this film mainly revolves around the fast editing and shaky cam, primarily during the Games themselves. Personally it didn't really bother me but I understand where others are coming from. That was definitely one thing that the sequels did improve on. But even with that in mind, 'The Hunger Games' was a solid start to one of the few 'good' film franchises based off of a Young Adult oriented book series.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you think this is another boring teen movie with sci-fi and fantasy elements, you're wrong. The story is pretty interesting and it's also great as an adaptation. While it's not as brutal as the book, it has almost every plot point and book fans will not be disappointed. The story will probably remind you of Battle Royale, but it doesn't make this movie bad. Performances are great and it really feels real. Some people complained about Gary Ross' direction and all that shaky cam. While I'm not the fan of shaky cam, it kinda worked here because it doesn't look like typical sci-fi blockbuster and it gave a more realistic note to the movie and it also helped cover up some more graphic moments in the movie. I didn't really like the visuals and it's still hard for me to believe that the budget was 78 million dollars but I could deal with it. After all, this is a very good and emotional movie and very faithful to it's source material.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

After all, many Hollywood adaptions of my favorite books have in the past been bitter disappointments, and I have walked out of several book-to-movie adaptions grumbling about wasted money and time spent I will never have back. After seeing this, though, my hope in Hollywood has been restored. Yes, this movie has its flaws like all others, but overall, I was very impressed. Right off the start, they do a great job setting up the story and they easily throw the audience into this post-apocalyptic future. Jennifer Lawrence does a wonderful job portraying the lead role of Katniss Everdeen. As the movie goes on, you are pulled more and more into it. During the games, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. When it was finished, the audience clapped and left gushing about how thrilling the movie was. Though they did cut out some parts and change a few things, it wasn't anything I was about to throw a fit over. The changes and cuts were fine and I thought actually made the story make more sense. I laughed, I cried, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I'd have to say this was definitely one of the better movies I've seen all year. However, I would have to say the movie may be a little more difficult to grasp if you haven't read the book. With any book-to-movie adaption, I always recommend reading the book first, and this was no exception. I went with a friend who hadn't read the books and once or twice she had to lean over and ask me to clarify a few things. However, she was impressed with the movie when it was over and immediately went to a bookstore afterwards to buy the whole trilogy. Another minor bone I have to pick with this movie would be the fact that the ending felt a bit rushed and the overall climax wasn't as thrilling as it was in the novel. The violence, too, was toned down a bit for a PG-13 rating, which is something I can understand in order to market the movie to a bigger audience. In any case, I loved it and would seriously recommend seeing this.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm a magnificent fan of ""The Hunger Games"" because I've read all three of the books twice. I liked the actors, the story line, and the action scenes.Essentially, I thought the actors fit the role immaculate for the people I imagined in my head as I was reading the books. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job for Katniss in my opinion, I think she is a very great actress. I also really liked Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, he did very well at the romantic scenes with Katniss. The director, Garry Ross did a great job finding a great cast.Additionally, the story line has a very good plot. The movie follows the book fairly well. Although, the concept is pretty morbid it's still a very intreging movie. A well known quote from the movie and book is ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" Effie Trinket. However, the movie could have used a higher budget. The camera work wasn't so great, but they still had some great scenes and the camera work was fine. Over all the movie is really great. Furthermore, the action scenes were Exquisete. Garry Ross did a good job of capturing the action scenes from the book. Nevertheless, the books scenes were a little more gruesome; but I think the director made a good decision by making the action scenes in the movie less gruesome than the books action scenes. Moreover, how did you like the hunger games? I thought It was a great and I hope you liked it too. I recommend you read the books, because I enjoyed them undoubtedly well.

The thing is, though, I wasn't excited for The Hunger Games. I had heard the book was great, but the marketing material looked as if it was geared mostly towards the Twilight crowd, of which I am most certainly not a member; so I went ahead and read the book. Now the book tells a compelling story with an interesting and timely political parallel, but it is not necessarily the most well-written thing I have ever read. Competent, but not excellent. However, what the book is is cinematic. The novel was absolutely begging to be made into a film and you could almost see author Suzanne Collins sending it off to publication and waiting by her phone for the film studios to start calling. As a filmmaker, and major film nerd, reading the book I started creating my own imaginary screenplay for the film and directing in my mind my version of The Hunger Games. The problem with this movie lies in the fact that it's not IllusionOfLife's The Hunger Games, it's Gary Ross' The Hunger Games. As I mentioned, my biggest problem with the film was that it was not The Hunger Games movie that I would have directed, and while I know that sounds terribly pretentious of me, give me a second to explain. Due to the cinematic nature of the novel and the fact that as a filmmaker and a film fan I have certain sensibilities, there are things that I would have done differently while adapting the story, but that does not make them inherently better than what is in the film, just more aligned to my personal tastes. I regret now that I read the novel first because I think I would have appreciated the film much more from an objective perspective. That being said, Gary Ross does a great job adapting the material and, despite what the marketing campaign might have indicated, it doesn't fall into the trap of teenage melodrama that so many other similar films do. The love triangle that forms in the story is appropriately handled here and doesn't overtake the more important themes of the narrative. The film has a very gritty and realistic feeling to it, and I know that those two words are buzz words that get thrown around a lot, often in the wrong context (Snow White and the Huntsman is neither gritty nor realistic, it's a big CG fantasy film that happens to have dark subject matter), here however, I mean it in the most literal sense. There are no big ""money shots;"" no grand, sweeping moments of spectacle; no massive visual effects set pieces; the whole thing is subdued in a way that I feel is very appropriate for the work. A lot of the camera work is hand held and intimate, and the score never attracts attention to itself and exists only to punctuate certain moments; listening to the score on iTunes would likely be boring, but it works perfectly in the context of the movie, often stepping out of the way in favor of complete silence when appropriate. The performances were also fairly strong, which is something I was not expecting from this. There's a fairly low bar set for acting in similar films that are aimed at young adults and teenagers, but everyone did a good job in this film; even some of the casting decisions I wasn't sold on right away (Josh Hutcherson most notably) surprised me by taking on the role really well. It doesn't have the brilliance of something like the casting of the Harry Potter films, but few things do. One thing the movie does cut significantly from the book is the lore and backstory, and I'm sure many fans of the novel will lose their minds over this, but it didn't bother me too much. Having too much of the movie dedicated to explaining the history of Panem would have taken time away from the core story and character development which arguably got trimmed too much already (I'll get to that in a moment). Not only that, but with the popularity of the book it's almost an absolute certainty that anyone seeing the film who hasn't already read the book will know someone who has, and conversations will inevitably be sparked about the lore of this world. There was just enough of the lore included to make sure the story at hand was in the proper context, but not too much that the film gets bogged down in the details. My one legitimate complaint with this film, is that it rushes through some of the character development in order to keep moving the film along at a brisk pace. At 142 minutes the film is already pushing it for a mainstream blockbuster, but if they had taken some more time to really develop the relationships in the film (like that of Katniss and Rue or the dynamic that shifts between the two leads in the third act) I think it would have made for a stronger film. The movie is an extremely well-made film and exceeded my expectations in many ways. It's not perfect, but I feel it does a good job of adapting the novel and setting up the trilogy. I also think that it is one that I'll appreciate more on repeat viewings as I'm able to set more and more of my personal vision aside and appreciate it more objectively than I do now.

Understandably, it is difficult to develop the characters and fully explain the story in a movie but this movie did the book a disservice. To the person who has not read the book the characters will seem confusing and shallow because little was done to explain their story and their relationship. Many major portions of the character development were left out. In particular the relationship between Primrose and Catniss and how that built on the relationship between Catniss and Rue. Additionally, the relationship between Catniss and Peeta and the complications and internal conflict it causes in Catniss is inadequate. Finally we get to Haymitch, the movie does his character wrong and he is a shadow of what he is in the book. There are many other things that I disliked about the movie, I only hope that the sequels can do a better job of developing the characters.

To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is the ultimate in reality television, romance, scripted realism and survival. Involving 2 children from each of this future society's districts who must compete in a cruel televised tournament in which the 24 lottery ""winners"" fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses. Yup I always knew reality TV was evil and this is where its headed.The second time was the charm with this movie for me because I enjoyed it way more when I caught it on TV the other night then I did the first time around. Not exactly sure why or what changed for me except that it's now been a few years since I read (and loved) the book so I wasn't as busy comparing the two. The movie still dragged a bit in the middle for me and Katniss spent way too much time hanging out in trees but ultimately I was entertained throughout.Great casting in Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, well everyone really; I liked Woody Harrelson & Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci & Donald Sutherland.They also did a good job of recreating the world that Suzanne Collins had created in her book (Capital city, all the crazy makeup, girl on fire costume) and explaining what the hell was going on in this post apocalyptic society, which couldn't have been easy. There was also less violence here, with very little actual bloodshed on screen (for ratings purposes?) and someone got to keep their leg, so that was nice albeit a little dull. 12/29/14","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

How do you pacify such angry citizens? Simple: Reality television. No, not Jersey Shore, something much worse. Or better, depending on how you look at it.Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence of Winter's Bone and X - Men: First Class) is a skilled tracker, hunter, and survivalist who lives in the impoverished District 12 where most earn their living in the mines. Her mother (played by Paula Malcolmson) has been struggling since her husband died, leaving her to raise Katniss and her sister Prim by herself. Katniss (Lawrence) is sixteen and a close friend of Gale Hawthorne (played by Liam Hemsworth) who dreams of running away. Every year, each of the twelve districts randomly selects two children (one boy and one girl) or ""tributes"" no younger than 12 and no older than 18 and Gale (Hemsworth) believes he's dodged the bullet as long as he can. Still, when the tributes are selected, Gale is spared and so is Katniss. But when Prim (Katniss's sister) is chosen. Katniss volunteers to take her place. Making her and Peeta Melark, (a baker's son portrayed by Jess Hutcherson of Bridge to Terabithia and Journey to the Center of the Earth) the candidates for the 74th annual, winner-take-all, death match known as The Hunger Games. Held in the Capital, The Hunger Games are broadcast live to the entire nation. Each participant is trained, sponsored, and ranked and then locked in a massive, futuristic Coliseum with remote control hazards, predators, and cameras hidden throughout.Now, this was a much-anticipated film. I was greatly intrigued by the trailers, but Twilight was also much-anticipated and no matter how much love it gets from the audience, I haven't even been able to sit through the first installment. Then, I saw the generally positive response from critics and took it upon myself to see this highly entertaining, dramatic effort and I urge those out there who haven't seen it to do so at there earliest possible convenience. This is a great film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The book was fantastic, great pacing and character development started in the book. The film I am pleased to say does not disappoint.The film is paced very well and sticks very close to the book it is based from. Some more depth of explanation could have been used throughout and introducing us to characters which will play a key role in the next two films.Despite this the special effects are very good from the District to the capitol where the games begin to take shape. My only criticism for the film in the bad camera work and shots in various scenes. There is a beautiful scene towards the finale of the film where two characters share a moment and the camera is shaking all over the screen and, for me it lost its full impact on the audience. Would I buy this film when it is released? Yes! Would I recommend this film as a family film? YesOverall I would say it is a very good film which sticks close to its original material even though some more work could have been used in explaining things in a little more depth therefor this film gets a solid 8/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Which, really, is the only way to watch a movie, unlike many reviewers here apparently think.The Hunger Games is terrifying. Set in a bleak future where a totalitarian world state rules with an iron fist and class separations are absolute, every year two teens from each of the world's ""districts"" are chosen at random to compete to the death in a callous show called The Hunger Games. When a young girl is chosen from district 12, one of the poorest districts, her older sister Katniss volunteers in her stead. She thus is taken to the Capital, a city overflowing with riches and privilege (the very contrast to her coal mining home town), heralded as a celebrity. But the sick thing about it is that while she and the 23 other youngsters are cheered on by adoring fans, they and everybody else knows they are really being led to most of their deaths. But Katniss, while quickly gaining attention in the much-publicised pre-games televising, is not intent on playing by the rules any more than she had to.Some fans of the books expected the movie to be more brutal. I found the callous attitude of the whole thing quite brutal as it was. The sick nature of leading random kids to their deaths, cheered on by adoring masses, is most difficult to stomach. The first half of the movie sets up the games, and the latter half is the games themselves, in the woods, where all the celebration and celebrity vanishes like smoke and the cruel fight for survival begins. Of course, they don't know that they're dealing with Katniss, who's already proficient at surviving in conditions not that far removed from the ones she finds herself in bar the teens trying to kill her. The movie knows how to build tension by giving us moments to breathe, not knowing what's gonna happen next and making us worry about the characters.The acting is superb. Jennifer Lawrence gives a stunning performance as Katniss and you root for her from beginning to end. She is 100% believable as tough and yet so vulnerable. If the Academy had any sense, she should've been nominated for her powerhouse of a performance. Donald Sutherland is chilling as the maniacal President Snow.It seems the books have such a high standard that they can't possibly be fulfilled on the big screen. Too bad. But for the uninitiated, The Hunger Games is a thrilling, stomach-churning action movie about surviving in hell.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sounds horrific right? Repulsive? Inhuman? You'd think so. Yet the only horror here is that the film plays out like a shallow, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster complete with an obligatory love plot and green screens galore. Seriously, talk about wasted potential. The source material is definitely there. The themes take nods from classics like George Orwell's 1984, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, and Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, laying the groundwork for a film that could've been a deep, disturbing philosophical examination of human nature and the dangers of government. I'm honestly upset that I didn't read the novel before seeing the film. In the hands of a capable and talented director, I truly feel that this story could've made for a fantastically effective, provocative film. This is what ultimately makes the end result so frustrating to watch. It's basically like gearing up to lift an 800 lb dumbbell only to have your arms swing effortlessly upward as you realize the weights are made of Styrofoam. What should've been an excruciatingly weighty, stimulating affair ended up being about as heavy as a dollop of whipped cream, and just as sweet. And that is true hypocrisy of the film as well: we're supposed to be condemning of government and the characters that put on the Hunger Games, and yet the film itself falls into the same category of glamorizing and diluting what should be portrayed as an atrocity. The action is stylized, the grit and violence is subdued, the CG-sheen is blinding, and the love plot is ham-fisted. The true meat of this story, the implications of such a horrific form of entertainment and the underlying themes of how it could've come to be, are almost swept completely under the rug.And don't get me wrong here. I'm not just condemning this movie because it wasn't what I thought it should've been. I love stylized action and I there's nothing wrong with an entertaining blockbuster. But the problem is this movie fails on that level as well. The action sequences are uninspired and just plain boring, which is probably a consequence of the fact that the movie never worked to make me emotionally invested. How can I possibly care about these kids fighting for their lives when 90% of them don't have more than four lines in the film and are portrayed as one-dimensional villains? To me, the majority of these characters were as expendable as they were to the citizens of the Capitol. They ended up feeling more like willing, eager participants than desperate, victimized innocents. The bottom line here is a movie that could've been a deep, provocative, disturbing look at human nature ending up being a shallow Hollywood affair that barely scratched the surface of the underlying themes of its source material. The movie simply felt as manufactured as the Hunger Games themselves, directly catering to the audience rather than challenging it. If you like your government-sponsored child death- matches sugarcoated and served with a large bag of buttery popcorn, by all means. If you're looking for a film willing to dig a little deeper, search elsewhere.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games is a televised death match that came about when thirteen districts rebelled against the Capitol. The absolute best way to describe a district to you would have to be saying that a district in this time frame is like what a state would be to the United States of America in our time frame. The Hunger Games came about when the districts lost and District 13 was destroyed. The punishment from the Capitol was to destroy District 13 and also every year host a televised death match. This death match consisted of pulling out 2 random names of children from the ages of twelve to eighteen. There would be two drawn out from each district. One of the tributes would be a boy and one would be a girl. There would be twenty-four total tributes drawn and they are immediately taken in the hands of the Capitol guards.In the 74th Hunger Games, Primrose Everdeen was drawn as tribute in District 12. Her sister, Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of the movie, volunteered as tribute for her. She is immediately taken into the hands of the Capitol moments after the boy, Peeta Mallark, was drawn as tribute. They are given a couple of minutes to say goodbye to their family and friends and then they are taken to the Capitol to prep for the Hunger Games.Let me get it off my chest that not one movie ever will ever do its book justice. This is because there is so much detail that goes into a book to make it make you see the scenes and play them out in your mind and movies show that for you. You don't have to think of the scenes they are right in front of you so your attention to detail will not be that great when watching the movie. Saying that I will say that this movie did do the book justice in the detail parts of let's say the cornucopia. This was one thing in my head that I could not wrap my mind around what it could look like and the movie showed that very well. If you don't know what the cornucopia is then it is the beginning of the hunger games where all of the supplies are stacked up and all twenty-four tributes are put into a circle around this pile of supplies. Every tribute is an equal distance away from the cornucopia.My absolute favorite part of the movie that matched up with the book had to have been when one tribute died. This very tribute had grown extremely close to Katniss and the death of this person threw Katniss through an emotional loop. Saying that she held somewhat of a funeral there in the arena and gave a sign to the district of the fallen tribute holding up three fingers. This later caused a fight to breakout in that district because everyone got on board to rebel against the capitol in that district. That being said, that sign from Katniss could have been the turning point in the whole series on the topic of rebelling because that is what caused it.One thing that I did not like with the movie that I know they could have done better and a lot of other reviews agree with my views is that it did not seem like the two tributes from district twelve were ""starving"" or fighting hunger like it said they were in the book. They both looked healthy as horses in the movie and that is just one of many small things that do not match up with the book.All and all I really do not have any bad things to say about the movie. This is because like I said before it is really hard to make a movie play out exactly how the book wants it to because there is so much detail that goes into a book. This is an overall great watch and if you do watch it, I strongly recommend reading all of the books that way when all of the movies come out you can compare them like I am doing so right now. Overall I give this movie a nine out of ten stars.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I must confess I found it an odd movie--a strange mix of Rollerball and Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, where teenagers from different parts of a futuristic fascist society win a lottery for the privilege of killing each other in a spectacle designed to maintain the social order. This might sound ridiculous, at least put this way, except that in my mind the movie works. It does not work for the reasons that everybody says it does--the awesome action, the ""brilliant"" dystopian premise (this is actually a cliché!), or the great marketing. I think it works because, if you have ever spent a fair amount of time with the modern teenager, you know that this movie really reveals something about the way that they perceive the world. Our society is dysfunctional (is it not?) in ways that especially hurt them, many kids have parents lacking in resources (yes?) or no parents at all to speak of, the privileged kids are sharpening their knives for the battle of winner take all, cliques form for the purpose of destroying you, etc. Furthermore, this perception is not just teenage angst--it is unique, truthful, often unseen by adults and revealed in this movie in a way that adults can digest it, if they take the trouble to take it seriously.The world of the Hunger Games movie is not realistic, it is not great literature, it probably does not measure up to its source novel or Battle Royale, the Japanese movie that everyone says it copies, but it is spot-on in depicting the modern world as viewed through the eyes of a teenager. In this movie, our teenagers get their revenge on us, showing us through the eyes of their mature- beyond-her-years hero Jennifer Lawrence exactly what our sick society is made of.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is not R rated, it is PG-13 rated and this film shows it and all of the violence is intense ad involves teens throughout the whole film.The acting is amazingly well-done. Jennifer Lawrence was good as Mystique in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS and she did a good job as Katniss Everdeen. Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta Mellark and he did really nice.

As I stated in the title, the use of shaky cam is so over the top in this movie at the beginning and during the games scenes that it almost made me sick (literally). It disgusts me how much Hollywood has gone to the shaky cam these days...IT DOES NOT ENHANCE THE MOVIE! Its almost amateurish since it replaced real cinematography. Why bother choreographing fight scenes that no one can tell what the heck is going on?One more thing, how does killing children only get a PG-13?","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The world is clearly defined, the politics and intrigues well positioned and the characters are introduced strongly in a way you understand and want to root for them.

My emotional level was kept high nearly the entire movie, it didn't seem to let up. In many ways, this is less an action/sci-fi movie than it is a compelling tragedy, and I cannot wait to get reading the books because I simply do not want to wait until the next movie to see what happens.We all know the premise - it's written in the IMDb summary; Katniss Primrose volunteers to take her younger sister's place after the younger sister is selected in a lottery to join the Hunger Games.Each district must supply a boy and a girl, aged 12 to 16, to compete, chosen by lottery in a spectacle aptly called ""the reaping."" Out of the 24, there is only one winner and death for the others. The districts are essentially all impoverished, with hunger being rampant; each district supplies the ""capitol"" with it's resources, but they are all kept on the verge of starvation. The ""winning"" district is supplied more food, thus ""the Hunger Games.""Like the spectacle of gladiators, the Hunger Games are the opiate of the masses in this dystopian future; more heinous considering kids as young as 12 are compelled to compete. The ""tributes,"" as they are called, are dressed up, paraded around the city, and interviewed one by one on what we would call TV in a macabre display as odds are calculated for each one for betting. Here we get to meet the tributes, learn which ones we like, which ones we don't, all the while knowing only one can live.The movie predictably moves on to the ""games"" themselves; very compelling and, after accepting the premise, very real. This movie doesn't do what the ""masses"" want it to do. I was on the verge of tears nearly the whole movie, and they weren't tears of joy. As a parent it may have affected me more than others. Still, by the end of the movie I was left wanting more, and so definitely am looking forward to the next installments, as well as reading them myself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The purpose is to remind the country of a rebellion 74 years ago. Each year, each district has to be represented by one randomly picked boy and girl from their district. That's the pervert concept of the capital of the country: ""Panem"" which is named ""capitol"". The whole science-fiction-film ""Hunger Games"" directed by Garry Ross, is based on the book written by Suzanne Collins. It tells the story about the main character Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) whose sister was elected for the deadly games. Because of that, Katniss volunteers instead of her sister. That's where the tragic story of Katniss having to fight in the arena begins. The two tributes, Katniss and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are accompanied by their mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and their contact person in the capitol Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks). The introduction of the characters is well done and also the actors can transfer their fears before and during the games. The peak of the movie is well installed and even though the films' length is about two and a half hour it doesn't get boring and keeps on making you want to know what's next. You can even watch it more than once and it doesn't get boring. It keeps on frightening, surprising you and makes you hope for the tributes and even want to help them. During the film and especially during the games there are a lot of violent scenes, even against children. It is questionable if the FSK 12 rating isn't too low but by reading the book you would have expected a lot more violence shown. All characters are well played, the carreers are as brave and frightening as they need to be, the normal tributes can make you identify with them and are piteous, the mentors are exactly like in the book and during the movie their very special individualities make sense and you'll get to like them; especially President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is like you would imagine him if you read the book. In summary it is a well action packed, moody and exciting movie with a complicated love story, for which the two and a half hours are worth sitting in the cinema (especially in 3d). I wouldn't recommend it to younger people because of the strong violence used, but if you have no problem seeing such things on TV then I can think of no reason why you shouldn't watch it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film, directed by Gary Ross, has a startling good cast with Jennifer Lawrence playing Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as the almost love interest, as well as Elizabeth Banks, as the Spectacular Effy Trinket (Style Icon of Capitol Couture) and Stanley Tucci as the fabulous talk show host, Caesar Flickerman. The whole cast has a certain chemistry that you can't help being swept up within the world of Panem.Enjoyable as a whole, The Hunger Games offers so much more then a glorified survivor film. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss embodies bravery, strength and the need to fight for what you believe in. She shows the importance of family and shows that even in the harshest situations there is a way for good to triumph evil. While I wouldn't recommend this movie for young kids because of the somewhat brutal killings, I would encourage all people to watch it and consider the comments it makes about our society today.Fans of the books will not be disappointed with the portrayal of Panem and will adore the sights of the Capitol and the wonder of the arena. From the ridiculous outfits of the Citizens with bright colors and fake eyelashes, to the amazing technology they have in the Game room with their 3d maps and touch screen abilities, you will wish you could be a part of Suzanne Collins' World.Perhaps the only let down of the movie was what they had to leave out. Although it runs for 142 minutes, it still feels rushed. This may add to the films adrenalin-pumping feel but at times you wish they would slow down and include your favorite book scene.So should you see it? Definitely yes. Regardless of whether you have read the book or not, it provides an entertaining escape into a world that isn't too far removed from ours, keeping you on the very edge of your seat. So may the odds be ever in your favor and enjoy the movie.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Normally, when my expectations are very high (as they were with this one), I tend to get disappointed. This film struck me with that rare instance of satisfaction. This knocks the first Harry Potter out of the water, and needless to say it tops Twilight by a million miles. I was actually a fan of the hand-held shots, even though most hated them. I thought they added a sense of realism. I will admit though, that the hand-held shots during the action sequences blurred out some stuff and made it hard to see what was going on, but I'm sure that was necessary to hold the PG-13 rating.Speaking of which, the film was actually quite violent for its rating. Yet, at the same time, it still could've been more violent. Not necessarily more gory, but I would've liked it to feel more gritty and raw. It didn't quite capture the intensity and peril from the book.Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both did FANTASTIC with their roles. Excellent acting from each. Donald Sutherland (Snow) was a wonder to watch as well. Elizabeth Banks (Effie) and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), also did a wonderful job, bring some comic relief at times. Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman) and Wes Bentley (Seneca) were also well acted. The rest however... let's just say their performances were average, and I wish some tributes had more screen time, damn it!My main complaint, though, is the sheer lack of character development. The reason why this film will probably only get an average rating of 6 out of 10, is because the people who haven't read the book will NOT connect with Gale, or Rue, or Katniss and Peeta's relationship. They won't have any idea what is going on, and they won't feel any sympathy for certain characters' deaths.But, all in all, this film and the next two (or three) are in good hands. Apart from a few minor things I would have liked to see get incorporated into the film, this is as close to perfect as a book adaptation gets.9/10","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

There is a lack of elements that make us care about any of the characters, bad acting from almost every actors (even Woody Harrelson).The movie can be divided in two parts - the first one is an ode to boredom - it takes almost one hour to present the odd world in which the characters live and the characters themselves. Once again, there is nothing really interesting about them both. The scenario is an alternative future where everyone is addicted to beauty and fashion - an interesting view of a possible and near future indeed - but the bad acting and the SLOW pace in this part of the movie made me want to have a remote control and skip it right to the game.Part two is the game. I must admit that when it finally began i almost had some hope that from that point on it would be a good experience. But unfortunately it goes back to the reign of boredom with full force. I almost felt asleep two times. I could care less for any of the characters that die or gets hurt, and the tasks that they perform are .In my opinion, this movie is some kind of rip-off from good movies such as Battle Royale and Brazil (for the scenario and weird people) used in a way that does not work at all. Hunger Games is one of those movies that i will forget in less than a month.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Great editing, flow, and buildup. Lots of cinematic feel in the filming that had just enough realism to make the movie's world believable. Great artwork and design of a dystopian society, down to lots of small details that really bring you into that world. It was also really great to see science fiction that does not have totally dumb camp moments. This movie gets a zero camp factor.

It was directed and co-written (with Collins and Billy Ray) by Gary Ross (who also wrote and directed such popular classics as 'PLEASANTVILLE' and 'SEABISCUIT'). The film stars Jennifer Lawrence, who rose to fame in 2010's 'WINTER'S BONE' in which, at age 20, she was the second youngest actress ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award! The movie is a very powerful and moving film going experience that is highlighted by Ross's masterful directing and Lawrence's outstanding performance! The film is a science fiction action drama film that tells the story of a dystopian post-apocalyptic future set in the world of Panem. Panem consists of 12 poor districts ruled by a wealthy city known as the Capitol. The masses once attempted to rebel against the Capitol but failed and as punishment are now subject to 'The Hunger Games', a reality TV series broadcast for the public to watch in which a boy and girl (between the ages of 12 and 18) are selected from each district every year to fight to the death in a bloody arena. This first chapter (in a trilogy) revolves around Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence), a sixteen year old who volunteers to participate in the game in order to save her twelve-year-old sister (Willow Shields) from having to. She's joined by Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who's selected as the male participant, from their district.Most young adult novel adaptations are poorly made films (the biggest example being 'THE TWILIGHT SAGA') and it's because they usually come from crappy books. 'THE HUNGER GAMES' is one exception that is widely seen as a very well written book series (another being the 'HARRY POTTER' books) and this first film adaptation is probably the best youth book movie yet! It's extremely dark and violent for a teen movie and I actually think it should have been rated R rather than PG-13; the themes and subject matter are pretty intense and disturbing but that's also why I think so highly of it. It's a very effective and nightmarish film going experience. Shocking, tragic and heartfelt (I cried multiple times while watching it).Lawrence is gorgeous and about as strong a role model for young people as you could ask for. She's everything I would want in a woman as well. She gives an award worthy performance and really powers the film into masterpiece territory.

I know it wasn't made by a major studio but couldn't Lionsgate afford tripods? Why were so many shots intentionally out of focus?!? The shaking-camera routine wasn't saved by the story, which was anti-climatic overall. The whole middle portion had me checking my watch. There just wasn't any compelling action or suspense - at all.And further not helping was the bland kid actors used, who weren't given any favors by the writers by being such under written characters that I couldn't care less if they all died, and the sooner the better.The only redeeming things in the whole movie are Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson but even then, their characters are only noteworthy because the rest of the film was so forgettable.Throughout I was constantly reminded of other, better films like First Blood, The Running Man and The Truman Show.Meh indeed!","33 out of 71 found this helpful.

Most stories, for instance, The Lightning Thief, were very well written but once the movie came into play, it was incredibly rushed and done very poorly, skipping many crucial details.With The Hunger Games, the book and movie were practically identical. The details that were in the book were portrayed in the movie almost exactly how I had pictured them to be when I had first read the book.However one thing that had disappointed me in the movie, was some of the acting. Jennifer Lawrence's acting was spot on, just how Katniss was portrayed in the book. But one big character, that I wish was in the spotlight more and had acted more like himself, was Woody Harrelson (Haymitch). In most of the book, Haymitch was a crazy alcoholic that didn't really care about being their to mentor Peeta and Katniss, but instead, just for the alcohol. The only time I saw the real Haymitch was when they were riding the train to the Capitol. Other than that, he looked like a normal human would, and I was disappointed by that.Overall, this movie was good, and I definitely recommend seeing it. Especially if you read the books.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Very faithful adaptation actually supplements the book.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2834922/?ref_=tt_urv","freeist","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20886638/?ref_=tt_urv","19 July 2013","""The Hunger Games"" seemed a natural book for a movie. Written by Suzanne Collins, the book was already cinematic. Still, Hollywood is full of egos trying to one-up each other in creativity, and this usually spells doom for book adaptations.Fortunately, director and screen writer Gary Ross was wise not to tamper with the book's winning formula. The plot: a female teen protagonist, Katniss Everdene (Jennifer Lawrence) living in an impoverished dystopia is forced to participate in an annual gladiatorial games against twenty-three other teens. It had vivid characters from Katniss on down, her ally, Peeta, their mentor, the disturbed but sympathetic Hamish and all the other characters minor and major. It had great action, it had depth, and had social commentary with the contestants having to gain sponsors while murdering each other on camera. The plot, the characters, are almost exactly what you find them in Collin's work. If you hadn't read it, you can pick up the story fresh from the movie and miss almost nothing.Nevertheless, the movie isn't limited, as the book is, to Katniss' first person account. Ross takes advantage of this and shows you what's happening out of the Katniss' sight. All of his additions improve the story and give it a wider scope. You could vividly see this society operating around Katniss, and it is one of the best futuristic depictions I've seen since Blade Runner.I did have a few small quibbles with it. The film started out a little too weepy.I thought of Katniss as more stoical and I don't remember the beginning being so wet. The movie needed make the audience like her as soon as possible, I guess, but it really does lessen the impact of the tears later on, when the character does have a real tragedy to cry about.My other quibble was with President Snow (Donald Sutherland). There was nothing wrong with Sutherland's performance, but his character seemed more like Colonel Sanders than Josef Stalin. People didn't respond to him with the restrained terror that would have sent the message about him home.I disagreed with those creative decisions, though it's probably only my preference. However, I highly recommend this movie. It's a rarity: well conceived and thoughtful action adventure.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Far above its YA fiction competitors, Hunger Games is a strong start to a much anticipated trilogy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3137685/?ref_=tt_urv","williampsamuel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56938771/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2014","I should begin by saying I have never read any of the Hunger Games books, and given the number of other books that I'm currently required to read, I don't know if I will for quite a while. But after watching the first film adaptation, I very much want to, because they always say the book is better than the movie, and it would have to be a very good book to be better than this.The story, which is surely familiar to most Americans of a certain age, is that in a distant future the people of North America rebelled against their government. The revolt was suppressed, and decades later the rebellious states, or districts, are governed as impoverished police states while the chosen few in the capitol enjoy every modern luxury. And to further punish rebellion and instill fear, every year each district must offer up one young man and one young woman as 'tributes' for the Hunger Games; a latter day gladiatorial competition that is also the entertainment event of the year throughout the land.Most of these 'tributes' are chosen by lottery. Others volunteer, either because they've been trained for it from an early age, or so that someone close to them won't have to. Katniss Everdeen is one of the latter. She volunteered to enter the competition after her much younger sister was chosen. As an older teen and experienced hunter, she'll have better chances than most, but the odds are certainly not ""Ever in her favor."" Her male counterpart is Peeta, a local boy who is roughly the same age but has only a fraction of her skills. If they win they'll be treated as heroes. If they die, they're just two more victims.This movie is extremely violent for a film based on a youth novel. But the violence is anything but casual or gratuitous. It stops well short of being as brutal as it could be; this is after all a PG-13 movie. But neither is it something that happens and is quickly passed over, nor are the deaths of Katniss and Peeta's rivals cause for celebration. Because really there are no 'bad guys', or at least they're not the ones fighting. The young people in the games, even the most ruthless and seemingly callous, are fighting and killing because they have to. They're not fighting to win a war, or for riches, or out of hatred for the other contestants. They're fighting because a tyrannical government makes them, and if they don't kill they will die.Consequently many of the fight scenes are less like the Matrix or Lord of the Rings than Fight Club. They aren't stunningly choreographed showdowns between skilled combatants, but desperate, uncoordinated struggles between frightened, semi-trained youngsters who would rather be anywhere else. Some encounters are over in an instant; with Katniss's bow finding its mark just before her opponent can do likewise. Other fights are extremely physical, as combatants frantically grapple and strike untrained blows at each other like wild animals, driven by adrenaline and instinct to outlive their opponent.Either way it is traumatic and tragic. Every time someone dies a family is losing their child, and every time Katniss kills she knows that she could just as easily been the one who died. In the Hunger Games victory means simply being alive, and knowing you had to do terrible things to stay that way. Katniss and Peeta's outcome was the best they could possibly have hoped for, but it's still no happy ending.Besides the cruelty inherent in the games, what's striking is that for everyone in the capitol this is all a great show. The games aren't just a warning for the outlying districts; they are a grand spectacle on the scale of the Olympics or an awards show. Garishly dressed crowds cheer as the contestants are paraded before them. Top journalists interview the tributes on live TV. 'Sponsors' pay to make a limited number of airdrops to their favorite contestants. There's as much pomp and pageantry surrounding the games as a royal coronation.And Katniss and the others have to play along, giving the correct responses, dressing the right way, doing everything they can to make the crowds love them and the government not view them as a problem, because the entire time they're on stage and the world is closely watching. We the viewers are also watching. The difference is that we know this is fiction and no one is really getting hurt, and even so we view the competition not glorious spectacle but as the cruelest of tragedies. Yet you have to wonder, if these were real people, if they were really dying, how many of us would still watch?","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I only rate it a 9 out of 10 due to some clear storyline stealing from other books and films, but altogether I think this is a movie that clearly stands tall in a sea of remakes, already dones, and uninspiring performances.Now there are some stolen aspects that I did notice. It steals a political plot very close to that of the Orwellian 1984, a bit of the Wizard of Oz's Emerald city, and even a little Sheakspearean Romeo and Juliet thrown into the mix, but all told not too bad Let's face it, if you are going to take inspiration from others, those are not bad ones to use. My only real negative is that I wish it was a little longer and maybe a little more back story on how we got to this point in the authors created world, but knowing Hollywood we will probably see many sequels and or prequals because the movie business likes to ride the money horse until it is dead tenfold. I only hope they don't do that to this movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

You know how you can kind of tell whether or not the movie is going to be any good in the first few minutes, and you are usually right. Well, that was this movie, and it didn't look promising and it wasn't.First, the movie was way too long. They took a lot of time to do nothing.Second, I could not stand all of the camera shaking. It started to give me a head ache. Luckily, it seemed like it was only during the first third of the movie (maybe they switched cinematographers after the beginning?). It was a lot like when your kids take the camera and forget that it's on while they are walking around.The fight scenes were mostly lame and the camera angles were clearly uncreative (not there there had to be great fight scenes, but you would have thought with all of the time they used on screen they would have done something with the time!).Character development was nill. Only the main character was developed and I didn't really care for any of the others since they were completely unknown to me.I would not even watch this movie again if it came out on DVD. To me it was a completed waste of the afternoon and my $8.I thought that the actor's performances were great, but there was just nothing there to pull the viewer in to get them involved in the story. I also really didn't get why they were having to compete in this game (I guess that you had to read the book and already be familiar with the subject) and it seemed like I had already been through this type of scenario before.","22 out of 45 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Review and Analysis: ""Hey Katniss, how about that kiss?""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2639780/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmGamer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34911714/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2012","Bias: Having read the book a year ago, I am more likely to fill in plot holes and character development mentally.When this movie was announced I expected it to be down the line studio filmmaking at its most mediocre like many lesser book adaptations, but came out quite impressed with how the film turned out. This movie stands on its own so you don't get any of that ""Well it makes sense if you've read the book"". As far as the adaptation goes this movie maintains every major plot point from the book without much change. The movie is limited by its format running time pushing everything in at a faster than preferred pace, but takes advantage of the third person narrative showing a few welcome and crucial scenes. Reactions outside the arena from the nation's districts, Katniss' hometown, and one on one's between Head Game Maker Seneca Crane and President Snow offer better and less obvious character development than the book.21 Year-Old and Rather Attractive Oscar Nominee Jennifer Lawrence as 16 Year-Old Katniss Everdeen The acting in the film is strong all across the board. Obviously the major role of Katniss Everdeen carries the film and Jennifer Lawrence who though seems just a tiny bit too old to play sixteen humanizes the strong female protagonist very well. Small roles like Effie Trinkett, Cinna, Haymitch and Gale (a major character later in the series) are played really well and put to good use. Though my favourite had to be Stanley Tucci in the fun role of Caesar Flickerman. I thought Game Maker Seneca Crane is set up better here as the main antagonist than in the book and looks cool. Josh Hutcherson (who like Lawrence is also a fan of the series) is the only one I would have a complaint about, as he is less charming here than depicted in the book (""Hey Katniss, how about that kiss?""). My guess is that he either played to his limitations, was cut from much of the film, or it was decided he was to be taken more seriously as a love interest, but this might make him lack as a strong alternative later in the series. Which could get interesting.Minor criticisms I would make are that the adaptation should have been even more bold venturing outside its faithful route (The character of Foxface though necessary in the novel is a fun distraction that doesn't add a whole lot to the film). The climax of the film lacks a truly strong payoff that the book had but also trades that in for planting the seeds for a series. There is nothing truly remarkable or stand out about this film that led me to think much about it afterwards, other than the fan fervor of counting the proceeds of its success. Many complaints of the film stem from the use of shaky cam. Though the film could use more wide shots, as it is beautifully filmed, I find it actually adds to the frenetic pacing of being in the arena, and is not as annoying or overused as in other such films as ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". It also should be known that this was one of the tactics employed by the producers to cut the film for a PG-13 rating, both to exercise more money and stay true to the authour's request. The rating is really played to the edge as it is still very bloody so I actually applaud the studio for maintaining the books vision as well as being consistent and not limited by its rating.In my opinion I thought the themes left unexplored in the novel aside from; Personal Independence and Satirization of the Media especially Reality Television, were hinted at but unused to their full extent, which would highly elevate the material. This includes comparisons to the Holy Roman Empire and French Revolution, Poverty, Class Warfare, Governnent Oppression, ""Big Brother"" a la George Orwell (though that's pretty overdone nowadays). The bright side is that there is plenty of this to play around with in the series' future.Bottom line This is a very strong solid film with great execution that is worth seeing in theatres, and deserves the praise its getting. The groundwork is strong for a series and it overall is a very good time. It's just not the R-rated magnum opus I would have it be having taken more risks.Ridiculous comparisons: Better than ""John Carter"", ""X-Men"", ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" and ""Mission: Impossible III"". On par with ""21 Jump Street"", ""50/50"", ""Inception"" and ""Spider-Man"". Not as good as ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"", ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", or ""Batman Begins"".","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was released in 2011, but now it's the norm that every year there are several attempts at starting a new franchise. Some are successful and some are not successful. Of course these films are aimed mostly at a teenage audience. One of the most popular franchises has been The Hunger Games by Lionsgate Films. The studio managed to pile up $78 million for this first film, which was released in March of 2012. The budget isn't very large but the filmmakers managed to make a good film. At the box office the earnings amounted to an impressive $691 million. One of the reasons for the success was the casting of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. Chloe Moretz was supposed to get the part but she failed her auditions. Director Gary Ross said that he was most impressed with Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence isn't the perfect fit for Katniss physically. Katniss is supposed to be shorter, thinner and have olive skin. Still, Lawrence has the good looks and the acting skills to make up for that. Her facial expressions capture Katniss' feelings without going over the top. She's especially good when it comes to the most important scenes. One example is when she grieves for Rue. Amandla Stenberg had to be persistent to get the part of Rue. Good thing she did because her scenes with Lawrence are some of the best in the film. Rue and Katniss talking in a sunlit forest was handled especially well by Gary Ross. The only real downside to Ross' direction is a lack of thrilling action. Was this due to the budget constraints? Or was this due to the attempt to maintain a PG-13 rating? Suzanne Collins' novel includes some sinister and violent parts that weren't in the film. In the excellent supporting cast Stanley Tucci's turn as Caesar Flickerman is especially memorable. Tucci is simply terrific. Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson do a good job as Effie and Haymitch. Banks is most memorable during the Reaping scene. Josh Hutcherson, however, is rather bland as Peeta Mellark. Once Katniss and Peeta get on the train headed for the Capitol, Hutcherson mostly fails to provide his character with the necessary emotions. He does a better job in the second film though. James Newton Howard's music score for the film is admirably restrained. He doesn't fill it with intensity but provides a bittersweet elegiac experience. The end credits feature the sad lullaby Safe & Sound by Taylor Swift, who sings it with a reassuring warmth. Suzanne Collins was, of course, inspired by Greek and Roman history. The Capitol is like a futuristic Rome. The Hunger Games arena is like a futuristic colosseum. Slavery was a major institution in Greece and Rome, so it's not surprising that gladiators fought to the death in Classical society as entertainment and spectacle. In the Hunger Games tributes from each district fight to the death, and Katniss is a defiant teenage gladiator who challenges the power of the authoritarian Capitol. Despite the shortage of thrills the film provides viewers with a well-realized world, with its unique clothes, architecture and rules. It's a good beginning for a franchise. I recommend it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

My 12 year old said she thought it was OK but that it was slow. For me, it is one of the worst movies of my lifetime. The plot is weak. The storyline develops into a very slow climax. The film set is boring with very weak lighting. The camera is shaky to the extent that it can make you dizzy - a similar feeling to that when you take a ride on a bus that takes winding roads up and down a hillside. The female lead (Jennifer Lawrence) has acted well, though. For the first and last time, we got drawn into seeing the movie based on the marketing and hype that built up into a crescendo. I would not recommend seeing this movie in a theatre. Wait for the DVD copy or for the movie to be shown on TV maybe 6 months or a year down the line.","46 out of 105 found this helpful.

""The Hunger Games"" was a well-funded movie, they spent tons of time and money working on this movie. ""The Hunger Games"" is based off of a book written by Suzanne Collins. ""The Hunger Games"" is just the first book in is series, there will be more movies coming later on.""The Hunger Games"" is based off a book and was written by Suzanne Collins and was sold to millions. It became a top seller, Suzanne Collins also wrote many other books such as, ""Gregor the Overlander"", and Fire Proof. Suzanne Collins made about $12 million off of the hunger games alone. She also helped in making ""The Hunger Games"" movie, so the movie was more accurate to the books than if the author wasn't helping. The director chose good actors to play in ""The Hunger Games."" They chose Jennifer Laurence for the main character, Katniss. They also chose Josh Hutcherson to be Peeta Mellark. They both have played in other movies, so they have the experience being in movies.There are more movies to come, for those who loved ""The Hunger Games."" Since Suzanne Collins wrote two more books called, ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mocking Jay."" Those two other books are going to come out a movies later on. ""The Hunger Games"" made about $155 million, so the next movies are destined to make that much, or even more.Some people say that you have to read the book to make the movie seem good but, the movie stood out on its own. I read the book, and there were some differences between the book and the movie, but you don't have to read the book to make the movie good.Did you think the movie was good, well funded, and had good actors? If you watch the movie before you read the book, you should read the book after so you can get into the rest of the series. In the future, when the rest of the movies come out, they probably will make over $1 billion dollars, looking at how much money they made in ""The Hunger Games.""","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Hunger Games, what can i say. I went into this movie expecting nothing, even after reading a couple of bad reviews AND good reviews. I went in thinking nothing. First Impression: The movie had a really slow kick start... thats even if it had a kick start.. I know the director was probably trying to portray the sadness and poverty in the districts with the slow music, but it wasn't the music that got to me. Coming from a person who did not read the books (me) i found myself quite lost in the story. But i did some pre-reading before watching so I had already known what the storyline was. HYPE!!: I kept waiting.... and waiting .... and waiting... for the action to kick in, for the action to explode into awesome action sequences!!. I was waiting for the music to LIFT!! To pick up the PACE!! but sadly.... it never came... It continued on from a sad poverty story... to a sad sympathetic story... to a sad Love Story.. It wasn't all sad to say the least. There were action scene's, some well constructed ones. But for a movie that advertised itself so much, it failed to live up to the hype. Project X offered more action sequences than this did. At least it offered the other kind of ""action"" ... anyways. Scenes that were meant to be romantic/sad ??? I don't know... whatever the scene was trying to convey it definitely wasn't suppose to be funny, cause I laughed and laughed at these scenes. Special effects weren't great either. Overall rating: 1 Star is given for the action, 1 Star is given out of my pocket for generosity. Thats my review, the Opinion of a Random Guy in the crowd, who at ice cream, pop corn and drank coke while trying to enjoy the movie. Hope you enjoy the movie, I really do. =)","41 out of 93 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence was by far the best actress in the movie, I thought she was a great person to play a young girl, like Katniss Everdeen. She looked amazing in the movie, she was just so beautiful and I thought the fire dress really showed her true beauty, really nice. This is in my top 50 movies of all time it was just outstanding, and it makes me want to go see Catching Fire which looks ever better than the 1st. The main story is about teenagers from the 12 districts of Panem have to go into a massive arena and fight to the death, and well, the last man standing wins. I can not express enough about how good this movie was... amazing!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I hadn't heard of this series until I started seeing previews a few months ago, and then read the first two books a week before the movie came out at the urging of my boss. I really enjoyed the books not only because of the tension filled action-y bits, but also because of the political background about a repressed people.However, I was building up the movie in my mind at how good it could be that I was getting afraid it would let me down. I got to the theater with only 32 tickets left, my friends a few places in line behind me, and grabbed a free poster from the dwindling pile next to the register. I even was interviewed by the local paper about seeing the movie. But the apprehension was still there. By the time the movie ended, it was all gone. This movie captures the feel of the book wonderfully. It has the usual variations that book-to-movie films always do, but those usually don't bother me. The movie version of The Hunger Games captures the feel of a girl thrust into a much bigger world than the one she knows and then is dropped into a deadly game in which she does everything she can just to survive. Some people will say the movie isn't gory enough compared to the books, or that there isn't enough action, or that it is just a retelling of this movie or that movie. The Hunger Games melds two stories together; one about a girl's will to do what it takes to survive in a deadly environment, and two, the political movings of a society where she is just a piece of a much larger game. I think the aspect of the movie that struck me the most was how it strikes the audience visually and audibly without overwhelming you. The score was woven in to bring out the emotions of some scenes, and help hold them back in others. The movie looks great too. The actors give genuine performances that capture the essence of their characters. This movie is a must see for fantasy-story lovers anywhere. It is forward enough to hold teenagers attention and deep enough to engage those that are a little bit older. It leaves you invested in the characters and yearning to know what is coming next. Back to book three for me....","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was terrified that the movie would be nothing like the book at all and that it would make me hate the series.However, those fears turned out to be completely untrue. The adaptation was brilliantly done, and as any savvy reader can tell you, you can't expect everything in the books to end up on screen. I think Debra Zane(the person in charge of casting) made a very good choice in choosing Jennifer Lawrence to play Katniss. Not only can she act, she also got her characters emotions clearly portrayed without being mumbly or twitchy (Kristen Stewart, anyone?). I do believe that Jennifer Lawrence will be able to carry out the emotions, downfalls, and mood of Katniss in the next three movies.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But if the book was released after battle Royal, it would be like me writing Jurassic park and then releasing a film of it?! In theory they could have made this a great film, but they chose to leave out any kind of violence. I am really interested to see if the book is also just the same as Battle Royale.

It was awesome, it was like reading the book really, the same feeling of wanting to put the book down at points where it's still relatively well for the characters but also really really wanting to know how it continues! There were some things I was disappointed about, some things they didn't include in the movie, but they were all left out for a reason and you know that, had they included them it would have downgraded the movie. The acting was incredible, what some actors lacked in looks (in my opinion, some didn't look like they did in my head while reading the book) they certainly made up for it in their performance. From the little kids like Willow Shields and Amandla Stenberg to Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson to Donald Sutherland, everyone acted so convincingly, I was brought to tears in the first few minutes. The only thing that slightly bothered me was the really weird looking Cornucopia, but really, that's such a small thing and easily forgiven :)Yeah, I'd give it an 8.5, but since I can only give whole stars, I'm going to round it off upwards, because it's completely blown my mind. I'm such a fan of the books and I was really worried it wouldn't be like I would've liked it to be and if you're worried about the same thing, don't be; it's not a copy of the book, it's not better than the book, but it's as good as the book -which is really saying something. Go watch it! :D","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But in this case, I make an exception. A 10-star movie, to me, is a movie that keeps wandering in my mind weeks after I've seen it, that I can keep watching over and over and never get tired of, that really touches me emotionally and introduces timeless and meaningfull themes and issues.I seriously suspect a lot of people hate this movie simply because teenage girls love it too. But I can assure you I am no teenage girl, I have read the entire trilogy and loved it and my parents (who are not at all fans of the fantasy and sci-fi genre) loved this movie too! There is nothing wrong with being honest about what you feel and this movie blew me away. Not only is Suzanne Collins a brilliant writer who came up with a wonderful story, it's clear she was one of the script writers herself. If there is a point of criticism I respect, it is people complaining about the shaky cam literally making them nauseous. However, I don't have motion sickness and understand the choice to use it. I think it's an addition to the way they tell the story on screen. It makes you sympathise more with Katniss and translates the very personal and subjective ""present tense first person narrator"" writing style to images that make you feel just as disturbed and scared and ""what-the-hell-is-going-on"" as the main character.I don't mind the fact that they made the story a bit less harsh for the movie. It's still wonderfully touching but I think it's great that they make it more accessible to a younger audience as this is a story everyone should read and as not everybody likes to read it's great they adapted it to a medium that reaches more people from different ages. I was relieved Haymitch was not the puking bastard he was in the book. It made him a more round character.The casting and acting in this movie is brilliant. I became an instant fan of Jennifer Lawrence and would see every movie that casts her from now on, even if the genre does not appeal to me at all, just out of admiration and curiosity about how she will make a character come to life this time. She does not play Katniss, she IS Katniss. The same goes for a lot of the other actors. I love Wes Bentley as Seneca for example. He reminded me a lot of one of my former employers who was an often not so black-and-white wolf in sheep's clothing with charming good looks who made you wonder about his real intentions and personality a lot.This movie really made me 'feel' the danger in the woods and the threat of the other contestants, 'feeling' really unsure and suspicious about their intentions, not knowing who to trust...I am convinced that emotions and feelings are very much underrated when it comes to reviews. It's like what you feel during a movie is completely inferior to the amount of grey and grumpy grown-up issues (that are popular at the moment) you can find in the story. It's like all reviewers are these ""Yuk, feelings are gay""-types nowadays. I'm not saying I can't enjoy a good action movie and that I need my hanky with me every time I watch a movie but when a movie gets me emotional at the end, gets me to CARE about what happens even after I've seen it scores of times, it's really good in my opinion. And just because a lot of girls in puberty will agree with me doesn't make my opinion less valuable. Puberty is after all a very emotional period in people's lives. ;-)This movie has a heart and more movies could use this nowadays. It shows the harshness of a world that (frankly) isn't that far-fetched if you have a good look at our current society. And I'm relieved that even amongst the most superficial teenagers, there are girls who love this cause that means there is still hope. It's a story about responsibility, courage and being a rebel against the main stream that is obviously not always right, having the guts to stand up to it! What's the point in blindly loving all those movies with hard political messages that are rated R and have a lot of 'realistic' and 'mature' violence if they only make you depressed and if they don't 'touch' you? What happened to art as a way of reaching people and making them have more fun than they could have watching the news channel. It's not because this movie is not about slavery or nine eleven or the civil war or any other horrible historic event or plain nihilism and because it is loved by teenage girls, that it is a bad movie. I hated most of the Twilight films but it doesn't mean I will brainlessly hate all movies loved by teenagers from now on.I think people saying this movie 'misses the point of the book' don't get the point themselves. What is 'the point' to begin with? There are several! I believe the essence of the story is contained in the movie. Maybe people automatically think it's 'intelligent' if you prefer the book over the film and forget Suzanne Collins actually helped writing the script. I bet she knows best what 'the point of the book' is and she watched the writing process carefully to make sure nothing important was lost. Also, I read the movie is a 'non-violent' 'dumbed down ' version of the book? What does that mean? That preferring violence is more intelligent? Just don't care about those pseudo-intellectual critics, don't you dare to consider this adaptation a 'guilty pleasure' and enjoy this wonderful movie as it is. I'm so looking forward to the sequels!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It wouldn't be something i'd voluntarily chose to see, cause i don't like the 'genre'. I have been wondering for decades now when the moral boundary will be taken and the imaginative praising of violence will become real. Maybe it has already with embedded journalists, appointed victims from the Dark House, (home made) video's with the most gruesome content leaping out of every laptop, etc. I try not to seek this part of civilization, being too aware it's there.The first half our of the movie is bad. There is no character building and i was lost several times, having to ask my daughter what it was about. I guess they expect we all read the book first.After that i sort of understood what was happening and it got predictable (i always amaze my daughter, telling her what comes next). There are some reality flaws in it, the purple fashion thing doesn't work and to be honest, if you make a movie like this, please don't mix in some very predictable romance angle, while you should have emphasized on the lust and decadence of the first district. So, story as it is told, not good. (One can hope the book is better)Acting was OK and i was totally surprised to find Donald Sutherland in it. Dude, really, you couldn't get anything better? Woody Harrelson, nice, but i feel he didn't get enough lines to lift the piece to something good. Maybe a lot was cut out, i don't know, but even he wasn't able to get to build a character.Action scenes and video stunt-work blabla, nothing new or exiting.Futuristic thingies, non existent.I won't be looking at part 2, 3, 4 and whatever else they fantasize after this.

The Acting and the look if the film was excellent especially Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson as Katniss and Peeta.The violence,although very much toned down via the slightly blurred shaky cam fight scenes it was realistic enough for the viewer to take it seriously and not in an Arnie Swartzy way. Also the arena Special effects were very well done, but never over done so please TAKE NOTE Micheal BAY and JAMES CAMERON. If i had one minor complaint,it would be that some of the much need humour regarding Haymitch, Effie and Cinna team of Helpers seems to have possibly left on the cutting room floor.Finally some people have complained that The Hunger Games is not as true to the books as it could have been. But I wish to remind these people that neither was HARRY POTTER,JAWS,THE WOMAN IN BLACK or even THE RUNNING MAN of which the novel in emotion bares more of a resemblance to the Hunger Games than Japans Battle Royal.All in all The Hunger Games wasn't perfect but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I read multiple good reviews about this being decent and was actually optimistic about seeing this.. And we didn't even get an actual movie? What did I even just watch? I really don't even know, a bunch of random guys off the street with a lightsaber, a cgi demon leader, a bunch of explosions, and a bunch of flying.There was no plot..There was no dialogue..There was no character development..There was no explanation of the plagiarsm..Just random random random.The whole movie went 0 miles per hour, I truthfully have never seen a movie so rushed and yet slow paced in a long time.This movie I cannot believe isn't getting torn apart by BR fans. I think fanboys are just way too devastated to accept/admit The Hunger Games was no less disappointing than the official sequels and there may never be another true BATTLE ROYALE continuance to the original masterpiece.The only thing the movie had going was the old cast gave you nostalgia and Shuya is now a female Mary Sue type. I liked how it ended for its cinematography, would have much more liked it if they just had that in the middle so they might have actually had a story or plot to go off of. There was like no character back stories or development.It honestly looked and felt like a Battle Royale parody at times.People meet each other in this movie and instantly, without knowing about anything of each other, are willing to die for each other and make their life goal about this random person.I can't say enough bad about this over-hyped movie. If it weren't for the Battle Royale connection.. I would have bood when the credits rolled.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence played the role of Katniss Everdeen to perfection,displaying that perfect blend of anger,hurt and love.the other actors did justice to their parts as well,but Jennifer Lawrence as usual stole the show.on a grade of 1 to 10 i'll give her an 11.this is one of the few movies who remain true to their novels...for me this movie was brilliant in all aspects be it direction,acting or whatever... To all those who haven't watched it yet-you can't afford to miss this one people.P.S To all those nutbags who r busy comparing this movie to Twilight- please stop making fun of your own self and also stop wasting other people's time because unlike you they have better things to do than to watch shitty movies or read books like TWILIGHT!!!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Date: Mar 23, 2012In my opinion, this was one of the best film adaptations for a novel I've ever seen. Did they leave some things out? Of course they did, but we can't all sit through a four hour movie. Most of us have what some refer to as a ""life."" Before venturing from your parent's basement, remember that, while Frodo's encounter with Tom Bombadil was fairly interesting to read, day-long movies just haven't caught on yet. If you think you're going to see your favorite novel on the big screen in all of its glorious entirety, better just stay home and inventory your action figure collection.The minor details they left out detracted from the story hardly at all. Instead of focusing on the mundane, as the Twilight adaptations were want to do, they centered more on the important things like the hardships of those living in poor districts, making it all seem so real. At the start of the actual Hunger Games the plot began to move much more rapidly, but overall, it was very well done. Recommend!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Also some of the scenes are resembling other movies and books. For example the scene in the end where Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark decide to die together like Romeo and Julieta because their love is impossible.Moreover for action the movie is to slow and the hesitation in it can kill you. Some of the romantic scene are very trivial and are exactly for teenagers. So if you don't like Twilight don't watch this movie.In the other hand the movie is based on a novel so I have to read first the books and then give more accurate rating. But what I had read about the adaptation of the book is that is not successful and the directors didn't succeed to create the atmosphere of the book.I am giving credit to the idea of the book because I think that these districts are representing our society and how certain people are enjoying the pain of others and for them their life's are just a game.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Not since Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings has there been a movie that's as exciting and thrilling as its source material.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2585176/?ref_=tt_urv","terrellrobinson71","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22782552/?ref_=tt_urv","23 March 2012","I just came from a midnight screening of the much-anticipated film adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games"". Now, like you, I have read all three books of the Hunger Games series and I was just as obsessed by it as you were. Now that the movie has just came out, let me tell you, it is a very intense and moving movie experience. As the film begins, we meet Katniss Everdeen (perfectly played by Jennifer Lawrence), a 16-year-old girl who lives in District 12, the poorest futuristic district of a divided country known as Panem. A skilled hunter and a everyday family-woman who takes care of her mother and her 12-year-old sister, Prim (Willow Shields) and has a friend in Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth from ""The Last Song""), another hunter. Her precious life changes from good to bad when her sister is sent to participate in a fight to the death of 24 tributes (12 boys, 12 girls; ages 12-18) known as ""The Hunger Games"". In an act of sacrifice and courage, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Joining her on this journey is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), a baker who did a kindness to Katniss when they were young. As the games start to heat up, Katniss and Peeta knows that it's just a matter of time until they have to prepare for the fight for survival. When the Games do begin, it's brutal, intense, and it's also very chilling and devastating. ""The Hunger Games"", directed by Gary Ross (who co-wrote the screenplay with the author Collins and Billy Ray), is as exciting and thrilling as any fan would expect it to be. Some people are calling it ""the next Twilight"", but ""Twilight"" has nothing on Katniss Everdeen, who may be the girl on fire, but a real 21st-century heroine. The performances are incredible, 21-year-old Lawrence is already on fire, thanks to her Oscar-nominated performance in ""Winter's Bone"". She basically own this movie and you can't imagine anyone else playing Katniss but Lawrence. Hutcherson provides the heart and soul and captures that as Peeta. Hemsworth may not have much to do playing Gale, but he does have a terrific screen presence to play with in the next movies. Then you have a very unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks playing Effie Trinket, who is the PR of the Capitol, Lenny Kravitz as the stylist Cinna, Donald Sutherland as the wickedly ruthless President Coriolanus Snow, Stanley Tucci as the Ryan Seacrest-reject Caesar Flickerman, and Amandla Stenberg who is very heartwarming as Rue and has a scene that is extremely heartbreaking and emotional. Even Woody Harrelson deserves some credit for making Haymitch, a down-on-his-luck drunk turned mentor, a pretty cool wiseguy. I sat with an huge audience and for 142 minutes, our eyes were engaged to the screen. Having put some differences from the book aside and using elements of ""Battle Royale"", ""1984"", ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Running Man"" to keep us chilled out, ""The Hunger Games"" is a amazing film that knows how to stay true to the book and to entertain us and wrap us with its presence. Go ahead, people. Believe the hype. Note: ""The Hunger Games"" is rated PG-13 (and for good reason) for the brutally intense violence and disturbing moments that takes place during The Hunger Games. If you have brave 12-year-olds and teenagers who read the books, good for them. Non-fans can get hooked into this film as well and they'll enjoy it, too. In the meantime, I can't wait for ""Catching Fire"" and I certainly hope the odds be ever in your favor.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I took my dad to see this film because I read the book and figured it would have pretty good action and enough intensity to keep me fascinated. Unfortunately, my dad dosed off towards the end of the movie and the parts he was awake he was still bored. I couldn't really complain since at some sections of the movie I was more interested in looking at the bored people around me (who seemed to wish -- much like my father and I -- they were watching Chronicle that was showing next door). Don't get me wrong, the movie had some good parts, it's just that they seemed to be overshadowed by the more lackluster ones. I read the books, and yes I know what you're thinking -- another teen aged girl who compared the book to the movie. I can't say I didn't because that would be a lie, but I can say that the only thing I really remember about the book is that some kids go into some stadium-like thing and battle against each other to live a better life with their family in the Capital and away from their more poverty-like homes...or something like that. My point is, I barely remembered what happened, but I did remember that it was a pretty good book. When I heard the reviews from critics they said that it was AMAZING so I figured it would be alright. User reviews on IMDb begged to differ, but I chose to ignore them because I was dead set on enjoying this movie. Sadly, I should have listened to them and saved $10. Maybe the movie just wasn't for me. I guess if there was another director maybe the intensity in the book would have been better conveyed... I don't know. I do know that I had to apologize to my father about seeing the movie (on a rainy day in the morning -- maybe that had been a sign?). He forgave me but since then he doesn't really trust me on movies like he used to. I will say that the actors did a pretty good job and the movie wasn't HORRIBLE...it's just something I wish could have been better, or at least as great as they said it would be. Oh, well. You take what you get, I guess.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Adaptations for me are always tricky because you can never really relay all the messages and moments that the book present and put them on the screen. The hunger games doesn't do that, but what it does, it does with effective subtlety and sublime attention.I liked how the director kept the story in Katniss's point of view. This gave the film a sense of new discovery, but also the moments where it ventures away from Katniss and explores the other parts that the book doesn't elaborate on, the book is spot on.It's certainly not the best adaptation of a book by far, but one thing i can say is that it is a really good one. The film moves from one point to the next with relative easy, but this could also be it's weakest point in that some of the moments are done too fast and we move on to the next before we have time to fully absorb some of the feelings the film presents.Gary Ross does a phenomenal job, and certainly requires high marks, but i can honestly say, ""don't expect any Oscar nominations"" because for one thing the art direction was cool but very predictable, it was to reliable. The visual effects had a very hard and edge effect, but nothing we hadn't seen been done before. The acting was spot on, giving away the true and real emotions, but nothing saying Oscar because the performances didn't pop, they were just safe.All in all, the film was enjoyable and i would like to go one but that would just bore, you, so i will live you with this. Go and watch it and see it for yourself, because there are moments that will shock you, make you cry, surprise you but there are also going to be uncomfortable moments where you think the film is just reaching and losing focus, but despite that, the film has merit and recommendation and that alone should be enough reason to watch it.My score - 7.8 out of 10.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Julianna No one, reviews the film for KIDS FIRST! below: Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHyKC-RSNnwAdapted from the first of 3 novels, written by Suzanne Collins and directed by Gary Ross, this film brought such an adrenaline rush of excitement that I couldn't sit still watching it. Set in a not too distant future, where North America has been replaced by Panem, where there is a Capitol and 12 Districts. The movie is about the struggles of a nation divided, where the districts must fight for survival and where the Capitol controls all of the districts. Each of the 12 districts must have one boy and one girl enter the ""Hunger Games"", where they represent their District in a battle for their life, while their citizens watch the action live as it happens. Twenty-four entrants, but only 1 will survive. Its reality TV at its absolute worst. The main characters that we learn most about are Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, X-Men: First Class) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island), who are from District 12, the poorest of the 12 districts. They are also my favorite characters. I like Peeta, because he is the underdog of all underdogs, and he wanted to stay true to himself and not let the games change him in any way. I love Kat, because she is a great role model for young girls like me. She is smart and courageous and she is always looking out for those who need her. She shows that just because you may not be the richest, or best looking, or most liked person, if you have the will and fight to survive, you can overcome any obstacle. I loved this movie so much, it's hard to pinpoint any one scene I like the most. The scenes leading up to game really set the tone of the movie. Then you have the training scenes, which too are very well done. I would say the scenes during the actual Hunger Games are my favorite, as that is where the most action occurs. The way the Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, Gone) controls the Games using hi-tech computer technology, was fantastic. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and had my emotions all over the place. The cinematography in the Capitol and the arena was amazing. One of the best special effects was how they made it look like Kat and Peeta were on fire as they entered the arena, and then later in the interview, they again made it appear that Kat's dress was on fire when she spun around for the crowd. While the movie contained some graphic violence, it was necessary to stay true to the storyline. It was no worse than a lot of video games that kids play today, it's just difficult to watch kids killing other kids. For me, I not only want to see the film again, but I started reading the books as well, so I can compare them when the next film is released. I think this movie is appropriate for ages 11 and up, though for some younger kids, the few short instances of violence are intense and graphic, but they are short lived. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars, but only because I can't give it more than that. Even my dad stayed awake throughout the whole movie and that never happens!

I watched this movie years after it came out, but is surprisingly well made. The world that is set is gritty and well-crafted. The post apocalyptic landscape is very open, with most of the world either in rubble with scarce lives within or belonging to nature. The aristocratic and colorful but brutal rulers take what seems like divine pleasure with technologies and the most synthetic and leisurely clothing and appearances. The film also something of a twisted adventure feel when the action begins, with characters trying to survive, kill, and hide from other competitors in different parts of the forest used as a battlefield. Jennifer Lawrence gives a smart and subtle performance as Katniss Everdeen and provides easily watchable sequences even when no action is going on. If you're looking for another young adult/ teen adventure/drama series, this review has got you covered.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Excellent cinematography, costume design, and soundtrack along with a very unique storyline help to create a really memorable screen experience. The acting-in-general is contrived and overly perfecto, and there are definitely a few holes and cop-outs in the plot. Yet, THE HUNGER GAMES is so one-of-a-kind that its flaws, some of which would be ruinous in a lesser film, are forgivable.All the same, there are ways that THE HUNGER GAMES might have been better; e.g., it would have been a plus to see more virtually created creature phenomena such as the were-pitbulls (or whatever they are) toward the end. Another thing: Considering the brutality of the premise, what actually happens during the ""game"" is fairly tame. Having said that, I'm not sure how it would have worked better--It certainly would NOT have been enhanced by creating a horrific ""It's either me or you"" gore-fest. It often descends into sentimental, politically correct, teeny-bopperish romance, but just when things start to get too maudlin, new things arise.I am sure that this film does not do complete justice to the book trilogy, which I have not read but am now very eager to read. The mere fact that the film version made me--and I'm sure many others--want to read the books says something for it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That says something.Having never read the books, and never liking the whole ""twilight"" teenage hyped up crap, I wasn't really having high expectations of this movie. I was never even sure I wanted to see it in the first place, but I'm gad I did. First of all, I think Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job as archery heroine Katniss Everdeen, and was perfect for the role. Nobody could have done it better. Second, I absolutely LOVED Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. Great cast and superb acting. That's two ups for me. I loved the storyline, the dystopian setting. There was very good character and plot development, I felt like I really got to know the characters and their way of thinking.The movie kept me in suspense most of the time, I could really feel Katniss's fear, desperation and hopefulness and was experiencing everything from her point of view, also. That was another point up for the movie because for me to actually ENJOY a movie, I need to able to relate to the main character(s). Which the hunger games did for me.It had good emotional scenes, really making me tear up at times because it was so sad. I loved that.Yes, the camera was shaking at times, but it wasn't THAT bad. It didn't bother me at all.Overall, I loved the movie, and will definitely be going to see all four. I DID end up reading the book, and loved it as well. Everything about the hunger games just did it for me. I recommend people who want an entertaining, powerful, and sometimes emotional yet satisfying experience, go see the hunger games.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Only one of the 24 actually relishes killing off the others. The rest do it just to save their skins.The society that arranges this is technologically advanced, decadent, highly artificial, somewhat reminiscent of the foppishness of the court of King Louis VI. This is indicated with impractical clothing, overly elaborate shellacked hair styles and extreme makeup with strange colours.I kept wondering if the players would subvert the game, and refuse to play. But they were just randomly chosen teenagers, not heroic societal architects, who after a bit of flirtation with rebellion, did just what their handlers asked of them. Quite a downer ending.The movie can be taken as a metaphor for war, where people who have no grudge against each other are conscripted to kill each other.The movie can also be taken as a metaphor for show business, with the cut-throat competition, the sponsors and the way everything is faked, and the way those in control use people as toys to provide entertainment, and their complete lack of compassion, honesty and fair play.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It can't be that everyone in district 12 is Malnourished to fight as characters like gale look like they are physically fit and do work out. All the characters from the capitol are shown to be unrealistically evil as they all seem to enjoy the fact that they will be watching children (Even though most of them look like they are in their mid twenties) killing each other and none of them even try to hide it. In Battle Royale it makes sense why the government are making children kill each other as they are shown to be a small yet powerful dictatorship who are exercising their power over the common man and killing the people who try to get in their way, but as i said before the people in the hunger games are shown to just be doing it as they just enjoy it.And while there are some good points in the film such as the social commentary (Even though that has been done in films before) none of them really can make me like the movie that much.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

In the latter regard, Gary Ross did a superb job in script writing / directing. He's balanced the need to keep the storyline moving with the need to keep true to the novel's underpinnings. I've watched the movie a couple more times before writing this review. I find nothing superfluous, bloviated, unnecessary. It's a compact story that's equally divided between setup and execution. What's truly sad: Imagine had Gary Ross been the director of Prometheus. Yes -- Gary Ross is a genius. What about the acting? The only weakness is the lack of chemistry between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Liam Hemsworth (Gale). Liam seems a miscast hunk out of place in an ugly dour world. Too bad they didn't cast Miley Cyrus as Katniss's younger sister. But there's a much larger problem: The source material. The audience has to keep swallowing incredible incongruities just so we can be continually hit over the head with multi-level anti-authoritarian messages. This is an amoral society on steroids that exists only as a foil to propel the thematics. We can't help but become angry at the atrocities foisted on Katness and her conscripted compatriots. Maybe I would have understood better if Katness had worn a six-pointed star. So, I'm giving this movie 9 stars largely on the excellent execution / beautiful realization of Gary Ross's vision.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

As it turns out, ""The Hunger Games"" (2012) was actually a really good movie – I'd cheerfully give it an 8 out of 10. I thought that this would be a sci-fi equivalent of a Twilight franchise, or a mainstreamed ripoff of ""Battle Royale"" (2000), but it was none of the former and only a little of the latter.It took a decent story and populated it with fully realized, three- dimensional characters, then cast good actors across the board. You know a movie works if you're cheering for the main protagonist. It was also a surprisingly dark story for a young adult book adaptation.The pacing was a little off  characters and plot devices are raised and dropped a little abruptly, and you can tell they were included because they were elements of Suzanne Collins' book that fans were expecting. And the action directing wasn't the best I've seen – the final standoff was a little awkwardly staged and anticlimactic. Those are small quibbles, though.If anyone really likes this, it might be fun to watch this and ""Battle Royale"" back-to-back on a rainy Saturday.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Teenagers swept the book off the shelf and demanded a sequel, which of course followed. Each of the new parts of the 'Hunger Games' won the status of a bestseller without any problems, and it is quite obvious that soon after the records of the printed creation, Collins got involved in mastering the heights of the screen.The plot of the film adaptation of the first part of the trilogy by Susan Collins begins with our acquaintance with the world, which lives by its own special rules. We are given to understand that some time ago some global cataclysms occurred in the United States, because of which the old system sank into oblivion and Panem appeared in its place, a new state headed by the President, which is more correctly called a tyrant.The whole country is now divided into 12 districts, the last of which is considered industrial and the least prestigious. And it is here that the main character, Katniss Everdeen, lives, who will take part in the competition called 'The Hunger Games'. Such an event was created so that every year the residents of Panem, tired of the injustice and cruelty of the authorities, were distracted from thoughts about a possible riot and cheered for the representatives of their area. Winning such a terrible battle is a real miracle, but Katniss is not going to lose at all.The film by Gary Ross tells us in a very informative and entertaining way what was written by Suzanne Collins. Thanks to the skillful approach of the director and screenwriters, even those viewers who are not aware of the original books and discover the world of the Hunger Games right while watching the film will easily get acquainted with this story.Of course, the most interesting starts here after the plot moves to the competition arena. It is a huge forest where mutants can easily appear. In addition, it is full of dangerous insects and poisonous berries, which makes the test really very cruel. But even though only one should be left alive, the Hunger Games are dominated by children, which once again speaks of how cruel the state system is established in Panem. And this means that sooner or later there will be a coup, but so far it is still far away and the most important thing is to closely monitor the very course of the deadly competition.Maybe the 'Hunger Games' from Gary Ross is not an exemplary youth dystopia and has its own optional, time-consuming moments, but it's still an interesting story that attracted the attention of a huge audience for a reason. And not only read the original.8 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Satisfying, but not for Ross","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2657381/?ref_=tt_urv","bigmystery23","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35513146/?ref_=tt_urv","11 August 2012","There are many positives about this film (the acting, the cinematography, the casting, the set, the costuming and make-up). But, there are some flaws (the depth of setting up the games and the lack of emotions in the games, the lack of Howard's music ability, the unrealistic images of the people who are ""apparently"" starving, and the unnecessary spoilers for the next film). Now is this a bad film? Absolutely not! This film overpowers the flaws with astounding acting from the older actors, particularly Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland, spectacular cinematography that, though may feel nauseous at times, feels as if the audience is in the games, some beautiful set designs, and memorizing costumes and make-up. Plus, with not as big as a budget as most films, Ross does a good job in creating the atmosphere of the novel. One thing I wish had happened was that Ross had focused more on filming the intensity of the games that was portrayed in the novel, but it is quite difficult to create a film that is better than it's adaptation. This probably wasn't the best film for Gary Ross to direct, but it wasn't a disappointment.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This makes us gain access to new games, news articles, darker things... and even any movie you can think of that isn't in black and white with just a simple Google search. Of course, this movie is newer than the ones I just referenced.As soon as I saw trailers come out for the newest Hunger Games, featuring the very handsome, Tom Blyth, I just knew my procrastination of watching The Hunger Games must END. Of course, it didn't... until today.It is currently January 28th, 2024 and I'm writing this at a time when I should be getting ready for bed because tomorrow I have school AND an exam. But no, here I am writing a mediocre review about one of the classics in cinematography from the early 2010s, The Hunger Games.This movie was AMAZING. I was astonished by the set(s) alone, even though it was probably all fake. The Capitol was futuristic and stunning. Each room was perfected and shiny. Very eye-catching. While the set where the actual Hunger Games took place was a natural beauty. I loved how almost every character had a different personality. And there was only ONE clique (that I can think of). The arrogant, better-than-everybody-else group. How can a movie even become relevant without the characters/group that makes you just wanna throw something at the wall? That was by far the most unbearable thing, other than watching innocent children die.Jennifer Lawrence, what a spectacular woman. Her acting alone had me locked into the movie. You can see the fear, the hope, and the sadness in Katniss's eyes throughout the movie. The dedication and impressive aim of Katniss Everdeen was played perfectly by Jennifer Lawrence. Also, a bonus is that she is gorgeous! One of the few main characters that I don't fully ignore for other characters... because she was the best character to me. Beautiful job!Josh Hutcherson is fine as hell, period. Girl candy, or guy candy. His acting throughout the movie was great. I feel as though he wasn't able to show his full potential compared to Jennifer because, undeniably, he had less screen time, but both actors did a fantastic job of portraying their roles! The love Peeta feels for Katniss was played perfectly by Josh, did not skip a beat and you can feel and see the awe Peeta feels for just being in the presence of Katniss. Perfect casting!Related to Gale though near the end...Romance in this movie, although at the end and quite a short period, was splendid! I'm sure I will see more as I watch the rest of the movies, but for now, I am pleased. As an avid romance reader and watcher, I am not blown away though. My feet weren't kicking. But it did cross my main box. It made me cringe with disgust, then made me fill up with delight. Bravo!I was captivated by the fights, although I have seen way better, even at my own school. LOL! The fear in some victim's eyes was unforgettable and I had to pause the movie to comprehend what I just witnessed due to sadness or just being take aback. The CGI was pretty decent for a 2012 movie, but sometimes there were obvious flaws. I have yet to watch the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th movies that star Jennifer Lawrence, but I am more than certain my expectations will be fulfilled.Let me start wrapping up this review, or as I prefer to call it, a rant. The reason for my 9-star rating instead of 10 is because of a biased reason... blood. The burns, cuts, etc. That were shown made me gag. Let alone the very, very faint sound effects I could hear because of my headphones. Of course, don't call me silly, I was aware of the amount of violence that would occur in the movie. The sound effects just threw me off the edge. Didn't even give me time to prepare for a swan dive!Anyway, GO WATCH THIS MOVIE (if you haven't)!!! It is a classic in my books and deserves to be passed on to the next generation, and so on. 9/10 STARS!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The premise seems quite similar to Battle Royale, a film I enjoyed a lot so on a whim I decided to see what it was like. I was aware that this was only a 12A so would be a watered down version but I prefer to make my own mind up about a film not blindly knock a film because it's seen as 'uncool' or not specifically aimed at my age or gender bracket. The film boasts an excellent cast and Jennifer Lawrence is slowly winning me around. She was perfect for this role. Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley also put in good performances. The Hunger Games grabbed me early on and the set up explained the set up well which made it a lot easier to follow what was going on. People have complained at the slow build up but I found it to be necessary in this instance. In any case although it may have lacked action for me it was never boring. The film has a fair amount of tension and whilst the deaths are understandably not gory it doesn't hinder the film too much. If you're looking for gore then stay away from 12A films. This is a story led film and it tells it's a story told very well. This is an impressive film, forget what the self appointed trendies say. It's easy to sit behind a computer and criticize to make yourself feel more important. There really isn't anything bad you can say about this film. It's targeted at a certain audience who judging by the films success were more than happy with the end result and ultimately that's what counts. The Hunger Games took me by surprise at how enjoyable and well made it is. It isn't as good as Battle Royale but it's aiming at a different audience. If you watch it with an open mind you may enjoy it as much as I did.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

When I saw the movie on Netflix, it was so inspiring. So many people overlook the fact that this was a pop culture phenomenon, and led to a dystopian genre shift in it's own right.Suzanne Collins's story about a young girl who sparks a rebellion with her bravery in dire circumstances was unlike anything seen in mainstream media before. It was probably easy for men to overlook this fact since they may have been used to identifying with similar male protagonists (or even younger girls who didn't know it wasn't normal). But, for many women, like myself, this was the first time that a female action hero was portrayed realistically in such a way that felt personally inspiring.Katniss Everdeen was not a born hero, or a Tomb Raider-like fantasy character made for men (or the traditionally feminine character like Bella Swan in the coinciding Twilight movies). She was the victim of her own circumstances, and made a hero by chance. She wasn't a typically feminine character, though she was like a mother to both her sister, and her adopted companion, Rue. She is believable and relatable to the average female, especially because she was not perfectly nice or exceptional in mysterious ways.The emotional aspects of the movie are its strength. It breathes a ""feminine"" energy lacking in our culture, in a good way. Most movies that conjure these similar feelings are based around family or romantic main plots, perhaps with war or politics in the background. But this story takes the emotional perspective on the big topics, making them front and center. Conceptually, it is a feminist work, not because it is written by a woman, but because it brings a traditionally feminist perspective to non-traditional storylines (ie war, politics)I did purchase the books on my old Kindle and read them immediately. I'm glad I saw this first movie before I read the book - it's always better to do it that way! The book will always ruin the movie, like riding the big roller coaster before the small one. Of course, I couldn't wait to read the others, and I was admittedly a fangirl when the subsequent movies came out. I wasn't a big reader in my twenties, after the many books I had to read in school, but I read these all at least twice. There are a lot of big differences between the book and the movie.Casting Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss was a bold and brilliant move. Her character in the book is small and unremarkable, while Lawrence was in her twenties and 5'9"" - definitely not a literal pick. But, she had proven herself to play a similarly desperate character in Winter's Bone, for which she received an Oscar nomination. It was rumored that she almost did not take the role of Katniss because she knew it would be a huge blockbuster, and wasn't sure if that's what she wanted. But, it would be hard to imagine anyone else portraying Katniss, now. I did love her in Silver Linings Playbook (for which she finally won the Oscar), but consider her performance in The Hunger Games just as impressive. In many ways, it is good that this was a blockbuster rather than a ""serious"" film, because it reached a bigger audience and inspired more people like myself to read the books.Of course there are a lot of things to be desired from the book that aren't portrayed in the movie, as well as there are altered points in the movie that change the story significantly. But, as a movie on it's own, The Hunger Games is classic. And the reason for this is that the main protagonist is female, along with the combination of themes. To say that it is unoriginal or simply a copy of other films or ideas is being disingenuous. There is no other story to date with a female protagonist with Greek-like culture, and simultaneously critical of modern day reality television. There just isn't. To me, I sense some bigotry in the negative reviews. It's not a perfect adaptation, but it's still an original story and very well done movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It has a really great plot and hats off to Suzanne Collin's for creating such a genuine but yet interesting novel! When I Went to watch the film I had really great expectations. And I enjoyed the movie through out but it could have been so much better.Screenplay- The 1st half of the screenplay was pretty good. But I felt that the second half lacked in emotion. The Katniss/Peeta scene in the caves were completely butchered down and the interviews after the games were really very short. The only scene that I loved in the second half of the film was the scene in which Rue dies! Acting- The acting was top-notch! Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant as Katniss. Her emotions, eye movement and everything else was perfect. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks were also great in their roles. Liam Hamesworth's performance was too short to be judged. Josh Hutcherson.... His character was not well written and so its not his fault that we did not get the Peeta we deserved.Action- The action scenes were pretty good but I still think they could have shown a lot more for a PG-13 movie.Direction- Gary Ross' direction was amazing. Sad He's not doing the second one.Overall the film was a good adaptation of the book but it could have been a lot better. Looking forward to the next one.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","THE HUNGER GAMES is Surprisingly Good for Teen-Oriented Series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2707637/?ref_=tt_urv","brando647","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3947986/?ref_=tt_urv","20 November 2012","I never intended on giving THE HUNGER GAMES any attention. All I knew from the marketing campaign was that it was based on a series of young adult novels all I could think was TWILIGHT. When the reviews started coming out and the word was overwhelmingly positive, I figured I might have to rethink my position on the movie. Not enough to see it in theaters, but I did check it out when it was released on home video and I was pleasantly surprised. For the most part, it lived up to a lot of the hype as a great film for both teens and adults. The movie is based on the first novel in a series from Suzanne Collins set in a dystopian future when America has suffered through a great internal struggle. The nation, now known as Panem, is now separated into the high class of the Capitol and twelve poverty-stricken districts that each specialize in a particular resource. The Hunger Games is an even held each year where two tributes are chosen from each of the twelve districts, one male and one female between the ages of twelve and eighteen, and placed in a battle to the death until one victor remains. The Games are meant to remind the people of Panem of the Capitol's dominance and discourage any future revolutionary behavior. When her sister's name is called as tribute for the 74th annual games, Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her place and must now fight for her life against 23 other tributes if she hopes to survive the Hunger Games.Honestly, I'm surprised this is as popular as it is with the teen/preteen crowd. This is a well- thought science fiction tale set in a future where the wealthy have tightened their oppression over the lower class to the point where they force them to murder each other for their own amusement. It's reality television taken to a whole new level, and we know how much America loves its reality TV. After everything I'd heard about the laughable love story in the TWILIGHT movies, I really expected this movie to be the same. I just assumed that's what it took to grab the attention of the teen girls that made this movie such a phenomenon. Again, I was wrong. There is a blossoming relationship in the movie between Katniss and a fellow tribute, but it's not the central focus. If anything, it's a subplot. Katniss's motivation in the movie isn't to find true love, it's to survive the Games and see her family again. Despite how good this movie turned out to be, I won't be running out to buy the novels anytime soon so I couldn't tell you if it's something that develops later in the series. I sure hope not. THE HUNGER GAMES has a good thing going here and I'd hate for it to break off into some melodramatic love triangle. I may not be interested in the novels, but this movie has guaranteed my interest in the inevitable sequel.The production design was probably the best part of this movie. The world of Panem is a bizarre one. The twelve districts are almost primitive in their designrural and low tech. The Capitol, on the other hand, is massive and colorful. People dress in abstract fashions with freakish hairstyles and flashy wardrobes. Think Victorian England on LSD. The action in the movie is as good as one can expect in a PG-13 film aimed at teenagers. Despite the bloody premise behind the movie, the action is mostly cut fast and bloodless. A lot of chaotic camera shaking and implied violence before cutting away. As a result, the violence doesn't hit as hard as it could but, again, this movie was based on a book series aimed at kids that can't cough up ticket money for an R-rated bloodbath. And then there are the characters, each of them memorable in their own right. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Katniss. Beautiful and stoic, she's a strong character and Lawrence is guaranteed to go on to a great career. Woody Harrelson stands out in the movie as a past Hunger Games victor who acts as mentor to Katniss and her fellow District 12 tribute. He's tortured from his time in the Games and persistently drunk, but he soon finds faith in Katniss as a potential winner. There's a lot of talent gathered here in both the cast and crew, and director Gary Ross has done an awesome job. As someone who can't stand the usual teen-oriented entertainment, I can say that I'll be following this series when the sequels arrive.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The most charismatic mainstream film in a long time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2900371/?ref_=tt_urv","Clockwork-Avacado","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36296455/?ref_=tt_urv","6 November 2013","In the run-up to ""Catching Fire"", I realised it was about time to finally knuckle under, and watch the first ""Hunger Games"" movie, which I've been previously put off because it looked like a bunch of whiny teenagers running around a forest killing each other, and a society of very camp people in ridiculous clothes watching. Well, to be fair, it kind of...is. It's also probably the most human ""blockbuster"" film of the last twenty five years, defying narrative obscurity, massive CGI set-pieces, smarmy heroes, and people posing about trying to look ""dark"" and ""cool"". ""The Hunger Games"" is small-scale, intensely personal, and well-crafted. So why does everyone like it then, in this age of over-kill? I honestly don't know, because it's not at all your average blockbuster.All this said, there's no denying that there really isn't anyone in the cast who, pardon the pun, really sets the screen on fire. Most of the cast are acceptable enough (Jennifer Lawrence, Hutcherson, Hemsworth, BAnks, Tucci, etc) with only a few duffers. (Kravitz, Ludwig)The main thing is, though, there's a strong story at work here, and Lawrence's rather opaque performance as Katniss Everdeen shows depth in places, which hopefully will be exploited in future movies. She's a good heroine for this film, don't get me wrong. She's just nothing special as an actress.Director Gary Ross has excelled himself here, with a very subtle film. The action scenes have been intentionally filmed in a very realistic, low-key fashion, where things aren't glorified, or ""stagey"" in any way. In a film about a world which glorifies killing, this is a very wise choice, and adds immensely to the threat. For once, the threat has been calculated very simply, with the assumption that less is more, and the minimalistic sense of danger is more powerful than any one of countless CGI-driven action movies out there, because the threat, to, is human. It's ""Lord of the Flies"", meets ""First Blood"". It may all be set in the future, amidst elaborate trappings, but what it boils right down to, is a very dark tale about survival.It's relevance to contemporary society cannot fail to be missed. How long before we're watching things like this? How long before our society will be taken over by camp, garish people like this? It isn't glorified in any way, and the implications are all very explicit. It's a sugar-coated critique, and, like the best dystopian fiction, it is done in a very extrovert fashion, to make the point all the clearer. It isn't a complex film, like say ""The Dark Knight"", but what it is, is an intelligent film, with more balls in it than any dozen other big budget ""epics"". It never loses sight of its' human characters, as shallow as they may be. The plight focuses on concerns so simplistic, that we don't need hours of moping about and soap-opera. It's about kill or be killed. That's all you need. And the drama remains poignant and undiluted. People fall, and we see their leg bloody and wounded. For once, we're not treated to computer-game like visuals. These are real people here. We feel their pain. Nothing is over-done. It's a film about simplicity, and, unlike every other ""dark"" film out there, is actually grounded in the laws of reality, however romanticised the story itself may be.Along these lines, is James Newton Howard's score, very stripped back and poignant, and yet, it isn't in any way intrusive, hence allowing for the retention of the atmosphere of reality. Rarely has a major film been so unashamed to fly in the face of cinematic tropes. The action, of course, is limited, and you're more likely to be surprised than excited by this film, because of its' stylistic bravery.The only thing, which IS especially modern, is that there is that creeping ""sequel"" mentality. There's a feeling of restraint to the sub-plots, especially Donald Sutherland's President Snow, who looms intimidatingly, promising great things, but doesn't get a chance to do anything. Similarly, the political unrest in the districts is glimpsed briefly, and the ending hints strongly at the events of the next ""chapter"" in the saga. For any film, even if the sequels are already in production, the story should have a beginning, middle and end. It should be self-contained, and not rely upon the fact that we're going to see the next film. Because it's thinking like that which stops second films from being made. As it is, ""Catching Fire"" looks set to be incredible, probably better than this, with more political intrigue now that we've got all the introductory work out of the way. The only sad thing is, no Gary Ross for the sequel. Regardless, though, this is a solid action/thriller, which stylistically feels like a grittier, more honest seventies movie, but one which has a profound relevance for contemporary society. Entertaining, and with more charisma than you'd ever imagine.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

OK, this wasn't any of her strongest performances, but that wasn't the problem for me. For some reason, the story and the storytelling just didn't do it for me. Not only was it far from incredible, but most of the time it didn't even feel credible.The Hunger Games depicts a dystopian future by looking back in time, to the gladiator games of Roman times. Some of the scenes with Stanley Tucci, a very accomplished actor that I normally enjoy watching, gave me the feeling that the crew's understanding of Roman times was based entirely on Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Oh, and Mr. Tucci's character is called Caesar, by the way, if all the other references were too subtle. That can hardly be blamed on the film, however, since it was based on a novel by Suzanne Collins.Donald Sutherland was perfectly cast for his role, and he did his job well. Unfortunately, however, we didn't get to see much of him.All in all, the film was OK, but not something I would watch again.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I then decided to watch the film online to see if it lived up to the hype. In my view it didn't... and here's why:1) Ending in the book: shocking and dramatic. In this: lazy and uninspiring. Obviously I won't go into detail to risk ruining it for others.2) The characters in the book are depicted as 12-18 year-olds, yet the leads in the movie are all in their early 20's. This somehow makes me feel less sorry for the characters as the killing of annoying, talentless adults compared to teenagers is less shocking and doesn't help me imagine the book in a literal sense. Plus the acting from about 90% of the actors is god-awful.3) Forgive me for sounding like a bit of a sadist, but those who have read the book will know there is a fair amount of gore described in the deaths of the characters. This, however, is a watered down version showing very little gore at all - obviously, to try and appeal to a younger teenage audience. This again takes away some of the sadness as the deaths seem quick and painless compared to the books gory depiction. Even the trailer describes it as a 'bloodbath', but I can assure you it's not. The most blood you will see in this movie is probably on the weapons themselves.4) The directors have definitely focused on quantity rather than quality in this. Admittedly, they try their best to cram in as much of the story as they can, but the scenes they depict are very flat, dull, uninspiring and rushed. All of the best moments in the book are literally squashed into 2-3 minute segments leaving the audience to think ""was that it?"". All of this, of course, being shot by the worst cameraman in the world.. which brings me onto my fifth and most important point.5) During the little action you see in the film, the camera is so unbelievably shaky that it is impossible to see what is going on. Whether or not this was intended, it simply doesn't work. And may leave some feeling a bit nauseated.There are very few good points I could give without ruining the plot, not that there are many, but the depiction of Cinna by Lenny Kravitz was very very good admittedly.Overall a BIG disappointment after the book.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story follows the journey of a young girl, Katniss Everdeen, as she is chosen to compete in a televised battle to the death, known as the Hunger Games, in a dystopian future where the government holds absolute power. As a viewer, the story does attract me, and it is clear that the filmmakers have put a lot of effort into bringing the story to life on the big screen. The production is of a high standard, with excellent cinematography and visual effects that help to create a vivid and immersive world. The script of this film is well-written and stays true to the source novel material, capturing the key themes and emotions of the story. The lighting, color, and editing are all well executed, creating a visually stunning film that captures the essence of the dystopian world of The Hunger Games. Even more specifically, the visual effects of this film are so well executed that you yourself often feel immersed into this fictional world. The costumes, makeup, and styling are also well done, effectively conveying the stark contrast between the wealthy Capitol residents and the impoverished residents of the districts. Overall, it is a well-produced and well-executed film that engages and enlightens viewers with its thought-provoking themes and excellent performances. It is definitely worth watching, and I highly recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I found it original, although as it went on there were some similarities to The Running Man, and The Long Walk, both, incidentally by Stephen King. I found the political situation interesting. Likely fleshed out a lot more in the novel, but from what I gathered, there had been a civil war about seventy years in the past, and they seem stuck in eternal Reconstruction. Instead of binding the nation back together over time, as we did, the losing side's territory has become occupied and exploited colonies, even four generations later. I also noted that many of the characters from the ""Capitol"", the winning territory, had Roman names, e.g. Cinna, Octavia, Flavius, Cato, Seneca. Hmmm. Well, I don't quite care enough to read the book, and likely not enough to see the inevitable sequels.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are so many different types of Dystopian type movies out there that all take very similar premises to each other. Hunger Games is...different.The world built around Panem is fascinating, as well as the Games itself. Choosing 24 tributes from all 12 districts to battle it out to the end, with 1 being the victor. All in the name of ""Peace, and Tranquility.""Obviously, the stars being both Ms. Lawrence, and Sir Hutcherson led the movie quite admirably. Katniss goes through the games for the sole purpose of protecting those she loves in from her home district, but learns to trust others along the way. Peeta began not seeing himself worth saving, but learns that there are people who care about him more than he realizes. Both lead the movie well, and had so many great character moments and scenes along the way. Shoutout to Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks who also get some great moments to shine as well; Haymitch to be particular.Another shoutout to the stunt coordinator, and choreographer. The action, while it is PG-13 does a suitable job at getting it's hands dirty. There were definitely some moments that were visceral, and straight up savage.The music and soundtrack was a great accompaniment to the movie as well. There are still scenes I remember distinctly because of the soundtrack.Other than that, the film itself does a decent at being a pretty contained film for the most part. While the world of Panem, and the concept of the games gets expanded upon in late installments, this is definitely one film, in my opinion, does a great job with the material it's been given.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Among the positives were Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson, who I felt gave rather entertaining performances, and the lighter, more humorous bits of the film were more enjoyable to watch. In regards to the preparation for the Games, I take issue with the backdrop of the whole affair, as it reeks of so-called ""reality"" TV, which I despise.

I'm one of the only Teens in the world who hasn't read the books, and was only watching because of the talented Jennifer Lawrence, for whom I have a great deal of respect. It turned out to be one of the best films I've seen all year, and one of the best surprises I've ever seen.The plot is pretty universally known (even I was familiar with the core concept) Teens fighting each other on T.V for the worlds entertainment. Not too original, but well executed. The visuals and scenarios were really well done, and I almost felt sucked into the world. The contrasts from the poor world of district 12 to the wealthy, colorful cities was awesome.The Film is lead by the lovely Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the part of Katniss Everdeen wonderfully. Katniss was the first volunteer tribute from district 12, and she was to go to the Hunger Games along with Peeta Mellark (played by Josh Hutcherson) Although not friends, they become romantically linked, and develop a bit of a love throughout the film which is used to gain interest from viewers. Despite the good acting, the romance did seem a little far fetched, and it is doubtful that any man could turn down the role of Peeta if only to snuggle with Jennifer Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, a favorite of mine, played their mentor, a former winner of the Hunger Games. He is a bit of an alcoholic, but very likable. The rest of the cast was good, but aside from the two A? listers, no performances stood out.I really liked this movie. I have some complaints, but nothing that ruined this nice experience. I would recommend it to people looking for a visually striking film with a strong female lead. Jennifer Lawrence was the highlight for me; I personally thought that she created a great character with tons of depth. Strong film, I might even go see the sequel in theaters.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

In comparison to my initial viewings of this picture (I kept watching the entire series over and over again back when I first watched it a year and a half ago, so I've lost count of how many times I've seen this), I found the lavish eccentricity of the Capitol citizens rather bizarre at first, but upon this viewing, I believe it was an excellent choice, in order to exacerbate the stark difference in social class between the Capitol and the lower districts. Plus, it really shows off the remarkable skills of the hair & make-up team, as well as the costume design team! Also, I was more emotionally moved with this rewatch, most notably with the Rue scene, which never really hit me that hard up until now.By the way it's perhaps important to note that this is all coming from the perspective of somebody who has never read the books (however I do plan to one day) so I had no prior knowledge or feeling towards The Hunger Games up until I saw the films.But I will leave my review here, and to summarise, this is a brilliant dystopian future film which I strongly consider to be essential viewing for almost all young to mid-teens out there, it's two hours and 22 minutes of sheer captivating excitement.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A great film with many subtle qualities","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3280227/?ref_=tt_urv","mortenblaabjerg","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24830309/?ref_=tt_urv","19 July 2015","Many reviewers compare this movie to other movies or the book, that it is based upon, saying that it lacks this and that in comparison with what they expected. I am really surprised to see how many negative reviews this film has received on IMDb.I saw this film without reading any of the books and without seeing the famed Battle Royale, and I really liked it.There are many great subtle qualities to this film. It's in all the performances, from the main actors to supporting roles - among others, awesome performances from Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci as fabulous TV-host Caesar Flickerman. It's in the wonderfully understated fascist sci-fi setting, which connects wonderfully to fascist architecture and cinema. It's in the way the games are portrayed as an advanced form of TV entertainment and sport, the slow but stronger development of the characters and their relations, and in the special effects, which are excellent, but also deliberately toned down appropriately.It's also in the great and appropriate comment, that this film is on present day society and the current global political order. We are the citizens of the Capitol, enjoying our ""hunger games"" in the form of mass-produced entertainment, while an economical and political order dictates that many of the Earth's inhabitants lives in a world, where they need to fight or starve, while we live in plenty.I can't fault this film in any way. It takes it's time, and keeps one hooked to the end. A very disciplined effort by the director, with a strong screenplay and cast. I wouldn't hesitate to call it a masterpiece.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not Twilight (thank Christ for that) and thankfully it's got a better romantic triangle than any of that vampire hogwash had going for it.This series is like a millennial-appealing take on other sci-fi dystopias ranging from George Orwell's 1984 to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World; where those stories explored totalitarianism in more subversive ways this one shows how extreme things can get when violence is thrown into the equation.Considering this came out in 2012 and people are STILL saying whether or not this ripped off Battle Royale I think that those addresses are fair, and that it doesn't suffer from the pre-established derivativeness of something like Divergent (which apparently carbon-copied the story so much the films themselves were distributed by Lionsgate/Summit Entertainment).Anyway, this film is an adaptation of a book that was craving a movie based on it, and it's a good action flick focusing on young men and women trying to survive the worst to-the-death scenario you could possibly imagine.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I believe that something that can have an immense impact on the amount of views a film has, are the reviews behind the movie. Of coarse every film may have different audiences depending on its genre. I sure have different opinions on movies with different genres. If I am watching a comedy movie, I expect it to make me laugh more than 85% of the time. If I am watching an action movie I expect it to look realistic when the action happens. And if I am watching a horror movie I expect it to make me jump out of my seat. My expectations of movies also have to do with how much I think I know about the film. For example, one thing that might affect how well I enjoyed watching the movie is whether or not it is an original film or a remake. Remakes of movies have a lot more to prove to me than original films because that means that I expect them to be better than the last film. One of the films I expected a lot from before watching it was The Hunger Games. The reason for that is because prior to watching the movie I had been reading the book written by Suzanne Collins. I actually had really high hopes that the movie would be exactly like the book. However, upon watching the movie I noted that a couple of things were left out. Now I know that there is no way possible that the movie could fit every single detail that was written in the book, but I do feel like some important things were left out. One of those things is that, in the book we are told right away about the districts and what they are known for, basically what each district works on. In the movie we simply see each of the tributes ""represent"" the things they work with as if each of them were just symbols. One other thing that was left out in the movie was how much district 12 struggled with starvation. We were never really told in the movie how much district 12 lacked food supply, we simply just had to assume and if someone who hadn't read the book watched the movie, we would have to explain how their situation was. We did see it at certain times in the movie when Katniss shares what has made her happy, the food that they have at the capitol which they do not have at home. Most of the details that were important in the book were covered in the movie like I said I know the entire book cannot be played in a movie so I can say they did their best at incorporating what they could. Another thing I expected to be the same as the book was the narration. One of my favorite things about the book was the relationship of Katniss, the main character, and her boyfriend, Gale. The entire time in the book he tried to convince Katniss to run away with him so they could be free from the games and we definitely saw these attempts in the movie. The Hunger Games falls into the thriller and science fiction genres. That being said I wanted the movie to look as realistic as possible. Having the book as a reference to details, the movie really looked realistic. One of the things I was excited about was Katniss' dress that she would wear to one of her interview in front of an audience. The dress that she wears actually turns into flames and I loved how it came to life in the movie. The fact that we saw her dress turn into flames is important because it is actually how Katniss gets one of her nicknames ""The Girl On Fire."" The most important thing that I hoped would look realistic was during the actual games. There are so many things that the game makers are capable of doing that some of the things I could not picture while reading the book. One of those things being another scene that also involves fire. About halfway through the movie Katniss tries to find a safe spot and in doing so she wanders off to far. The game makers attempt to kill her by adding fire to forest at the spot where she is camping out. They add flying fireballs, which one actually strikes Katniss and burns her leg. Trees that are on fire appear to fall right in front of Katniss as she attempts to run away and closer to the middle of arena. This particular scene looks very realistic and it is one of the things I was surprised about the movie and satisfied with. It was almost as if I was in her position trying to run away from the fire that the game makers have created. This kind of teaches Katniss to remain close to the arena and not wander off to far. It also shows us how evil the game makers can be and how bad they wanted Katniss dead. Overall I was satisfied with the movie and I don't feel as if it was exaggerated like some films with the same genres may be. I would recommend this movie to someone else to watch and I definitely look forward to watching the latest film of the trilogy. I hope that the other movies capture the book as much as this one did since it was one of the things that I most looked forward to. Especially since one the movies is split into two parts, I hope that means that close to the entire book will be capture in that film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless.

"9","/10","An excellent, exciting film with a good story. Worth watching.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5701276/?ref_=tt_urv","filipemanuelneto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53053227/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2020","This film is the adaptation of a literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing that, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film. And what I have to say is very positive.The film brings a dystopian view of humanity: Panem is a nation divided into 12 districts, where people live and work to sustain the luxury and power of the ruling and social elite, who lives in the Capital. After a brutal civil war, the elite set up the Hunger Games in memory of that carnage, and to remember the loyalty that each district owes to the Capital. In the games, which are a mix of Big Brother, FIFA World Cup and ""Apocalypse Now"", two teenagers (male and female) from each district fight to the death, or better say, try to keep on living until everyone has died. This film tells us the gaming experience of Katniss Everdeen, a young woman from District 12 who offers herself in the place of her younger sister.There is some details in this film that I think are not well explained. One of them is the title: was there hunger? The whole environment around who is Katniss and what her life was like in District 12 before the reaping seems too chalky to be clear. That's a big problem but if we chose to ignore it the film flows, and it does it wonderfully after the reaping scene. One of the things that most caught my attention is the similarity between Panem and the ancient Rome, either by the character's names, the environment of the Capital, or by the idea of having deadly games as entertainment (kind of modern gladiators, you see?), whether by using the eagle as a symbol of power. The similarity is evident... and purposeful.Jennifer Lawrence proved to be perfectly up to the challenge and maintains a good cooperation with Josh Hutcherson, who is never quite as interesting as she is. Lawrence also makes a very good work when she shares the screen with Willow Shields, who gave life to Primrose. The romantic interest in Liam Hemsworth's character, however, is as cold as winter. In the supporting cast, we can highlight the good performances of Wes Bentley, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones, Lenny Kravitz, Amandla Stenberg and, most especially, a huge Donald Sutherland, cold and majestic in the shoes of the dictator Snow. At first glance, Stanley Tucci seems histrionic and annoying, but if we look at his character as a satire of a thousand and one talk and reality show hosts around the world, his work acquires another consistency and relevance.In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, but which fails to abuse the unstable camera movement; excellent sets and costumes, good CGI and sound effects. The soundtrack deserves a special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.Full of action and with an excellent story, this film may not be perfect but it left good premises for the sequel that inevitably happened. It is worth seeing, but I don't know how much younger children are prepared to see and, above all, to understand the story told.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is a televised battle where twenty-four teenagers – two from each of the districts of Panem – are forced to fight each other to the death. Blessed with incredible archery skills, Katniss uses all her resources and luck to try and make it to the end.When I first heard about this movie getting made, I rolled my eyes. It just seemed like Hollywood was looking to piggyback on the success of the Twilight saga by bringing yet another teen novel franchise to the big screen. And let's face it, they were piggybacking. But, and this is a big but, 'The Hunger Games' defied all my expectations.I'll be honest, if this film was just okay, I'd have been pleasantly surprised. The fact that it's actually brilliant is a slap in the face. You have a very strong plot and story – while I don't think the film properly explains the reason behind why this barbaric event takes place, it's a very interesting concept. There are also the obvious connections to 'Battle Royale', but 'Battle Royale' paid more attention to the blood and the violence. 'The Hunger Games' pays much more attention to character development and the emotional drama.That's not to say the violence wasn't good. In fact, the violence was extremely well-directed. That very first action sequence when the Games start is a visceral pleasure, enhanced by shaky camera effects and a lack of music. Director Gary Ross is equally adept at handling these violent scenes as he is at getting us to engage with the characters on screen.Jennifer Lawrence is one of my favourite actors right now, and she proves why in this film. Katniss Everdeen is very similar to the character Lawrence plays in 'Winter's Bone' (for which she was nominated for an Oscar): a young girl who is mature beyond her years, with an entire family dependent on her. Katniss cannot afford to show emotion or weakness; all she can do is carry on living, and carry on supporting her family. It makes her cold and distant, but it also makes her a survivor. Lawrence exudes all of these things perfectly. While the outcome of the movie is obviously very predictable, it's the journey she goes on that appeals. She's surrounded by a cast of great actors (Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson stand out), but this is all about Lawrence.Like most films, 'The Hunger Games' is probably far too long. Half an hour could have been shaved off and it would have been perfect. But it is on the longer side, and that's a small price to pay, I suppose. But what makes it more grating is that, despite the long running time, a lot of stuff isn't explained enough. It makes me want to read the books (which is good, I guess), but the film should not unwittingly leave you with questions.'The Hunger Games' is a brilliant film, and I am genuinely interested in seeing the sequel, and where the character of Katniss Everdeen goes next.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was not completely disappointed because the movie didn't not change anything major from the book except for one thing and that was the gore factor. The book had incredibly vivid and violent visualization which was not translated to this teenage pg-13 movie. I feel like if someone who had never read the book were to watch the movie not enough would be explained for the viewer to follow the plot line or to have any cares or connection to the characters. After reading a few of the reviews from people who have not seen the movie I realize my suspicions are correct. The movie jumped from scene to scene so fast and with so little explanation you may as well be watching a series of trailers all pieced together or a montage of the book.

The Hunger Games is not just a movie of action and romance – it is a movie about survival of the fittest. The Hunger Games is about who can outwit the others. The Hunger Games is about finding your true self. But how can one find their self in a brutal attempt to please the one nation that created the games – The Capitol and the ruthless dictator of all time President Snow (played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland).With an all-star cast, directed by Gary Ross – who brought us Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, interwove the world that Suzanne Collins created. From Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) to Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) to Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to Cinna (Lenny Kravtiz), this movie defied all odds.I have nothing negative to say about this movie, it was a movie that will stand up against one other movie this year. A movie of a test of time standing still for one immortal girl, one immortal boy and clan that will have to meet their end in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2.But for The Hunger Games, thank you Suzanne for sharing your world with us. Thank you Gary Ross for your excellence in movie making. And thank you to the cast – you outshone and maybe just maybe in Catching Fire we will see more of your brilliant work.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Given that, seeing this movie with an open mind still lead to far more questions and contradictions that just didn't add up. I also saw this movie with someone who did read the first book, and they were just as puzzled. Simply put, there's far too much left out in the screen play, that, if I was to be enticed to read the book after ... I wouldn't. There's nothing here. It's another story of humans hunting humans in a forest for sport. Been done. Several times. And are we supposed to be shocked that children are hunting children? C'mon, you can read more shocking stuff in local newspapers about what kids are doing to each other that's far more disturbing. Entertainment value is gambled on the marketing toward the Twilight/pre-teen vampire/I hate you/I love you angst group that will eat this up. But that's about it. Sadly, I couldn't get my money back, but at least I'll save a few bucks by skipping reading any of these stories.","18 out of 37 found this helpful.

I highly recommend it for young adults and those in their 20s, which is when I first read it and saw the movies. My peers had high praise for it and I'm glad they introduced me to the novels and that they came out with movies. It's one of the first in my time to star a main character as female and not stereotype her lack of affection and vulnerability as a male-sounding, asexual being. The female characters are more authentic here compared to the movies I grew up with and get to have a complicated story other than being some geek in need of a makeover. The movie follows the book well and the story is well organized. I do not recommend it for those younger than adolescents. My pre-teen nieces had no empathy for Katniss and believed the book was unnecessary complicated. They said none of it would happen if she didn't defend Peeta. It was obvious their young naivety and lack of education in history and politics due to their young status impeded their ability to understand the story at all. I told them to wait until they start learning about governments in history and they went silent realizing that they had no idea the story was more grown up than they knew. (They didn't even know what world war 2 was and or who Hitler was.) The political games between Snow and Coin are so real, too. I have nothing to dislike and nothing bad to say about the movie nor book except for one thing: I don't understand why the author made Katniss a cat hater. At least she's not abusive, but still...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure, we don't outright kill them but again, the books and the movies are ALLEGORY. Instead, our society tends to punish the kids who don't belong, the kids who are brown or black, the kids who for no fault of their own, are not the chosen of the Capitol.

You people who gave this crappy movie a high rating confirm my worst fears, i.e., American film=goers can't possibly be any dumber. The ONLY reason I went to see this movie was because I liked director Gary Ross's work in ""Seabiscuit,"" which was an enjoyable and well-crafted film featuring fine actors and a wonderful true story. In THG, Ross has lousy source material to work with, true, but also his deft directorial ability is largely absent here as he caves into CGI, an ever-shaky camera and truly pathetic actors. The entire plot was preposterous from beginning to end and so predictable as to make me root for our ""hero"" and ""heroine"" to eat the berries and finally be done with it. But no, there has to be a sequel, doesn't there? It's pointless to try to critique this film because those ""who get it"" clearly are either on delusion-inducing drugs or have the I.Q. of a fence post.Finally, what's happened to Stanley Tucci, who has done some good work in film but lately is playing queer roles, starting with Devil Wears Prada.

In all honesty, based on the trailer and hype, it just didn't seem to grab me and none of my friends really seemed interested either. Some of my favorite films in the action/fantasy genre include the original Star Wars films, Many super hero films such as the dark knight and iron man, the first two terminators, etc. so the Hunger Games didn't seem to be up my ally. Since then, I have come to learn that two of my closer friends were actually big fans of the first Hunger Games film. With the release of the second film coming this weekend, and with the convenience of the it's availability on netflix, I decided to watch the 2012 film last night.I don't regret giving it a shot at all. I was very pleased with what I watched! First, I am going to talk about the negative aspects of the film in my opinion, just to get them out of the way. The pacing of the first hour is just a tad slow. Nothing painful, and it does make the later parts of the film all the more thrilling, but it does move just a teeny bit slower than needed. I wasn't particularly fond of Josh Hutcherson's performance. Also, the cgi within the last 20 minutes looked a little fake. Some of the make up on some of the characters were a little silly. They looked like they came right out of Ron Howard's 2000 film How the Grinch stole Christmas. But these characters don't have massive roles or anything, and it's a very minor complaint. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point.Now on to the good stuff. I fell in love with Jennifer Lawrence in this movie. She's a very good actress and is very attractive. She's my new celebrity crush. I really cared about the character she played, Katniss. This had to be at least 60% because of the gorgeous actress and maybe 40% because of the script. The fact that I cared so much about this Katniss was in peril, I very enthusiastically routed for her. The story was also interesting and fairly creative. I haven't read the book it's based on, so I can't say how it works as an adaptation or if it does great justice to the source material. As someone who knew very little about The Hunger Games going in however, I think they did a good job.I touched on the performances a little bit. I mentioned that I though Jennifer Lawrence was perfect, and how I didn't care for Josh Hutcherson. As for the performances as a whole, I think the movie was pretty solid though. Woody Harrelson was probably the second best actor in the film and played one of the more memorable characters. Everyone else was serviceable for the film. While I said I thought the pacing of the first hour was a little slow (which was very slight), the remainder of the film flew by. I was glued to the screen. There was a surprising amount of violence. I was expecting the film to be on the lighter side of the pg-13 rating, while it was actually quite the opposite.If the film took the violence any further, it would have easily gotten an R rating. I think this works very well for the film as it makes the world seem all the more realistic and dangerous, and makes the drama more effective. There are actual deaths in the film as well, which I didn't expect, which also added to this. If people die in this world, that also means that the main protagonist can die as well, which raises the stakes. There are also quite a few interesting twists and role reversals in the film that keep you invested.Overall, if you are skeptical about this movie as I was, I recommend at least giving it a shot. If you get to the 80 minute mark, and are not satisfied, then you can turn it off, but I urge you to get at least that far before forming an opinion. I went into the movie expecting something targeted towards children around the ages 7-12, while in fact it seems to target a bit of an older crowd, probably between 12 and 18. It also managed to please me, a 21 year old. This movie was very entertaining, and I expect great things from the sequel.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The film is set in a post-apocalyptic North America, where the citizens are separated into districts based on economic status. To keep each district from rebelling against the people in a higher power, the Hunger Games, a fight to the death between randomly chosen individuals from each district, is held every year. The storyline follows the main character, Katniss Everdeen, throughout her nail-biting experience in the 75th annual Hunger Games. The film gives an alternative perspective on war. The Hunger Games is a movie that engages and transports the audience into the fictional world.
The Hunger Games was originally a book written by Suzanne Collins, but due to its popularity, made into a movie directed by Gary Ross. Throughout the film, it takes the details from the novel and displays that in the sets. The backgrounds perfectly portrayed the poverty of district twelve to the wealth of district one. More importantly, even though the characters are in different situations as much of the audience, such as participating in the Hunger Games, the audience is still able to connect to cast. The movie is very much like the book, but instead of imagining what this world looks like, the viewer is automatically inside of it. On the other hand, at times the film is difficult to follow if the individual is not paying full attention because minor details help piece the plot together.
The film forces the viewer not only to feel Katniss' emotions but what it would be like to partake in the Games. The Hunger Games is a movie made to take the audience out of any existing comfort zone and show an alternative perspective on the future of the Earth. However, due to the mature themes and violence, the movie should be recommended to people over the age of 13. The Hunger Games should be given 5/5 stars because, despite the outlandish idea, the movie still manages to relate to the audience through the well thought out characters and the relationships built during the plot. The Hunger Games series, while at times confusing, will open one's eyes up to a new version of the world and better movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Clearly meant for teenagers: trite romance; contrived, hole- filled plot; Disney-style happy ending. (Though at 2 1/2 hours it is way too long for teenagers' concentration spans). However, as far as teen- oriented movies go, it is still better than Twilight, though that doesn't say much.Take out most of the first hour or so, as this was all just padding and didn't develop the characters or plot much; give it a more realistic, gritty feel and take out the Disney romance, sentimentality and ending and this could have been a decent movie. In its current form it is boring and crap.If you want a good, gritty, Last Person Standing / Survival of the Fittest -type movie, watch Battle Royale instead.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

I think the fear comes from imagining Trump in the role of President Snow and Great Britain being District 12. Mostly because I can believe it could happen.This film shows us what the world would be like after a big war, where they choose to send teenagers in to a ring for slaughter, to balance out the fact they don't fight any more (Because that makes sense, right?) Meanwhile, some people live better, happier lives than others. It also shows us how people with good morals can react in certain situations. I'd hope I could hide out long enough for everyone else to kill each other, without me having to hurt anyone myself, but like some in this film, I would probably go a little bit mad and retaliate accordingly.It's a horrible thought, that we might be near such a future as this and I really must stop watching films like this for that reason. There are very few films nowadays that show a future I would like to live in. Even the newer Star Trek's show our future selves to not be as enlightened as we would hope to be by the 23rd century.I really like this one though and I can't wait to read the books. Roll on ""Catching Fire"" next weekend, when the nephews return for the next movie instalment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The character of Katniss was not particularly likable (the author even went to great lengths to have Katniss state that herself a few times). The story line was a bit forced, but that is acceptable in a young adult title. It was a quick read overall, and that made the net gain (in the Hunger Games book) worth the time spent reading. A fast paced action story.The movie decided it would use shaky cameras for dramatization. Not just when it might actually add drama (like when viewing the District 12 area for the first time) but throughout the entire movie. And I think the director might have ordered the cameraman to shake the camera particularly hard during major action sequences.The net effect is, the action sequences are a huge blur, a moment of clarity, a huge blur, action done. Taking the action out of an action story pretty much misses the whole point.If you read the books and enjoyed the well written action, don't bother with the movie.","29 out of 65 found this helpful.

Because of many action scenes, it contains a lot of tension. But there are also touching scenes which make the film sentimental. The story is compelling and also understandable for people who did not read the book. The introduction explains the situation of the character's life well, so that the audience can follow the subsequent storyline. The actors perform their role heavenly, so they act convincing. They are well chosen, so they match into the atmosphere. The costumes and the make-up underline the story and are conducive to the ambiance. Based on the clothes, you can notice the life situations of the characters. The backdrops of landscape and sceneries seem real and they are animated well. The same applies to the special effects. They are not used too often, but they are, like in every new film, amazing. I also love the soundtrack. It is fantastic, touching and matches the feeling of every scene perfectly. The method of utilizing no music is also used because the missing of music sometimes expresses more than every piece of music. The film ""The Hunger Games"" is very close to the book. That's why it is the best adaptation we have seen for a long time. This film is unique because there are just a few films which have this kind of ending. This ending whets the audience's interest for the next parts. All in all the film is a perfect mixture of action packed and sad scenes. It is a good choice to watch the recommendable film.

The Hunger Games is a fight aired on television where two teenagers are chosen from each district and they fight to their death. In total, 24 people fight in the hunger games. Only one person is supposed to be left alive.In Hunger Games, the main characters are Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence)and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). It is a movie that is based of a book by Suzanne Collins. It is only the first movie in the series, there are 2 more books, but the movies for the last one isn't out yet. I think teenagers would like this movie the most. I like how Jennifer Lawrence portrays the character of Katniss and you can see true emotion behind her acting. I don't like all the fighting and the blood though, I think it's kind of disgusting. Basically, 2 people are chosen from each district (they are districts 12) and they fight to death with everyone from the other districts. The name of this fight is the hunger games. I love the plot of the hunger games, there are a lot of plot twists and everything that happens is stuff that I wasn't expecting. Overall, I think Hunger Games is an amazing movie but they could have shown less fighting scenes. The way everything is acted out is so amazing, it makes you believe that they are actually sad at someone's death. I love this movie, and it is definitely one of my favorites.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Once a year, the Capitol chooses two people from each district to participate in the Hunger Games (a punishment for past rebellions). In this tournament, 23 participants will die and the survivor will obtain economic and resource benefits upon their return to their district.The protagonist is Katniss Everdeen who offers herself as a participant in the games, in order to save her little sister.

A writer who can't even come up with her own ideas shouldn't be credited for anything at all, especially a writer who steals the basic concept of one idea and makes a few changes. Movie sucks, the book is a rip off simple as that. I personally found it very upsetting that Suzanne Collins even denies every hearing or knowing about Battle Roayle, a straight lie. Which shouldn't be hard for anyone involved in the movie business. Even Mr. Tarantino says Battle Royale has been his ""favorite movie of the last 20 years"" The fact that stuck up Suzanne Collins would deny the fact she has never heard of this and that the idea for this book came up of thin air is disgusting.

The story is post-apocalyptic and centers around a girl, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence), who must fight to stay alive when she volunteers in her sister Prim's (Willow Shields) place in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is an annual fight to the death occurrence in the fictitious nation of Panem, which consists of a Capital and twelve districts. The Games is means of punishing by the Capital against the poor districts because of rebellions that happened in the past. At the Reaping (lottery), each district must offer a boy and a girl (called tributes) to fight in the Games. The sole survivor of the Games is rewarded with fame and riches to last for their rest of their lives. The premise of the movie is the strength of character and how hope can flourish from just a small spark. Katniss must leave her best friend, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), unstable mother (Paula Malcomson), and younger sister behind as she is paired up with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) in the Games. Katniss and Peeta are joined on their journey to the Capital by former Games victors, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks). Katniss and Peeta, who become portrayed as star-crossed lovers thanks to Peeta, become unlikely favorites as the Games get underway. The televised competition is fierce and unforgiving as tributes die off either on account of fighting or the contrived elements of the Games. Katniss and Peeta are the last ones alive, but soon discover the Capital only wants one to win. A quick ploy by Katniss disrupts this plan and both are proclaimed victors, but not without upsetting the President (Donald Sutherland).Throughout the movie, the audience watches Katniss as she bravely fights against all odds. Although she may not be as highly trained as some of the tributes, she is passionate about staying alive for her sister and mother back home. Although a kind person, she takes on the role of hunter as she plays the games to win. She somehow manages to walk the line between being ""good"" at the Games and still defiant of the Capital's imperious ways. Although none of the tributes deserve their untimely deaths, the audience roots for Katniss as she skillfully plays the game. The movie is reminiscent of The Running Man (1987), a science fiction-action movie where ""contestants"", who were convicted killers, must ward off killers in a televised slaughter. Like the Games, the main character, Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a wrongfully convicted man who ultimately is fighting a resistance against the government. Although he must participate in the deaths of his fellow contestants, Richards is victorious and the movie ends with hope. The Games has both magnificent colors and special effects to portray the brilliance of the characters and life in general in the Capital. District 12 is a drab, dark place where people are struggling to stay alive. Everyone wears shabby clothes and their homes are anything but fancy. But when Katniss and Peeta arrive at the Capital, the colors are vibrant and the scenery comes to life. The people of the Capital wear extraordinary costumes and makeup and live in palace-like buildings. The lights of the city are bright and everything is clean. The people of the Capital truly live in a different world. The Games, although fictitious, represents a future world that occurs as the result of the oppression of the common people. It takes the courage and bravery of one young woman to ignite the spirit of the people. Although she must fight for her life while taking the lives of others, she becomes a ray of light for her dark world. Katniss, through her bravery and character, beat President Snow at his own Game (literally) and began a revolution that inspired broken spirits.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And unlike every other bad review its not because something didn't match up with the book...1: This should have been an adult rated film: and I'm not saying that because I'm against kids watching anything gory. I watched the shining when I was 6 (even though a theater filled with unsupervised teenyboppers was greatly annoying especially since they talk through every preview except that sparkling vampire crap)... I'm saying this because the movie needed a more realistic gore. Every time you are about to see any kind of physical damage it cuts out that angle. this brings me to my next point.2: Who edited this movie?: From the very beginning of the movie to the bitter end there is senseless shaky-cam and 180 cuts, theirs even a cut just about every second and a half. This movie moves so fast it gives you a headache and I wish I was taking about the story line.3: Combine my first two points into one whopping one: The worst part of this movie is that you wait sooo long for anything cool to happen, through the yawns you finally get to start seeing action, and then what happens? faster cuts and ten times the shaky cam. If you try and watch these scenes yer eyes would cross. That right there sums it up, you wait for a good scene then you cant even watch it...(The only way this movie has gotten any good reviews is from the teenagers they decided to make this for.. Lets look at the kinds of cinematic expertise they have in there favorite selection: Twilight, high school musical, ... I'm sorry I don't know any teen spawned crap flics kinda happy I don't they give me a headache.) Any teenager reading this that is angry give it 6-10 years go back and watch it and see if I'm right.","33 out of 76 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A good movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2809506/?ref_=tt_urv","Rebe_gonzalez","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42700787/?ref_=tt_urv","8 June 2013","""The Hunger Games"" By: Rebeca Gonzalez Few months ago, I watched the movie ""The Hunger Games"" directed by Gary Ross and based on a novel, with the same name, by Suzanne Collins. To start I would like to say that I am a huge fan of the book and therefore I would like to give out my opinion in regards of the things I liked about the movie and at the same time the things that I disliked about it. It is a movie that contains action, adventure and science fiction all at once, and due to that the audience can easily either feel a connection with the movie right away or simply don't like it at all. The movie is based on government's oppression towards the population. The movie takes place in the ruins of a nation known as Panem, a place once known as North America, where twelve districts are manipulated by a shining Capitol. Long ago, the districts waged war on the Capitol, showing their rebellious desperation towards their oppression, but they were defeated by the Capitol. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send as tribute, one girl and one boy to appear in an annual television event called ""The Hunger Games"", a fight to death on live television. Sixteen year-old Katniss Everdeen, (Jennifer Lawrence) who lives with her mother and sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games along with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. Even though the book and the movie present differences in regards of the cast, both main characters portray exactly what both author and director wanted. In one hand Katniss is presented as a simple girl that is trying to protect her family, which considers herself one of the rest, which in the other hand, Peeta struggles to get what he wants and at the same time try to fully represent his district. The main difference is that in the book, their situation, as teenagers that have to struggle with death and love is more precise and you know exactly each though they have, while in the movie, you as the audience, have to infer their feelings and try to keep up with their situation. Even though the main characters did a good job in portraying their role, other secondary actors didn't such as Effie Trinket, due to the fact that the audience can see how fake her character is, and at the same time how over reacting her expressions are. Every movie has its ups and downs and despite the fact that I enjoyed the movie, there are several things I didn't like and actually liked. One of the things that cached my attention the most was the colors they used in every scene. Every scene had a particular color, and that was used to demonstrate the feelings and situation each character was going through. In matter of fact, an example would be the costumes the Capitol residents used versus the color of costumes the district residents had. For example, the scene where Effie is about to pronounce the tributes, everybody is wearing neutral colors, such as white or gray, while she is wearing a striking purple. As I mentioned before, her fake expressions and striking colors were just elements the director used to emphasize all the attention on her and at the same time make her represent the wealthy class rather than the lower- oppressed class. In the contrary, one of the things that I disliked the most about the movie was that the director emphasized much more on details rather than major scenes. My point here is that the director rushed through the movie. The main objective of the movie should have been the one of giving relevance to the title, but instead more than half of the movie is based on teenagers being chosen to represent their district. The point here is that the interesting parts such as the teenagers struggling and fighting for survival was rushed, so the audience had no time to experiment their situation. The setting of the movie, especially the one in the woods was amazing. The setting helped the audience understand the difficulties the actors had and also revealed the qualities each had in the movie. One of the best scenes in the movie was when Katniss, still fighting for survival, demonstrated the authorities that they might have power, but she still has emotions and respect for the other districts, and no matter what they would do to her, she stood up and proved them wrong. The strong dispute between the rebellious populations towards the Capitol is what makes the movie interesting. The fact that they are fighting for survival, to cause joy to the wealthy ones, and the fact that they have to make choices in regards of their death, just to represent their district, are the main things that makes the audience like the movie, and actually connect with it. Sometimes the message is much more important than the image, as it can be seen in ""The Hunger Games"". The movie managed to show the audience that instead of fighting with authority, we have to work with it, because they are what sustains us and leads us to the future. I support the PG 13 rating the movie received, but I would rate this movie with an R. Even though the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience, there is violence presented throughout. The movie deals with themes such as survival, oppression, governmental control, grief and resignation, so despite the fact that there is little graphical violence, there is no way a kid could understand the reality in which the actors are placed in and the strong criticism the movie is demonstrating.

So that the survival portion when playing hunger games seems a little small, especially with the handling of the camera which is very confusing for me, I don't know if that's the concept.

Fictional yes, but highly imaginable to what it could all become like in another 50 to 100 years from now. I loved it. Thought the characters were well picked among the up and coming talent we have today. I would totally let my children watch as opposed to some of what I wouldn't like Silence of the Lambs etc..... when my child was younger and then was sickened when I found out he watched it at another parents home. I look forward to hopefully more movies like this which allow a movie goer to escape in something out of the ordinary and all too obvious films that you already know how they are going to end.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

ANYONE -- I dare you! Answer one simple question that should be so obvious it's ridiculous: What the hell has HUNGER to do with the PLOT???!!! They're not fighting over food...they're not trying to FIND food... But maybe I'm not supposed to understand. Maybe I'm supposed to read the book to understand. Just like ""Seabiscuit.""But that's just the tip of the pathetic iceberg. Definitely hard to know where to start the postmortem on this turd...but let's begin with the camera-work.. and I use that term loosely. For years, the Shakicam style -- jerky, hand-held zooms and sudden, erratic pans (not to be confused with good, hand-held documentary work) has gained popularity in both movies and television. It probably started on TV shows such as""NYPD Blue,"" then later, ""The Office."" I guess the idea is to simulate documentary filmmaking, or reality filmmaking, or whatever the hell they call it these days. Movies like ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch Project"" used this style to convince audiences they were watching a home movie. Fine -- they made their point.But somebody want to tell me WHAT THE HELL HAS ""HUNGER GAMES"" GOT TO DO WITH A HOME MOVIE SOMEONE SHOT WITH THEIR CAMCORDER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!What was Gary Ross trying to prove? It can't have been Tom Stern's fault (Eastwood's current favorite cameraman). He's been shooting extremely steady shots, from tripods, for years. You know, normal scenes you can actually follow that aren't a blurred, frantic jumble of swish pans and out-of-focus abstract images. The only explanation is that Ross, a middle-aged guy with absolutely NO connection to the average teenager or 20-something, must have figured this was the way to play down to the demographic that loved the book. The shaky ""reality"" look is the only way to be ""hip"" -- and show teens this is really their movie, part of their generation, part of their reality-TV/camcorder/mumble-core/Internet upbringing. Right?!?Wrong. What an awful, misguided miscalculation. For this disastrous decision alone, Ross should be banished from the DGA. Strung up and publicly tortured. Maybe required to suffer through his own ""hunger"" game (whatever the hell that means -- I'm still not sure).I won't go into the how stupid and clichéd the script is, how it rips off ""The Running Man"" and ""Westworld"" and ""Rollerball""... or how the idiotic, contrived ""happy"" ending with Catnip Whatever and her cross-eyed, pseudo boyfriend hammered the final pitiful nail into the coffin of this pitiful attempt at cashing in on a book series by launching a money-making movie ""franchise.""Let's just say this putrid waste of celluloid is an embarrassment to the world of cinema and a permanent black mark that will never be washed off the once-opulent silver screen.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Its premise could hardly be more violent, more brutal, more cynical more inhumane: As a punishment for a long forgotten rebellion against a totalitarian state that has long replaced the United States as we know them today, but more importantly as entertainment for the rich, privileged and bored, 24 children and teenagers between the ages of 12 and 18 are forced to slaughter each other until only one remains. Yet the series has become a huge success among younger readers, rivalling that of the Harry Potter or the Twilight books. And it is threatening to do the same on the big screen: Even measured against the giant expectations, the first film has been a huge success. And all this without holding anything back, with a bleak, unforgiving, completely anti-escapist view of the world. The Hunger Games is a frighteningly honest defense of humanity that is heavy on its destructive, merciless, selfish side as well as a stinging indictment of today's media culture. For the ""Hunger Games"" are nothing other than excellent ""Reality TV"" brought to its logical conclusion.The film centers around Katniss, a tough teenage girl acting as the surrogate mother for her little sister and takes her place when the latter is picked in the lottery that determines the ""games'"" participants. Jennifer Lawrence has proved in Winter's Bone that she can carry her film with her strength, her truthfulness, her complete and utter believability and she does so again here. Her Katniss is a young girl grown before her time, stubborn, angry, harsh. She has built a protective shell around her which hides her vulnerability and fears. She is forced to be brave, she has no choice but she is only human and she remains so.One of the film's aspect is a carefully told coming of age story as Katniss finds her inner strength without losing her compassion and the fear that makes her human. Accepting no advice at first she learns to trust others, to forge alliances, to play the game. First and foremost, she learns how to survive: from her fellow combatant Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is much faster on the uptake and sheds his pride more easily to do what needs to be done or from her jaded, hard-drinking but ultimately decent mentor (Woody Harrelson). As the ""games"" advance she understand she needs to become part of the game and walk the thin line between accepting the necessary and staying true to herself. Peeta is more easily willing to give up his pride but he never loses side of his primary goal: Even if he must die, he wants to remain himself even in death. Play the game if you must but remain the player not just the pawn the others see in you. On the other side are those competitors who have been trained for years to do this, who don't know anything else than kill. They have been stripped of their souls, turned into sad figures for whom death is delivery from a life they lost long ago.For a film targeted at a younger audience, The Hunger Games paints a surprisingly honest picture of the mechanisms of totalitarianism. It is not just the cruel spectacle itself, it is the discrepancy between the comic-like splendour of the ruling ""Capitol"" and the oppressed, starving 12 district, the use of spectacle to build a fake community, to distract as well as scare, to keep the people from thinking from themselves. Donald Sutherland gives a chilling performance as the perfectly Machiavellian president. It is the trusted Roman concept of ""panem et circenses"", bread and games with a good measure of fear thrown in. The most important task is to keep people to think for themselves. Distracting them, making them focus on feeding their families, keeping them afraid of what will happen if they step out of line are mechanisms employed by dictators all over the world and throughout history and they are used and shown here.In addition, The Hunger Games is also a biting and disturbing satirical unmasking of the workings of television and other means to manipulate the masses. What might seem harmless enough in our society can only too easily be made to serve any purpose at all. The ""games"" are first and foremost brilliant entertainment, gripping, full of suspense and nail- biting intensity, a perfectly produced TV show personified in Stanley Tucci's unsettlingly excellent showmaster. More than once the audience find themselves the the role of the spectator, drawn into voyeurist mode, enjoying this a little too much. It is the basic principle of the ancient gladiator battles as well as today's ""Reality TV"". Others' suffering is our entertainment, their humiliation or triumph. There is something thoroughly totalitarian in this and the film does a great job at showing this, giving the viewer an uneasy feeling about being entertained.There is much more to be said: about the skillful use of the hand-held camera to convey the fear, the the horror, the stark reality behind the entertainment, the fact that people are paying the ultimate price for others to have fun; the frightening realism which never make one feel this to be a distant future; the brilliant cast that fills these characters with more life than we can handle. The Hunger Games may cater to the same market as Twilight and the like, but it does not play in the same league, it does not even play the same game. Director Gary Ross has turned Suzanne Collins' novel into a gripping film which makes no compromises and does not spare the audience. And they still love it. Maybe Hollywood has underestimated their audience in the past? It can only be hoped the message is not lost.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is as if all the worst hair and clothes designers in the world were recruited to attempt a futuristic frolic filled with oh-so-outrageous fashions and it just looks clownish, not creative.It is a mix of a dark concept with a light approach. We have teens killing each other with PG-13 violence. So we have a disturbing concept spun to be appetizing. All of the sociological statements are so muddled and thrown away ending up pointless. There is nothing gripping or anything that for one minute seems frightening or fearsome. It is all handled with such a feathery touch that the deaths come and go without any feeling of loss or lament. Even the lame attempt at a flowery funeral is without much pathos. The Romeo and Juliet affair is also so unbelievable and the rules of the game change so much it has a dizzying rather than a dramatic effect. It is all so detached and diluted, the movie can't decide where it is going or what it wants to be. A complete catastrophe with so many unfulfilled elements that are just confusing and confounding. It remains a half-baked, horrendous mish-mash of a movie that doesn't bother to be anything but dumb-downed dreariness.This is just so bad that it is sobering. A wake-up call for all to take a second look and demand some first-rate entertainment.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

With Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson being the stand outs. The only con to The Hunger Games is the use of shaky cam throughout the whole film which can makes some scenes Jar and take you out of the moment. There are a couple of scenes where shaky cam works to capture the panic and realism of the world.The production designer did an amazing with the sets and costumes which stand out within the film. This helps captures the themes of the film. Overall this film is 100% worth a watch!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Really good story, I totally love the concept, I always adore such type of new thought that gives and leaves in you deep print of freshness of the idea of the whole story: Completely different future world (not like classical seeing of future in movies such as Robocop, Terminator and alike). It's just something else, that gives excitement: different adventure type, different future world, life, survival, and some fresh simple faces like Jenifer Lawrence. Just like in ''DIVERGENT(2014)''.It's all good for me. I just wish the whole movie's quality has just been a little bit better. Just like in ""DIVERGENT"". God, I loved DIVERGENT too. But it lacked in (a little bit) quality the same way, by me. Such fabulous, tremendous, extraordinary ideas deserve a bit more attention and a bit better filming. FYI I loved loved so much the movies, just felt that something was missing. And I want to thank the film makers and the creator of the idea. Impressive and affecting work done.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Forget the suspense and dystopian drama; let's talk about the real stars of the show: the Capitol's fashion designers. I mean, who doesn't want to rock a hat that triples as a fruit-fruit bowl or...or to wear a flaming dress? (Katniss' outfit was good too, though. I guess.) It does lead me to wonder... what the chungus would happen if Katniss or Peeta were to let one loose? What I mean is, would the whole audience spontaneously combust if Kit-Kat and Pita Bread were to cut the cheese, toot, flatulate? You get the important idea. Honestly, that would give me quite the thrill! I would let out a gasp, clasp my hands, jump up from my couch and shout ""Where there's a will there's a way!""
Okay, okay. Now I am aware you're thinking, ""Right, but what does all of this have to do with what we're discussing? Which is, of course, Hungry Hungry Hippos!"" I'll get there eventually. Just you wait. Chin up, pip pip!I'm gonna stray from the duck's herd and write to you readers what I suppose is a ""unique"" review. Mi mama always told me, ""gosh darn it! You'll never amount to anything you worthless sack of meat. Now go."" But she ALSO told me, ""tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them."" So therefore, that is the approach I will be approaching for writing this review. I'm gonna tell you about how much I partook joyness in this television show. Okay, I just told you. Now, least but not last, just to recapulate I told you about how I'm going to tell you how much I adored this movie show.Beware! Here's where the review goes wrong. I was on cumulonimbus cloud 56 when my one and only friend informed me about this new and forthcoming movie: ""The Famished Competition"". What did I think to myself when I heard that title? ""Speak of the devil..."" and I proceeded to roll my eyes for two hours, froth and foam at the mouth and thus began my weekly exorcism. After exiting a 10-week coma from a laundry folding challenge gone wrong, I finally clicked that play button with my crusty thumb. You guys out there know what that's like. Hahahahahhahahha! I would take the scary chances to say that I probably laughed and cried for about three thirds of the movie.""WOAH! That just happened."" Is what I said verbatim after Katniss said her first lines in the movie. Moving on. The REAL STAR of the show is Effie Trinket, the human Peacock who deserves an award for her ability to announce tragic deaths with an unsettling level of enthusiasm. ""And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, the death of District 9's tribute! Drumroll, please!"" That line made me laugh so hard that I had to absolutely MASH that pause button on my Panasonic, Direct TV 2016 TV remote and get up and laugh at my 60'' electronic television set. I laughed for a solid fifteen minutes and... oopsies... viewers, I accidentally peed my pants! But any true fan of the Hunger Wars will relate to that. Anyway, I had a very rough time re-gaining my composition and keeping a straight face after that seen ever since.Talk about being hungry! I aggressively salivated un-dis-intermittently while watching this movie due to their unhealthy obsession with bread. If you're unfamiliar with bread, like most families can and shall be in the future, it's the yeast of the gods and goddesses.Can the odds be in your liking evermore? Can they? Will they? Or maybe you should even dare to ask yourself... should they?Look, in summary, I'm not one who normally counts their chickens before their roosters but this movie blew me away irregardless.This is your Starving Games #1 fan, lover, and secret admirer signing off. And as always, may the chances be always in your odds.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games it is a science fiction, drama and action movie. The movie is directed by Gary Ross, he is known for writing and directing the fantasy comedy-drama film, Pleasantville (1998).
I think the The Hunger Games plot is fascinating because the story is about a poor society controlled by de government, there are 12 districts and each district choose two persons to fight to entertain the government, the persons that are selected has to fight with others and kill them to survive.
Katniss and Peeta Mellark, the protagonists, were selected by their district but only one can survive, Peeta is in love with Katniss and he wants her to win but she is a really good person.
Katniss Everdeen is a really brave woman that protected her sister and fought for her. That was very moving for me.
I think Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence, who has Katniss Everdeen role, is a brilliant protagonist in the movie, in my opinion, her acting is always good.
Also I think Joshua Ryan Hutcherson, who has Peeta Mellark role, has a nice and very cute role in the movie.
I felt very emotive when Katniss sang ""Deep in the Meadow"" for other girl who was murdered in the fight because that girl reminded her of his sister. The song is composed by the British musician, Sting.
I also like the special effects because all of them are really amazing. In the movie is very usual to look the special effects, for example, in the Katniss dress, in the fight when the managers throwing fireballs, the big dog at the end of the movie,etc.
In the movie, there are a variety of nice scenes, the place where Katniss Everdeen lives is actually Henry River Mill Village and it is in North Carolina, also in the movie you can see North Carolina forests and a lot of beatiful places.
The film is long, at over two hours and twenty minutes, but all the time is gripping and exciting.
In my opinion, The Hunger Games is a really thought-provoking movie because we maybe one day can be in a similar situation in our country because of the bad government.
I have enjoyed every time I have seen it, so I really recommend you see The Hunger Games.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Simply the concept of this film leaves something to think about, especially when we live in a capitalist world where only the strongest and those who get the best are the only ones who survive and progress. One of the best movies of the 2010's. My rating for this movie is 9/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is a very good adaptation, but mostly for people who have read the book because the movie is not dumb-ed down. The wild clothing and make-up of the people of ""The Capital"" is a bit much visually and maybe that could have been toned down a bit, but if you understand how it came about (because you read the book) it makes sense. Because of the violence this movie is for adults only. And I'd say the movie is for (real) sci-fi fans only.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the movie follows the story of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a strong-willed and determined young woman who volunteers to compete in the Hunger Games, a brutal competition in which 24 teenagers fight to the death until only one remains.The movie is based on the popular book series by Suzanne Collins, and it does a great job of bringing the story to life on the big screen. The visuals are stunning, and the world-building is excellent. From the bustling Capitol to the desolate District 12, the movie does a great job of immersing the viewer in the world of Panem.Jennifer Lawrence delivers a fantastic performance as Katniss, perfectly capturing the character's strength, vulnerability, and determination. She's a fierce warrior, but she's also a loving sister and friend, and Lawrence does a great job of balancing those two sides of the character. Josh Hutcherson is also great as Peeta Mellark, the boy from District 12 who is chosen to compete in the Hunger Games alongside Katniss. He's sweet, charming, and brave, and he forms a great bond with Katniss throughout the movie.One of the things I loved about The Hunger Games is how it explores the consequences of a society that values entertainment over human life. In Panem, the Hunger Games are a way for the Capitol to keep the districts in line, and they're broadcasted to the entire nation as a form of entertainment. The movie does a great job of showing how the people in the Capitol are completely disconnected from the horrors of the games, and how they view the tributes as nothing more than characters in a TV show. It's a sobering commentary on our own society's obsession with reality TV and celebrity culture.The Hunger Games is also a great action movie. The games themselves are incredibly intense, with lots of thrilling action and suspenseful moments. The movie does a great job of keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat, wondering who will survive and who won't. There are also some great fight scenes, particularly between Katniss and the other tributes. The movie doesn't shy away from the violence of the games, but it also doesn't glorify it. It's a difficult balance to strike, but the movie pulls it off well.Overall, I would highly recommend.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A bankrupt,hungry, dysfunctional and soulless North American country called Panem stages a fight to the death epic featuring teenagers from ages 12 to 18 from the 12 Districts to compete. They train all their lives-sort of like former East German Olympians -for this event where they have to face explosions, fires, being shot at and attacks from rabid wild dogs among other things all filmed on a jerky nausea inducing hand held camera. A backwoods teen with the unlikely name of Katniss Everdeen replaces her sister who was ""chosen"" to compete, and therefore she must train to prepare for the games. Highly deriverative film ""borrows"" elements from ""The Most Dangerous Game"", ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Rollerball"" "", ""Battle Royal"" and last but not least ""The Runing Man The games themself are a cross between ""Gladiator"" , ""Fear Factor""and ""Survivor"", and are quite graphc as teen after teen is eliminated while a zombie like population is forced to watch. The set up takes about half the film's lenght to get there, and once the games begin, the violence starts. Film totally misses the mark because it takes itself way, way to seriously. It would have worked a lot better if it was made as a black comedy or a satire on the so called ""reality shows"" the author Suzanne Collins obviously based these books on, but no attempt is made to correlate the two. Jennifer Lawrence and the mostly no name cast is good, but they don't do very much other than act grim and self determined to succeed at their tasks. As I have already said ,what this film desperately needs is a tongue in cheek sense of humor to help the story move and lighten things up a bit, but the fimmakers totally blew it. I'm sure the 'tween age girl target audience this film is aimed at probably doesn't remember ""The Running Man"" with Schwarzenneger where condemned criminals had to compete on a game show to fight for their lives. What made that film work was the dead -on satire , a keen sense of humor, the brilliant and hilarious one liners and the utterly improbable scenario that the audience ""got"" not too long after the film started. This one uses the same premise, but makes very poor use of it. I'm sure it will do good at the box office with all the hype its been getting, but you will definitely leave the multiplex feeling ""hungry"" for something more satisfying Also, don't be too surprised if you soon start hearing names like Katniss and Peta becoming popular after the drones who watch this overrated piece of drek deciede to name their offsprings as such .Another P-U movie review from Lou!","43 out of 104 found this helpful.

The film effectively manages to take the raw emotion of the book and transfer it to screen. This film makes you care about the characters and it gives you insight on some dystopian politics. This film has some good action scenes and some intense survival scenes, but I feel like this film is carried by the raw emotional power and the great acting.Gary Ross's film takes place in the country of Panem. There are 12 districts and every year each district has 2 young people who participate in the hunger games which involves one victor and everyone else dead. For this game, Katniss Everdeen volunteers in place of her sister and along with District 12 other player Peeta, they both go these violent games in the Capital and try to survive these games! The acting is nothing short of brilliant. Jennifer Lawrence is a young, talented actress who has a very broad emotional range. Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson are also nothing short of magnificent. Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland are also good in their roles. Finally, Elizabeth Banks probably has the best wardrobe I have seen in recent films.Overall, this is a fantastic adaptation of the original source novel. In many ways, this film improves on the novel. In the novel, I was not fond of Katniss's thinking. But luckily we did not have to deal with that here. Movie-wise, I was not fond of the shaky camera but thankfully it didn't take anything away from the film. I rate this film 10/10.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Woody harrelson really suits his hairstyle!It's a great start to the film series and no wonder it has become one of the most successful. May the odd be ever in your favour!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Hunger Games franchise is born proving not to underestimate the public, creating something new and modern and finds space for a series of social criticisms","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6642309/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","27 February 2021","In the distant future, a good part of the population is controlled by a totalitarian regime, which recalls this domain by holding an annual - and deadly - event among the 12 districts under its tutelage. To save her younger sister, young Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to represent her district in the competition and ends up counting on the company of Peeta Melark (Josh Hutcherson), challenging not only the dominant system, but also the strength of the other opponents.In this purest bread and circus, there is an interesting anthropological analysis, focused on the criticism of elites and corruption by power. In addition, the narrative always shows the main characters acting in their own interests, except for the pro-revolution mass, which, like Katniss, serves as an instrument of the Revolt. In addition to the dispute for power in several spheres, contemporary and real issues such as segregation, slave labor, abusive state and extreme poverty are present. Although Panem is a futuristic vision of the USA, it hyperbolically bears the traces of a strong capitalist state. What inspired the author Suzanne Collins to write the trilogy was the live broadcast of the Iraq War on American television, as well as the traditional reality shows, the Roman gladiators and the Greek myth of Theseus.As the author of the books was involved in the creation of the script, she wanted to remain faithful to the message of the source work and, with that, what we have on screen is a dynamic adventure, very well adapted to the cinema and that makes a point of dealing the subject in a more mature way, avoiding the trap of ""teen films"". Of all these recent great franchises, the first adaptation of Suzanne Collins' literary trilogy is the one with the most challenging content, with inspiration from great dystopic works such as Brave New World, the aforementioned 1984 and, in the next books, even Fahreinheit 451. Discussions about authority, celebrity worship, obedience, power and control are at stake in the story that takes place in the futuristic ruins of North America, divided into a capital and 12 districts.Starting from a premise that is frightening, due to the high level of violence inherent in the nature of the games - the participants, some preteens, have to kill each other -, Gary Ross manages, throughout the 144 minutes of the film, to keep the public interest. Its direction, as well as the script, balances action scenes and moments in which the complexity of the central characters has the chance to emerge, opening space to criticize a society that consumes itself, having as main entertainment the manipulation of other people's lives. . As it could not fail to be in a blockbuster, this critical bias is not the focus of the film. But it is always present, permeating the entire narrative and even having certain moments of greater attention. This social subplot, although contained, presents itself to a greater degree than usual for films of this size, with a commercial proposal and a youth target audience.The mature character in relation to other productions of the genre is a reflection of the competent direction of Gary Ross, who is concerned with approaching the theme with more drama and less romanticism and pyrotechnics. The first act is the best example of this atmosphere. The characters are patiently presented in their routine actions and we only get to know their personalities during the course of the plot. The clichés, which need to exist, are worked on in order to integrate them into the plot or the psychology of the characters, making them less uncomfortable. The soundtrack by T-Bone Burnett and James Newton Howard is limited to the brief transition sequences, remaining quite subtle, which provides space for silence in the most dramatic scenes. This gives a sober and realistic tone to the feature which, at least in this first part, does not push the viewer towards a kind of cheap emotional reaction.Ross even opts for a style of camera and editing in the action scenes that elegantly deviates from barbarism, giving glimpses of it, but taking out the graphic impact that could make them fetishists (and, obviously, make the film commercially viable in terms of indicative classification). The director presents all the important elements of the narrative without losing the rhythm, sometimes using flashbacks without dialogues, something that ends up valuing the film, given the air of seriousness that it prints, besides being efficient to expand the series mythology and the depth of the characters. With a well done montage, Ross manages, at the same time, to pass the impression of temporal passage and a frantic rhythm, which does not give the viewer much time to think, certainly to highlight the issue of manipulating images, but also to give a tone from documentary to film, he chose to use the ""camera in hand"" technique, which causes some strangeness at first, but which we get used to later. His style brings more urgency to the context of the story and, even though Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling exaggerate the crowded montage of quick cuts, it makes the experience a little more ""adult"" if we take into account the technical exhibition of most films aimed at the audience young.But it is the script that manages to stand out. First of all, it is encouraging to see that a well-formulated work - and full of allegories - has managed to find its way into teenager minds (this considering what something frivolous like The Twilight Saga has collected in recent years). Collins' plot owes credit to previous work, but it still creates something new and modern and finds space for a series of social criticisms. The initial mood is radically transformed when we are introduced to the program's consumers. The bizarre makeup and costumes designed by Judianna Makovsky refer to the artificiality of the people of the Capital. Extravagance and color are contrasted with the gray tones of the less favored population. Art directors John Collins, Robert Fechtman and Paul Richards bet on a simplistic and square architecture of the sets, as if everything was built just for practicality, with no human touch to the decorations. At this moment, we realize how much that society is a product and hostage of the old and always current policy of ""bread and circus"". And when it comes to media control (wouldn't the deplorable reality shows of certain national television networks be the ""The Hunger Games"" of our time? What if no one watched them anymore, as Katniss suggests?).The writers condense the story of the book without forgetting the most important aspects. There are several modifications of the original work, but extremely necessary for the adaptation to work in the audiovisual media in a satisfactory way. Characters are entirely cut out of the narrative and others have a very low profile (like Gale, for example), but if it were not so, the film would have fallen into the trap of trying to reproduce, not effectively adapting a story. Another interesting aspect of the script is the more constant presence of elements of science fiction, although the special effects, in many moments, but especially in the final sequence, are sufferable. We see not only futuristic hovercrafts and an extremely modern Capital, elements contained in the book, but we also participate in the control of the Games directly from the ""war"" room, in which Master Idealizer Seneca Crane and his team determine every detail of what happens in the arena, ""helping to remind the public of the artificiality of the arena"". And this character, which is only mentioned in the book, is very well developed in the film, as an element to allow the fluidity of the narrative. All this development ends up contributing to a more organic ending to the film, which does not create strangeness as in the book.Also to help in the narrative, we have several cuts for the presenter Caesar Flickerman, something like the presenter of this universe to the audience, to literally explain, without seeming artificial, several events in the games. For example, the explanation of genetically altered wasps would sound forced out of the mouth of any character in the arena, but for Flickerman, the narrative works very well. And the teen romance had its presence reduced to the exact measure, making Katniss's character even more believable than in the book.Anyway, The Hunger Games is a great action movie, with a lean script that could have had the effect of reducing its enormous duration. However, even with almost two and a half hours, the tape flows smoothly. The film entertains in the right measure and, incredible as it may seem, it makes one think, thanks to the base material that manages to go beyond a simple deadly competition and, also, to the author's talent also in the creation of a script that does not forget the non-aspects focused on action, something increasingly difficult to find in a Hollywood blockbuster. In times of reality shows, where the exposure of intimacy, social masks and personal judgments define our culture, nothing is more convenient than a film that pins these new customs precisely as a product consumed by the new generation. The Hunger Games franchise is born proving not to underestimate the public, delivering quality entertainment with openness to reflections more linked to our own real context.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A couple years ago I was a full time student at a private college I transferred to where we were given ""The Hunger Games"" book as an acceptance gift. I hate reading books and sadly never even skimmed through THG. I remember saying to a friend in these exact words, ""I think I'll wait for the movie"". Little did I know were we supposed to read the book and would have a dinner with the dean of the college to discuss it! Anyway, 2012 hit and this movie came out. Unfortunately with the release of so many other good movies (The Avengers, Spiderman, etc.) I passed on seeing this film. I finally sat down last night and decided to see what the hype was about. Despite having the book and so forth, I had absolutely no clue what ""The Hunger Games"" was remotely about. Only that is was a very popular best-selling book. I was very hesitant and skeptical at first about watching this movie. But in the end, I'm glad I did and I really enjoyed it!Without going into great detail about the story, I have to say I found THG to be a fantastic film from start to finish. The story is very deep and compelling. The whole concept of this movie is very interesting. We think of children so lightly in our society today; to think of throwing innocent children into a battle arena for entertainment, it's just insane. Albeit the concept is incredible, I have to agree with other reviewers on here whom have read the book. Being a PG-13 movie, it seems that they slightly cherry-coated the death/slaughter of of the children. I think this movie would have been more powerful if they turned up the dial on the violence. But I understand that the movie is PG-13 and aimed towards teenagers, so in other ways it made sense to keep the violence i a certain minimum. Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal in this film. She is a great, dramatic actress who fit the role perfectly. It felt like Hollywood picked someone this time with talent before looks (although she is very cute). She absolutely blows away (in terms of acting) people like Megan Fox and Anne Hathaway who often give a stale performance and are there for eye candy more. Previously I was not a fan of hers from the media/spotlight that surrounds her, but I have to say I really enjoyed her work in this film. She is also the same age as me and for the level her work is at, it's just incredible. (also by the laws of man I have to ask, Jennifer Lawrence will you go on a date with me?)Besides the toned down violence, my only other complaints - I could tell that a lot was crammed into this movie to make it work. It seemed like the contestants/characters each could have had more back story (which from what I read online they did in the novel). Also, the ending was flat-out predictable. Other than that, fantastic film. Excellent camera work mixed with traditional (non-digital) film (which we rarely see anymore) combined with epic IMAX shots. The soundtrack was fantastic and the rest of the cast perfectly complimented Jennifer Lawrence's performance. Hollywood has a bright future with the new ensemble of actors who were in this film. I give ""The Hunger Games"" an 8/10. It's not a game changer and young males/elderly viewers in particular maybe turned off from it. I'm a guy but in no way did I find this film negative, bad, or ""pro-feminist"". And although it has kids in in, it no way did it feel like a kids movie. It just felt like a good movie with a solid lead actress, almost reminding me Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise. If you like sci fi and want a good story telling, heart pounding movie, this film has it. and I am already considering seeing the sequels on the big screen!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He said I wouldn't like it much as I'm more into supernatural/horror. I gave the first HG book a go, and LOVED it!!!! The writing was well paced and very enjoyable, and so naturally, I wanted to see the film. I have to say, I was more impressed with it the second time round, and to be honest, I get a bit miffed when people pick it to bits.Not everything is explained in the film, but it doesn't need to be if you open your mind and imagine yourself in that situation. Although I'd read the book, the first time I watched the film, I wondered when Jennifer Lawrence was actually going to do something. Then I remembered that her character Katniss was thrust into this fancy world she'd never seen before and crowds were screaming, cameras all over the place, no wonder she was confused. I got that in the end and sympathised with her.I liked the occasional jerky camera footage, simply because it highlights how messed up the situation is. You're a child thrown into the lion's den and forced to protect yourself or die. I'm a fan of watching the special features on a DVD, and a lot of the techniques are explained in these, the camera angles included.The one scene that chokes me up every time is the part with Rue, and Katniss really shows her humanity and vulnerability. It's not necessary for there to be mountains of story for these two, you understand their bond straight away.There is very little blood in this film, but once again, there doesn't need to be. The subject matter on its own is horrific and unimaginable, and I believe that the author as well as the film director did a fantastic job in capturing the despair and determination. The cast did a great job too, and although I did like some performances a lot more than others, I'll be interested to see how they fare in Catching Fire.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

In this film, students are kidnapped in a excursion trip and wake up with a head-explosive-collar. They were selected to a life and death game with only one survivor or none at all. Each one receive a backpack with food, drink, lantern and one weapon or survival device. Each six hours they are informed about the dead and the danger zones to be avoided in order not to explode their necks. Alliances are made and death follows the smallest suspicion. Previous infatuations and enmities are explicit. Enfasis centers in the animal inside all of us and how thick is the civil layer of our personalities and our survival willingness. Hunger Games is much more complex, however it is impossible to deny so many similarities","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling.39 out of 49 found this helpful.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Set in the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, the film follows Katniss Everdeen, portrayed with intensity by Jennifer Lawrence, as she volunteers to take her sister's place in the annual Hunger Games-a televised fight to the death among young tributes from each district.The film's strength lies in its world-building, presenting a bleak yet fascinating vision of a society divided into districts ruled by the Capitol. The Hunger Games themselves are a brutal spectacle, and Ross captures the tension and drama adeptly. Jennifer Lawrence's performance as the resilient and resourceful Katniss anchors the narrative, bringing depth to the character.The supporting cast, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, adds layers to the story. Stanley Tucci's flamboyant portrayal of Caesar Flickerman and Elizabeth Banks' eccentric Effie Trinket contribute to the film's satirical commentary on reality television and the manipulation of public sentiment.Visually, the film is striking, with the stark contrast between the opulence of the Capitol and the poverty of the districts. The action sequences are well-executed, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. James Newton Howard's musical score enhances the emotional beats, creating a powerful atmosphere.While ""The Hunger Games"" successfully introduces audiences to the harsh reality of Panem and establishes Katniss as a formidable protagonist, some may find the shaky camera work during action scenes distracting. Additionally, the film leaves certain aspects of the source material unexplored, assuming familiarity with the book.In summary, ""The Hunger Games"" is a compelling adaptation that sets the stage for the franchise. With its strong performances, thought-provoking themes, and visually arresting presentation, it remains a noteworthy entry in the dystopian film genre, offering both entertainment and social commentary.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His creative approach was quite heartfelt and he did a tremendous job with the Reaping scene especially which filled one with anxiety as if one was part of it too.Moreover, the interaction between the characters were exciting and satisfying to watch and I really wish we could have seen more of that kind of storytelling. This is where the sequels fail devastatingly and end up looking very artificial, especially the main characters.The Hunger Games lived and died with the work of Mr. Ross and his team in the first movie which in my opinion is the best of them all. It is organic and manages to move one.I was never content with the rest of the sequels as they failed to create real human connection and resorted to the Hollywoodesque/Major Motion picture action and drama where quality is overlooked.Subconsciously, I am still waiting for the sequels to happen.

The movie The Hunger Games, how far is the sci-fi story from reality? The fiction story is set in post-apocalyptic North America, and the characters are grouped into separate districts by their wealth and status. There are 12 districts and the lower the number, the more safe and wealthy it is. The capital, the highest power created ""The Hunger Games."" They created The Hunger Games to prevent the districts from rebelling against them. Every year, two young people, one boy, and one girl are selected from each of the 12 districts during ""the reaping."" The story lines main character Katniss Everdeen takes us through an anxious journey thought he 75th annual hunger games. This film presents alternative perspectives on how to keep peace and the emotion of death. The social class system is often a divide in the human race; The Hunger Games is a strong representation of what could happen if the social class system is taken too far.
The Hunger Games movie comes from a series of books written with immense detail by Suzanne Collins. The books were later produced into the film due to the popularity of the books. The movie includes extensive detail like the original novel. Since this movie has so much detail, the viewer may find themselves lost if they miss parts of the film or drift off into space. Due to The storyline being packed with so much detail the movie can feel extremely realistic times. Though the realism is distracting, what is keeping everyday society from reaching this point in time with rebellion, class-divided districts, and the murder of young innocent people for entertainment, and punishment in a way; from happening today? Some may see The Hunger Games as a simple movie, but there's actual meaning behind it. Collins is trying to show what the world can come to if humanity falls under the pressure of the class system, and thinking that one is better than another due to their economic status or social status. But the thought of all man was created equal is what is keeping the pressure of the social class system from taking over as it did in The Hunger Games.
The Hunger Games truly shows The horror of the class system and how it could change humanity. Katniss brings the viewer through the journey of what it's like to be in the poorest district, and how being the lowest class is shoved in her face all the time. The movie is full of vivid detail that represents the human races class system and how its hard for one to escape. I would rate this book a four out of five because of its vivid detail.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had heard mostly good things and was ready to experience it as it had been described. And woah...I'd never seen a movie like this one before. From the moment the opening titles passed, I could feel my heart rate climbing. Very similar to the book, there is, to quote Stephen King, nearly constant-suspense and a looming sense of dread in every second of every scene. This was one of the few movies that genuinely kept me right on the edge of my seat at all times. There were some changes made to the story when adapting a screenplay, as is par for the course with any screen-adaptation of a book, but they all worked for the overall benefit of the narrative. The casting was next to perfect. After watching the movie, I can only see Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne, and so on. The combined efforts of facial expressions, body language, and an uncomfortably quiet setting made for a very fast-paced, very entertaining, very frightening, very real feeling plot. The score is iconic where it has to be, anxiety inducing where it has to be, and triumphant where is appropriate. Cinematography wise, this was a knockout. The rapid camera movement and flashes of blood brought the games to another level of scary. The directing was excellent. The editing was excellent. Costumes and makeup were done so unbelievably well. The acting was top-notch.I was hooked the whole way through, and finishing it felt very rewarding. It's not exactly the same as the book, but it doesn't have to be. If you liked the book, the movie certainly will not disappoint.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Instead, I'm going to talk about the things I disliked, even though I went into this hoping to love it; after all, I invested two-and-a-half-hours of my life in this movie, so of course I was hoping I'd have a good time with it.The first problem is with the pacing. It takes an hour and a half or so for the actual games (in which teenagers fight to the death) to begin. Until that time, there are endless attempts at needless characterisation, some training montages that go nowhere and add nothing to the overall effect, and lots of extraneous supporting characters. Some of these characters, particularly the likes of those played by Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci, complete with stupid hairdos and costumes, look like they belong in a kid's film and the acting is horrendous. I felt embarrassed for them most of the time.When we finally get to the games, they're equally disappointing. It's not just that they're not very violent (although the BBFC's decision to further tone down the violence is frustrating), it's that they're badly directed with stupid shaky-cam work by a director who doesn't understand how to utilise it properly. Jennifer Lawrence gives another bland and unlikeable turn as a stand-offish heroine and I didn't give a fig for any of the characters, good or bad. Instead I was just hoping for it to be over, and quickly, but THE HUNGER GAMES is one of those films that seems to go on forever. By the time some CGI creations are added into the mix (what, did the scriptwriters get bored with the storyline?) I realised that this is awful, awful stuff indeed. And even worse - they're making sequels?!","25 out of 57 found this helpful.

I had finished the first two novels (which are both fantastic and readable in a matter of days if you're stuck for something to read) but I checked the film out and when the opening starts and we're thrust into the world of District 12, I was shocked.The opening is something remarkable. It's great if unyielding from the truth of their poverty. District 12, run down where residents struggle for food and to make a living, but Katniss and her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) find escapism in their hunting. And when Katniss' sister is nominated for the games we see Jennifer Lawrence show why she is currently the most promising actress of these last 5 years.Lawrence was a great choice to play Katniss. The character in the books is quite unusual, quite solemn but with hidden desires and energy that the young actress excels at. Her on screen peak is with Rue when in the arena, a heart wrenching exhilarating piece of acting combined with opportunistic film pacing.The film starts slowly getting into the feel of the poverty of the districts but as viewers, when we see the world of the Capitol and see how perfect, classy and snobbish everything is we feel the pace pick up and we are right there with the contestants, in a world the Capitol controls where these young fighters have little say in their destiny.The first book is very imaginative and is very well brought to the screen by director Gary Ross. The excitement and adrenaline really starts pumping when the arena is introduced. The resemblance to the events of the book is spot on, if not better. Katniss' independent tracking and thirst for survival are well shot, especially during the Trackerjacker sequences. The best part of the entire film is when Katniss is with Rue, the excitement and emotion in these scenes are fantastic and it's hard to express how well this works in developing their characters and holding the film and the rest of the story together.When reading the books I had concerns over how Collins was working the romance angles, being a bit like Twilight with the love angles but this is nothing like that series. This is something calmer, less intense in terms of love and lust. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) may be viewed differently by people. As the stories progress his character changes and Hutcherson portrays him very well and strikes up a good partnership with Lawrence that resembles their respective adaptations.There are a few minor lapses and improvements. I only wish the fire sequence was a bit longer as it was in the book. Seeing Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was rather strange at first but it would have been great if he was included more during certain scenes! This film is a great adaptation of a great book. The imagination Suzanne Collins has been wonderfully adapted for the screen with her vivid and controversial environment and ideas and with excellent performances, particularly from Jennifer Lawrence, the Hunger Games is a must watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games has so many flaws in the storyline that I wont even try to name them. The list would never end. The whole thing is so unlogical. It seems that the story has been made in total of 4 minutes. There is no complexity and this movie is not trying to make you to use your brain at all. Everything is so predictable. The environment of the movie is so exaggerated. The styling, dresses, mood, everything. Someone is trying to be some kind of modern Tim Burton. And I wont even begin with these young actors, who are just not convincing at all. I guess the high ratings for this movie came from young teenagers. But if you would ask me what I think about this movie when I was 12 years old, I think I would feel the same about it as I feel now.

Sure, it isn't the greatest book-movie adaptation ever, but as a movie itself and especially compared to book-top movie adaptations of other Young Adult novels (eg. Percy Jackson or Mortal Instruments), it is very well done. I'm a massive fan of the series, I've read every book several times and was very exited for this movie. I feel it did not disappoint. Yes, they had to cut out some aspects to fit it into a movie that is already over two hours. If people are looking for a film exactly like the book they are never going to find it with anything. It called an adaptation for a reason. And as a first installment to a movie series this was done very well. Casting choice was perfect. Absolutely. Usually aging up some of the characters can ruin elements, fortunately Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale's (Liam Hemsworth) casting was some of the most brilliant I've seen. Other characters including Haymitch (Woody Abernathy), Prim (Willow Shields), Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) were exceptionally well cast as well. The actors are, personally, the best thing about the movie. Portraying the characters and their stories (with what is not the best screenplay) was very well done. The costumes, score and production design was also very good. Unfortunately cinematography is not - though the ""shaky cam"" adds to the realism of the situation it also adds to the realism of a headache if you watch too closely. The screenplay was not the best but still kept true to the book. Overall people are treating it too harshly, they did well. But if you do want to see an exceptionally accurate book-movie adaptation, go watch its sequel, Catching Fire.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought it was one of the current, endless dark, violent, plot-weak/less ""shallow"" movies that rates way up there for teens. Despite the number of people who rated it, and the near 5.0 star rating from so many, I was not going to watch it.I changed my mind when my husband told me he believed ""Katniss Everdeen"" was, in real life, a professional archer (as is Geena Davis.) And am I ever glad I did watch it! I bought the movie, in fact, after seeing it for the first time 2 weeks ago or less, and since that first time, I have already watched it over 10 times.It's hard to put a finger on ""specifically"" what made it such a pleasant surprise, but there's no doubt...physically, physiologically, mentally, emotionally...I was GRIPPED to the point I wouldn't even pause it for a 15 second bathroom break.Using a list, here are the following elements that made me rate this a 5-star movie: 1. An original storyline and plot 2. Quality of the acting performances, by both leads, and supporting actress/tor 3. Jennifer's exceptional loveliness: she is beautiful inside and out. (read bio) 4. Excellent Directing; steadily growing from the start, never losing focus 5. Dynamite special effects without sensationalism. Used sparingly, but INTENSE! 6. The moral...very well defined without forcing the point: purity of goodness overcomes the adversity of the corrupted in power, who cause suffering. 7. Last, and yet the most influential - the power of being stunned by the unexpected, and original ""points/actions"", etc...that spring up here and there in the movie, causing the RARE (for me) ""rabidly gripped attention.""

Firstly what made the movie for me was the performance turned in by Jennifer Lawrence who took the core elements and grittiness mixed with a subtle and not weakling like vulnerability, I'm sorry but I was totally bought into the film on this alone. The actual story was handled in a very 'grown up' manner for a film of this sort (based on a teen book series) cause I'm sorry for the most part they suck. I am a 31 year old man and Twilight-esque teen melodrama does not float my boat. The Hunger Games has shown me that if handled well films of this kind can be pretty darn good. Secondly the condensing of the story hugely satisfied me as I hate things being overly drawn out just because the director is trying to not only remain faithful to the book but also recapture it for the big screen. Many fans of the book have in fact complained about this element claiming it gave no real depth or insight but hey everyone is a critic these days. I for one found myself totally immersed in the story without an unnecessary amount of back log. So watch with an open mind and forget everything you would normally assume of 'teen flicks' and enjoy. Brutal in parts and with moments of sheer nerve shredding tension shows how this film is truly head and shoulders above the rest of it's kind.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie is given a 4.7/5 star rating because it deals with scary topics and it this also makes it very enticing. A girl named Katniss lives in district 12 with her mom and sister. All of the districts are extremely poor and have little food, except for the Capitol which is where the Hunger Games is shown on television. This makes it hard for Katniss to obtain food for her family, and when placed in a dire situation she risks her life for that of her sister's and the better for her community. The Hunger Games is a 4.7/5 star movie because of the ideas of social class and status, the maybe too harsh concept of enslavement of districts, and the entertainment of the rich.Social class is one of the most significant issues that Katniss faces which gives viewers an inside look at her struggles to provide for her family. Katniss lives in one of the poorest districts that make money only on farming. All she has is her sister whom she loves dearly. When her sister is chosen to fight in the annual contest, the Hunger Games, Katniss takes her spot. The Capitol has everything that could ever be wanted while the districts are impoverished. The prize for the winner of the Hunger Games is free food for their district for a year. The people in the Capitol do not have any struggles, and they watch the Games as entertainment even though many people die. This is why Katniss takes her sisters spot when she is picked to participate. This is one of the main turning points that brought down the review because it is slightly confusing as to why her sister was chosen. The movie indeed portrays the difficulties for this teenager trying to move up in social class and provide for her family, all while trying to stay alive, and this is one of the more advanced topics that need to be handled carefully.All of the districts are enslaved in some way and do not make much money if any at all. The Capital is where all of the money is, and that is why Katniss must fight to gain fame and fortune for her district. There are even guards in some districts. Near the end, Katniss does something that upsets the President, and this provokes even more rebellion in the districts. Some of the districts that aren't as close to the Capitol have more freedom and property. This also creates rebellion which moves the storyline forward. The enslavement of the people in the districts continues to grow when the viewers are told that the more laws that are broken, the more that name goes into the bowl that determines what two people are inserted into the Hunger Games. All of the enslavement and torture of the people in, and out, of the Games is all just for the Capitols entertainment which shows how terrible the situations are for the people in the districts and this is one of the very mature topics that could prove difficult to some.The people of the Capitol are rich, and they want the Hunger Games to happen because they are entertained. It is like a giant television series where people die. They enjoy it because they never have to experience any struggles themselves. This makes Katniss, and the other participants, struggle to hold back and not yell and scream about their struggles. The participants gain more help in the games if more people like them because they can give them money, which is why the contestants must win over the people of the Capitol. Viewers also see that the Capitol controls the arena and can kill anyone they want at will. This adds even more suspense to this already thrilling movie. The fact that all of this ruthless killing is just for people's enjoyment frustrates the viewer and provides for a suspenseful and thrilling watch which is why it has such a high rating.Viewers see inside the life of a teen girl, and her society, struggling with, social class and status, enslavement of districts, and entertainment of the rich in the thrilling movie, The Hunger Games. Katniss is thrown into this horrible situation of imminent death all because of her social status and need for a better life which gives the storyline a captivating beginning and end. Each district is enslaved with the knowledge that the Capitol has everything they could ever want and this leads to rebellion and a plot twist in the story. The people of the Capitol enjoy this ruthless killing of others just for their entertainment, and this is why there is conflict in the first place. The Hunger Games would be enjoyed by viewers who love to delve deep into a storyline, and who enjoy thrill and suspense, but it does handle some deep topics that could prove scary, and difficult, for some to comprehend. This movie is one of the best that dives deep into a story and leaves viewers begging for more.Rating: 4.7/5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Someone unexpectedly thrust into a whole new level of stardom whose strength lies in being herself. Josh Hutcherson is equally self aware with Peeta, he's fully aware that someone like him isn't usually the hero of these stories.Whilst the heavy use handheld camera is obviously there to obscure the violence, director Gary Ross uses it so frequently it feels like a consistent style choice. The film really uses its budget well considering it's technically mid-budget, creating a grandiose world that feels lived in and only pushes it too far when it's heavier on the CG spectacle.James Newton Howard's score is really good, the epic triumph of it is filled with cynicism and the real beauty is in its quieter pieces. It's also very effective at communicating what the film visually can't when it comes to the games themselves, emphasising the horror, the intensity and the trauma of it all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Is America's Reconstruction Different from Panem's?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4510128/?ref_=tt_urv","mattheweverlewis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96344882/?ref_=tt_urv","14 December 2018","The Hunger Games by Gary Ross is a dystopian young adult novel about 16-year-old female protagonist Katniss Everdeen who represents her district in a battle for her life. The Capital of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games, a cruel punishment for a past rebellion. The Hunger Games is a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains and wins food for a year for their district. The Hunger Games, although fictional, has strong connections with the real world. Although the movie presents a post-rebellion dystopian world, in which viewers can see connections to the American Reconstruction, the movie does not develop the character's backstory as much as it could have.The Hunger Games movie is similar to America's Reconstruction period, which was after the Civil War. After the union won the war, America went into a period of turmoil. This is similar to The Hunger Games because, after the rebellion, Panem went into a tumultuous period due to their continuous uprisings. The president decided to have the Hunger Games to remind the districts of what they did in their past. Also, while America was going through Reconstruction, Grant and Hayes created an unintentional class system, and similarly, that was what Panem was doing with The Hunger Games and their idea of Districts.
Most countries are willing to join together to fight a common foe. In the sense of The Hunger Games district, 3 through 12 all fought together against the Capital, District 1, and 2 in the rebellion. Proving that people rich or poor come together to achieve a common goal. In American History, in WWII U.S.A. France, U.K., and Russia, the Allied powers, all came together to fight against Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Axis powers, due to the common goal they wanted to defeat their enemy. All of the countries worked as a single unit against others focused on their advantages.While Ross does transform the book into a movie, he does not develop some part of the movie. Taking .4 off of the rating is because of how Ross had the characters killed. The characters had an immense amount of screen time before entering the arena and little in the arena. When watching the movie, Rue is showed to be shy, and in the arena is killed. Although Katniss does give Rue a 'proper burial,'Rue could have used more time connecting with Katniss before they entered the arena.
The Capital was willing to tear down their country for their benefits, which is inhumane. It is unfathomable to see what types of terrorizing laws governments could create. The power of working as a unit is much stronger than individuals trying to achieve righteousness for themselves.
Rating: 4.6/5.0","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You come in without any expectations and hopefully be pleasantly surprised by the storyline, direction, acting, action and or something else.The only thing that surprised me here that I was planning to leave the viewing before the end. The chemistry between the actors was terrible. You could not connect to the characters because there was no real human element to connect to. If the book is really that appealing, then this has to be a huge disappointment. There have been references to Twilight because of the ""teen"" appeal. And surely the twilight series could be a lot better than what we've seen. But at least there is a cast you can sort of connect to. Try and imagine that these young people are really fighting for their lives and check that with what you feel looking at this movie. What is a real shame is that something as bad as this is getting box office rewards and really enjoyable films (maybe not brilliant) are past by.If I had known what I was going to see I certainly would've stayed away.

Katniss really captured my attention and proved to be a strong young woman which made for a perfect lead role. From beginning to end, I was entertained awaiting for the hunger games and what was yet to come. The battle was so fierce but portrayed courage, something people use in every day life. Throughout the movie they said ""may the odds be ever in your favour"" and the odds turned out to be something never expected. Watching Katniss at home with her sister and in her everyday life showed that she would be tenacious in such a competition and for her to volunteer was honourable. Her and Peeta were such a great team but it was such an odd coincidence that fate would put the two of them together. I watched the movie 2 times in one day and recommended it to everyone.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence; the 18 year old main character is a bow and arrow wizard. This really helps when she volunteers fight in the games so her little sister, Primrose (prim for short) doesn't go to the games, which yearly is a blood thirty game show where a teenage boy and a girl from each (12) district is chosen increasing your chances with each year of your life. Resulting in 24 kids from ages 12-18, very young, fighting to the death.katniss' best friend and hunting partner, Gale, promises to take care of her family for her while she goes into the games up against many people, including Cato and Thresh. These people are careers; people who train in an academy there whole life and at 18 they volunteer for the games and, most of the time, win. The capital; higher class people, allows it because all they want is to watch tiny helpless 12 year olds get viciously massacred by gigantic 18 year olds on live TV. The capital includes one heartless, snobby, Jerky, conceded, leader, president Snow (even though he's more of a dictator). Just because 13 said they didn't like him, he started a war and ended the district's days by bombing it and leaving nothing but rubble and dust.Once the games actually start katniss (despite specific orders from her mentor), run strait to the cornucopia and almost gets killed! The cornucopia is the most suspenseful, blood thirsty part of the arena. It's where you begin and for many, end. You supply here, so many (unpleasantly) meet with others here! Yes, there is a lot of violence, but whoever wins the games gets a worry free life until they die.""The Hunger Games"" movie keeps you at the edge of your seat wandering what will happen next. The theme of this movie is to treasure what you have. You will love the fast pace movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This masterpiece of a book has been made into the most spectacular movie ( in my opinion ) ever made. The characters, all perfectly cast and played amazingly and exactly how I imagined them to look like, every single one. The first one sets the background for the franchise of the hunger games movies and does it extremely well. District 12 and the Capitol were completely well made. Especially if you compare the two, the Capitol so bright, lively and modern while district 12 is so run down and old.I absolutely love the Capitol citizens outfits! Truly astonishing and exactly how I imagined capitol fashion to look like when described in the books ( bright and colourful )As the film progresses, the main character Katniss Everdeen's - played by Jennifer Lawrence - confidence grows, in her defiance towards the Capitol and her hatred starts brewing, we get to watch that anger grow in strength until the last movie when she kindles that anger.

The Plot to ""The Hunger Games"" is Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the evil Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentor-ship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. ""The Hunger Games"" is directed pretty good by ""Gary Ross"" also written by him and is spectacularly acted by ""Jennifer Lawrence"" and ""Josh Hutcherson"". The special effects in this film are a bit out dated for 2012 but still acceptable and the score have a few stand out moments. Characters are probably the most important part in story's and my god did they hit the nail right on the head with ""Jennifer Lawrence's"" character Katniss Everdeen. The film also stayed quite close to the book but with a few unnecessary changes to it. Overall the first installment to ""The Hunger Games"" franchise started off spectacularly with awesome acting, great characters and a suspenseful plot.

Watching a film after reading the book can be nothing but disappointing. A book has so much more opportunity to give the story and the characters depth and background. When that fails to transfer to the screen, I am always disappointed. After hearing so much about this film, I didn't want to spoil it by reading the book first.I don't know that any Director other than Gary Ross could have made this film. It is unique to any movie I have ever seen that seemingly targets the teen/young adult audience. For one thing, the language is clean. I find that utterly refreshing. There is no salacious sexual contact or even innuendo. I also find that refreshing. The attention to allowing each actor/actress to bring their own kind of 'life' to the character is without comparison in other movies of this target audience.As for the actors/actresses, I find the casting absolutely without fault. Who could have been Cinna if not Lenny Kravitz? He is the one person Katniss and Peeta meet in the Capital who seems like a compassionate and real person. He is integral to the development of Katniss as a warrior with a heart.Liam Hemsworth has a small role, but brings an influence to the film that is present with every scene because he leaves his quiet message of love for Katniss. Even in the late scenes where it seems Katniss is developing this romantic relationship with Peeta, brief glances at Hemsworth's face reveal his depth of love for Katniss. His pain is evident when seeing her kissing Peeta, yet he has only smiles when she returns home. He loves her and she survived and that is what is important.Jennifer Lawrence' portrayal of Katniss is cinematic perfection. She is a courageous and loving young woman who faces her worst fears with integrity and compassion for others in her lot. She is vulnerable, yet tough; caring yet determined to stay alive; full of fear yet completely confident and resolved. Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss Everdeen.I don't do a lot of movies targeted for this audience, so I wasn't readily familiar with Josh Hutcherson. My first impulse was a complete dislike of the character. However, as the film progressed and Peeta opens up, I liked him more and more. He is complicated, not easily readable so you are unsure as to where he stands. That can be both a good thing and a bad one. In my opinion, Josh Hutcherson parlayed that quality into a definite advantage for his character.I don't generally enjoy Woody Harrelson, but I must say his interpretation of Haymitch won me over. The seething angry drunk in the beginning somewhat confirmed my presumptions about both Harrelson and Haymitch. However, as the film advanced and Haymitch became more human, I found myself enjoying Harrelson's portrayal very much. It seems he suddenly became a responsible adult with real compassion for his protégé. By the end of the film, Haymitch had actually become one of my favorites.Then, of course, you have Donald Sutherland. Is there any role Donald Sutherland cannot play and do so with absolute success? If there is, I don't think I know of that character. He is a consummate professional with depth and abilities rare and difficult to find. I don't always like his characters, but I always enjoy his portrayal because he is always on the mark.My last observation would be about choice of locations for the shooting of the film. I cannot imagine that anywhere else on earth would have been more perfect. The Appalachain Mountains of North Carolina lend a haunting effect to the hunt that few other locations could have. It was so much more enjoyable to see the forest and hear the sounds of the forest than to see blue screen adaptations to make it appear like a forest. The authenticity was a remarkable addition to the entire film.When I first decided to watch this film it was quite honestly due to the fact that Liam Hemsworth was in it. If you're gonna look at something, it should be something enjoyable and stimulating to look at. No woman in the world would honestly say that Hemsworth was not both enjoyable and stimulating to look at. However, the experience became so much more than that. I would watch this movie over and over again because the story is riveting, the acting makes the characters believable, the location is stunning and the casting and directing are without flaw. That's a full package in my book and I'm happy I watched. I will most definitely be waiting to see if #2 can bear the standard set by #1.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With a compelling narrative, strong performances, and social relevance, ""The Hunger Games"" stands as a captivating and well-executed adaptation that resonates with both fans and newcomers alike.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

She had a younger sister Prim. Their state had 12 districts and every year they conduct the 'THE HUNGER GAMES'. they select two tributes randomly from each district, one boy and another girl. On the occasion of 74th annual hunger games, Prim was selected, who was a small girl. So her sister, Katniss wished to volunteer her. and the boy selected from the same district was PETER MELLARK. After being selected, they visited to each districts and finally they reach to the center. There, they had training and finally the day came. They all were sent to the artificial environment, where the conductors could create or destroy any thing they like. There, only one could survive from any of the districts and s/he is called 'Victor'. The game started, 8 of them were killed on the first day, similarly others were also being killed. Most of them would be killed by natural phenomena, or by dehydration, or simply by other tributes. A announcement was made that the 2 tributes from same district, if remain alive, both could be announced as victors. Finally, both from same district i.e. district 12, Katniss and Peeta.. remain alive. But, instantly, the another announcement was made that both couldn't be called victors. then, they said one another to be victor. then, katniss had something poisonous and they decided to suicide. But they were stopped from doing so and both of them were announced victors...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's well acted with solid characters and good art direction and I'm certain that it's just the beginning of a larger saga with an epic story.Jennifer Lawrence continues to deliver solid performances and Is by far the stand-out player in this, but all of the other players do a convincing job. Even the child actors, which I'm always wary of seeing are good. The performances mean that you will actually care about the characters and want to see them again (the ones that are left anyway). Even the ""villains"" have their moments of character development to show that they're not just mustache-twirling bad buys.One element that I really enjoyed and thought was pretty impressive was the costume and art direction. To really show a clash of civilizations and how different this world Is from ours the people of Capitol City (where the titular Hunger Games take place) have all of these outlandish costumes and manners of dressing. These costumes sometimes have futuristic elements (explaining that this takes place far into the future) but mostly serve to show the difference between the 12 Districts from which each of the ""game players"" come from and the rich Capitol. It also gave me a rough Idea of how far into the future this story takes place without falling on typical science fiction elements like flying cars, or daily trips to the moon or other extravagances that have questionable plausibility. The costumes really feel like they could be worn by rich models and the cream of the crop of the 21st century, except for those futuristic elements and they're fun to look at. I don't even care about fashion and I was impressed by the costumes on display here.When it comes to the action and violence the film does a good job, showing just enough to demonstrate how brutal a fight to the death can be without going too far and feeling like an exploitation film. The violence is well integrated into the story and it never feels like the movie was built around it. Even if you're not a fan of this type of film, with an audience watching as gladiators fight each other to try and win a prize, this is a smart entry in the genre with good acting and tasteful violence that's sure to get even more interesting with the future entries in the series.

Nuclear war and rebellion ruined mankind whose society in America was rebuilt into a new Orwellian nightmare where people slave away in prison camps with no freedom. As a punishment from the authorities for rebellion, each of the 12 districts (1 being the richest and 12 being the poorest) have to fight it out in a battle royale called the Hunger Games, a modern version of Gladiatorial combat or Mandingo Fighting with a bit of Bear Grylls survival thrown in for good measure.When a girl is picked as the female participant or ""tribute"" of her district, her older sister - played by the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence - volunteers to take her place. After preparation, training, advertisement to various potential sponsors and an Olympic-esque opening ceremony, the participants are released to fight for survival.The film is very much 1984 crossed with Lord of the Flies, and has a strong cast. Jennifer Lawrence plays the role well as a strong character albeit with a vulnerability. Unlike most other participants, she is not a typical ""action girl"" but simply uses her wit to survive. The rest of the cast is excellent and the settings immersing and atmosphere intense. But also it is very clever in its portrayal of a nightmareish totalitarian society where freedom is nonexistent, and how far we would go in surviving in such a society. Very much worth your time!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I have never understood the idea of a remake at all. If a film, like ""Battle Royale"", is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? If you insist on tampering with perfection, why then do you have to try to recreate it in it's whole? There is nothing original here. Gary Ross put nothing of himself into this film.They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this is ridiculous. There are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as Battle Royale, and I suspect that Ross may have wanted to explore them. Instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap imitation of the popular Japanese classic. Tatsuya Fujiwara turned in a performance that lead to one of the most memorable characters in film history and it would have been impossible for any actor, no matter how good to recreate that. The rest of the characters are stuck just as tight to similarly wooden imitations of the originals. It is almost painful to watch very talented actors (namely Donald Sutherland) have that talent stifled.In the end, Gary Ross set out to pay homage to a great film. Instead he cheapened it, and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cable.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

By the end we felt sick, and like we had narrowly escaped an involuntary lobotomy. The story steals the premise of ""Running Man"" and is told even less plausibly. At least 'Running man' tried not to take itself seriously!The 'hero' Katness is set in an implausibly tyrannical world (all mankind would have to be made up of cowards for a situation like theirs to arise) and winds up a participant in a stupid contrived gladiatorial/survival Arena with Pita: a spineless effeminate eunuch that I'm told the writer tried to portray as her idea of the 'perfect guy'. God help us all if that's what women look for today, because I didn't see a real male protagonist the entire movie.There at the games, Katness winds up spending the whole story doing what gets her popularity, feels good, and gives her a lead on her competition as she compromises every principle she has (Kinda like those A-crowd losers you knew in high school). Basically, the woman becomes a social prostitute for the spectators in a selfish urge to survive. In fact its the level of selfishness and self-deception that boggled my mind. Even the 'oh so selfless' act of going to the games in place of her little sister is done out of guilt, not love.People tell me how 'its not like that in the book', and how 'you never see her struggling to decide', but the road to hell is paved with intentions like hers, and everyone I met ultimately admitted that she still makes all the same selfish decisions as the movie portrays.For those who cannot see what I'm getting at, there will forever be a divide. They, like her, live by the jingle the hunger games has: ""May the odds be ever in your favor"", and will forever be at odds with Men like me who say ""Never tell me the odds!""","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

We watched it a week or so ago and I was appalled that the concept was deemed entertaining!Devotees of the movie I'm sure will hide behind the fact it's fantasy....I for one do not fantasise about watching children kill each other!I am not a prude, I enjoy movies such as Predator, most of the action genre and as another example thought the cartoon violence of The Expendable 1 & 2 entertaining.If it were the other way around and the book was a bi-product of the movie then I'm sure it would remain on the shelves!!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

All in all a really bad movie I would say. Too many loopholes, bad direction, worse storyline (& very predictable) and one hour into the movie, you begin to wonder when its gonna get over!!!!

Or there are too much Survivor fans, but this is definitely no survivor genre neither hunger at all, because there was no starvation. Also I have to notice that the idea of killing children is not so liked mostly by the audience (just killing is not the way to affect by using death). Also the main female character needs more accuracy and faster reflexes, something more like Clint Barton (Hawkeye) from The Avengers. The movie just desperately needs more action, martial arts and compassion! Also the way or representing the primitive and the basic in the human kind is not so obvious if that's what the movie crew wanted to achieve, because they supply them with surviving kits and weapons (lets not say even spoons).","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's neither heartfelt, shocking, or emotionally visceral enough. Bereft of this kind of depth, it therefore lacked any strong resonance with me. I forgot about the film pretty much as soon as I left the theatre, and it provoked very little in the way of discussion with my film and literary savvy friends. There's just not enough there. And what is there is simplistic and writ large. It's no Lord of The Flies. And yes, I get all the Rome, NAZI Germany, and reality TV allusions. It also commits the cardinal sin of having no true, strong villain to despise. Society is the villain. ...Bad society, bad!

I'll confess that I haven't read the book. Apparently some consider it a rip-off of a movie called ""Battle Royale"" - which I haven't seen. So I really didn't have any pre-conceived notions about this going in. I watched it because I had heard a lot of people liked it. So much for popular opinion.I came out of this feeling as if I had just been subjected to almost two and a half hours of ""Survivor: Extreme."" In this case, it would be extreme because there's really only one survivor. In some future nightmare world, a government uses The Hunger Games as a punishment for a long ago uprising. Every year each of 12 Districts that rebelled has to send two young people (one male and one female) to do battle with one another and form alliances and kill each other off until only one is left. Meanwhile, this has become this society's version of reality TV, as the whole thing is televised, and the ""tributes"" (the young people in the battle) are interviewed. I suppose if you think about it, it's not actually a bad social commentary about our own society which gets so fixated on the drivel of our own reality TV. But I didn't find it entertaining. Somehow, watching a bunch of teenagers trying to kill each other didn't appeal to me all that much. There's also the fact that I really didn't care that much for any of the characters. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is a bit sympathetic, especially as she tends to young Rue (Amandla Stenberg) - and certainly, Katniss and Peeta Josh Hutcherson) are the only two characters (aside from Rue) that you really could root for, but I still didn't feel much for them.I honestly didn't know what to expect coming into this. I had no idea what the movie was about. In the end, I can't say that watching this was a highlight for me. (3/10)","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence maybe a great actress but i could not take her serious in a role where the girl was to be tenacious. why not cast Ellen Paige instead. i feel the two main characters were casted due to supposive sex appeal and Hollywood standards and it had nothing to do with talent or actually being perfect for the role. Linda Hamilton in terminator is tenacious. i know shes not young but i feel Jennifer Lawrence never made me feel she was any bit tough or worthy of being this survivor. again she could just be a victim of the horrible character development and writing she was given along with the lack of portrayal of any hunger. this was really the most disappointed I've been watching a movie in a long time that had high expectations. good story that is poorly executed in PG 13 to make more money. I tried to say to myself is it good for a beginning of a series foot in the door? it really isn't. i never saw anything more clearly only about the money and appealing to the right target audience. this movie is not for anybody who knows anything about what makes a movie good. it isn't for any adults, young adults, critics, movie buffs, or even people who love the books that should just continue reading instead of watching movies. this m movie is purely for teenagers to do what they do best and follow something in pop culture.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Let's start with the core subject: dystopian societies have been explored in many movies before, and this one does not add anything new of substance. In addition, the society depicted is thoroughly inconsistent internally - advanced technology, but still digging for coal? The imagery: It's easy to believe that many members of a society are brainless and ridiculous, but assuming that they would control the society is preposterous. Not at all believable.The dialog: Quite silly, especially at the beginning. The naming scheme: Giving Roman empire names to bad guys comes across as juvenile and unsubtle. The names of the downtrodden masses are just silly. Peeta?The camera: The director seems to be one of those under the impression that shaking the camera during action scenes contributes to realism. It does not. It just makes many in the public dizzy, gives them a headache, and makes the scenes confusing.The script: Silly and discombobulated. The underlying social critique: Come on! This has been done many times before, and far more competently. It's so transparent and obvious that ends up being - yes, ridiculous.The acting, without being great, is acceptable. Miss Lawrence is fine, and, albeit pleasant to look at, she is not the beauty goddess that Hollywood has been peddling for the last three years. Alas, it is difficult to believe that she would become infatuated with the one-dimensional, boring and wimpish Peeta.I imagine that, for the most part, this is a movie (like the book it is based on) addressed to naive, immature and shallow teenagers, who will probably leave the theater under the impression that they have watched a deep, life-changing movie. I'm sorry, but it is not. It's puerile, predictable and, mostly - ridiculous.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

And judging it purely on it's own merits, it's certainly not the worst dystopian film I've seen in recent years.However, while I did like Jennifer Lawrence's performance, there isn't much else positive to say about this movie. Everything feels a bit rushed and unfinished- kind of like the final series of Game of Thrones. The screenplay is badly constructed and it doesn't allow the central characters to shine as it should. The depiction of futuristic aristocrats is highly unimaginative and the general setting and social structure is just far too unrealistic. This had the potential to be a masterpiece but the final result is just confused and ostentatious.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A lot of games, but not a whole lot of hunger","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633763/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","5 February 2017","The book is very detail rich and is not an easy one to adapt (true for any literature featuring dystopian/totalitarian societies), but it is a thrilling, scary and moving one too with fascinating characters and relationships.As an adaptation, the film adaptation of 'The Hunger Games' is pretty poor. The basic details are there as is the basic story and crucial characters, but spirit-wise it feels very watered-down and tame with little of the book's atmosphere and the characters nowhere near as interesting. This said, 'The Hunger Games' also fares problematically on its own terms, a fairer way to judge an adaptation from personal opinion and that's how it will be judged here.It is not all bad. Some of the acting is good, with the standouts being a magnetic Jennifer Lawrence, a deliciously smarmy Stanley Tucci, a splendid Elizabeth Banks and an effective Donald Sutherland. The dystopian setting is eerily evoked in the costumes and settings, and help the film start off well with a genuinely ominous depiction of District 12 which really give off a sense of dread. James Newton Howard's music score is thrilling and emotive.Not all the acting is good however. Most of the cast actually don't really stand out all that much with underwritten characters and lacking dialogue. In the principal cast Josh Hutcheson (blaming the writing here because Hutcheson has shown, like in 'Bridge to Terabithia', that he can be good) gives a lifeless and charisma-free performance. Woody Harrelson is also too anaemic and somewhat annoying as a shady jaded sort of character which undermines any development or direction of the character, he tries to give a coolness but this feels completely wrong for the character.Lack of character development and halfway-decent writing plays a large part here. The characters had a lot of meat to them before but here are pretty bland stereotypes with non-existent development or direction. Didn't find myself caring for the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, mainly because of Peeta being written and played so blandly but also the chemistry didn't seem to be there. The writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time.Was expecting the story to be much more compelling too. The District 12 stuff at the beginning sets a promising tone, but it takes forever to get to when anything properly happens after over an hour of suffering through under-baked, repetitious and sometimes unnecessary exposition that amounts to little. When it does finally get there, the scary intensity is still lacking, as well as any insight on social commentary or satirical edge, everything just feels rather tame and undernourished.The action sequences are rushed through, lack tension and further spoilt by being shot and edited chaotically and incredibly fake looking effects. Visually, only the set design impresses, the rest is too sloppy and frenetic.In summary, has its moments but very much lacking. 4/10 Bethany Cox","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

For an action movie built upon the survival instincts of a young and humble warrior, the majority of the film is spent watching people explain things to the heroine and the audience, almost all of which is totally unnecessary. You don't really need to know about sponsors, apartments, blue hair or the repetitious ""Rules of the Game"" so to speak. It just ends up dragging what is essentially a 80- minute movie nearly an hour longer. Despite all the talk of myth that inspired the original novel, we've seen it all before in what is unambiguously adapted from the Most Dangerous Game. Once you get over the novelty of kids killing kids - which seems to be no novelty at all if you watch the news - there isn't much here to go on.Jennifer Lawrence has an honest face which owns every scene, but unfortunately Gary Ross gets it all wrong. Ross cuts to so many arbitrary setups, he seems lost on how to lens and frame this story and by consequence, who to connect with. You end up not caring who lives or dies in what SHOULD be a story of life and death. On the dramatic side, we spend more time hearing people jabber on about nonsense than see them act upon anything. Characters in The Hunger Games seemingly talk AT Katniss, never TO her and it all funnels into unmemorable noise. The empty dialog is shuttled around by lots of unmotivated shaky cam and quick cutting nonsense that doesn't edit. The movie just doesn't flow well and in the scenes where it finally does - always in action - it is short lived. At the end of every scene, I was awaiting the commercials because it feels like a hastily produced FOX show for Friday night.I really just wanted to see the young and talented Jennifer Lawrence out in the wild tracking down Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Running Man. But instead we are held hostage by Gary Ross's witless direction and a dry talky script. This is a movie with a character but no story, a setup but no payoff. Lots of hunger and very little game.Don't tell me I should read the book, because I'll just tell you to watch a movie like Hanna, instead.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Given it's many, well tried angles of looking at it. Like deadly, old Rome type spectacles being shifted into a futuristic setting. Or the 1984 kind of healthy rural vs. decadent urban life style antagonism. ""Apocalypto"" type human sacrifice ceremonies, to tame the gods. And even some fashionable media critique - ""it's only a TV show"". A colorful collage to start with indeed. And still failing.Two major reasons: shallow actors, presumably meant to appeal to ""twilight"" type teenie audiences. And shoddy production, likely because they spent too much money on a plethora of big names for supporting roles and had to save it elsewhere.Look e.g. at what could have been a highlight of this film, a feast for the eye: the dance in the flaming dress. They cut that short though, and had to. Because it obviously looked fake, CGI. And in a poor - shoddy - way.Most of the above critique addresses just the first half of the film, the build up, anyway. Because once the kids are down in the woods hunting each other, the film becomes about as original as some boring TV episode about amazons hunting rabbits in a dumbed down fantasy environment. Serious yawner alert certainly applies there.Still two things may be taken away: Miss Lawrence is an actress sporting womanly features, which is rare these days and much appreciated. And Woody's the tutor you want, in any kind of situation, even if suffering from the worst hairdo of his movie career.Bottom line: if older than 16 better bring a cushion to rest your head on.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie sucks. The acting is terrible, the idea is really not even that creative or original, and the storytelling is beyond awful.I didn't read the book and I feel like you had to read the books in order to understand this movie. For example, the movie does absolutely nothing to explain why these hunger games are being carried out. This movie does nothing to explain who each of the characters are. This movie continually mentions the importance of sponsors and the importance of achieving a high fight rank/score, yet there is absolutely no explanation given as to what the sponsors or what the fight rank do. This movie does nothing to really do much of anything in filling us in on what we're watching.The quality of the sets, special effects, and costumes was bordering on embarrassing. I felt like I was watching a Star Trek episode where Jean Luc Picard goes down to one of the alien planets and interacts with various people. Other comparable quality comparisons: Xena Warrior Princess, Power Rangers, and Smallville. In other words, the movie looked like it was using television special effects, set designs, and costumes.There is one scene where the lead is being driven in on a chariot with fire and everyone is freaking out. That was the cheesiest/weakest fire chariots I could imagine. It was almost like the producers were presented with this sort of choice: Option 1, Bad ass, real-looking fire chariot, or Option 2, pretty sweet fire chariot, or Option 3, awful/terrible chariot but we'll save some money...and the producers go, ""We'll take option 3"" This sums up the entire movie--> it looks and feels cheap and like the producers were trying to make this for the lowest possible amount of money.Other bad parts of the movie: (1) The love story: they try to force a love story between the two leads yet I found myself being disgusted by the love story because the lead character is cheating on her at-home boyfriend. Lame. It make me hate both of the leads. Also the chemistry between these two was like a lukewarm bowl of unsalted Matzo ball soup; the romance was totally forced and was like a piece of cardboard; (2) the length--> this is a two-and-a-half-hour movie and it didn't need to be longer than an hour and a half. Nothing happened...the scenes were long and drawn out for no reason; (3)the fighting--> beyond cheap...no sense of darkness, no sense of aloneness, no sense of desperation. The movie was too DisneyLike, totally killed the realism and reality of what it would be like to fight in a death match; (4) the fact that the game makers changed the rules to create suspense and then changed the rules back to create more suspense. Yet, no suspense was created. The decisions were done within seconds and there was no emotion freak out by the actors...it was just a matter of, ""oh okay so we have to kill each other, well we don't want to so we'll kill ourselves."" and then the game warden jumps in.Overall, the movie was sloppy, poor executed, had terrible acting, and was essentially a failure at every single point of the movie. This movie just goes to show you that talent/skill are not required to make it big in show business.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

And nothing. Two lovers emerge as winners. The end. What happens next year? Her little sister gets picked and dies. What a terrible lesson in morality! All you can take home from this movie is some mindless action-packed survival scenes. Is it good to kill somebody, enjoy doing it, or watch people kill each other and get some sick rush out of it? Is something like this really going to happen in our future? Are we going to do something about it? Do we have solutions such that these things can never ever happen? No answers. What a terrible message (or the lack of one) to pass to young people. 1/10. Couldn't go any lower.

I knew a little about the premise and went to see what all the hype was about. As the movie progressed, I noticed an increasingly uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach. I just felt that there was something inherently wrong with this movie seeing kids killing other kids. It is one thing to read it in a book, but another to graphically display it on screen. It bothered me to see adolescents snapping each others neck, stabbing with knives/swords, closeups of young children lying dead with eyes wide open, all part of a game no less. While it was not over the top graphic violence, there was enough for me to feel uncomfortable given the young age of those being killed. I feel that Hollywood was clearly trying to capitalize on the popularity of the book and I feel they crossed a line by making a movie about kids killing other kids and mass marketing the movie to our kids. I can honestly not fathom a society where the adults would actually be entertained and cheer children hunting down other children. Maybe the acting was good, maybe the cinematography was good, but in the end I left the theater wishing this type of movie had never been made.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

They wanted to give you a sense of action, some thrill and extra drama dosage by visually killing the film. It lost any visual attractive.The plot is not quite bad at all; there are some interesting elements, but the premise that sustains the whole story (the Hunter Games celebration/Ceremony/Feast/TV Show/Sacrifice/etc) is not well explained in the movie, perhaps the books do a better job. The given theory is quite vague and contrasts with available technology and production means, wealthiness, etc.The Acting is not so bad, some recognizable faces do a decent performance; the protagonist (Katniss) does a great portray, and her character is really cool (at least so far) is not the stupid Bella from Twilight, this is a hard-boiled down-to-earth forest-side-girl, a true hunter and a rational human being, her deeds are credible.I hope that for the next 2 ones they don't focus the whole story around another Love-Triangle, I think we are kind of tired of the same crap; if the books are like that, I prefer to have the films a little bit distant from the books, letting Katniss to remain a cool Steve Macqueen Girl-next-door character.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

It's like a long made for Lifetime movie with a bigger budget. In the 1980s. And, also, that Gary Ross dude should not be allowed to make any movies no more.Cuz he kinda sucks. Dude can't help himself but to try and make every scene in the movie the most awesomely important moment in the history of the movies ever.Basically he made the perfect movie to promote on the Jay Leno show. Because Jay Leno sorta blows in the same way that this movie does.Did I mention it is too damn long? Oh I did? But it's still true so it's worth saying again. I heard that they got these people that work on movies that are supposed to edit them or whatever. Where was that guy on this movie? Did he go out for a bacon sandwich when he was supposed to be doing that? There's no way he was in that little room with a pair of scissors snipping up this movie because every scene went on forever.Not that I care about it. It's not like I read these books and liked them. They are for teenagers so I didn't read them at all. Never read them straight through in like three nights. That's not my thing.Oh. And one more thing...Can people stop bringing little sick babies that cough and kids who are four years old to movies about teenagers who have to cut each other's heads off and stab each other and break each other's necks?I only say this because I guess that message hadn't gone out before my showing of the movie.","14 out of 31 found this helpful.

So this review is only about the movie experience. Which was a huge let down for me.***Contains spoilers*** I HATED that the fight scenes were directed this way. All those shaky effects right in front of the cameraSeriously?! They were so messy and annoying that I couldn't see what was happening. Besides everyone died so quickly. Where were the real fights? For food, for water, for life? I didn't really feel the hunger"".I don't know if the books are written like this but I did miss a few things: 1. The character developments. For example: In the beginning Cato seemed so brave and confident, acting like a warrior who came here for winning this thing. And at the end? He was afraid and desperated, crying. I asked myself why? What happened to him? I wanted to see the moment when he broke, and realized he can not win. I wanted to see the moment which turned him.2. Why did Katniss cried so much when Rua died? Seeing the movie this part wasn't that clear to me.3. Although I know that Katniss is the main character I expected to see the others trying to survive in the Arena.4. Why didn't the movie show what the audience's reaction were to the fights, and basically to everything that happened in there? I thought I could see how they were rooting for the tributes.5. What about the sponsors? Have there been any? Because I haven't seen them. They emphasized in the beginning how important it was to get them. Only Katniss received sponsor gift parachutes? Nobody else? 6. Who is this Gale guy? Is it Katniss' boyfriend? Or a friend? Although I know the answer thanks to some of the book spoilers, in the movie it isn't clear. And I also don't know what's up with Peeta. Do they even know each other? Or what? I missed a little background story here.So these are only a few things that really annoyed me during the movie. Maybe I just went to the theater with too high expectations. But it's because The Hunger Games was soooo hyped! People said it was going to be awesome. Maybe even the best movie this year. But it wasn't. So I'm disappointed. But I must admit even though this movie sucks the books must be really good.","22 out of 54 found this helpful.

Vital plot points were not included whatsoever or were butchered beyond recognition for anyone that read the trilogy. For those who have not read the series, the movie will make absolutely no sense as none of the characters are introduced or even remotely developed beyond a very shallow puddle of what would even be considered acceptable for a protagonist or lead character.Rushed, bad camera angles, horrible graphics, very poorly adapted, deviates dramatically from the novels, annihilates the possibility for a continuation, invalid sequencing of events, contains spoilers of the second and third books, unnecessary and ridiculous additions, no emotional or mental insight to ANY of the characters, and removes all significance or meaning from the story. This can hardly even be called ""The Hunger Games"" for how horridly the story was followed as the only aspects that remain intact are the characters' names.This is a mockery of the series and deserves absolutely no praise for even a single minute of the entire two and a half hour film.","28 out of 72 found this helpful.

Maybe it's spelled ""drek"". We see it here often in these reviews. It's the stuff that comes out of the south end of a horse going north. It's stuff that's most often flushed away. This movie is dreck. It should be flushed away. Yet another case of a director taking a great work by a great author and thinking s(he) is even greater, so the work has to be distorted somehow, so the director's ego's stamp is on it, so everyone will say ""this director is a genius in his own right. (NOT). I guess it's tough to be a mediocre director faced with putting on a work of greatness. Where is the director's input? Sorta like opera, where they intentionally sing out of tune and harshly, and those egoists call that art. Opera has been around for hundreds of years, yet this horrible rendering of it is only 50 years or so old. Movies have been around less time, but they're already mucking it up so they can say, ""look at me, I can f*ck it up, and I did, so go blow"", like children in a playground. It's really amazing how many shills the producer got to vote high ratings and give good reviews. Actually, I have to commend the producer and director for the con they perpetrated. Obviously, they put in the least amount of cost and work, and they got mega-millions back for their paltry effort. The bottom line, thats the reality of our world. I'm sure one could write a high school English essay about the role of ""bottom line"" in the ""Hunger Games"" book. That might have more value then this movie dreck.

Effectively making a very mediocre 12A taking away from its cult status. This film lacks all the elements of horror and the fight for survival, also the struggles of the poor versus rich and the evil ruling elite from the book. Instead we see a lot of Hollywood stereotypes and tweenie wannabes. With their smiling faces and over dialogues and CGI special effects. Well I had real hope here because it had a great story, sadly it was a complete cop out and the on screen content was really lacking. Ultimately I am thankful though this film smashed the box office higher then Twilight, so at least this group of audience is starting to head on better themes. Although I am absolutely disappointed with this final product, it could have been a lot better instead of making it with such a puke factor. The smiling faces and massive dialogue and those oh wow special effects. In place of the horror and terror and gore, the evils of the ruling elite and the ultimate fight for survival.

The movie followed the book fairly well, but had to tame down the violence to keep it in the PG-13 rating. Acting was actually pretty good. I do wish they would have started the movie off with a quick overview of why they have the hunger games, but that can be easily forgiven.What CANNOT be forgiven is the feeling of seasickness I had because of the horrible camera work. Every scene was shot from what seemed to be a camera set on top of a bucking bronco. This made it not only difficult to understand what was happening in the scenes, but actually made me dizzy and I left the theater feeling like I just stepped off of a roller coaster.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I know, the author of the book says she had never heard of it before but I am sure the guys in Hollywood were pretty much influenced by it. I enjoyed the first half of the film, getting more into the societies structure and getting info about the games was a good choice, maybe spending half the film outside the battle was a bit much though. On the other hand, the second half totally sucked. The battle was without any believable emotions, character development suddenly stopped and everything came down to a couple of action sequences centered on one person rather than showing emotions and complex interaction of the many. Also, the actual cruelty of these games was not portrayed appropriately. All these things made Battle Royale a greater film and rendered this one a waste of time for me since I have seen it in a much better way before.","15 out of 35 found this helpful.

It sounded a lot like Battle Royale, but any movie that has that sort of 'last man standing... with kids!' Game employed would sound like Battle Royale. That movie was truly the first of its kind. After seeing the promos for this film my intrigue subsided slightly, as it looked like a child's film... Low and behold, it really was.Firstly, I don't know why subject matter like that should be aimed at children as it's quite dark, so why attempt to make it a 'safe' film and torture mature audience members with things such as awfully obscure camera work (to hide the violence) and in whole, a watered down film?Secondly, if the books were anything like the film then that's not a good reflection on society, as there is no way that these should become best sellers based on story telling (then again, Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey became bestsellers). I doubt that the book and film had too much in common anyway. This movie contained a few too many plot holes that grinded on me (what happened to the 'sponsors'?) as well as some cringeworthy lead role acting, and did I mention the watered down plot?Another thing that gets a notable mention is that the female protagonist doesn't do anything in the whole film without someone else's help! I found that rather annoying, as a good protagonist in a film like this I'd expect some sort of kick-assness about them.To cut it short, I thought it was too long, too safe and way too commercial for it to be respected by cinema-goers. I wish Takashi Miike could get hold of something like this. This was way too mainstream for anything good to amount from it.It gets 2 stars because of Woody Harrelson's performance keeping me awake.","14 out of 33 found this helpful.

Enter, ""Katniss Everdeen"" played by the tall and attractive but physically weak Jennifer Lawrence. Add in pot head Woody Harrelson and Lawrence's boy toy co-star for pure tripe.Only in the delusional minds of feminists will a female come out on top in a fight to the death survival game that lacks firearms. The writer of the book thought (apparently correctly) that there were enough wussified males to fall for such a ridiculous premise. I just kept laughing throughout the movie as one unrealistic nonsensical scenario after another allowed our heroin to stay alive. She really did nothing intelligent but instead ran around aimlessly and got help from spectators.Why not make the hunger games more interesting and only leave a bow with a 60-70 pound draw weight to use, unlike the 30-40 pound little kids bow in the movie. Would that not be politically correct to watch our female lead fail to be able to even pull the bow back? Poor feminists and their delusional fantasy land.Fathers everywhere need to man up and talk to their sons who ""love this movie"" and make sure it is simply because they like the way Jennifer Lawrence looks in a body suit.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

To prove her wrong, I packed the family out for movie night to shell out $60 just for the sake of losing it. Well I'd have to say that I was thoroughly unimpressed by the storyline, the acting, the action, and that awful camera-shake effect. Not only did the slow pace of the movie get me nauseated, the camera got me nauseated. My kids? Well, they simply got bored and caught some z's for half the movie. They're experienced movie-goers mind you and anything that involves a thoughtful storyline, great action, or captivating drama keeps them going. The movie did not supply enough of any. My wife? She admitted that she wasn't impressed with it either, especially after she had read the e-book -- mainly having the same complaints as I did, but with only the reader's ""disappointment"" insight added. In a nutshell, I'm not going to flatter you with a true critic's linguistics or intellectual discourse in this review. If you like tweenie movies that are overly hyped (e.g., the Twilight series), have no qualms about losing your hard earned dough, have no concept of time, are endowed with high tolerance for camera shake, then go for it and more power to you.

First off what's up with the shaky camera, the thing was going all over the place and was making my dizzy, at one point i thought my coke a cola was spiked. I was busy glancing side to side to keep up with the screen. Action is blurred, not sure what's going on in the fight scenes maybe due to the PG-13. But don't expect any good action out of this. Character Development...non existent, okay who are these dozens of kids again. People will pop up randomly only to never be seen from again. What's the purpose, why is this world the way it is...i never discover that? Even though the following three films / shows aren't the best you are better off with them, as this is tailored to lower high school and below audiences....Condemend - similar themed, more action, more purpose. a group of inmates are selected to duke it out on an island for a game show.Cast Away - More development in Mr. Wilson the 4 year volleyball friend of Tom Hanks. Again no character development in the hunger, I'd rather watch Tom Hanks talk to his volleyball on an island for 2hrs, than to watch 23 teens randomly pop in frame then disappear. I don't know who to root for or why....and you know what i would root for Wilson hands down!!! Oh and also it seems like i'm only dealing with the main character throughout the story and everyone else is just a prop.First Season of Lost - Why because you are completely lost with a lot of the unexplained events. Remember those deadly tornado death machine things....What's with the ""numbers"". Same thing here, also there are going to be a lot of random things that are conveniently written to move the story forward in the protagonists favor..ala lost.Anyway I'm sure the books are better, this is just Hollywood using it's get rich quick formula...slap together a film based on a popular teen book (ala twilight) get some cool youngster eye candies on the screen for the boy and girl dreamers out there. throw in some romance to hook them and there you go 200 million in global sales, before the audience realizes they have been dupped.

Save yourself the time and money seeing this and just rent that one unless of course you're 12, then this movie is for you. That said, this movies biggest problem is that its main focus is about killing, yet they skimp out on showing any actual killing. The opening scene of the battle shouldve been a bloodbath, but instead turns into a copout cutawayfest as the camera only shows people falling down dead after what we assume is being stabbed or whatnot. You cant make a movie about such dark themes and not have violence. its just absurd. they seem to have blurred out all the actual plot and violence, and focused on the fake relationship between the main actress and her peer(which is lackluster at best) to sell this movie to the tween audience its clear that the movie industry was trying too hard to market this movie to tweens(apparently the adult and mature teen audience don't matter anymore), even despite the fact that they would have to sabotage the entire film to do so. so instead of having an intense thriller that leaves you at the edge of your seat, you find yourself shifting in your seat out of boredom. The character development is so poor that you don't really care if anyone dies either (accept for the black girl). I felt like massive chunks of plot were left out or something because there is a scene where people stand up and riot, but that cuts out after 5 seconds and is never shown again, and that seems like its a key piece of plot...especially if there are sequels. its sad when the entire time, all i could imagine was Jean Claude Van Damm running through the woods in 'Hard Target' as he was being hunted down. whats even sadder is that that movie had better acting and character development LOL!","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

The Shawshank Redemption is of course a great movie, the acting, the plot, the writing, the camera works, the expression of actors and actresses.This movie is no way near when you say to yourself things like ""this could be done better"",... The plot and content make no sense and logic to me. It's up to you to judge.BUT, let's vote down any kind of child killing media, unless you want the next generation thinks that killing another child does not look so bad...??For real happiness, let's go home and what some Walt Disney's, let me suggest any of the Disney classics, and if you are stranger to the classics, let try The Incredible or Finding Nemo. If you've already seen them, let's watch them again, to see how smart the set, the director, the creator, the artists,... are to make such movies. Or, how about Transformers, for some real awesome actions where no one is killed (well, maybe, but you get my idea).I don't think I will want to watch any other movies of the same director / writer and no more movies under 8.0 rating ( I raised my bar from 7.0 to 7.5 to save my wasted time already).Please DO NOT watch the film if you don't want to be angry or sad.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

The story,the characters,everything which gives the reader so much to think about.I was honestly pretty excited to see this movie,but i told myself not to have high expectations and in the end i'm glad i listened. Now i do have to say the first half starts out promising.We come across the character of Katniss Everdeen as she gets prepared for the yearly reaping of two children,a boy and a girl from each district to battle to the death. This half was good and i did fell tension between a lot of the characters and i liked that. But the second half when the games actually begin,i found myself starting to realize a lot of changes!They took out a lot of things i quickly noticed while i was watching.People said they made minor changes,but i think their were major changes.From taking a part out or just adding in an extra scene made me feel like it could have been executed better.Occasionally it worked but overall it kinda ruined it. So the bottom line is i give it a thumbs up to the look of the movie,which pretty much covers all the details in the book,capturing the capitol city wonderfully. Also a thumbs up to Jennifer Lawerence,Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci for their fine performances. Thumbs down for the lack of details i wanted to see,lack of acting for certain people (Josh Hutcherson) and the last half of the film which to me seemed kind of anti climatic. Also i didn't like Ross's camera work in this movie for one reason.The majority of fight scenes were all done hand held and it really ruins the action.5 out of 10.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Message lost in graphic violence","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2587476/?ref_=tt_urv","forcommentary","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32712847/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2012","The underlying themes of this movie appear to have been redemption, fighting oppression, determination and perhaps other positive ideas, but sadly and unfortunately these are buried deep beneath the violence and gore typical of the Hollywood shock value system that values shock factor above such notions. What's more disturbing is that the trend in shock violence and gore for most films was confined for the most part to adult (R) rated films - not that this stops younger people from seeing them, but at least such classification prevents the implication of a gross societal acceptance for such graphic imagery to some extent.Not so with this film - by allowing a rating of PG-13, not only has the MPAA grossly neglected their duties in classifying age appropriate material, but it has allowed for such abject violence to be viewed as ""acceptable"" - even more so than before (e.g. ridiculously graphic video games) - by the teen/young adult population, with potentially far-reaching repercussions on a large subset of our society already faced with the difficulties of understanding their place in the larger world around them.It seems we are always wondering: where does so much violence in our society come from? We watch the news, constantly aghast as we see people, particularly young people, acting out in amazingly violent and shocking fashion - seemingly ""out of nowhere"".Yet here we are, charged with shepherding our youth, but instead of giving the care and attention we should about what our kids and teens are exposed to, we are constantly allowing them access to violence, more so than even adults, in the form of movies like these, video games, etc. We already know full well they are in such a hurry to grow up and that when we allow them to see this they think this kind of exposure and ideology is ""just part of growing up"". We know that they look to adults for guidance as young people - what exactly are we showing them with images of wanton butchering, lifeless children's eyes, etc.? Do we really think that teens, who deal with so much already in learning to understand the world, will see past that so easily? Will a teen watching this really get the sense that this is ""really"" about how depraved society can be, or ""rising above oppression"", or any of that? Or are they more likely, especially younger teens, to be scared and shocked by the violence they see, and believe, at least to a certain extent, that there must be some basis for this kind of violence in the real world? And does the fact that there is basis for this in the real world mean that it should be used for entertainment purposes and to enrich movie-makers at the cost of suppressing the true indignities and butchery that goes on in the world and that does involve children, teens and young adults?Shouldn't we require a different venue, a more controlled way of introducing such things to our youth, if we feel that they in fact be introduced? Should they be introduced to a 15 year old? A 14 year old? A 13 year old??Either way, is this kind of ""shock"" a good thing for kids & teens? How are we not concerned that this will so wrongly plant concepts of violence in them, especially for teens who already use violence to deal with problems or emotions they can't control well - which we know sadly is a large percentage? Furthermore, we know that kids & teens especially tend to mimic and idolize what they see, especially when it's in a ""cool movie"" , or comes from a ""cool book"" that ""everybody"" likes. Unfortunately we know that many of them just haven't developed the ability to distinguish between ""fiction"" and ""reality"" enough - certainly not to the point where there wouldn't be at least some negative effects from this kind of imagery. And isn't the movie, by the fact it is a big ""cool"" Hollywood movie, implying ""this violence is cool"" or ""it's cool to use weapons on each other"" or ""well killing is the only option if you have to survive"" etc.?Try to think about this for a second: IF THE MOVIE MAKERS OR AUTHOR CARED MOST ABOUT WHAT THE SUPPOSED ""MESSAGE"" OF THE FILM WAS - I.E. TO BE CAREFUL OF HOW SOCIETY CAN DETERIORATE TO OPPRESSION ETC. - THEN WHY WOULD THEY NEED THE ADDED VIOLENCE, BLOOD & GORE IMAGES?? They could have easily show or depicted the death and drama indirectly, instead of visually showing it to the extent they did - just think of older Westerns or other ""action movies"" where people were shot and ""killed"" but without the added ""shock value"" of actually seeing all the blood and gore. So clearly what they are really trying to do is shock the audience because that leaves more of an impression, regardless of whether it's a bad or damaging one, and that means better reviews, more of a following, and MORE $MONEY$. Maybe what we should realize from all of this is that as long as we allow MONEY and GREED to rule our lives from politics to entertainment, we will continue to have major problems around the world that affect us all - which is ironically the only concept of the book that is worth understanding, but which is confused behind the unnecessary violence and gore which again wasn't really needed to get the point across, if it even does come across to the teens who are so shocked by what they see.Maybe we should encourage all parents and young people to be honest and label these truly as attempts to create ""hype"", take advantage of teens and to make money for the movie studio (and the author by the way).","14 out of 35 found this helpful.

I only read a bit of the next book out of curiosity but realised that I couldn't bother to finish such a crap book :L. It was so stupid and unoriginal. In my opinion they messed up with the characters too. Gale doesn't seem right and neither does Katniss. Katniss is meant to be 16 whereas Jennifer is not. I liked the bow and arrow thing but that's probably because I was interested in it before I bothered with 'The Hunger Games'. I fell for it because every one seemed to be reading it and saying how good it was. If you're about 14/15 or so, you might like this film and the books of course.

First off, it's insane to think a 12 y/o girl can compete against an 18 y/o (professionally trained) man. However, that seems fair to this ""advanced"" government. So, after 2 weeks of preparation, their plans are to die instantly or run away. There are few battles and you get just a countdown of everyone dying off in the distance somewhere. There's a gang of 5 or 6 that KNOW only one can survive, but no one back-stabs (literally) anyone. The rules change and are very predictable. Somehow, without explanation, the controllers of the game can make fire bombs appear or mutant dogs, but for some reason ""sponsors"" can help.

So this movie has been getting a lot of hype for a while and thus I was expecting a really immersible and engaging movie, this is just not it at all. I enjoy watch premises like this although it has been done before and in this case it has been done much better than this. The movies that comes to mind is ""Battle Royale"" and ""The Running Man"". ""Battle Royale"" has done a better job with this type of premise and made it engaging although it can be startling at times. And although it had way more students having to play the life or death game, most of them stood out to some degree. And it focused on all the different students while having very few main protagonist the story revolved around and it still worked. This time there is like 24 students playing the game and none of them stands out except maybe 2. The movie focuses on two characters in the game but after a while they just come off bland and boring after a while. I don't get why they would have 24 people playing if hardly any of them stand out at all. There is also obvious plot holes in this movie as well. So in this there is couple of Districts going from rich to poor, while the rich district look futuristic and very retro the poor districts looks like the people are living in the 1930's. With all the hype this has been getting I didn't expect a teenage romance movie but that element is a big part of this movie. I should have caught one when bunch of 12 yr old girls were at the bookstore looking for this book and being really into it. So there is 24 teens fighting for there lives but you don't care about any of them, there is almost no character development so if one dies there is no attachment. Jennifer Lawrence was pretty good as Katniss and Woody Harrelson stood out but that is about it. The theater was packed but a lot of the audiences was yawning and I heard one of them say ""this movie sucks"". The romantic parts are drastic and super corny to the point even the girls were giggling and laughing. And not because the movie was trying to be humorous but the some of the audiences was laughing at how corny the movie is. This movie just lacked excitement. What was really disappointing is the main event where the teens has to fight each other to live. But that was the most boring part of this movie, the beginning when the teens get selected and the training is more entertaining than when the actual game begins. So the build up for the main game is drawn out for a long time but the build up leads to disappointment cause it just isn't that entertaining. The cinematography is choppy just so they can show the violence off screen sometimes since this is a movie for wider audiences. I can sort of see the direction this was wanting to go but it just didn't get there. This might have worked better as a TV show with maybe 6 episodes for better development maybe. I haven't read any of the books in this series and this movie slightly made me want to read it. Since it's been getting a lot of hype and the movie just wasn't that good, thus the book might be better. And this might be a poor transition from book to movie. Elizabeth Banks is also in this and she plays Effie, I don't don't know how that character is in the novel but she was pretty good in this and when I first saw the movie I couldn't recognize her.5/10","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was so looking forward to watching it and it fell so short of my expectations. The plot is not coherent, a lot of things make no sense. There is no culmination to the movie. The story line makes no sense. One may ask himself a lot of why-questions when watching the movie, but there are no answers, which doesn't help . The movie doesn't grab your attention and does not keep you engrossed in it, especially the second half of the movie. All in all, I do not recommend anyone to watch it. It's not worth your money.

So fake, reminded me of the kardashians. director and producer blow up. What a way to waste a fantastic cast.Based on a story of our recent reality TV craze. Dysfunctional emotions, screenplay, very fake characters and acting. Couldn't wait to get out of the theatre.Right from the start of the movie, you know the end and you basically have to go through this painful 2 hours to watch it happen. Couldn't really make out if the movie was supposed to be happening in the past or the future. Just because they could stage a fancy reality show, it looks like they are in the future. But,looking at the districts, it looks very primitive. The characters themselves seem to be so confused on what emotions they should portray in each shot. Since every scene they have to act in a completely different way than what they were doing in the previous scene. All in all, what a fabulous way to blow up 78 million.Coming to the story itself, given our recent craze to watching the kardashians or the RHOBH the Jersey Shore, etc - was kind of numbing to know that we are not far from watching something like this in the next few years on reality TV.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

And some parts in the movie that were supposed to be serious were instead so ""cheesy"" that half the people watching the movie just laughed.30 minuets into the movie it hit me, the reason I was finding this movie so unenjoyable was the poor cinematography. 90% of the time the camera was 2"" away from the characters faces. So instead of a cool battle scene we simply saw peoples faces scowling. And because all we could see was their face, there was no context for anything to happen in. So normally illogical scenarios seemed logical because there was no context.

The feelings of savagery and blood-thirst are so confusingly mixed with feelings of compassion and love from the side of the people of the Capitol that those inhumane feelings of slaughtering and hatred have in a way been endorsed. I don't give a D if someone defends the film by saying that this Game has turned into a tradition for the people after decades of practicing because it is, I believe, only in the most nefarious period of human spirit (if imaginable) that these kinds of traditions would be condoned or, as the film suggests, received full-heartedly and enthusiastically and that has had no instance except for the Dark Ages and the Arab Conquest! It's funny (for me, even disgusting) that the people of the Capitol show joy in watching blood spilling on the one hand and love and sacrifice on the other hand.Innovation is good, but not in a Frankensteinian way. One might think this is preposterous, but believe me, films of this sort cannot be without psychological effects on younger people.I can't help but restate that this film is dangerous for it fails to clear up the moral mess it creates in the film, which might not have been the director's intent, but it should have been. He's responsible for the Frankenstein he has released.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The anticipation was tangible as they waited to see how faithful the book was going to be to the movie, and if Katniss and Peter were all they had imagined them to be. What they saw was hard core dehumanization. The fact that we find teens killing each other in big-screen gladiatorial combat entertaining marks a new societal low. This is more than a movie, it is a desensitizing and trivializing of life and death as a form of twisted broadcast amusement. Best summarized from a line in the film, ""just think of them as the other animals you hunt"".

People my age may remember the Hunger Game's plot from a 1987 movie called 'The Running Man,' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson. I found myself squirming at the premise and really uncomfortable at the story. It is very transparent, I figured out virtually every important plot point very early in the movie. Plot devices like little parachutes delivering sponsored favors and controllers who can introduce forest fires and genetically-engineered Cujos into the arena do not make it more interesting, they make it even more ridiculous than it was to begin with. Katniss and Peeta are certainly ""redeemed"" characters and Peeta's desire to transcend the games certainly made it easy to figure out how the plot was going to wrap up. But even with these compelling heroes, the world is just as dark and hopeless at the end of the movie as it is at the beginning - in fact worse, because Katniss is pretending to be in love with Peeta. I know we are only a third way through the story, but still there should be triumph and hope. (Think about the end of Star Wars episode 4 or the Fellowship of the Rings - darkness still threatened in those stories, but hope was plentiful). So there is no redemption at the end of this very dark story. I have kept hearing about how it is ""poignant social commentary on American life."" The book may be, but the movie really misses the boat here too, making the movie even less relevant.I thought the acting was good (Great to see Lenny Kravitz acting again. Loved him in 'Precious'). The cinematography, art direction, and and costumes were great. Since I have not read the books, I cannot comment on the adaptation. I saw the film with my friend Jennifer Serling, who had read the books and thought the adaptation was more than adequate. There are some cute little plot points that I thought were okay - e.g. the ""fire costumes"" and ""mocking jay"" calls.) I found the movie visually stunning. the costuming in the capital was interesting but derivative (did you see a little film from 1939 called 'the Wizard of Oz'?)On the whole I think that the movie is a just okay adaptation of a children's story that is far too violent for children in both premise and story-telling. I won't be bothering to read the books and I could probably tell you the plot of the second book without much trying or thought...I was prepared to like it. I was hoping this second movie in one day would redeem another bad movie experience from earlier in the day (October Baby). Not so much. 4/10.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I'd read the bad reviews, but I still had to see how it held up to the original. Just too bad it doesn't at all. I will say the acting and score were decent.

I took my husband, who hasn't read the book, and the movie had little meaning for him.I grant you, it's hard to take a 1st person novel and film it. But even a crappy voice-over (as in Blade Runner theatrical version) would have helped this get closer to the spirit of the original. As it stands, it's just another PG-13 scifi flick that looks and is horribly derivative, leaving out most of the symbolism, motives, and background. Worse yet, the violence was toned down. Hard to believe, but true. Permanent maimings in the book became minor ""put some Neosporin on it"" wounds in the film. Good grief. The horrible, pointless violence the tributes were subjected to, and its scars, physical & psychological, was a major point in the book. Only fans of the book who are able to fill in the blanks and don't mind doing so would be happy with this. Am glad I went at very early matinée prices, because paying full evening price for this disappointing film would have been painful.

The love was completely underdeveloped as well as many of the characters (practically all of them). I found no depth to anyone even for Katniss which was shallow.

I never read the books, the advertisements were in my face at every turn, so I decided to check it out and see for myself if the hype was true.What I got was a mediocre movie with the only thing standing out was the acting by Jennifer Lawrence. That's it. She's good, no doubts about it, but not great by any means. The beginning of the movie was nice in the way it built things up, but the latter was a let down, and the movie as a whole could never live up to the hype that proceeded it.All in all the movie is a money-making machine created to become a multi-movie franchise that Hollywood will milk until there's nothing left to suck from the tit.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie looks like one shot by a high schooler that just got their first camera. Back in the late '60s American filmmakers began to experiment. They adopted the use of the extreme close-ups, and in attempt to show they were ""fresh"" some would rapidly pan the camera from actor to actor, and quickly move from full frame to headshot and back. They were trying to show they were innovative, but what it really showed is they were bad directors, and by the early '70s this experiment had mercifully died out. Unfortunately, a quarter of a century later a trio of poor filmmakers resurrected this herky-jerky camera style with the Blair Witch Project, and ever since some bad directors have been copying this failed style of 50 years ago to show they are new and original. I wanted to like this movie. I liked Jennifer Lawrence in X Men, but because of bad filmmaking I couldn't watch her.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

After watching it, I can only assume this is one of those movies where if you have not read the book, it will not make sense.Two examples.1. The relationship between Katniss and the first boy we see, and her more intense relationship with her fellow tribute. Clearly both are in love with her, but there is no real resolution of what her feelings for them are. Not good movie-making.2. There is, of course, one scene which appears to show some sort of uprising in her district, but it is very vague how it starts (because of the hand sign?) and there is no follow up or discussion of what it means and whether it is successful. In fact, not much is said at all about the exact nature of the government and whether people are chafing under it.A final pet peeve. The idea that small girls like Rue and Katniss's sister would be pitted against some of the bloodthirsty tributes is simply ridiculous. And even the idea that Katniss could compete against them (without firearms) is a stupid Hollywood (liberal) wet-dream.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

What's so nice about watching teens fight to the death in some kind of survivor gladiator tournament? The plot is irritating and annoying. The changing of the rules back and forth is silly. The pageant like beginning of the competition is out of place. About 20 minutes could have been shaved. The jerky camera action wasn't necessary and gave me a headache.The casting - apart from Jennifer the rest was hit and miss. Jennifer Lawrence is a believable and moving actress. She is good at looking like she is suffering and has the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her vulnerability and strength are touching. She manages tug some emotional strings as she did in Winter's Bone. But even she can't save material that is weak.Josh Hutcherson isn't handsome enough for a romantic lead. Even if they didn't want a heartthrob they could have picked someone slightly better looking. The chemistry between them is lacking and the love story unconvincing. There isn't enough reason for her to love him so much. Liam Hemsworth's role isn't big but he looks more earnest. Woody Harrelson as the mentor is too goofy. Donald Sutherland as the President is a bit feeble and looks like he would rather be elsewhere. Wes Bentley is suitably deranged looking. Elizabeth Banks getup is silly.There are very few good points besides Jennifer Lawrence. It isn't gory or too violent so the family can watch it if they want to. But careful about the message they might be getting. You do want to see how she survives. It is a bit touching in parts eg the initial parting.Overall not even really worth one watch for all the hype. It wasn't enjoyable or romantic like Twilight. Won't want to watch it again. Please don't make this a box office sensation that smashes all records. It just isn't good. Even enjoyed John Carter more. I think this one is more for fans of the books. If you like the premise of the story then you will probably enjoy it. Otherwise you probably won't.","17 out of 49 found this helpful.

Hopelessly without depth at every turn: ridiculous sets, garishly clownish costumes, and so lacking in character development as to be pointless. One gathers from the heavily conservative budget the studio really wasn't a believer or really committed. I also suspect the very able Gary Ross had his hands tied at every turn and wasn't allowed much creative input into the translation to the screen - it had none of his character outside of the district scenes. Who knows, maybe they'll do better next time now that they've been shown the money - but this one, pitiful.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

It stops there. Despite the fact the movie will make hundreds of millions of dollars in the box office, the studio should fire the Director and the DP (director of photography). Nearly entirely shot ""hand-held"", and shaky at that, the film will give the strongest stomachs a run for their money. I'll start by saying I've seen many films, I even make them, and i have a very sturdy stomach. But watching this movie set me off, giving me a full blown headache by minute 15, and making me nauseous by minute 30. I even had to get up and walk out for a few minutes to quell the vertigo. FAR too many close ups, even more too many extreme close ups, and all with a shaky almost nervous hand. It got to the point where as a character was running all we see is quick, shaky, close up cuts of the feet, then head, then feet, then face, then feet... This does not create suspense! The story is suspenseful enough! What's more is nearly EVERY action shot is blurred by the terrible choice of camera movements so that the audience really doesn't see what's going on. What's more, simple shots of the characters doing mundane things are ALSO shot in this horrid manner. Sadly I was not alone, as a dozen more people also left the theater to regain their equilibrium, some did not return. After the film many of us gathered in the lobby, all strangers, to openly complain about the films camera work. Several of those that left early demanded their money back. I must also speak to the positives of the film. The acting was well done, particularly by the films lead, Jennifer Lawrence. She portrayed emotion and lack there of as it was called for. Completely believable as the character Katniss Everdeen. The pacing of the film lacked a bit in the beginning but picked up quickly. My advice to future moviegoers: Sit in the top row. Distancing yourself from the screen may be the only method of effectively staving off the dizziness.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

I had some time available and didn't want to things I should have been doing, so I saw it. After some research on it, I understood what the plot was about. I confess it sounded interesting. What I didn't understand until the movie laid it out, was the whole televised spectacle that was driving it. As soon as that was put forth, I thought ""oh, The Running Man from the 80's"". As it turns out it's a lot more boring. The plot often contradicts itself, the action is mostly filmed in shakeycam and the hackneyed concept of the 'good hero' not able to kill just sours it for me. Maybe the other novels continue this story to it's expected conclusion. I do not know. I DO know I won't pay money to see the sequel.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

I have to say I didn't read the books,nor did I see the new moon thing because it would have been too much to digest.I cant live with it, but I think after I spent a great deal of my life watching movies,I can say this movie offended my intelligence simply because the plot is too weak and naive,yes it is... ""cheap to sell values"" writers and then of course Hollywood are selling the public Love ..Sacrifice ..etc....hey what else do we need from Hollywood other than the infinite wisdom..right? The Hunger Games is about a society suffering from hunger and poverty living like slaves under the sadistic rule of the mighty wealthy society which has it all from food to fashion (even that sucks) somewhere in the no place/time era...fine,but I didn't really get a grasp of the core selling point of it which is the game...really it didn't make any sense whatsoever to my little mind,yeah I'm in the 40 land of age. The movie has long scenes of mixed emotions supposed to transfer you and move you to the next level of the whole experience,but i found those long and boring,worthy of people who have overloaded emotions to give further to the one sitting next to.

My advice is to look up the genre* and take your pick.Better examples are: The Running Man, Battle Royale, Rollerball, Logan's Run, 1984, ... Gattaca, Equilibrium, Demolition Man, Robocop, ...Stretching the genre further, eg. *'Future Dystopia Movies', you will find films that hit the same targets more effectively, thus making this film what it is - redundant.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

That's not the point though, the movie constantly revolves around Fatness just like the cameraman did while pleasuring himself. It explores her deepest darkest emotions as she is put through a brutal test of beating kids from other districts in a contest of collecting and eating the most ham burgers they can find. How cruelly true to its name the games are gets epitomized in one scene where the kids are force fed a platter of Big Macs after just finishing off the BK Whopper challenge. Finally Fatness decides enough is enough and contemplate's to go on a diet while her competitors are savaging through one burger after another. Will she have the very last bite or will someone else have her burger and eat it too? Oh yeah there is also a love story in there somewhere like a pickle.Summary:- The big burger who played the role of Fatness deserves nothing short of a happy meal for her stomach churning performance as does the rest of the cast. I felt the movie makers have served the big Kahuna burger but they missed the sides completely. Call me picky but I wouldn't even consider biting into a burger without the mandatory fries and ketchup and add to that a lack of drinks leaves me feeling high and dry like I ordered an incomplete meal to begin with. For a lean and mean discerning viewer The Hamburger Games would be an indigestible fare and may lead to a stomach upset or worse diarrhea. Other chunky viewers who are pleased with any thing that the Hollywood fast food joint throws at them will most likely be hungry for more. Please consult your local burger joint before venturing into this gluttonous Hog-fest.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I seriously think he forgot to use standard lens and instead used zoom lens to focus on character faces most of the time. How weird, big screen filled with half faces. Fight sequence was also too fast to understand what's going on. Camera was shaking like 'The Office' series which causes me a headache if I had to watch like this for more than 2 hours.The most pathetic part was the climax where a sponsor of show announces two winners but later decide to go with one. I said to my self I had enough and moved out of theatre.I give this movie 3 out of 10 stars because of costumes and some graphic effects and that's about it.

I absolutely loved them - they were suspenseful, catchy, interesting, touching and overall an amazing read. So if you happen to be one of those people who saw this movie, hated this movie and decided not to read the books - please don't. The books are gold, seriously.The movie however...I honestly have no idea where to start. So many things were wrong with this movie, I'm having a hard time keeping track with all of them.First off, the shaky camera. This movie is filmed in a Blair Witch project style - ALL of it. That is to say, you get 10 minutes, at most, of focused camera time, before it starts shaking and blurring and giving you headaches. I've heard some people say that this was done in order to censor the violent scenes with kids killing each other and such. That may be true, but it's still a horrible idea. I left the cinema with a huge headache because of it.Second of all, I think the biggest problem for this movie is that, unlike the books, it was neither emotionally touching or action-packed.The action is missing, largely because of all the censoring, I'm guessing, so the movie can have its ridiculous and out-of-place rating. Half of the movie is spent with Katniss going through the entire pre-Hunger Games phases, which worked great for the book, but not for the movie. Technically, this part is supposed to make you empathize with the characters and get to know them better, only it fails so hard that, at the end of it, you not only don't care for the characters, but you're also bored because you were expecting action-y stuff if you haven't read the books.Then, you think, the Games finally start. FINALLY, there will be some action...except there isn't - not really. Because of the shaky camera, you can't understand much of what's happening, and because the movie doesn't really introduce 3\4 of the characters to you, you just get to see some random kids dying, often in stupid, uninteresting ways. Yawn.*SPOILERS AHEAD!!! BE WARNED!!* The thing that bothered me the most about this movie was the lack of any emotional connection to any of the characters we are supposed to care for. There may be very little of it regarding Prim, Katniss's sister. But other than that - Rue for example - it is severely lacking. In the books, we get to know Rue, and maybe even care for her, and we are sorry to see her die. In the movie, she's just some random black girl who gets killed. Again, yawn. Same goes for Peeta and everyone else. As for Katniss, she gets plenty of camera time, except that she is written poorly. In the end, I felt about as emotionally connected to her as I would feel with a wall. The acting wasn't bad, she was just written poorly. *END OF SPOILER* You can either approach this movie from a human point of view - make the audience care for the characters and sympathize with their situation, or you can approach it from an action-y point of view - throw in kick-ass effects, lots of action, make it interesting and exciting. You cannot do both in two hours time. That may work for other movies, but these books don't provide the proper material for such blending. The writers tried to do both, and ended up with none. Throw in the awful censorship - the entire point was to show the world how horrifying and terrible the Hunger Games were, which required some good measure of shocking images and display of violence. Add to that the shaky camera effects, some very ridiculous scenes, and you get the worst movie (by far) that I have seen in a long time.Bottom line - if you are truly interested in this idea, if you found the trailer interesting, if you feel any urge to watch this movie, just pass and buy the books. The books are extremely enjoyable, while the movie can simply be summed up in one word: fail.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The ""romance"" is just cheesy and high school like.Camera work is little overdone for being too shaky, and many of the ""actions"" are kind of skipped.Acting wise, it's kind of up and down for Katniss, at some point you can feel her toughness but at times it just feels like she is just being ""girl in iron mask"". She has hard time interpreting the ""fake love"" feeling with Peeta. What's worse is the tributes all look so FRESH and unharmed after all the suffering and exhaustion, it almost feels like they just have buffet and sleep 12 hrs daily in the wood.It just got kind of bad after mid point of movie, I keep seeing people come and go, to get water, get popcorn, go to washroom.

It is based on a book of the same name.This is an idea that has been explored in various literature and films - most notably in the preceding Japanese film (and book) Battle Royale.I happened to have read the book a week before seeing the film for the first time. The film's story follows the book exactly and that is it's biggest downfall. This results in the first hour of the film being simply exposition - it is slow and stealing time from what should have been the best part of the film - that is the games.Which brings me to the biggest factor that ruined this movie is the PG-13 rating. The subject matter is about death and ultra-violence and it is artistically ridiculous that the producers go for this rating. There is nothing shocking about the violence and that should be the main emotional impact. Though obviously they have been very successful in grabbing a whole mountain of money for this franchise.Despite a lot of exposition time, big problem with the movie (and the book for that matter) is the lack of character development from anyone other than the three or four main characters. There are 24 competitors, but we only really see two. People die, but you just don't care.This is definitely one to go straight to the book for. And then, read Battle Royale because that's twice as good! I'm looking forward to seeing the Battle Royale movie one of these days.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie is to over-hyped and won way to much money at the box office. It really wasn't that great of a movie. I am going to start with the first thing that I noticed was going to make the movie awful from the first scene was the shaky camera work. The entire movie had awful camera work, during the fight scenes which is supposed to be the whole point of the movie you could barley see what was happening because of the camera. Every review that I have read everyone is says that the acting was great, I didn't feel that way. Like most teenage actor/actress their acting really isn't that good and it was the same thing in this movie. There was no real emotion in any of the actor/actress voice, witch made the performance not believable. The dialogue was weak there was a lot of cheesy corny love lines, the movie is supposed to attract 10-13 year old kids and most kids don't want a movie filled with love lines. Another big problem with the movie was the character development, there was no connection with any of the characters and they didn't explain the characters well enough for any type of emotional connection when one of them would die. But I can't blame all of this on the filmmakers its mainly the authors fault because the book was made in 1st person the only character that we really know anything about is Katniss and to me that isn't good enough especially for a book where people are being killed. Finally the plot for the movie has been done to many time, Battle Royale is very similar to this movie, so because the plot has been done way to may times i felt that there was really nothing that was original in this movie/book. I recommend this for anyone who just wants to wast 2 hours, it nothing new nor special. I would wait for it to come out on redbox, netflix or when it is the $5 bin.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was ready to shoot the director about halfway through the movie based solely on the filming. The action scenes are way to jerky to be able to follow whats happening. There was a girl that was watching the movie sitting near us that left the theater twice, holding her hand over her mouth as if she was about to throw up. My guess is that she got a little motion sick, as I didn't think it was THAT bad.If you haven't watched it yet, I suggest reading the books first.

If you want to know what it was really about you should read the book instead of watching the movie. As far as who they picked to play the characters though they did a great job. The acting in itself is great. It was just everyone I talked to that watched the movie that hadn't read the book 1st was lost. They cut out or changed things they shouldn't have that just left them confused and asking questions. I was hoping that the people doing these movies would have learned after how badly they had screwed up the twilight saga.

And I was mostly not disappointed. Obviously the premise of this movie is that 24 young people between the ages of 12 and 18 are placed into an arena to fight to the death. The Hunger Games, as these annual events are called, are there to act as a warning to the people of Panem, a nation in the ruin of what was once North America hundreds of years in the future. Panem is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol, which is ruled by the ruthless President Snow. Every year a boy and a girl is chosen from each district to compete in these 'Games.' The protagonist of this film is Katniss Everdeen, a teenager who comes from the poorest district, 12. She has to hunt illegally to provide for her little sister and mother in poverty and in constant danger of starvation. She is chosen to compete in the Hunger Games.I adore the books, and the film was good, but not great. The plot was fine, as the filmmakers didn't make any big changes from the novel, and the acting was great, especially Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss. Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland and Lenny Kravitz round out the cast. All of them were great in it. The bad points of this were the shaky-cam direction style, the drawn-out feel of the 2 hour and 20 minute long running time and also the absence of a score in places which should have had music to make them more effective, e.g the choosing of the contestants. However, this lives up to my expectations and is a fun, exhilarating and interesting sci-fi action drama.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

True to its title, it kept me hungry for a solid entertainment. Set in near future , The Hunger Game is a live-captured tournament aired on the TV where two people from each district must compete and fight with each other in order to survive and win the title. The Review Directed by Gary Ross , The Hunger Games was like a thundering clouds which makes lot of noise before raining but actually doesn't rain at all. After watching such an exciting trailer, you will feel a complete let down. Neither it is thrilling nor exciting at all. Loosely based on a novel of same name , the story of a girl struggling to survive do raise few eyebrows but that does not transpire into an must-watch film. Direction is completely immature with movie running sluggishly at a snail pace. There is not even a single moment which is entertaining. Story is good which could have made more sense given in the hands of some other director. Screenplay is haywire. I did not understand if every participant has to kill each other to survive , why everyone was after Kate ? How come little Rue came to find the whereabouts of Kate and how did she protect her continuously for 2 days ? I am still surprised to the 7.5 IMDb rating for this boring flick. The only silver lining is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence. She leaves no stone unturned when it comes to superb acting. Rest of the star cast are average. At Direction and Cinematography is good. Background score is nice. Dialogues are just OK. Overall , a very boring and disheartening film moving at a snail pace. Neither it is entertaining nor it has any good action scenes to keep viewer's interest alive. Disappointing 1.5 /5","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Second of all, it is because many of the things in the movie can not be understood completely without knowing the background stories. I was really disappointed to see that they changed so much, not just removing plots from the book, but also adding happenings that wasn't even in the book to begin with, and which didn't make any sense at all. What a disappointment! I'm not a director, nor do I have any knowledge when it comes to film making..but I do know what makes a good movie, and considering the emotions I got from reading the book, it could have been made in a much better way. The movie didn't get any of that at all. It was like watching a recap of a movie, I bet you could tell a lot of things were missing even if you hadn't read the book. Why not just make two great movies instead of just one really bad? That's how they make money in the film industry now anyways. Oh well.. I'm not bitter. Not at all.

But the end result disappoints big time. There has been a lot of fuss around the fact that it's an excellent adaptation from the original books and that it has lots of similar moments to Battle Royale. Well coming from a person without any pre-conceived notions (neither watched the Battle royale nor read the books)this movie came across as a very poor attempt of film making as well as the story telling. Performance:- Jennifer Lawrence is pleasing to the eyes and acts decently promising a good future, But Josh Hutcherson is a misfit. Liam Hemsworth's role is next to nothing. Woody Harrelson does provide some lighter moments though. Cinematography:- The Shaky camera approach to almost every action scene takes the sting out of this so called action thriller. Where is the fun if you can't see what's happening. Screenplay:- Unaware of the book details I would say the events unfolding in the movie are predictable to say the least. The struggle of the protagonist doesn't seem challenging or real enough and the cheesy end doesn't help its case either. Direction:- One word - Poor.The healthy premise of a promising subject was executed badly. Hope they improve over this ordinary effort in the sequels to come (which seems quite unlikely with the same technical team around and the amount of mad money the film has made) as I definitely felt my hard earned money was wasted in its ticket.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I had seen all the trailers, all the interviews with the actors, and read most of the critic's reviews. I was so bored. Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress, and just comes across as likable and down to earth. She's also unusual looking and natural, so she's believable as Katniss Everdeen. Gale is just obviously so must better looking than Peeta, there is no competition and there was no chemistry between Katniss and Peeta whatsoever, or if there was I didn't sense it. Katniss seemed to pity Peeta, and it didn't help matters that Katniss was taller than Peeta, like a big sister and little brother. I loved watching Stanley Tucci more than any other actor. Donald Sutherland seemed barely awake. Wes Bentley was just pretty to look at...those EYES. Woody Harrelson as the tortured soul wore me out with his anger and disappointment. Elizabeth Banks was supposed to be annoying as Effie and she was. Casting could've been better. Too much time in the same place...the forest. I found myself looking at my watch and wishing it was over. And, though there were references to hunting for food, and 'make sure they don't starve,' nobody looked hungry or skinny or very concerned about food, event when there were tables full of lustrous desserts. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it just seems like the characters were one dimensional, the story wasn't explained very well, and the settings were without visual variance. The costumes were interesting...as if everyone was trying to out-weird each other. Then, in the next scene, they would dress Katniss in a traditional gown, minimal make up, elegant hair. So...not clear on what the fashion trends of the times were in this movie. The ""fire"" was genius, and I would've enjoyed seeing more of those types of visual effects. Maybe the sequel will be better. Maybe the books are better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

While some of those scenes are impressive, and may satisfy on that level, it ignores everything else about a good movie. Characters are terribly developed, dialog is weak, storyline is predictable with way too many convenient developments. I even found the cinematography disturbing. Action/fighting movie fans will even be disappointed as those scenes are nothing but ordinary (except it's disturbingly all children, of course). Romance fans will be saddened at the cheap attempts to make us care about relationships.

The fear that the book generates, the suspense, the horror and the hope are all missing. The book is fabulous, movie doesn't even have the essence of the book. To say that all the good things have been shortened and marred of their existence will be an understatement. Too much is missing. The part with Rue is so under defined. I don't know how the people who haven't read the book are ever going to understand the true thing. The book describes every moment, every particular detail of how Katniss feels, the movie however, doesn't depict anything. The producers should have realized that this book can not be made into a movie. The book is about the horror of each moment. It is in Katniss' first person. A movie can never describe that. Failure of an attempt. I'm disappointed.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A typical book-to-movie translation, but with terrible camera work too","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2665304/?ref_=tt_urv","bayou_hannibal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34037648/?ref_=tt_urv","27 August 2012","The Hunger Games movie is like a lot of book-to-movie translations. It is at least watchable, largely because of the quality of the source material. But, also like a lot of book-to-movie translations, it suffers badly from the need to take all of the background and story that you get from a novel and cram it into a movie of acceptable length. In this case, it has to be date movie length. The usual result is a mediocre effort where you can see the brilliance of the source material around the periphery, but which still makes major sacrifices out of necessity. The Hunger Games is a little worse than the usual result, because it also has possibly the worst camera work that I have ever seen in my life. I guess that's what happens when you hand the keys to the Hunger Games Ferrari to a director whose only accomplishments are Pleasantville and Seabiscuit.I hadn't heard of the book series until the movie was about to come out, and then my wife told me the general outline. My reaction was ""Holy crap that sounds cool? Why didn't anyone tell me about this before?"" It is a futuristic, semi-post-apocalyptic story where an oppressive government stages a horrifying gladiator match between 24 children once per year. It is The Running Man, but this time with innocent kids, and it is much more disturbing. The best part about The Hunger Games is how unsettling it is. The movie gives you a brief background of how this came about – A few generations ago, some of the country rebelled against the government, resulting in a terrible Civil War. The rebels lost, and, as punishment, each district must now offer up two kids as ""tribute"" every year. You can tell while watching that the movie gives you the thumbnail version of this story. It's enough to make the movie work, however.At every moment, regardless of what is happening on the screen, the movie's premise sits at the back of your mind. The kids are addressed as ""tributes"". The privileged elite take bets on the contestants and watch it like the Super Bowl. How could a society become so cruel? How can some parts of the population become so dehumanized that they delight in watching teenagers hunt each other like animals and slash each other with knives and swords? If you win, are you so scarred for life from having to kill other kids that you would have been better off losing? You might be asking yourself that after seeing Woody Harrelson's character. As the lone winner from District 12, he is famous and now part of the elite. So what does he spend the day doing? Drinking away his misery.The movie works. That is about the best thing that I can say about it. The raw material is good enough to at least keep you from switching if off. Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well. The biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that the movie is completely unable to deliver its events with the emotional weight that they need. Characters follow their actions in the book, but they make no sense on the screen because we haven't been given adequate background. Characters die with sympathetic music and tears, but none of these deaths register with you, as the viewer. Why? Because everyone other than Katniss hardly gets any screen time. The actual death match only lasts about an hour on film. In that time, lots of people get killed, but none of them with enough buildup or suspense to pack a punch. We never get enough information to understand the dynamics between the contestants. Even when the movie's ""villain"" bites it, if you want to call him that, there's less of a feeling of relief, and more the feeling of ""eh, I guess this means the movie's over now?"" Time after time, I had to swallow something that seemed implausible at the time, thinking to myself ""the book probably explains this better"". According to my wife, it does.A good director could have made this movie better. Unfortunately, the camera work in this movie is a disaster. I am flabbergasted by how bad it is. A major part of this movie, if not most of it, appears to have been shot with a hand-held camera. Unlike lots of other ""shaky cam"" movies though, it's not just the action scenes that will hurt your eyes. Dialog and exposition scenes also feature this terrible camera work. The camera constantly drifts or shakes. The angles are poor. You get close-ups when you want to see wider shots, and you get wider shots when you want close-ups. I don't go into movies looking for reasons not to like them, but five minutes into this one, I was already annoyed. By the halfway point, I wanted to punch the director in the face.Is The Hunger Games worth watching? I guess so. I don't regret watching it, but I have little desire to see it again. What I really wish is that this book had been made into a TV series ala Game of Thrones. Then, it could have been given the time that it needed to better develop its characters and background. The Hunger Games movie feels a lot like the Cliffs Notes version of the novel.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The storytelling seemed choppy, and everything came off as too sudden because there wasn't enough time to provide setup that would have explained character motivations. Katniss' commentary was also lacking, of course, and it was hard to tell what was she was thinking. It's especially bad, I think, if you've read the books, because then you know just how much is going on in her head, and what you're missing out on! The movie gives little hint that a large part of Katniss' connection to Peeta is how she feels that she owes him for helping her. And the association with the dandelion---thus her ability to support self and family---is never mentioned at all! It feels like the human depth was stripped from the story for the movie, and the romance was played up a little too much as such. Did not accurately portray Katniss' conflicted state.Interesting how Portia just suddenly appeared in the background. And I rather missed Venia, Octavia, and Flavius. And why did it almost seem like the mockingjay pin was contraband? In the book, they were all permitted to have an item from home, and hers was approved.Overall, it wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I just got done eating before the movie and it almost made me sick. I understand they wanted you to feel like you were running with them but not done very well. If you want a good example watch Last of the Mohicans great camera work.Plot: They did have lot of the books but they seemed to keep out key points. When Karniss and Peeta meet for the first time they are 11 not 15 or 16 makes for a much more dramatic scene knowing he risked so much to help her. They added too many shot from the command center which are not in the book. Could have let those out and put in more scenes from the book. What happened to the bread from district 11 to thank her for what she did when Rue died? What happened to the sleeping meds for Peeta since he would not let Karniss go to the feast? Where was the break up/fight scene at the end of the book. I guess they wanted to end on a happy note.I was disappointed.

That said, The Hunger Games, as the latest literary craze, had a lot to live up to. What comes out is a decent experience that nonetheless falls short of what it could have been.The plot, for those unaware, revolves around a group of teenagers who are thrown into a last man standing death match at the whims of, and for the entertainment of a totalitarian state. Not the most original plot, however, the execution is what makes it memorable.I want to separate the book from the movie, and when I do, it is a decent effort. But it is the fact that the movie tries so hard to emulate the book that makes it impossible to completely separate the two. A good movie or book makes you feel the plight of the characters, and the book did better at that than the movie. As a film, it lines up some big names: Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Liam Hemsworth, all of whom could have brought a lot more life to their characters than they did.The action scenes were decently done. Environments were rendered beautifully, but combat was mediocre and rather dulled down, probably to get that PG-13. None of it really ends up tugging at you too much.All in all, as a movie, I've seen worse. It is mildly entertaining, but I wouldn't recommend it as any more than a rental. Neither fans nor non-fans of the book will find themselves popping this one in over and over again. It tries to hit every emotional point of the book, and just doesn't end up pressing your buttons hard enough to leave an impression.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

My opinion is strongly influenced by the fact, that I've seen and read Battle Royale. I'll refer to it a lot during this review.I fail to see the point in watching this film ever again, if there's a far better alternative. The Battle Royale book. In BR the story is better written, and the characters are flashed out far better too. The characters' actions seem far more realistic, with real motives, and ""real"" lives outside the games. In Hunger Games most characters are like cardboard cut-outs with no real motives other than, for example, ""I'll be the bad guy, because the story wants me to be"".
Of course this is because in BR (the book) we get to see most of the characters in their day to day lives, and get at least one chapter with them, whereas in the Hunger Games (the film, although if I remember correctly in the book too) we almost always see the story from just the Katniss's point of view. This, at least for me, is a problem.If you want pure enjoyment out of a film, you'll probably like Hunger Games, but because I want to get to know the characters in a greater detail, than just their names, I'd much rather spend a week reading the BR book, than sitting through 2 hours of this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most of the hype was surrounded because its an adaptation from one of the franchise of the novel which were equally successful, and was not a big surprise when it became a big money earner at the Box Office.The story takes place in the future in a place called Panem which is divided into 12 districts. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The first half of the movie is about surroundings and the preparation of the event. The second half deals with the real game and the action. Often compared (wrongly) with the Japanese action movie 'Battle Royale', which is a far superior movie, both are different. The script seems rushed where it has to be clear, and slow where it had to be really fast. Also the direction seemed a bit bad. Acting wise the movie revolves around Katniss, wonderfully played by Jennifer Lawrence. She is one good reason to watch this movie. Although its not her best performance, we can see her amazing screen presence in almost every frame that she is in. The rest of the cast just does what they are required to do. Cinematography and editing is just fine. And the make-up in this movie is really wonderful, one can hardly recognize Elizabeth Banks. I know most of you would not agree with me but the movie is just watchable.

It is basically movie for kids dressed as a thriller. It is definitely not recommended for anyone ho seeks real thriller or really powerful movie. But again: If you are twelve it might be fine for you. The leading actress is pretty so you may be happy just to observe her in various dresses and enjoy when she runs around the woods.

Attempting to do too much in too little time. What we have here is a really long and disjointed movie that, in reality should have been set-up like a real trilogy in several offerings rather than what has been created.I attempt to be diplomatic here because I truly believe that the books are masterful and has been cheapened by the product we see before us now. I suspect, but have no proof, that the author believed that she would make a quick buck by selling the rights to the books and then envisioned the 'professionals' would take it from there. The Good: Casting in the form of Harrelson, Banks and Tucci, as all were masterful in their portrayals with what they were given for the script. I really like Harrelson, even if I always will think of him as Woody from Cheers. I do feel that he was not all that convincing compared to the character in the book. Banks, as in Jack's wife in 30-Rock was very Helen Bonham Carter- ish in her portrayal of Effie Trinket. Tucci.... this man would shine in anything that is given to him. The Bad: The VERY disjointed story. Unless you're under 16-years of age or have little concept of truly feeling the character, this story is an act in futility. There is little to no back story for the characters, leaving this reviewer to not care if all or any of them got killed off. At one point, I was hoping they would ""just die already"" so I could leave. As I was not connected to the characters, I focused more on the plot holes and inconsistency with the book and then thinking ""Why did they cast (blank) in that role?"" I've seen Hutcherson in quite a few roles when he was younger, all I have to say is that he must have a VERY good agent, and I hope that guy/gal gets paid allot! He was mis-cast for this role, but I suspect that was for the pre-teen girl audience with little consideration for anyone else. Lawerence is most likely a very good actress, but comes off as un-likable, pushy and ignorant in this part, instead of simply an intelligent and strong-willed young woman. Finally, I agree with many reviewers that there were two other flaws here.... The shaky camera syndrome did not make it feel 'more real' to me and the choice to ""attempt"" to draw the viewer in with the muted portions and ear ringing in various scenes. Eventually, this was just a distraction/annoyance and I left the movie with a headache.Ultimately, this is a good movie for the pre-teen set who will make it a financial success because they are taking their parents money and going in a horde of screaming pre-teen glory. There is little else to like as far as substance, but unfortunately we will be subject to a sequel because this one was a financial success, if not a story line failure.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nevertheless, the storyline is an ugly one: in a dystopian future America, 24 under age children (12-18) are forced to fight to the death in order to expiate the guilt of their forebears for rebelling against the powers that be. In other words, child sacrifice. Self-evidently this is a challenging and shocking concept and one which clearly sent the studio attorneys into a panic, which is why the actors playing the 'children' are all adults - and obviously so. This is probably the only way the film could have been made at all, but it immediately undermines the credibility of the film. Even worse is the presentation of the characters, especially the participants in the Hunger Games, who are all stereotypically bad or good, with only one or two displaying the real fragility and fear that children would have in such a situation.. The attempts at portraying a futuristic society, especially in the capitol of Pandemia, are risible, mainly consisting of weird hairstyles and hair colours and whacky facial hair designs. Stanley Tucci with purple hair in a bun is one of the best things in the film. The first half of the film is dull and the second half, featuring the Games themselves, utterly predictable and largely unexciting as a result. You can write the script as you go along because it is that obvious, both with regard to the way characters behave and the way the Games pan out. As for the ending, sentimental tripe. One reviewer describes this as ""a brutal, sometimes jaw dropping but emotional experience."" The evisceration of a shocking concept is brutal; the dull predictability of the film is jaw dropping; and as for emotional experience, weeping with frustration is the nearest one would get. Jennifer Lawrence is worth watching, as is the ever great Stanley Tucci. As for the rest, this is the perfect example of how Hollywood takes a potentially challenging and shocking idea and pedals backwards to turn into a bland, by-the-numbers production in which every event is forseeable and the shock element is removed. Imagine Dr Lecter telling Clarice Starling that he ate a census taker's ""nut roast with fava beans and nice Chianti,"" and you get the picture.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I like action films but this was disturbing to me, My wife and I don't have any children but we were shocked at the whole concept of the movie. First of all, it had nothing to do with hunger - it had to do with forced teenage killing. 2nd there was no purpose or point to the killings, 3rd there was no positive conclusion and no one was held accountable. The movie ended with the protagonist winning but the killings continued as the whole Hunger games TV show continued. To what level have we, as humans, not animals, have stooped to? Where we find teenagers killing each other for survival as a good film? Are we getting that desensitized to violence?Yes, there was not too much gory visible violence but the implied violence was definitely there.We ban pitbulls fights and cockfights but consider acceptable watching a movie about teenagers fighting in a forced manipulated ring for survival, not by their intelligence or ingenuity but by their ability to force them to use weapons and kill others?Heres an idea, why not bring back bull fighting, yeah, lets allow that, its entertaining to see an animal slowly die. Better yet, how about bringing back the Roman Coliseum shows that were fought to the death. We could call it Extreme fighting, not ultimate fighting - hows that? We pay to watch this crab on TV, why not real life. I'm sure we could find a moral lesson or a warm fussy message in there somewhere.This movie does nothing much more than teach teenagers that the only way to solve problems is thru violence.Show should of been called ""Forced teenage slaughter"" show.Next time, we will ensure we read the reviews here at IMDb to make a more informed choice about what we watch, we though it would get better and there was a light at the end of this terrible tunnel.If we knew more about it, we would of never watched it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Instead, what we get is mostly just the first third of the book expanded into an emoes-at-hogwarts film that is not entirely bad in its presentation inna TV-movie sort of way, but not what I would go to see this in the theaters for. The last tow thirds of Battle Royale's elements and characters are entirely left out, possibly for a sequel film but who knows, leaving us with a dumbed-down adaptation designed mostly to get people in the theater seats to watch it. The 2000 Toei version was much better at handling the entire story, compressed as it was for the amount of screen time the studio could afford to show it in. Let's hope and pray that this film succeeds at least enough to warrant a sequel where the rest of the Battle Royale saga gets properly introduced and we get to see stuff going down as in the original books.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It leaves you with a jolt of shock that you get after watching a good movie.I would suggest this to 14 and older for violence, thematic elements, and frightening scenes. I wouldn't suggest having a family movie night with this, as it faces some disturbing topics and scenes. However, adults and mature teens will fully grasp the message the author is trying to relay to the audience. We enjoy violence, and laugh at it in movies and TV shows. And yet this movie tries to put violence in a darker more serious light, and does so very, very well.Performance wise, the acting is superb as well as VFX, however they must of run out of tripods, they should get some so that the poor camera man doesn't have to hold the camera the whole time...:)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I will give some credit for the originality but that's it the rest of the content is very amateurish even if this was done in Hollywood. I was looking forward to watch Jennifer Lawrence,s acting skills but I was not impress, there is so many good actresses out there but Jennifer is not part of that group. All the talent and money was spent on the marketing of the movie so they could create another sensation like the Twilight series. The problem is that it worked, they made a lot of money creating a movie lacking in all aspects of film making. Hollywood is first and foremost an industry, it needs to make money to exist and right now what seems to be a good bet is to make movies that will attract teenagers who are interested in violence and actors with good looks. So what if they can't act.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This an over-hyped Hollywood propaganda movie. First of all it is a lame, weak and childish remake of a Great film Battle Royale, no matter how anyone spins it! Second the intro and beginning were weak, the middle was so lame, cheesy and kiddy i was laughing in my seat. The end was so dreadful and poor it left the whole audience empty. They Hype this film had BEFORE it opened was specific and precise. It is an attempt to de sensitize slow, easily mind controlled young adults 10-20 yrs old. It is getting them ready for the war and killing to come to the states. Third, the lead character Katniss is so dumb witted and makes so many Gross errors in the movie (11) i counted that she would have been killed 7-8 out of those 11 times, so unrealistic and dumb dumb dumb, but hey if you didn't see that and liked this film, your brainwashed and probably liked the trash film twilight. Go back to sleep sheep zzzzz. Please don't buy into the hype, the gay overtones of the future males and the projected woman that saves the world is so in your face its sickening. Its poor at best. if you want a good film like this watch Battle Royale Shinobi Naked Weapon Ellection (johhny To)This film is a footnote in 1 year junk","9 out of 27 found this helpful.

But not as good as I thought this movie would be with the hype.I was skeptical because I felt originality was amiss and I don't want to watch a group of teens thrown in a melting pot with gore action. Which I heard Battle Royale was like. If this movie taught me anything is that authors like to throw in a Teenage-Romance in the midst of fighting for love to increase sales on books and movie adaptations. I went to watch this movie with an open mind an hr later it felt like watching the grammys with talk show hosts and fashion statements, another hour later footage of romance themes and cutshots/glimpses of action. Lots of plot holes, weak character development and weak story to begin with and to end with. Worse it's a trilogy it felt like Twilight.What's weird was that the contestants didn't look hungry in the movie like they were starving for food in order to survive or cannibalize. It doesn't fit the description of the movie. I would recommend not to watch this movie, if anything it deterred me from reading any of the books if there all going to be the same.","8 out of 24 found this helpful.

Wes Bently's performance was overshadowed by his own beard - that silly looking flame cut was so distracting Much of the context was sacrificed to make room for poorly shot action footage and computer generated images of the fancy 3D displays in the control room. Spending a little less on pointless graphics would have freed up some funds to get some stabilizers for the hand held cameras used for the action shots - maybe then they wouldn't have been so blurry and out of focus. However even in shots where the actors were not moving, the drift made it clear they were using still using hand-held cameras and couldn't keep them still.

Perhaps I'm too old, seeing as the film was obviously aimed at little kids, although I didn't get this from the publicity.I haven't read the books but the story on film is a poor re-hash of 'Battle Royale' with elements from 'Lord of the Flies' and a huge steal from Stephen King's (Bachman's) 'The Long Walk', with a bit of the flavour of the movie version of King's 'Running Man' as well - derivative hogwash. I think I could even see themes lifted direct from 'Rollerball'. Certainly 'The Long Walk' explores exactly the same themes as Hunger Games but achieves them far better. Probably wouldn't have been an exciting film though, seeing as the youths merely have to walk at a set speed until only one is left. The acting and direction were poor. The special effects were feeble. The storyline was predictable and obvious. Character development was so poor you cared nothing for the life or death of any of the characters, including the heroine and the little girl. The love story was emotionless and unbelievable. The fight scenes were flat and unexciting. The bad guys and the 'grown-ups' were cartoonish and one-dimensional. Poverty and desperation in the 'village' was conveyed by giving everybody 1940's clothes and haircuts, for some reason I haven't worked out yet - except for the heroine who, although poor and starving, seemed to put on a very expensive designer Italian leather jacket to go out hunting. All very bizarre.It has obviously given rise to 'The 100', which has a similar feel of a derivative teen-angst story taken from far better 'dystopian future' novels and is another failed project of poor quality in writing and acting","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Each year, a boy and a girl from each district are picked at random to fight in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death spanning days. And in this film, that's really all that matters. Instead of giving this film a heavy political theme, it backs out and presents itself as an action/adventure type film. By all means, that's okay if you want to build a large teenage audience demanding some sort of action, where no thinking is involved, but the action sequences themselves are what this film relies on, and is ultimately let down.At the start of this film, you'll take a guess that this director loves close-ups, and you'll be right. You better like them, cause the director persists in using them the whole way through the film. As a result the action scenes that this film seems to rely on turn out to be horrible. We are given nearly no vision and it ends up stressful for the eyes.Taking away the supposed action scenes we are left with minimal character development in the main heroine Katniss, boring dialog and a minimal plot.What really bothers me is that there are already sequels lined up, ready to gross millions, luring in loyal fan bases for 2 hours of low-par filmmaking. Novel adaptations like The Hunger Games are filmmaking at it's lowest, requiring little to no effort, and shameless sequels, as if the millions this film made isn't enough.Perhaps the novels are better, at least with books, there can't be a shaky camera with extreme close-ups every second.Appalling novel adaption. 2/10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This series is to killing fellow youngsters as the Twilight series is to vampires and werewolves - and we still have another episode in that blood bath to go.Suzanne Collins wrote the book and contributed to the screenplay along with Billy Ray and director Gary Ross so the result must be satisfactory to those addicted to the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES. According to the brief synopsis (for those who have yet to submit to this 2 ½ hours of mayhem, the story goes something like this: In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives.'The story inserts phrases like 'Hope, it is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is fine, as long as it's contained' and 'They just want a good show' in order to make excuses for the wild concept of the movie. The cast includes Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson (probably the best performance in the film, sleazy though his character is), Elizabeth Banks (her makeup and costumes are more ridiculous than any of her confrères), Lenny Kravitz (the most sensitive of the crew), and hunks Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson in addition to a cast of thousands. They do with the script what they can.Perhaps it Is the popularity of the mayhem of the current video games or perhaps it is facing the mess we adults have created of this globe, but it is worrisome that themes of films such as this (and the sequels to come) attract such a positive response form the young adults for whom the book was written and the movie was made. It is almost like we have sunk to the level of the gladiator games of ancient Rome or the cockfights still popular in the little towns of the Americas. Knowing that those who follow reviews of this film will shred it, this viewer has to rely on the oft-repeated phrase form the film, 'May the odds be ever in your favor.'

This probably alters my perspective on this film as I just can't help myself but compare the two films. Just a heads up. Firstly, I feel as if this film is too slowly paced and is dragged a bit too long, what makes it worse is that in these two and a half hours there is very little character development so when a child dies within the film it isn't very emotionally impacting and both aspects are better handled in Battle Royale as many of the characters in it are sharply introduced and just as sharply cut off and the shock and horror within their introduction and demise make it all the more impacting. However, the performances in The Hunger games are rather strong. Josh Hutcherson does a very good job as Peeta but is overshadowed a bit by the wonderful performance by Jennifer Lawrence. She manages to display a large variety of emotions with such ease and accuracy that it makes the film fill out some of it's potential but only a little. Nevertheless the performances by some of the supporting cast members are rather weak. The careers are prime examples...to me they seemed to overact their malevolent side and made it less emotionally impacting which was a major purpose of the film. After all they're children killing other children they're meant to represent innocence. Yet all they represented were heartless killers from a typical slasher film. Once again I think the performances in Battle Royale were far better than in this. Not only are the main cast amazing but so are the supporting cast. I can't think of a major character in that film who wasn't convincing at all. The fight scenes. For me it didn't work. Why they used a jumpy camera all the over the place was beyond me. We weren't seeing from anyone's perspective, they made that clear. It also didn't make sense, one second Katniss is on her feet, a few seconds of the camera trembling horrendously and then she is on the floor and restrained with the viewer being none the wiser on how she got there. When compared to Battle Royale...well the fight scenes in it made it all the more tragic watching adolescents break down with fear and paranoia before your eyes make the horror in it stand out even more. One thing I did like in this films were the visuals. The budget on that truly paid off. So in conclusion, if you have the choice between Battle Royale and the hinger games, then choose Battle Royale, it is a very well made movie with plenty of positives which scold into your mind for a very long time. This just had far too much wasted potential.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is very frustrating that I got worked up much more by how poor the transition from book to movie actually went, instead of being shocked by the hunger games visuals. Without spoiling any plot line: The shown district is a very poor district. Their only export is coal, there is usually only enough food that people tend to gamble anything including their life just to get a chance for few bits of extra food. Hunting game is prohibited as well as most lines of work which are not in the mine. They are not allowed to leave the town unless the officials grant that permission. The mine ""gently"" covers parts of the town with coal dust, so why do the people living there have clean clothes virtually all the time? Where is the emotional landscape that leads to the point that there is even a need to change?I know the author copied a lot from the Roman empire (bread and games) and Battle Royale, and at least the first book looked promising. If they continue to produce a second and third movie, it will be either adult only, or the very same sunny day, minor complains - so let's start something really dangerous just because well, eh what exact motivation do they actually believe to have?I'm sorry for the actors, if you actually see how little help they had from the setup, you can certainly agree that some have even accomplished something. But they will utterly fail, if they try to convert book 3 (my least favorite, because here the author actually did not copy much, but instead choose to finish it herself and at least in my point of view, she didn't even know how some of her key characters actually think) There will be too much they have to fix to actually have a decent end to the series, not a totally senseless [***].I strongly advice that the crew should not only read all 3 books (hopefully) again, but also that they at least try to get a feeling for the setting by for example watching similar works (the original Rollerball, Battle Royal) and actually learn something about the controversy motivations behind all leads. And then try again on the first part, especially because it is the best part of the trilogy.And for the audience I would suggest to wait, until they have done their homework. Beside some fresh actors it has so little value that you would think of the motivation from the crew as: Girl needs a reason to fight ""beautifully"", so give her some and don't bother with authenticity or reasoning. It did work for Rambo as well, so why not try it again...","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I consider myself quite the movie critic and to be honest, it takes quite a lot to impress me these days.I can understand that the books series is a fan favorite and that 50% of the positive reviews on this site will be from avid ""fanbois"" who can't see passed the fact that this movie is quite average fan fare at best. I'm assuming the other 50% are from either teeny bop teenagers who don't know any better or adults that probably don't have triple digit IQ's.So I went into the midnight screening, blank slate, hoping to be wowed. I'll start by saying this - The first 1/3 - 1/2 of the movie, actually had me hooked for a little bit. Not knowing the background story of the world, I initially found myself craving more information about the plight of the people of district 12. Then after looking at the well rounded figured of the actress that plays Katniss.. I found myself thinking ""Hang on.. She doesn't look hungry at all..""...The movie for me went downhill after the actual games start. This isn't because the movie shows not one drop of blood spilled or a death scene.. It was just because it was done so poorly. Shaky camera angles a good action scene do not make. I hate to point out the obvious comparison between this movie and Battle Royale, but come on... It's pretty much the exact same concept, except this is like the poor under aged mans Battle Royale.There is literally no character development for any of the other tributes apart from Peeta and Katniss, and their love story seems forced and awkward. Are we supposed to like Peeta? He just comes off as a hopeless whining ****.Oh well.. Nothing I can say can change the fact that you've probably seen/or will see this movie. Here's hoping for the sequel they actually capture some of this magic these ""best selling"" books are supposed to have.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has all the elements you could ask for; Forbidden Love, oppression, government propaganda, social politics, raw emotion. It's a real coming of age tale oh yeah, and ritualistic brutal sport killing for a sloth of commercial onlookers cheering on the adolescent violence.The story is basically this; the social order intimidates the masses by requiring they submit a young boy and girl to compete in the annual ""hunger games"" to project fear and power over the lower classes. Interestingly, this film only covers the first book and so the injustices are still very real at the end of this movie.A strange characteristic of this movie is how deep and intense each characters emotions are. They have such strong feelings for one another even though they are all aware they will have to kill one another in the end. But the movie is done well and the audience is drawn in and can't help but caring for each character even thought their all destined to die.Check out my full blog post at - http://off2themovies.blogspot.com/2012/03/hunger-games.html","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

While the brutality didn't warrant an R rating, it was over the top ... and children as young as six were watching the film at the time. It was frustrating that there was so little back story that it was really nothing more than a story about kids beating the snot (and the life) out of each other. But what really bothered me is that the movie is SLOW. Really, really, slow. So slow that my discontent with the violence against children was almost irrelevant. My wife agrees that the movie is slow, and my wife and mother both assure me that Twilight was worse, much worse, but it's hard to believe. Stan Tucci was good. Woody Harrelson was better. The children were OK, but it was hard to tell because the characters were so shallow! And the writing was predictable. When the ""scores"" for Peter and Katniss were announced, I turned before hand and told my wife what they'd be. I had a perfect score.Like Twilight, fans of the book will freak out and love this show.

However, anyone who has read the trilogy knows that the movie did not even address the theme that made the trilogy so outstanding. The trilogy is primarily a character study of at least four of the trilogy's characters: Peeta, Gale, Haymitch and most importantly Katniss. Katniss is a girl who seems to stand for honorable ideas, but who finds insult and deceit in almost everything anyone tells her; especially Peeta. She finds comfort in his arms when she is fearful, but then refuses to admit to anyone, including herself, that she has any need for such care. Rather than being the hero, she is more the anti-hero of the story.In the movie, she is brave and bold and smart. In the original she is bold, but not really so brave and certainly not smart. She operates entirely on emotion, saying and doing things without paying the slightest attention to logic. Time and again she is convinced that everything bad that has happened was caused by her. In this view she is only somewhat wrong. But after all of her agonizing and vows of repentance, she continues to do the same self-serving and illogical things that lead to more suffering of herself and others. In book 2, Haymitch tells Katniss, ""See, this is why no one lets you make the plans."" Later, she recalls Haymitch's statement and says,""That's true, no one in their right mind would let me make the plans. Because I can't tell a friend from an enemy."" Here, she is exactly correct, but that does not prevent her from making that mistake time and again with her most loyal friend, Peeta.Nonetheless, Katniss is a very appealing character, and that is what kept me going for three volumes. I got a feeling about Katniss very much like the feeling I had for Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone With The Wind.""This, not her skill with the bow, is what makes ""The Hunger Games"" a great story.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

(He obviously never heard of North Korea.) He says that by giving the people a hero, they will be inspired to hang on and not overthrow the power structure. That may work if you're offering distractions, but the Games are an instrument of terror. It's not the Olympics. The kids who are selected are supposed to be proud to fight to the death, and we're supposed to believe that the viewers would cheer children slaughtering each other. It's a preposterous tale told PON...DER...OUS...LY!!! Essentially, the movie crosses the stories of ""Rollerball"" and the Minotaur. ""Rollerball"" was a violent game which allowed viewers to vicariously release their aggression and to give them heroes. King Minos fed tributes to the Minotaur as a means of terror. You can't have both. You can't pretend that feeding people to the Minotaur is the Olympics. The movie's premise is completely illogical, and all of those good performances were wasted.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think not. I understand movies are fun and adventurous, but they are also harrowing, emotional and riveting. What Hunger Games was supposed to be in the book, was not on the screen. The novel, also written for teens and an audience with a certain limited vocabulary, fell victim to plain and tasteless, everything. So was the Hunger Games doomed from the start? The idea, though used before, had a its own twist of use. The Hunger Games is set in the near future in the Americas, now divided into poverty stricken nations where the right hand and flamboyant aristocrats of the Citedel nation act like baying Roman crowds and demand a yearly penance for the other nations uprising. The penance? Each nation selects 2 representatives in a cruel lottery of bloodsport, called The Reaping. The 'lucky' selectees are transported to the Citedal to represent their districts to fight each other to the death where one may only win. Pretty cool idea but with poor penmanship and even worse directing the idea and the emotional drive was sapped of the film. We are offered completely useless scenes that could have only been supported by other plots and focus but were removed, forcing the film to its knees. Roo's death was useless and lacking complete emotion. The whole idea of starving, seething districts was made redundant with no screen time and the bittersweet romance between Katniss and Peta was superficial and cosmetic. I give The Hunger Games a 3/10 as it was faithless to the novel and as a film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The cuts, pans, hand shake, depth of views changes... it all seems like a kid that got a new camera and wanted to try out every new feature and put them into his first film. It got to the point where I was just waiting and hoping for a 30 second time period with the camera holding still so I could recover. And I do not get motion sick anywhere... Terrible editing and directing.It felt like 1/2 the shots in the first 30 minutes were focused so close on their face that you could only see from the eyebrow to the mouth... with a shaky camera and constant cuts and pans. Watch this movie to see what happens when you try to get 30 angles of every scene and then piece them all together.Honestly, as you watch it count the seconds of continuous film until a new shot. I did this at the first of the film for about 5 minutes and on average it was about 5 seconds.

THey kinda did but they kinda didn't. Here are the things that I think were wrong with the movie:1. The parts that were very stretched out and long in the books, didn't even seem that important in the movie. Like the cave part or the rue thing.2. THe character relations were way different from the book and weren't developed enough. Like, the relation ship between Katiness and Cinna. Cinna only had like 5 lines in the movie but in the book they were very close. Her relationship with Gale and rue had the same problems to. 3. The ending. The ending in the book was very long and brutal in the book, Peeta was very injured, and Katiness and Peeta are very sad and mad at each other. But the ending in the movie was very short, nobody is badly hurt, and Katiness and Peeta are all smiles like nothings wrong.4. JUST TO SHORT THe thing that was good in it was the scenery and how the set was designed, it matched the book very well. The actors were pretty good,. Again. overall, just okay.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I understand that a movie has to be different from the book, due to cinematic reasons, but not this much. Too predictable, lack of any tension, no character development, disjointed scenes, horrible acting from the rest of the cast (except Donald Sutherland - he's always good), repulsive cinematography and most of all, a failure to create any bond between the audience & the protagonists. Basically, it was exactly opposite of what the book was.One other thing that is increasingly appalling nowadays, is that most mediocre adaptations of books are doing great business at the box-office, or is just the hype good books bring that is responsible for this (and I do not consider the 'Twilight Franchise' as good literature). Whatever it is, the general audience should at least be prudent and skeptical enough before queuing up for the even more lackluster sequels to the subsequent books.We should comprehend that something is alarmingly wrong with the movie studios, when comic book characters are given superlative visual treatment (not that I'm complaining, I simply adore some superheroes & have grown up reading them), while great novels are dealt with mediocre standards with only well directed marketing and publicity gimmicks, to milk enough dough from the hype these novels generate.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The main character played by Lawrance was the best part of this movie she was smart cool and all around bad ass she was believable aside from when they tried to make here seem like she cared about her (not really a spoiler) love interest Peeta played by some dude. That brings me to my next point Peeta this is the ""love interest"" in the movie along with the not so love interest/might be a love interest later character Gail. I haven't read the books I suppose I should have said this earlier but it seems in this movie there going for the team Edward/Jacob thing with Peeta and Gail this is lame because there is no competition for one Gail is far more attractive and way cool in my opinion were as Peeta as portrayed in the movie is well lame he doesn't seem cool he never seems strong or funny or anything he seemed like an after thought you don't really care for him or hope he falls in love with her or anything you felt more for some of the side characters that they only showed for a few minutes than you did for him. Lastly the way they made the capitol people look was super again yes lame they all had weird costumes on they could have done so much with this you didn't really hate them or like them or feel anything for them they were just there looking ridiculous. The final thing I will say is this movie should have been R and I'm not one of those people that are like it would have been better if I would have saw some kids heads cut off but the camera work sucked because of this so that they could kinda show you what happened without showing you what happened and they obviously only did it to make more money with a pg 13 rating by the way don't bring any children under the age of 14 I would say unless you want them to see some children kinda get slaughtered............ this is my first review and just my opinion I'm sorry for poor punctuation or what ever I don't really care. the movie wasn't bad it just wasn't all that good either.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

The movie is very good and exciting and will have you on the edge of your seat. The cast is excellent and portray the emotions of the character very well. The camera is shaky at times (for effect) which can be a bit confusing and annoying. The soundtrack is really beautiful but is missing for large parts of the movie - making some parts bland. However, the gripping plot and effects will make you fall in love with this movie! The movie does get a bit gory but not for long and is a lovely romantic tale of sacrificial love. This movie will make you laugh, cry and will have you at the edge of your seat and biting your nails. If you like Harry Potter, Twilight or love the books then this is for you. It is a movie full of action and adventure and is rather realistic for its imaginary plot.

The premise of course has been done before, several times i.e. running man, Logan's run and I think even an episode of star trek dealt with a similar theme. It started out pretty okay though I wish that Katniss' story had not been forced into flashbacks as it would have gave her and Peter a more sympathetic storyline. The movie was cinematically pretty and directed OK. But it got only five stars from me because the Games themselves were boring and the ending was completely unsatisfying. For a movie with such a strong heroine the audience should have been cheering in the end; but there was nothing but silence and a rush to leave the theater. Why? Because we were all stunned by the terrible last half and the completely 'this is all for nothing' ending. Too bad.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

So I was not expecting the film to be quite as sick and twisted as it was. The fact that so many kids have to die in the film is sad and wrong. I cried when I saw one (really REALLY nice) character die. Also, the beginning, when all the kids aged 12-18 are forced to come up to risk their lives in the Hunger Games (although only two from each Province are randomly picked), made me feel very angry with the government and upper class people in the film, who are in charge of the cruel operation of the Hunger Games.I saw it with a group of friends, including my sibling. My sibling told his best friend, who was with us, the basic plot of the film before we watched it. After we had all watched ""The Hunger Games"", my sibling's best friend told said that he had thought his plot synopsis was a joke. He had thought the basic plot, (kids being picked to kill each other) was a joke! This goes to show that even tough kids will be shocked by the premise of this film.So, yes, the film has its moments. Call me cheesy, but I did enjoy the romance scenes, probably because they were some of the few scenes in the film where people show any degree of humanity or feeling. I also thought the acting, the character development, the designs and the costumes were brilliant. But most of the film just turned my stomach as they were so inhumane, barbaric and irritating, because of this.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie suffers several major defaults which in my opinion are not the cause of a mere poor execution but are the result of his propagandistic nature. Why? First: the stereotypes about poverty. Future is poverty, but not ANY poverty: a Great Depression style poverty. The poor in the future wears clothes which resembles those of the 20s, lives in houses like those of the 20s and works in 20s style conditions (and of course woman stops working and go back home while men become once again miners). This is a pure stereotype, developed in all the movies on the great depression and on poverty in general. But I think that it is meant to be the most stereotyped so as to ""speak"" to the most people; to make them fear what could happen in the future (does the city where the protagonist lives remind you of any recent political republican spot?).Second: fault is of the government. The fault of that situation is of the government of the Capitol (Capitol is the Capital/the Capital is Capitol). The current capital of the USA, if I do not mistake, is Washington, were sieges the government. So in Washin... sorry, in the capital, there is a sort of Versailles style degenerated, luxurious and frankly effeminate aristocracy which concentrates the best of all stereotypes on aristocracy formulated since the French Revolution (they are fat, stupid, homosexuals and God know what else) in order to make them the most hateful as possible.Third: very hateful bad-guys. For some sort of reason this people seems to believe that thieving children from the provinces of the empire, like once used to do vampires and monsters, and make them kill each other would help to maintain peace. I do not know who had this idea while writing the plot or if it was the writer of the book, but please! The basic principle of a dictatorship is to maintain social peace, to not stress too much the emotions of the people, and now those guys come and thieve (thieve!) children (children!) and kill them? Honestly, on ""How to cause a popular uprising"" manual this is step n° 1. But again, in my advice the purpose of this film is not to be realistic or even plausible. Its purpose is to instill fear and hate toward the elite who lives in the capital. But not TOO much hate, we don't want to make revolution no?Fourth: very polite heroes. Apart of the fact that 90% of the characters in this movie are pure wasp race and of the only two black who appears, one is gay and the other gets killed quite uselessly, there is not a single real critic of the system. Yes the aristocracy is hateful, but the system does not get put into discussion. At the end of the film everybody is happy and get back to his house, evildoers are dead and the heroes are rewarded, none of them thinks even for a second to send everybody to hell and kill one of the aristocrats or the president; they all accept the system which after all leaves you a narrow possibility of escape. Again and again, this is republican propaganda: the ACTUAL government is a bunch of retarded and cruel homosexuals but you must not criticize the whole system, just the necessary to win next elections.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I saw trailers for it and couldn't see what all the hype was about, so I never gave it a 2nd thought. After now watching it (I saw it on TV purely because there was nothing else on) I STILL can't see what the hype is all about because for me The Hunger Games is a somewhat mediocre - and vastly overrated - Sci-Fi/Action movie that left me feeling unfulfilled and kind of bored.Don't get me wrong...it's a watchable film, but it's definitely not anywhere near the hype it's been given, nor as good. Teens may enjoy it, but in all honesty, anyone over the age of 16 will probably think it's a very average movie.Now, I've not read the books (and have no intention to either) so I don't know how accurate the films are in comparison to the novels, but this is basically a cross between The Running Man and Battle Royale with the look of Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland thrown in that is aimed for the mid-teen crowd. In fact I can just picture a bunch of teen girls ""ooohhh-ing"", ""aahhhhh-ing"", and giggling every time Liam Hemsworth comes on screen, or teen boys wiping drool off their chins as they gawp at Jennifer Lawrence. Makes me glad I don't have kids myself so I'm not forced to watch movies like this.It's usually these reasons why I avoid these types of films...it's all about looks rather than acting ability or story. That and they are generally guff.Anyway, if you're looking for something that is exciting, thrilling, keeps you entertained with an enjoyable story then you'd best avoid this. On the other hand, if you're wanting to watch something because there's nothing else on, or just want to while away a couple of hours then you can do worse than The Hunger Games.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's been said a thousand times before, but this is such a shameless Battle Royal rip off that it's all I could think of as the film proceeded. My take is slightly different though, because I wouldn't have minded if they actually made a half-decent movie. The problem is BR is a modern classic, an American remake would have been the best way to proceed. But they have chosen to give NO credit to BR, pleading ignorance, and made a pile of rubbish. That said, IF you haven't seen BR, or some of the other tournament genre greats such as Running Man, then it is feasible that you would not be irritated by it. Final note. In fairness, Jen Lawrence is an excellent actress and is the only, I repeat ONLY, reason to watch this movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But that's one big thing they changed in the movie is make Katniss a stronger person, which I think was a good move.That's almost the only change they made that was good in my opinion.They took out characters in the movie that aren't the most important, but they do help share more inside to the type of person Katniss is. They are reflections of herself in the book. In the movie, I think she only talks to three people outside of the Hunger Games. So you don't get a lot of depth on Katniss, or her past. The book goes into her past and explains why she is the way she is, the movie spends a few seconds on it really.Also, they don't explain certain things. You are given a brief history lesson about the Hunger Games and then you're thrown a lot of stuff quickly.In the book you are told the significance of the people holding up their middle three fingers, in the movie you have no real idea why they do it.Book explains the significance of why it's hard for Katniss to trust Peeta, her fellow person from her district. Then, the significance of them working together and always being together. This was one of my biggest problems with the movie. The book stresses from the beginning that they must be buddy-buddy even though in the Hunger Games Katniss knows she must kill him eventually. It's a tough thing she goes through that shows her real character at points and really shows her growth as the movie progresses. The movie makes no attempt what so ever to explain or show this. It's just mentioned for a second and that's about it. To me that was one of the most important things in the book.They changed the ending around, a lot too. The ending in the book is very climatic and builds up well. The movie just disregards parts that are important and says they never happen.Like I said, if I never read the book, I probably would of liked this movie more. I wasn't a big fan of the shaky camera during a lot of the beginning scenes but they worked better later on.The movie stands well on its own and it's not bad, nothing amazing. For me it's more frustrating to know what it could of/should of been after reading a great book like the Hunger Games.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It wasn't all that great, in fact it was terrible. The movie never clearly describes to you exactly what is happening, so I found myself quite lost on the story-line, but it seems that there is a main city called Capital City which is surrounded by 12 districts. These districts live in poverty; mining, farming and pretty much doing all the hard labor for the Capital City, which is bathed in luxury, reaping the benefits of the districts resources.Then every year the Capital citizens select two children (between the ages of 12 and 18) from each district and watch them kill each other in an arena, until only one child is left, they call this event The Hunger Games. The reason behind this because the districts had an uprising against the Capital City a number of years ago. Now I'm not one to get my knickers in a knot from a child dying in a movie, but an entire movie of children being murdered? It made the movie awful in my opinion, after all how many people want to watch children killing each other?But let us say that you're okay with that, what is the rest of the movie like? Well for what is obviously intended to be a rather emotional movie, there is very little character development and although I felt sad that a child had died, I felt nothing about the characters death. Though the actors did a great job portraying their emotions, and a good thing too or else the movie would of been completely devoid of emotion.Then there are the action scenes, I don't know if they were good to be honest I couldn't tell what was happening. It seems that when they wanted to shoot an action scene they told the camera man to zoom in as much as possible and then break dance in front of the actors with his/her camera. You can't see what is going on, you just hear screaming and fighting while watching the floor, sky and various body parts rapidly switch and then someone is lying on the floor dead.In general an awful and incomplete story-line, shallow characters, unclear action scenes, but very good acting and some creative costumes. Perhaps this is a movie for those who have read the books, but after watching this, I don't want to read them.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was so disappointed that I actually left the theater mad.Now the actors they chose were decent for the characters, except for Haymitch. At first I thought he would be an awesome choice, but he didn't even play into the character very well.

Structurally there isn't anything wrong with it and all the most critical details are left intact, as they had damn well better be if these people hope to make a trilogy out of this. Being a fan of the series myself and having read all the books, I notice the glaring differences where small or large details have been left out and while I'm not thrilled, it didn't prove to be a deal breaker either. On the whole, I would say that this film is a perfectly adequate adaptation of the novel, not good, not bad, but adequate. It is kinda neat to see some of the elements you read about visualized and I gotta say at least a handful of them are pretty satisfying.On the positive side, I have to say that the casting is pretty good, with Lenny Kravitz being the biggest surprise and in my opinion, a fantastic choice for Cinna. The acting is good. The sets are at least mostly believable and the overall plot of the novel is left largely intact. This is quite an achievement when you consider positively Godawful adaptations of masterful works of literature like Michael Crichton's Timeline, which was thoroughly butchered into some schlock of cinema featuring Paul Walker.On the negative side, people who did not read the books may likely find the film somewhat inaccessible, and need to either read the books or have friends fill them in as they go. While I fully understand the significant challenges of adapting a novel into something that gets squeezed into 2 hours and 20 minutes, this is something that has hurt the movie. Details from the book that helped to flesh out characters or events just aren't there and end up leaving the plot feeling thinner than it really is. Things that were included are over and done with so quickly you barely have time to register them or their significance. And lastly, the soundtrack, or to be more precise the distinct lack of a soundtrack. The entire film feels so muted and while that may be good for conveying the naked despair the general population feels, it really doesn't get the audience into the film.I know it sounds like I've had a lot more bad than good to say about the film, but it really is a decent movie. If you're a fan, you're probably going to see it anyway and its not like anything is going to be spoiled for you in terms of plot twists. If you're not a fan, go ahead and check it out, you could certainly do a lot worse.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That said, she also helped explain some of the vagaries of the plot and characterisations as the movie progressed, making it a quid-pro-quo so far as I was concerned.What I got from my viewing was a sort of near-future version of ""Lord Of The Flies"" crossed with ""Big Brother"" (referencing both the TV reality show and of course Orwell's novel). It is a bit slow to get going, as the characters are introduced to the viewer, then stays in low gear once the young sacrificial lambs are selected for training before some excitement is generated in the ""last man standing"" last hour battle-royal between the combatants. Actually this section reminded me of nothing so much as a classic episode of the original ""Star Trek"" where Captain Kirk is marooned on a strange planet to fight a one-to-one battle with an alien opponent.To be honest, there was a bit more action and drama in James T's adventure than the youngsters' here. Each time a major crisis was averted, a new one would manifest itself, computer-game style, usually created by the games-masters conjuring up new perils at will for the young hero and heroine to fight. The young actors playing the main parts to me didn't seem especially memorable although in a screenplay where they mostly get to run and fall down a lot, perhaps I'm doing them a disservice. There's not really much depth in the portrayals from the older actors too, Woody Harrellson getting to play ""larger-than-life"" as the youngsters' grumpy, soused mentor although of course he's won over to their side quickly and easily enough, while Stanley Tucci gets to ham it up almost as outrageously as he did in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" as a TV show interviewer.I guess it was hard for this movie to fail commercially given the literary following amongst teenagers the source novel has attracted in a similar way to the Harry Potter films. I personally prefer films of this type to be more fantasy and less ferocious, (some of the on-screen violence must have been border-line excessive with the censors) and about 40 or so minutes could easily have been edited down to make a tighter, more coherent and satisfying movie, but I've certainly seen many worse ""teenagers"" -type movies, although unless young Erin is really stuck for company, I'll not be queueing up to see the sequel any time soon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So many details are left out which makes the plot bland, boring and simplistic. Characters don't develop bonds and relationships, it just happens. When a character feels remorse it makes no sense because they haven't developed a relationship, they were just allies for 20 minutes. 
The first thing you see when the movie starts is boring text explaining what the reaping is and why the have the hunger games. So straight away they throw the rule of show don't tell out the window from the top floor. Its just so lazy. And its completely pointless anyway as it is explained again in short film that all the tributes watch. The pacing of this movie is also unbearable. Things just happen one after the other. Even the dialogue is lightening fast a lot of the time. Its hard to keep up with the conversations.
The plot itself is somewhat interesting, but it is completely watered down to the bare minimum in the movie.

Many would interpret such this to mean I wanted more gore and death - but this is not the case. What was lacking from this the most was nudity (not sexuality per se) and a more sophisticated if not blasé attitude regarding life and life's value(including sexuality); the film needed a rawer, more somber tone. 3/10 is an extra-critical vote based on reducing a a pretty-good book to cinematic fluff.The vexing teen angst that does bubble up from time to time in the Hunger Games book is thankfully overshadowed by a raw, pragmatic need for survival and all which that requires. The raw elements of illness and injury, and the sadness which accompanies the loss of loved ones through traumatic experience is refreshing. Ultimately the book is worth the read.Unfortunately, the need for box-office profits sets a stage for adaptations to be razed of their quintessential value until most of what remains is a flimsy, teenage adventure epic. PG-13 might bring in more viewers, but it reduces any adaptation to trite and forgettable.As others have pointed out, the character building is weak. One central character is 'The Arena' itself (the place where the contestants are corralled to kill each other). Like in the book, the Arena contains a wooded forest environment, unlike in the book - the movie Arena is devoid of a grassland, devoid of rocky slopes (where our protagonists' cave should have been), devoid of sloping ravines where creeks should flow and supply fish (and are later completed drained and dried by the Arena's controllers) and devoid of an ever-changing climate (hot and freezing) which lends to our protagonists suffering/starving more easily in the book. Because the film producers chose to make the forest ubiquitous in the Arena and the forest temperate (not even a drop of rain - let alone torrential) our heroine doesn't need a sleeping bag for warmth, and they leave out that book element. The directors also leave out night-vision glasses (?). The severity of injuries and all that intones is also marginalized. In the book, Peeta is dying of an infection and blood poisoning for which ointment and an antibiotic is needed: ergo, the director reduces the severity of the injury, no shot is needed (which Katniss stabs into her partner in the book), instead launching the viewer into the final trial without any delay.Although many movies are far too long, the brevity of this film leads to two-dimensional heroes we feel little connection to. The film feels rushed. Incidentally, while ""The Games"" are supposedly drawn out over a two-week period, I felt as though maybe only 4-5 days had elapsed in the film. If this was a non-adapted screenplay I might have given it a four, but for the disappointment this 'adaptation' brings - I give it a three.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I left disappointed. But it could have been worse.First off, I loved the first book. I couldn't stop reading it until the final page was flipped. So my expectations for this movie were stacked pretty high. But I still think my expectations weren't met. The thing that killed the movie was it's PG-13 rating. The premise of the movie is kids killing other kids. And if there are no guns or bombs involved, then it must be very bloody. But it turns out to be bloodless. The action is destroyed... Wait for it... Through a shaky camera. Really? The inevitable action sequences are kept ""family friendly"" through a possibly drunken camera man. In fact, the shaking goes on through out the movie. Action-wise, it only is kept still when there is danger that doesn't actually kill anyone. Those that are killed, are either killed off screen, or through the sickening shaking of the camera. The action scenes are heavily cut, and seem obsolete to the result of the movie. All that's left to wonder about is the Relationship between Katniss, Rue, and Peeta. The movie is supposed to be a future government forcing kids to kill each other, not a future government forcing kids to make out with each other in caves, all while under the heavy watch of a shaky camera. It shouldn't even be in the Action/Adventure category. But it could have been worse.The acting was great, and the effects were good. The locations were better than I expected them to be (Although, I couldn't fully enjoy all of them, thanks to a certain camera crew.) If the Directing and Camera crew were totally replaced, then the movie would be much better than it actually is.Let's hope Catching Fire will be better. Although the 2nd book wasn't as good as the first, the casting of the new Director, and new actors, could be what is needed to save the trilogy. It would take major improvements, but it could be done. Time will only tell.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't what you people are smoking. This movie felt like it was made-for-TV. Flimsy and unbelievable. Why are the 'districts' so docile when government troops don't even look like they are armed with anything but batons? You are telling me people would live like that for 74 years without rising up? Where is the background story on how Donald Sutherland became the ruling dictator? It also utterly unbelievable there would be so much cooperation amongst the 'tributes' considering it is 'last man standing' competition. Also, why would the capitol allow 'tributes' as young as 12 to compete? Wouldn't that make for pretty lame competition and entertainment if say most of the 'tributes' ending up being kids? Also, how is that so many of these 'tributes' became experts at knife throwing or swordsmanship when they were randomly chosen and only trained for like 3 or 4 days? The fact is, if you randomly picked people from the general population for something like this, there would be very low entertainment value and would probably drag on. Also, Woody Harrelson quotes that 'most tributes die from the elements, not combat'. Hmmm...if I recall correctly, all of them died at the hands of other 'tributes' save for maybe the girl who died eating the poisonous berries. None of them died from starvation, cold or thirst as Woody Harrelson claimed they would. The fact that Woody Harrelson is in this movie made it even more laughable all though he did an OK job. I am thinking the makers of this movie toked up more than a few times with Woody while filming.Those who read the book apparently are not fans of this movie and this movie certainly has not stirred me to go and pick up the book. Cheezy costumes made it feel like Running Man or the Fifth Element.

And, of course, Donald Sutherland looks out of place in this type of movie (PG13). Things that were complicated enough were not transferred into the movie at all, others were truncated to the couple of dashes, and mostly movie has focused on satirical representation of the capital and on action part. Peeta, for example, was just ""plain nice guy,"" while this character in the book is quite interesting. But it would be OK, since movies are in general considered ""entertainment"" that means they are for spending time with pleasure, not for thinking them over. However, pleasure was questionable because this movie hurts. I mean, physically. The worst thing was the work of cameramen and of the director of photography. I felt dizzy from the very first minutes of the movie. Mostly, it looked like the movie was shot by an amateur with a simple video camera bought in the nearest department store. If you try to shoot from hand, this hand must be strong, and nobody has dismissed the rule that the camera should not move randomly without stopping, as if it is hanging from someone's shoulder without switching off (even so called ""intellectual"" low cost movies are shot much better - even when directors want to make an impression of being shot by amateurs). If you hire cheap cameramen who don't know how to shoot, you should at least train them before letting them work on the movie. Montage could correct this a bit, but obviously nobody cared. I wonder how many people got seizures watching this movie? I went out of the theater with red eyes as after visiting swimming pool. Would not recommend for people with migraines, vertigo, seizures, or for those who are prone to motion sickness. I can read in the car, but this time I almost threw up in the cinema theater.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Actually I got the set with the two movies that have been released and yesterday we watched the first one.Well, as far as I am concerned, it is not a turkey, it is rather ""okayish"" but I certainly do not understand all the hype. It is really far from a great movie. But then, I am probably somewhat biased since, as I wrote above, I did not really think this movie was my cup of tea. Anyway, it starts of with a lot of scenes in ""wobblycam"". I have not met any person outside of the movie industry and self-proclaimed so-called ""critics"" that actually likes it when the camera wobbles around, scenes are blurred and you generally get nauseous by watching. Bad start! The backbone of the story is ludicrous to say the least. Part of the world leaves in luxury when the rest is starving. Been there, seen that. Every year a seemingly random selection of kids, not adults but kids, are selected to fight to the death under some silly pretext of ""preserving the peace"". As I said, ludicrous. The entire air of ludicrousness is enforced by the wacky costumes, makeup and hair styles of the people in the capitol. As I science fiction and fantasy fan I could easily live with this but, sadly, the movie made me only mildly interested in following the characters to the end.The acting in general is adequate but nothing special. Having said that it must be difficult to actually make anything out of some of the silly roles in this movie. I for sure would laugh my head off every time I entered a scene with all of those ludicrous (yes I know I have used that word a lot in this review, live with it) costumes. The main characters act like the children, with absolutely no clue what they are doing, that they indeed are. This is of course entirely in line with the story but still, the main character is spending a lot of the time running away and sitting around looking startled, sorry or depressed when the games start. I have to say that, at times, the movie felt a bit boring. I have liked several movies that are very slow but here it simply did not sit right.The games themselves with those dickheads in control and the changing rules, well they were mostly frustrating.This movie, to me, is a movie for a young adult audience. I have not read the books and I can see how this kind of story would work for a YA book.

I haven't read any of these books so I was going into this film as a regular viewer and can't figure out why some people think this was a great film, the best film ever made, best movie ever etc.Huh?We've seen this before, we've seen these themes before and done much better than what was done here. Part of this film reminded me of The Running Man from the 80's, part of it the TV show Survivor.Despite the fact that the film lasted over 2 hours, as a viewer I had no real idea what the reason behind The Hunger Games was. There was very little character development done. There was very little building-up time to make you even vaguely interested in the characters or the main idea. We spend some time in the city before the main event but even that time is wasted. Nothing interesting happens here.The last half of this film was people running around the woods while goofy looking technicians and even dumber looking aristocrat types watched. Clue- it helps if the Evil Guys look Evil and not Stupid. I agree with some other reviews I have seen, this film looked like a Sci-Fi Channel movie. Where did the budget go?Even worse, for a movie about a death sport, the movie was mostly pretty boring. You would get a little action and then back to boring dialog which itself did nothing to even help the plot. If you've read the books you have something vested and a real background in this film already. I get it. You're probably going to like it for reasons other than what was on the screen. For those of us who watched without reading the book, let me tell you > not a good film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

From someone who have not read the books. Relevant: I'm 37, love movies, and consume them en masse.I have avoided this series for years but now a good friend really wanted us to see the series so I took one for the team. Of course I realized the target audience has an average age of about 13,2 years. But not even that notion could save me. I've seen the Harry Potters and the Twilight Sagas and such, and I think I managed to put on a ""teen filter"" and could appreciate those products for what they were. But this. This is something else... What I thought of the characters? Were there characters in this movie? I only saw faces that spoke. I think some of them died. I'm not certain because nothing in this movie evoked any feelings in me except all over-the-top illogical things that made me doubt myself, thinking, ""That was so stupid I must be seeing things! I probably missed something here so I better shut up, because what just happened was so stupid it couldn't have happened"". The only ""character"" I could see on screen was delivered by Stanley Tucci. The Effie character had glimpses of actually being something of a person you could connect anything at all to. I actually think Mr Sutherland performed well (as always) but the movie just pooped on his performance, smothering it completely. The same goes for Mr Harrelson. Mr Kravitz!!?? No comment. Love his music though.The whole art design and atmosphere had some sort of TV- production/documentary touch I couldn't really grasp. I guess I feel like it was presented to me like by a five year old presenting his/her drawings: ""Here is the poor, here is the rich, here is a forest, here is the city, here's a police man, here comes another one"". Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence. She may be a lot of things, but she's NOT on fire in this movie (or the next one). This role is just not coming out right. Maybee it's even so that it's not in her pocket to play this kind of roles...All stupidities that happened... Well I haven't read the book. Maybee it's all explained there. But it's not a pre-requisite to have read the book. There are so many things... But the major ones: It's never really explained how this gory TV-show is to hold a whole nation under control. Yes, they explain it by talking of fear and hope of different degrees and how to manipulate it and maintain control. But they fail to create a feeling of the situation and why this TV-show is needed. What's confusing is when you see the resources the upper class and government have, in the form of superior forces, technology and food and energy. Teaming up in a sole-survivor-kill-em-all competition is a good idea all of a sudden? This isn't some reality TV-show... you kill one and other here... I understand that the ones that doesn't want to murder team up by instinct. But the trained killers - why would they ever want to stay within proximity of the other trained killers??? Dog- monsters (this is actually part of the ""superior resources"" point) that are created out of thin air, becomes solid creatures that can tear humans apart. Isn't this a more efficient way to control the poor labour in the outer districts than some TV-show?Final point is on the subject of how to point with a bow and arrow... I had to Google her technique because I got a funny feeling every time she was aiming at something. Modern bows with all the tech-stuff on them, you hold the way she does. With traditional ones, like the one in THG, you need to have the end of the arrow further up, closer to the eye, because the only thing to aim with is the arrow... Silly detail really. But if you ask me I say it's such a central detail it's mandatory to get right.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This whole concept of making a mortal game has been an exciting idea for me. Yet, it looked like a kid movie, in which all the necessary elements for this kind of a concept were eliminated. To me, it is normal to expect seeing some breath-taking gore and profanity, if the movie is grounded on a death game. Still, the movie was watchable for the plot's sake, nonetheless the camera-work kicked in and ruined the joy. I don't know if they wanted to try out some new style or something but I found it rather annoying. The angle changed so sharply. And the first person takes, which took place quite a few times, almost made me feel dizzy. For instance at the part, where Katniss and the blade girl( i called her that way) were fighting, it was almost impossible to tell who was who. For the next movies to come, I hope the producers will improves these downsides and will not try to hide the gore. I mean it's like selling drugs as M&Ms. The idea is violent yet it was presented like it were cute.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","The box office success does not make ""The Hunger Games"" less disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2596415/?ref_=tt_urv","knowyourmovie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28188278/?ref_=tt_urv","13 April 2012","After I finished watching ""The Hunger Games"", it remained a profound mystery to me how such a mediocre movie could possibly have received so warm welcome from public and critics alike. That was something so surprising, so puzzling, and - let us face it – so annoying, that I decided to use the elimination technique to find out what exactly had made ""The Hunger Games"" so attractive to such a diverse audience.It could not have possibly been the story – poorly written, shallow and strikingly unentertaining. While I have not read the book that served the basis for the movie, I am almost certain that the original story written by Suzanne Collins lost most of its depth, intrigue, and punch in the process of being adapted for the big screen. As Samuel Goldwyn famously said, ""We want a story that starts out with an earthquake and works its way up to a climax."" ""The Hunger Games"" employs the opposite strategy - it starts quite lethargically and ends quite anticlimactically.Specifically, the movie begins with the boring, barely watchable cliché that drags for quite some time until the main characters finally leave the coal-mining District 12 on the train that takes them the Capitol where the 74th Hunger Games take place. The travel on the train and the preparation for the games are a little livelier, mostly because of the excellent diverse set of the vivid supporting characters played by the battle-hardened, experienced acting crew (Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Toby Jones) fittingly joined by Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, and Lenny Kravitz. The games themselves are suspenseful and engaging enough, but also a little dull, far from mind blowing. I am not even talking about such an extravagant luxury as character development: following the regrettable pattern from the preceding parts of the movie, the game scenes fail to demonstrate anything even remotely original or even slightly thought provoking. The ending is almost unprofessionally weak and disappointing, especially taking into account that ""The Hunger Games"" is expected to have sequels. Not only there are no cliffhangers that would keep us wondering and almost no hints that would keep us intrigued, but there is also even no sense of completeness of the piece; the abrupt ending creates an impression of a semi-finished, half-done job. If not the story, what could have possibly made ""The Hunger Games"" so dear to the hearts of the millions of the moviegoers? I doubt that it was special or visual effects, that happened to be mostly basic and unimaginative. If you do not believe me, simply try watching a movie with truly well done special effects (""The Lord of The Rings"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""Inception"", ""Avatar"", or even ""Hugo"") and then compare it with the undistinguished, unoriginal averageness of the effects in ""The Hunger Games"".The directing, only slightly better than average, can easily be eliminated from list of the features that make the movie worth watching. It is not surprising therefore, that Gary Ross would not be directing the sequel of ""The Hunger Games"".The acting on the other hand was mostly solid and convincing, although the poorly written story and dialogues did not leave the actors much room to express their talents. It was almost painful to watch the excellent performance of Jennifer Lawrence wasted on such an unworthy of her talent movie.On the technical side, camera work and editing were quite unimpressive to say the least. Sometimes they were simply horrible. More than on one occasion the incessant wobbling of the camera combined with the frequent image flickering was physically painful to the eyes. At times, the picture on the screen was changing so rapidly that it made some scenes (including the final fight) hard to follow and almost confusing.And yet, what is the secret of the popularity of ""The Hunger Games""?I think that the answer is simple and complicated at the same time. Of course, we should not write off the popularity of the book, the exceptionally well-done trailer, and the skillful and highly effective marketing campaign.The main reason, however, seems to be that the movie tells a basic, convenient, easily digestible story, preying on the unfortunate misconceptions, toxic stereotypes, naïve illusions, and hidden desires that rack the fragile souls of the teenagers, young adults, and even older and supposedly wiser generations of moviegoers. Sadly, instead of stimulating independent thinking, so important for teenagers and young adults, ""The Hunger Games"" readily conforms to their stereotypical expectations and eagerly indulges their primitive fantasies. That is what happens when authors too literally follow the famous (faulty) principle declared long time ago by Samuel Goldwyn: ""Pictures are for entertainment, messages should be delivered by Western Union.""knowyourmovie.blogspot.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Because this is not a sequel or a remake, it's a clone. Far from being terrible and telling as Battle Royale is (within the obvious limits of a film with imperfection and mistakes), Hunger Games turns an interesting politic-fi story into a twilight-like teen-oriented desperate quest for coolness, failing to deliver the real soul of the original idea.Folks, I know despite sometimes stellar budgets, good movies are rare to come by, but you can always watch again some Kurosawa instead of hi- rating 142min commercials like this one just because ""it's still better than found footage lame horror crap, anyway"".There are better options.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't know what else what was positive about the film. I didn't feel any of the tension between tributes that I felt in the book. Everyone seemed pretty well fed from start to finish. No lack of water. No feeling of fear of getting killed, you don't even see the deaths. And no backstory whatsoever. The backstory is the best part, and the best they can do is a predictably evil president.

There were definitely things I enjoyed, why don't we start there? The acting is pretty good across the boards, I think Jennifer Lawrence brought Katniss Everdeen to life really well and Stanley Tucci's game show host and Donald Sutherland's ice-cold President Snow were additional standouts in a pretty solid cast. As an adaptation of the novel, I think the screenplay did a very good job capturing the first-person energy of the novel and broadening it out to a more objective reality-the world-building was compelling and the production design was fantastic.So why don't I really like The Hunger Games that much? This movie is kind of a joyless slog for a good portion of its two-plus hour runtime and the dystopia really hasn't aged well on this side of 2016 or 2020. The action sequences, while admittedly compelling, are few and far between and weighed down considerably from its shaky cam cinematography (I can't imagine how many people seeing this movie in IMAX got sick). While the novel was written for a young adult audience, I think the very nature of these sorts of deadly games-media can only shine with an R rating, as we saw recently in Squid Game.All in all, I don't hate The Hunger Games, but I'm in no hurry to revisit this first installment anytime soon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Anyone who watches the original movie will agree to that. That said, It is important to remark that, in the end, the result of ""Hunger Games"" was not so bad. But it was not good either.. American Motion Industry has been ""copying"" movies for some time ( terror movies, for example ) and many of them are a terrible facsimiles from the original. This time the copy was not so bad. They changed a bit the story ( although the main plot is still there ) and adapted it to the American audience. The result is a teens movie that is possible to watch. Unfortunately, a lot of the emotion and originality from ""Battle Royale"" was lost. I was in a bit of doubt between ranking it 5 or 6.

A shaky hand-held scene does NOT a great movie make.Luckily there were a few cutaway shots that were big-screen worthy. Sometimes looking grainy, and way too many closeups, it needed more polish and grand scope like a Blade Runner. There were a number of times in the film where patrons got up in droves and left because it got too wordy and honest, (usually the emotion-laden portions as most young people like the drama of reality TV but not the deep inside kind that makes you feel human.) I did not read the books, so expected a grand movie experience using those great wide angle lenses.It looked small and crowded. The CGI was the only true sweeping moments and they were fleeting and not enough to make up for the hand held crap.

I had a headache after watching this one and the plot was totally non-practical.The bottom line : Highly predictable action flick aimed utmost for teen-agers.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thus, the director Gary Ross's only true challenge is to just not screw it up. He succeeds. To be fair, Ross does take the extra step to clean up numerous shaky plot points (such as the torture porn death of Kato that mars the end of the book) and devices most especially the first person narrative which limits the development of backstory and B plots (realistically, once Katniss enters the Hunger Game arena all we should have known is her quest for food and water). Ross also does a nice job of peppering the cast with real actors including Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci as well as Jennifer Lawrence herself. Given that the core 12 year female audience lacks any interest in such matters must have represented a temptation to hire cheaper talent. Ross adequately captures the brutal action in the book and smartly drops out before the long, meandering final section. However, the CGI very much comes across like CGI and two often the film feels like a car commercial. The cimenatographic slickness undercuts some of the emotional scenes quickly jumping away before Katniss' emotion can fully land. It blunts the viciousness found in the book without papering over it but still results in a non-recommendation for those younger than fully in the pre-tween ranks. In short, the mediocre King- homage (or ripoff depending on how much of his stuff you've read) makes for a somewhat entertaining book that wears is 2 hour 22 minute running time well.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think the book Mockingjay had just come out, and I heard of some people who were reading and recommending it. Before long, it was the newest big book series on the popularity level of Harry Potter and Twilight, even though at that point I had never heard of the previous two books in the trilogy, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. (Some people close to the books could tell me that the previous books were always popular, but I have no proof.) It seemed undeniable that it would be the next big movie franchise. If it was, I knew I would eventually see it. But when I did would depend on what I knew about it. My awareness of what it was about changed over the course of a year or so. My first bare assumption of its content guessed it was some cheesy love story. But when I picked up a book and read the description on the back, it looked like a potentially intriguing story of a battle to the death on live television within an oppressive nation, which is pretty close to what it really is. Over a little more time, I thought I understood some premise that it's in the sci-fi genre, more so than Harry Potter and Twilight, and that represented the point where I began strongly considering reading the book. Then over a little more time, I started feeling a little pessimism about it. Really, 24 teenagers from throughout Panem, being forced by their government to kill each other on television until one is left? Is that a necessarily sci-fi premise, and would it really be uplifting enough for me to put it in a classic place in my history?Then a month or so before the movie's release, I decided to go to the bookstore, pick up the book, sit down, read the first chapter, and leave the bookstore, considering that I would decide to read the whole book (and see the movie early) if the first chapter was particularly compelling. I considered the book fairly difficult to read, and it took five or ten pages before I could really understand what the first two to four pages were saying. But the book made enough sense by the time I read a couple pages into the second chapter, which was where I decided would be as far as I would get with the book, and I would see the movie in the discount theater. The first chapter is about the characters Katniss, her younger sister Primrose, and her friend Gale, and the second chapter as far as I read introduced Peeta. The story seems to emphasize that it's about Katniss volunteering to replace Primrose as District 12 tribute to the Hunger Games, but that's really only what the first chapter is about. Primrose and Gale have very little to do with the rest of the story. I was able to figure this out even as I stopped at that point in the book and before I watched the movie. I hope (and people who have read all the books could confirm or deny) that the sequels are a little more focused on them.The Hunger Games came to the discount theater when the London Olympics were on TV, which interestingly enough, was a good time to watch it, though it goes without saying that it's nice to live in a world where the Olympics are not the Hunger Games. My impression of the rest of the book seemed pretty close to what I saw on the screen. Somewhat intriguing, but nothing really compelling. Nothing that made me cheer, and the logical lack of applause from the citizens of Panem probably had something to do with that. People I had talked to who had read the book said that there are dramatic interactions between the characters, particularly before the Games begin, and that's basically true. The big picture of the story doesn't really put it all the way into the sci-fi genre, but some little sci-fi elements, including genetically engineered creatures, made the movie a little closer to my kind of thing. There is obviously quite a bit of disturbing violent content, and I was right that it wouldn't be very uplifting.As for the cinematic artwork of the filmmakers, the directing and acting were okay, and the music which I often pay attention to was also okay. It is an action movie, but because the sci-fi elements are somewhat subdued and almost the whole thing could theoretically happen in two hundred years or so, that doesn't really justify it for classic visual effects. The costume design, makeup, and hairstyling were obviously really weird, especially on the government people, and I don't know how much the book suggested that. I guess that justifies it for consideration for Best Costume Design and Best Makeup of the year. Is ""may the odds be ever in your favor"" supposed to be the new ""may the Force be with you""? It's quotable, but I don't think that's really going to work.And my last comment, why is it called ""The Hunger Games""? I can tell that the government tries to lighten up the mood of the competition by calling it a ""game,"" but other than the fact that competitors might sometimes get a little hungry during the games, I don't know where the ""Hunger"" part of the name comes from. If I were writing it, ""The Panem Games"" probably would have been a better title.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Didn't the creators kinda miss this major point or did they plan on only fans watching the movie? I suppose no movie is going to meet up to the expectations of the fans of the book, but this was a pretty big oversight.Filming at the beginning was horrible. It's that shaky type of filming they do in TV police dramas. You know the kind, where you get dizzy and have to look away. I'm not sure what they were thinking, but thankfully they stopped this about 1/3 of the way through. Maybe the shakiness was supposed to represent hunger? The acting was good and what special effects there were turned out nice as well. The quintessential moment of fire was thankfully not a disappointment.I think the problem is that they needed the movie to be 3 hours to really convey more of the book's essence. Still everyone that read the books will have to see this. If you didn't read the books, judging by the people that went with me that didn't, you probably can wait till it comes out on DVD.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So other than an endless series of self contained scenes strung together doing little to move the plot along, it limps every onward, punctuated by brief flashes of the poor miserable people back home. And some kind of vague jealousy back story that's never fleshed out. As a side note I've read that the director was quite proud of his extreme and somewhat random use of shaky cam in order to impress the audience with the 'urgency' of the situation. There is nothing urgent with this movie. If you watch it, feel free to get up at any time and make a snack, go to the bathroom, have a smoke, whatever. You won't miss anything and when you return it will be like you never left.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

That in it self is a decent plot and expected a decent action movie of course with some romance as i was under no delusion that this was a teen movie and have heard about the book from my friends.But what i got was almost like watching Twilight, 2 guys and then the girl and without spoilers we all know what that leads to, also of course the girl is way way better then any guy and proves to be quite the Rambo.All in all its a OK movie for teenager girls but if you are older then 18 and not a girl i cannot recommend this movie to anyone except perhaps to do something sweet for a girl.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Anyway, this story could have been done incomparably better in someone else's hands (say, Wheddon?, Cameron?, Scott? or anybody who knows how to make a story consistent, logical and meaningful).

It does take a while to get going it's true and I'd never read the book and wasn't sure about the premise - pitting 12 - 18 year old against each other to the death. It is a very odd film, like Big Brother with extra-ridiculous tasks. The contrast between the Districts and the Capitol are well done - dowdy one, ridiculously coloured the other. The whole bit of the actual chase is a little less than thrilling, though it does have its moments. They obviously spent a lot of money on it and you can see where. I found the ending a bit obvious. And the bit at the beginning with the heroine and her what you think of as her 'beau' is a bit wasted, because it doesn't really go anywhere. The acting's okay, given what they've been given to work with. It just feels overlong, over-hyped and could have delivered so much more.

You would expect a similar rating for the movie, but unfortunately for Suzuanne Collins, it falls short. The action scenes would be generally good if it weren't for the annoying shaky cam. This is something that cinematographers of today implement too much into action movies, and I like it when it is used in the correct time and not excessively used. In almost all the scenes in this movie, the cameraman can't stay put. As for the acting, it's not really anything special. Jennifer Lawrence does a decent job, Josh Hutcherson does a decent job, Woody Harrelson does a decent job, and pretty much everyone was decent in this movie. Probably the only stand-out performer was Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket. A major problem with this movie is that I think the delivery of the lines from the books were not exactly what I imagined them to feel like. In the end, I think this movie is nothing special at all, and I hope that Catching Fire can fix the errors this movie has made.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And so, on Friday I did. The result was a good movie. Not a great movie; however, because of its loyalty to the book and thus good storyline, it is still a good movie.The story, as I said earlier, is well done, seeing as the author of the books worked closely with the writers for ""The Hunger Games"". When the movie did take liberties with the book, it executed them quite convincingly. Never did any of the added scenes seem unfeasible or uncharacteristic of the book. I thought, ""Yeah, that could've happened."" Although the beginning seemed slightly rushed, the plot regained its pacing and was fine from there on. I particularly enjoyed how effectively the movie reflected the perverted atmosphere of the Hunger Games. Many times amongst all the glamor and flair of the whole production of the Hunger Games event, I forgot that the movie was about teenagers battling to the death. The movie portrayed it almost like it was just Superbowl Sunday.The acting was generally good. None of them necessarily shined, but they all delivered solid performances. The actors were excellently casted; they were perfect for their respective roles.The cinematography technique however, was questionable. The camera shake in ""The Hunger Games"" made the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" look like a movie from the 1920's. I found myself a little irritated with the overwhelming amount of camera shake, especially in for instance just normal shots of people walking. During the fight scenes, the problem was dampened, as it is a fight scene after all. However, I usually spent the time being lost on what exactly is happening the tussle, and at which point I saw a splatter of blood; I suppose that means someone just died.The soundtrack was actually surprisingly good. It had the right feel to it, matching the tones of the scene well.Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" is a good, entertaining movie, but from what I've heard, you should read the books first. This movie is a fan-pleaser; it was very loyal to the books, and added a couple of new scenes that Hunger Games fans will enjoy. ""The Hunger Games"" is a truly exhilarating movie, with some surprisingly intense action sequences, and sometimes, it would have its emotional moment also. My recommendation is to read the books first, and then watch ""The Hunger Games"" for a fun and enjoyable experience.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The dystopian, science-fiction story is set in a post apocalyptic country called Panem. The ruling city 'Capitol' takes 24 children from 12 districts, places them in an arena and forces them kill each other until only one is left alive. These are 'The Hunger Games'. The film never comes close to the book except in its depiction of the poverty in District 12 and the gaudy decadence of the Capitol. It also criticises some aspects of modern society very clearly, such as the distribution of wealth. However the negative aspects of this film are far more numerous, for example you never feel properly connected to any of the characters, so you do not really care who lives and who dies. The director also fails to make the film in the least bit logical. A muscled young man dies instantly when hit by a arrow, but a tiny girl takes ages to die from a massive spear to the chest. The acting isn't great especially Josh Hutcherson, who plays Peeta, as he always comes over as whiny and pathetic. Jennifer Lawrence is adequate as Katniss but fails to make you relate to her. All in all I do not recommend you watch the film. Read the books, they are superior to the film in every way. I rate this film a 3 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the book it describes how the characters look and act which leaves the reader to use there imagination and it had a lot more action in it than the film did. All people do these days is watch a film without reading the book and this film, even though it was good it had missed out on a lot of what was in the book and it wasn't as exciting and it didn't really make you want to watch more whereas the book kept you on edge and made you want to read it till the end. Although i wish the film went with the storyline in the book this film did a pretty good job.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I now can't say I didn't try...
Drab and depressing, I found all four Hunger Games movies missing almost all elements to make it memorable, enjoyable, fun, exciting, clever or 'epic' in any way.
The concept from the get go made very little sense, the fictional world was not very well designed, and the rules of the universe weak and flimsy. 
I liked some of the cast and have been fans of several for years, but each character was hollow with very little true motivation, and the arks of their characters rarely moved beyond their first introduction.
I actually lowered my stars scores after binge watching the series, because it seemed like a waste of time and the only thing it clearly indicated is, on my own personal scale '2 stars' means- ""an ordinary movie that I don't want to and could not be easily convinced to ever watch again..."".

Romance plays a big role into bringing the characters together and a bit of the cgi looked... unfinished to me.

The main problem (outside of the cinematography/direction) is that she's emotionally flat which makes Katniss, who in the book is a complex character (as most main characters are) seem one dimensional. And if your main character is one dimensional, you don't have the facilities for a 2 hr and 20 minute film. Especially a film based off of a book with a lot of plot elements. JLaw does well portraying Katniss in every way, expect when she must convey her emotions for other people. Katniss lacks the intimacy (and the chemistry with both ""love"" interests), which ultimately is why her relationship with Peeta feels forced and the scene with Rue (you deserved so much better) falls totally flat.Josh Hutcherson does a great job at connecting to even the dull Katniss. He's as charming as he can be given the choices the filmmakers made.Likewise, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitiz, and Woody Harrelson add a little flavor and interest to a very drawn out movie.This movie is not good for several reasons. The most impacting is the cinematography style choice. Not sure if it's the type of camera used or the editing, but the film doesn't do a good job at setting the tone or mood. For example, scenes from the districts are shot the same way and with the same overlay (if they even used one) as scenes in the capitol. There's no contrast and no style to it. Also, the writing doesn't help. There's a lot to get through with the book being so complicated and in 2 hours the film feels like it's just checking things off the list. Overall, its monotonous.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, all that buzz surrounding The Hunger Games made me realize that maybe I should watch it just to be up-to-date with the movie news.I've never read the books, and, really, the topic of a 'game, where people hunt each other down in order to see who survives the longest' has been repeated in many pictures over the decades. Survival of the fittest, as one intelligent man once called it.I won't bore you with the synopsis, because it seems actually as simple and trivial as a child's story. The beginning is so simple, yet so tragic, that it is undeniably obvious what must happen through the 142 minutes screening time. After Katniss Everdeen has so bravely protected her little sister from taking part in the murderous, and tremendously unethical, annual Hunger Games the viewer already knows what must happen at the very end.I'm not really mad that the movie was so predictable. It is, after all, a big budget blockbuster, which was geared towards earning horrendous amounts of money even before the real production had started. It wasn't supposed to boost one's intellect.I just can't understand why they had to make such a long movie, with so many unnecessary and boring scenes and promote it as one of the biggest hits in the teen flicks category. I won't deny that it stands out from the crowd of such flops as, oh let's say, the whole Twilight series. But the overall excitement that appeared right with the premiere of The Hunger Games probably left many people totally unsatisfied. I know I was.As for some of the positive aspects, there were a few scenes that made the movie a bit more enjoyable. Even more, if it weren't for the part, which presented the stage of preparation for the Games, it would be a pretty decent action movie with some entertaining fighting sequences. I must also say that the movie is well directed and presents some stunning cinematographic achievements in the sense of visual experience. Jennifer Lawrence did well. She is now on the list of many production studios as the new leading female. Because the lack of actual heroine characters in the last few years made her, and the role which she played, appear as a definition of the thing that Hollywood needs – a strong and independent woman that can support a picture on her own. Josh Hutcherson's character – Peeta - was just a supplement. He wouldn't be able to survive without the help of this brave young girl. Don't expect any blood splattering over the bodies of deceased teenagers or gruesome scenes of murder. This is a PG-13 movie. If you want a real survival picture you would be better off watching Battle Royale, a fantastic Japanese flick that presents a similar concept, but with a 100% more violence and ruthlessness. And it goes straight to the point in just a few minutes.All in all, The Hunger Games happened to be exactly what I expected it to be: a movie focused on a group of teenagers, who are in need of yet another teenage drama with a whole lot of heartfelt romance. Watchable, but definitely not a movie for the ages – 5/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't like the book at all, either. I am not in anyway saying that the Hunger Games was a bad film or novel. I just didn't like them. The movie disturbed me more than any other film I've ever seen (with maybe a few exceptions I'd rather forget). Yeah, I know it was supposed to be like that, convey the message that teenagers aren't supposed to kill each other, corrupt government, tone of the film, and blah blah blah blah blah. I just didn't like to see the slaughtering of kids portrayed in such a way. I was also very annoyed at how much people freaked out over how amazing the books were and all of these girls treating it like some sort of dramatic soap opera that just came on TV. I also hate how people now ask questions like ""what would you do if you were forced to do this"" or ""what if the country ended up like this"", because I'd rather not think about it. Also, I think that all of the die-hard fan-girls and fan-boys of this story had totally annihilated the true message and reason of this book and film. Kids ust focus on the love triangle and Peeta Vs. Gale or how awesome that katniss is a girl protagonist, rather than even give a second thought to why it was written. Not that I know the author's purpose, but i know it was not written to be some stupid soap opera.Despite how much i hated the idea of the film, how it was made was outstanding. Thea acting was amazing (with the exception of Josh Hutcherson, who did not do so well as Peeta), the camera work was great, the CGI and special effects were great and nobody needs to ask about the makeup (how it was not eligible for the Oscar for best Makeup, I don't know). Summing it all up: I did not like the idea of the film but it was outstandingly filmed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Here I will spoil about as much as you see in the trailer and some unimportant trivia. If this offends you stop reading now.The book/plot starts with a fantastic setting of an post-apocalyptic world where the super high-tech capitol and surrounding colonies. It also contains a number of silly concepts - like a super high-tech capitol that can easily gather 100 000 people on a sporting event but still, for some reason, needs impoverished colonies of about 8000 people. Pretty much all of the characters (except for Katniss) are flat and easily summed up with one or two words. The story itself is as straight as a highway with pretty much nothing really surprising the reader. It's not hard to imagine what you average movie adaptation does with a start like this.And it does exactly that. The characters are dumbed down your average Hollywood norm, and the plot is even more straightforward, since the only interesting parts (like Katniss' view on things) are lost.The rest of the movie stuff: The acting was decent, the visual effects were OK, sound effects too. I was hoping for a decent song or two, but didn't get anything. The screenplay was using some plot devices only when it suited it and forgot about it after a while. Nothing else really left a lasting impression.To sum up, this was pretty much the most mediocre film i've seen in a long time. Nothing was *bad* like The-Last-Airbender-bad, but nothing was good either. So if you're in for some brainless entertainment involving teenager killing each other or a fan of the book - go for it. If not, you're not missing much.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My first choice ended up being ""The Hunger Games"". In ""The Hunger Games"" we are shown a vision of the dystopian future of a country in which the members of the ruling government and their elite affiliates are the only ones with any substantial financial wealth. Meanwhile, the rest of the country is broken down into 12 districts in which those populations live in sheer poverty. The ruling class then, have a yearly tradition of taking a young male & a young female(both under 18) from each district and making a game show which consists of the 24 contestants killing off each other or dying in one form or another until there is only one contestant left. This ""game""(reality show) takes place in a forest region with limited resources. There are quite a few things that make this movie a very disheartening experience. First of all, the premise of children between 13 & 18 years of age, being put into a wilderness environment to kill one another for the entertainment of a ruling government/class is NOT the kind of movie which should be marketed to children of that same age group. I wonder, what was on the mind of the Director and Producers of this movie. Are they trying to desensitize the younger generation into considering the killing of other members of their age group to be something which can be considered sane once it is government sanctioned? This movie closely resembles a familiar scene in which teenagers from all over America are trained after joining the military & then deploy to foreign countries to kill other people. This movie did not deserve a PG-13 rating. If this were to be released in the 80's or 90's, this would NOT have gotten a PG-13 rating, so why should it have such a rating now. Anyhow, visually things were good. There were quite a few special effects and futuristic pieces of equipment which placed the movie as being sometime in the near future. Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" has its fair share of action and emotions throughout the movie for people who are fans of those things, however, otherwise the premise of the script seems void of any true depth and compassion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To me, the movie just didn't have that same feel. For one thing, it kinda felt too rushed to me (seeing as the book was a whopping 384 pages, not a short book by any means) and to me the movie just wasn't able to convey all the same emotions experienced while reading it. Having said that, I do think that they did a good job of portraying Gale, Prim, and some other key characters accurately. I do kind of wish though that a little more was put into Thresh and Rue (though they did do a fair job with her) and I would agree that it was kinda violent, though it was only semi-realistic for the most part (for obvious reasons of course). Over all though, I would say it was a fair movie, though I much prefer movies like The Chronicles of Narnia, the Lord of the Rings, and Pirates of the Caribbean.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When I heard about the movies I was hoping for something good, something that would come close to doing justice to the story. Sadly, my gut instinct was correct. Wooden acting, no depth to any character, no depth to the ""game"" left me feeling - aside from bored - as if I couldn't care less who died. Even the sweet little girl tribute was left .. empty.I wonder why people say this is so much better than Twilight. Certainly, the BOOKS were in a different league to Meyer's trilogy but I found the movies disappointingly similar. As a matter of fact, I preferred Kristen Stewart's Bella to TheGirlWhoPlayedKatniss and that is a very large statement.People interested in such stories, read the books! You will love them. You will cry with the characters and care deeply about their fates.

Perhaps I should join that camp ? It's not a bad movie but it has TVM production values written all over it . Nothing about it is outstanding and nothing about it is involving either . A chick stuck in the wilds fighting for her life would make a fair premise for a TVM and director Gary Ross gives the impression that he has made something for television . Perhaps the worst aspect is how inoffensive the action scenes involving killing are .

It is based on the books by Susan Collins. It has a huge cast with quite a few celebrities, e.g. Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss, or Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta. The movie also stars Liam Hemsworth, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and many others. The film is about a girl (Katniss) who is forced to compete in a tournament that is smiilar to the gladiator fights in ancient Rome. The movie is a dystopian film. The picture is very entertaining, exciting and incredible. It contains some violence but it isn't too brutal. The movie also has a little love and some fighting. Ther also negative points about the film: it is very monotonous and it can get very boring. Also, the picture is very cheap, they could have used a nicer and richer arena. Most of the time, it's unrealistic. In my opinion it is a film, that everyone should watch but it's not a picture that you buy DVD of and watch it a couple of times. One time is enough. The movie is made for everybody, because it contains some action and some love. So in conclusion in my opinion it is a film that no one should miss.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In my opinion , if they are to make a Hunger game part 2 ( They should because the plot and main idea provided by the book is so vast and so interesting) , they utilize the early 20-30 minutes for the introductions of the characters and to explain the plot and the rest for pure heart-stopping action. Less on shot kills and more fight to death scenes would have made this movie way better. PS. If you plan on watching this movie with your friends at a night stay , don't.

Jennifer's performance was excellent and single-handedly stopped this movie from sinking.

Jumping on the Lord of the Rings > Harry Potter > Twilight bandwagon, the film is based off a series of popular books (that I hadn't heard of until the film arrived) and follows a young girl sent into an arena of death against other children for the entertainment of a tyrannical, self-obsessed higher society.Sounds pretty grim right? Unfortunately The Hunger Games feels terribly insecure, lacking self confidence in what it can and cannot show to a 12A / PG-13 audience, and decides to meander around and waste excessive amounts of time. This is not the worst crime however, since it was expected, the worst flaw with the film is its lack of confidence in explaining itself. The plot literally makes stuff up continuously, like a child improvising a story: ""Oh, oh, now we have fireballs that appear out of nowhere! Now they make these huge monsters appear with magic! Now they get help from the outside cos they're the main characters!"" What the heck is any of this?? I didn't understand how it was happening as none of it was explained, great plot-holes loomed constantly, and with a run time of two hours and twenty, you'd think they would get around to some exposition!The film also has some of the stupidest villains I've seen in a long time. We are talking 1980s cartoon villains. Not so much how they look, I dug that (even though The Fifth Element's designs by Jean-Paul Gaultier did it so much better) but how their entire society was hinged on a massive flaw i.e. The Hunger Games. Gladiatorial combat is no new concept, but it is particularly stupid when the dominant masters train up the helpless, angry majority. A majority prone to riots. Not just that, but thinking giving these poor people ""hope"" is a good idea? Hm, let's see: hope + training + wilderness survival (thanks to being shunned and native to the wilderness) + hero worship via Hunger Games = bad, stupid, retarded idea. Not to mention our heroes in this story trump them at their own game in such a ridiculously easy fashion, means they are completely useless as antagonists!Anyway, I've gone on about the flaws since there are a lot The pros, well, I do like the concept (despite it being terribly implemented here) and the ""Capitol"" high society characters had some funny lines from time to time, and leading star Jennifer Lawrence was convincing as a young but strong female role model.I'm sorry, but The Hunger Games strikes me as a ""for the fans"" production, I was disorientated by the insane camera work in the fight scenes (it made Transformers and Batman Begins feel like cruise holidays) and disconnected by the shallow explanations.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie has the overall plot but lacks the details and depth of the books. And damn those are important. The movie stays right at the surface of the plot and cannot give the viewer the same emotional and cognitive involvement that the books have. I almost cried for some deaths in the book while it didn't even register in the movie.I also feel that that the film lacks gore and desperation. I am not much of a horror fan or even an action fan but the whole premise of the story is that the games are awful and to bring that across on the screen you need more gore then the bit of blood they show. I won't say that the movie is awful as so many have done before me. It is good enough, it just doesn't reach the depth of the books.

From beginning to end, I was entertained awaiting for the hunger games and what was yet to come. The battle was so fierce but portrayed courage, something people use in every day life. Throughout the movie they said ""may the odds be ever in your favour"" and the odds turned out to be something never expected. Watching Katniss at home with her sister and in her everyday life showed that she would be tenacious in such a competition and for her to volunteer was honourable. Her and Peeta were such a great team but it was such an odd coincidence that fate would put the two of them together.

Jennifer Lawrence gives a great Everdeen, and Josh Hutcherson gives a great Peet's, but most of the non-leads (with some exceptions) felt lacking. Example: when a certain highly likable character is killed, it fails to wrench your guts.If I had to pick one thing I was very disappointed about in this film, it would definitely be the CGI. Some of the action (ESPECIALLY a certain scene toward the end of the film....no spoilers) looks incredibly fake to the point where you aren't in the movie anymore. While it's definitely no Battlefield Earth in terms of poor CGI, it should be kicked up a notch considering the high demand for this movie.Despite some flaws, this movie is probably my favorite ""YA"" movie (if not one of it's sequels) and one definitely worth a watch. It takes great care to give you the same experience you had when yo read the novel, and it's a ton of fun as well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","A Darling Summary of: The Hunger Games.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2674675/?ref_=tt_urv","s-wesner1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36346528/?ref_=tt_urv","17 September 2012","Suphie Wesner 9/13/2012Movie Review for the Hunger Games: Produced in Year 2012 AD Well, actors Liam Hemsworth (current beau/fiancée of Miley Ray Cyrus), Josh Hutcherson, as Peeta Melark (a fictional name, of course), Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, as Caesar Flickerman, and others, including, not to be stingy, (the mother of the protagonist), verified as complete as well as actors and actresses, in the following order: Jennifer Lawrence, who played the role of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, a film based in post-apocalyptic North-American, conglomerate, ""Panam.""Indeed, this movie is very reminiscent of the types of mind-control that sometimes, people are capable of producing, and, going through, themselves. It is a very scary situation that, the character (our heroine, but, also our victim, must face). The book itself was written by an authoress named Suzanne Collins. Indeed, in the scene, ""Very Lethal"" one can tell what that chapter of the movie, film, Hollywood production, or just about whatever you want to call it, must be about. It turns out to be about fire-balls being thrown everywhere by another group of simply evil animals, and they choose her as their main target, for some odd reason. The whole point of the movie appears to be, to the lay-viewer, again (this is just my point of view, so, again, don't mind me), showing the desire, or the fear, that one who is avoiding death at all costs must have to go through; it is not pretty, as new hurdles keep getting thrown in her direction by the unkind, non-compassionate, game-show hosts. All in all, though, I do not have time to finish this darling review which is quite near and dear to my heart; the film is quite bloody, though I wouldn't say there is much gore, per se, visible until the end (the movie palpably builds up the gory suspense, as when the panthers eat away the body of a teenaged-boy and the lead-role characters mercifully pierce his body dead with an arrow). But the truth be told, it is a very gory, very violent, and uniquely immoral film; unique and insightful, I say because it supposedly does teach us about the threatening destruction that can be wrought by harmful, by violent, by people-devaluing, horrible societies, and new world orders, so to speak, but it does not teach us anything about how to do something about it. The best moral lesson that this film offers, indeed, is the tried and true moral morsel of wisdom that love conquers all (the girl in it, and the boy in it, Peeta, and the leading actress played by Jennifer Lawrence), sharing is caring, and, indeed, that ""thou shalt not kill..."" In general, though, if so many of our American youth (it is, after all, an American film, so, this notion is not far-fetched want to kill each other, then this film might be the very reason that people like James Holmes do what they do... Why else would A few fictional elements are thrown into the film, too, to make it more realistic: mocking jays, a bird by whose call one can figure out the time, night-shade berries that are supposedly so venomous that they will kill you ""in a minute"", and even some huge packs of modern wasps, as well as computers that are designed to conjure up a pack of panthers in minutes. It is all too much to believe, that the new race of humans could have so much hatred, for each other, certainly, but it is the evolution of the human race here. Hatred from man to man, back-biting, and, indeed, lots, and lots of ""games-sponsored"" killing, and efforts to weed one another out at the expense of their lives, and to save one's own life, is the reality portrayed in The Hunger Games. Gary Ross, was the twisted director. To give one's imagination some clue as to how horrid this film portrays the human race in the year 3,000, or so, one merely has to turn to the praise given by Writer and producer Stephen Spielburg to the movie, whose own books border on the sci-fi, horror, and social engineering to make man more ""perfect."" Indeed, ""perfect"" at the expense of cruel devastation and destruction, is what this society has achieved in its own barbarous way; people all look like one another, they all wear weird, outlandish costumes, they wear their hair oddly, and they even wear strange make-up. People who want to participate in the games are told to dress in this Lady Gaga-esque garb, and they even get waxed, manicured, and steamed up, but at the cost that their lives might be spent, later...It is not worth it as producer and director Gary Ross tries to tell us, I think, societal perfection will never be achieved through wearing blue wigs, trying to tell the teen public that they must form districts, clans, and posses, and then try to kill each other, out-maneuvering one another, sneakily, and ""out-couraging"" each other, if you will. Unity doesn't come from too much destruction, anyway; one simply has to try to use one's judgment, and be discerning... Only then can we achieve, the ""perfect society."" Not by stealing other people's food, as they try to do in the games, even to the extent of blowing up ""apple carts,"" nor by being so mean to each other that one tries to kill off someone's boyfriend (as happens in the film), out of jealousy of their love, nor by trying to eliminate other teams, simply out of rivalry, nor by killing little children out of cowardice, nor by declaring that ""one only"" can be the winner. These are all sick fallacies of judgment, and must be stopped. Declaring that one style, one type, one race only can be allowed, these are all perversions of judgment. They are not only highly detrimental to any type of peace-loving society, they are destructive, war-loving, and sick, ill, mentally unhealthy.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Two contestants are chosen to represent each district in a battle to the death with the other 11. Ultimately, there can be only one survivor, making things even more heartwrenching. All of this plays out via live broadcast to a cheering audience.This movie is reminiscent of THE RUNNING MAN, mixed with elements from classics like BRAVE NEW WORLD and BATTLE ROYALE. The main character, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is from the coal-mining district 12. Ms. Lawrence is very convincing in her desperate role, making Katniss a wide-eyed country kid who must draw upon everything she knows in order to stay alive. Many difficult decisions are made, all of them costly.There is just as much poignancy as there is action and violence, making this movie stand out as one of the more balanced of its subgenre. The film's commentary on commercialization, social / moral decay, and governmental control, is clear and suitably biting.

Due to an unsuccessful uprising by the districts of Panem, a raffle (known as the ""reaping"") is held to choose one boy and one girl (ranging from ages 12–18) from each of the twelve districts to participate in the Hunger Games, a competition in which each contestant (known as the ""tributes"") battles to the death until only one is left. The winner or victor receives fame and fortune. The Hunger Games are a yearly reminder to the 12 districts of the Capitol's authority and punishment for their rebellion over 70 years ago in which the 13th district was destroyed.In District 12, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) cares for her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her sister Primrose ""Prim"" (Willow Shields) since her father died in a mine accident when she was 11. Each year, since the age of 12, Katniss' name has been placed in the reaping more than once. In return for taking this extra annual risk, she receives extra grain and oil for her family. In addition, Katniss has been illegally hunting for food outside the boundary fences of District 12 with her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth), whose father died in the same mining accident.Prim, now age 12, has her name placed in the reaping for the first time—only once—and it is unexpectedly drawn. Katniss volunteers to replace her sister in the Games. She competes against other tributes, including Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the male tribute from District 12, who has secretly loved Katniss since childhood and who once showed her a kindness she could never forget.Before the Hunger Games begin, she is given a stylist named Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and a Capitol escort named Effie (Elizabeth Banks) to help her make a good impression with potential sponsors. Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a drunk and the only living victor from District 12, mentors both Katniss and Peeta before and during the Hunger Games. Once in the arena, Katniss must rely on her hunting skills, stealth, speed, and wits in order to survive. She also has to fight her anger for the Capitol and 'put on a good show' in order to receive food and aid from sponsors.The only drawback of the movie it proceeds slow making it boring for the viewer.Since the movie's story is based on the novel,so there is nothing original.The direction is fine.The screenplay is good.Performances:- Jennifer Lawrence is excellent,while Josh Hutcherson is good.Woody Harrelson excels.Elizabeth Banks is good too.Lenny Kravitz is subtle.Stanley Tucci is okay.Liam Hemsworth is fine.All in all,""The Hunger Games"" is an excellent movie .I am giving it a six on ten.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's so easy to make fun of this movie as if it's just another teen exploitation product, like the TWILIGHT movies. Certainly there are times when it feels that way. A lot of people say it rips off other action epics, everything from RUNNING MAN to ROLLERBALL. But THE HUNGER GAMES also has elements of much older films, like THE GRAPES OF WRATH (hillbillies coping with poverty in a dignified way) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (corrupt government forces young people into pointless war) and even GONE WITH THE WIND (in a time of turbulence, a headstrong, independent, strikingly beautiful young woman must save her family and deal with her feelings for two very different beaus.) This is not to say that it's a great movie all the way through. It's not always convincing as a study of totalitarian governments. As a drama it's often corny and derivative. The real point is that Jennifer Lawrence can do anything and make it seem fresh and new. She can be honest and stubborn in the face of social injustice (like Henry Fonda as Tom Joad), sensitive and thoughtful in the midst of combat (like Lew Ayres as Paul Baumer in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT) and she can even be innocent and sensual and provocative all at the same time (like Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.) Quite a range for a young actress who's still learning her craft!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawerence is wonderful and really succeeds in making the viewer empathize with the lead character. It's the rest of the ensemble that are shallow as can be.

Based on the book written by Suzanne Collins, this film stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth. The story takes place in a future setting in a nation known as Panem, which is divided into 12 districts and the capitol. This science fiction, adventure-filled film is bound to have the viewer on the edge of their seats. Each year, in the nation of Panem, two young adults are selected by lottery to represent their district in ""The Hunger Games"", a televised fight-to-death that the rest of the citizens are required to watch. When Katniss' younger sister's name is called to represent District 12, Katniss volunteers herself in order for her sister to remain safe. The male drawn as Katniss' partner for The Hunger Games is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), whom she has dramatic history with. Immediately after being selected, the two are sent away to training where they must gain the proper skills to survive The Hunger Games. Given only a small amount of supplies, Katniss and Peeta are sent into the woods where they compete against the remaining 22 opponents. Katniss finds herself a nice tree, where she is able to make a small platform for her to sleep on for the night with the hopes that no one will spot her. Day after day, Katniss and Peeta must remain a team to protect each other for survival. Obstacles appear, and suddenly the game is unpredictable. Throughout the film, the audience gets an intense look as The Hunger Games play out, leaving them on edge and unsure of the end results. The director of this film, Gary Ross, did a fabulous job of directing this film. The angles used within the film helped the audience to get a better understanding of emotion within the film. Despite the fast-paced, extreme situations that each opponent faces throughout The Hunger Games, the audience is able to feel the connections between the characters. Furthermore, the audience gets a chance to feel as if they are part of the film, finding themselves cheering on the main characters as they fight for their lives. The set design and costumes were also done really well in this movie, as it allowed the viewer to believe this actually took place in the future. The set design was a perfect fit for this film, as a majority of the film took place outside in the woods. The set design allowed the film to bring to life the world that Suzanne Collins had created in her novels. Additionally, it was very easy for the audience to see the difference between life in District 12 and the capitol, where life in the District was poor and rural with washed out buildings, and the capitol was futuristic with modern decorations and bright colors. This film was strategically put together, allowing for the audience to feel a sense of belonging, as though they were involved. From the very beginning to the very end, the audience is hooked, and more often than not, begging for the sequel. From the cast, to the set design, to the directing, The Hunger Games is a high quality film that is strongly recommended for any teenagers, as well as any one interested in adventure films.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Subtle and Shocking","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2593555/?ref_=tt_urv","andreas-inderwildi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33010700/?ref_=tt_urv","8 April 2012","To appreciate ""The Hunger Games"", one has to recognise that it works on quite a few different levels. Sadly, some people seem unable to see beyond the superficial and to appreciate the clever subtlety and complexity of this film. On its most basic level, of course, ""The Hunger Games"" addresses many issues relevant to adolescents, such as taking responsibility and dealing with a world dominated by adults. It's about finding one's way and standing one's ground even when this world of adults is utterly unable to provide role models for even the most basic ethical behaviour.On further levels, however, it also deals with totalitarianism, a lack of ethical frameworks and modern exploitative mass media with its total disregard for privacy. The beauty of ""The Hunger Games"" is not just that it addresses such diverse topics, but that it manages to bring them together in a single and coherent commentary on our cultural and political situation. It's a delight to see how today's politics and television shows are cleverly exposed for all their totalitarian tendencies as well as for their stupidity, manipulation, hypocrisy and cruelty. And the totalitarian state of Panem provides the film with a setting in which all the adolescent's concerns, such as growing up and taking responsibility, become especially urgent and relevant.Some people criticise the film's love story, claiming that it detracts from the cruelty of the games and banalises it. If one fails to recognise that this film is more than a story for teenagers with some random violence and action thrown in, this might seem accurate. But nothing could be further from the truth. This love story is primarily about manipulation, about a brutal intrusion into the emotional life of teenagers. Those in power try to instrumentalise the potential love story to strengthen the totalitarian system both by providing the audience with a clichéd image of ""young love"", thereby disencouraging them from revolt, and by weakening Katniss's emotional power over the audience. On a different level, Katniss herself instrumentalises this love story (to a certain degree) in order to make her (and Peeta's) survival more likely. In the end, their relationship seems fragile and ambiguous, abused and violated by the manipulative and totalitarian system. Therefore, the film's love story further emphasises the brutality of the games.I believe that ""The Hunger Games"" is an important film for all adolescents struggling with this world and trying to find their place in it, encouraging them to disagree, to criticise and giving them the hope that change for the better is possible.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","A successful franchise kicks off","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2590209/?ref_=tt_urv","rogerdarlington","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1911738/?ref_=tt_urv","1 April 2012","Following the ""Potter"" and ""Twilight"" transpositions of a series of young adult novels into a sequence of money-spinning movies, the gap in the market has surely been filled by ""The Hunger Games"", the first of three books from Suzanne Collins and the first of four films planned for the new franchise.Set in the near future in a land once called North America and now named Panem, the games are an excessively grandiose and violent version of reality television in which 12 impoverished Districts are required annually to select at random one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 who will fight to the death, leaving only one survivor, simply for the entertainment of the pampered citizens of the Capitol. There are many other films that have deployed a similar theme, the one that comes most to my mind being ""Rollerball"" in 1975, but this version is created with panache and appeal with a mix of splendid sets, outrageous costumes, sustained tension, and a (barely) sufficient degree of violence.At the heart of the novel and the movie is the selfless, brave and resourceful 16 year old Katniss Everdeen - the first name comes from a plant and the second from a character in a Thomas Hardy book. She is wonderfully acted by Jennifer Lawrence who was so brilliant in ""Winter's Bone"" and is clearly set for stardom. Josh Hutcherson is winsome enough as Peeta, the other District 12 ""tribute"", and there are some colourful adult support roles from the likes of Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci.For me as an adult viewer, the only real problem was the violence - or lack of it. In order to secure a PG13 rating in the US and a 12A rating in the UK and enable the age group at which the book is aimed to see the movie, the amount of gore had to be contained, but this takes the edge off what should be a horrific set of encounters and certainly ""Rollerball"" hit much, much harder on this score.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Good But Could've Been Better. A Decent Start Nonetheless.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2946289/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2014","Set in a dystopian future where a totalitarian government is in charge, The Hunger Games presents an annual event in which a boy & girl are chosen from each of the 12 districts to compete against each other until only one survives in the end to be crowned as the winner. I had no idea of what this film was about but now that I've seen it, The Hunger Games looks like a toned down version of the violent Japanese film, Battle Royale that is clearly targeted at a younger audience & although it had the capability to be a brilliant adventure but it's not due to many noticeable flaws.What works in favour of this film is its theme, a darker tone than its counterparts & Jennifer Lawrence who turns out to be the thread that holds this movie together as Katniss Everdeen and even though her character never fleshes out as much as we would've liked, it still maintains a level that can be appreciated. What doesn't work is that the story had the scope to give us the entertainment that's worth our money but is indeed very much toned down; maybe for monetary reasons or whatever. The character never develop throughout the story, the production design, costumes, makeup etc felt cartoony & the acting from everyone else was mediocre & lacked depth.On an overall scale, The Hunger Games manages to be a decently entertaining but entertaining nonetheless, is briskly paced, well-carried by Lawrence & presents an intriguing view of a dystopian society. There are setbacks & falls along the road but it manages to crawl by all of it to come out on the other side & compared to its genre counterparts, is a much better beginning than what others have offered us until now but there is also a lot of things that this film can improve upon & it will be interesting to see if it learns from its mistakes in the upcoming sequels. All in all, The Hunger Games is a good film but had the potential to be even better; an opportunity that went wasted.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games are a televised event in which ""Tributes"" have to fight each other until one survivor is left standing. A young girl, Katniss, played forcefully by Jennifer Lawrence is forced to rely upon her instincts, along with being coached by a drunk - a former winner. The VOICE meets SURVIVOR? Well, no. A reality show that is completely insane like NETWORK? Okay, no. But The Hunger Games does entertain and the cast, the whole cast is fun to watch. Good performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth top off the cast. The action was big, but not necessarily ""epic"" and it didn't move as fast as did the book. However, I did like the movie and would definitely go back and see it again - or the sequel. It is a fun movie and, at times, it is intense.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
