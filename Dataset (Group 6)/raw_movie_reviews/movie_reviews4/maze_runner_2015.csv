They meet other survivors from other mazes and they learn that everyday, a group of teenagers is summoned to be lodged in farms and communities in safe areas. However Thomas decides to investigate what happens with the teenagers and he meets Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland). Soon they find that the place is a WCKD facility and Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is alive and the leader of experiments with the teenagers that are intubated neither alive nor dead. Further, his group will be the next to be guinea pigs. Thomas and Aris succeed in escaping with the other Gladers from the facility and they decide to search the resistance group The Right Arm that is hidden at the mountains. Along their journey, they find the post-apocalyptic world completely destroyed; they meet the Cranks, zombies infected by the Flare virus; they have the loss of a friend; they face storm in the desert and a dangerous group of survivors; and they are betrayed by a friend. Now Thomas and his friends want revenge against the WCKD and Thomas promises to kill Ava Paige. ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" is a full of action sequel of ""Maze Runner'. The story has a predictable plot point disclosing that one character is a traitor. There is no explanation why the teenagers needed to stay in the Glade and why the WCKD wanted them submitted to the situations against the Grievers of the previous movie. Maybe the explanation will be given on the next film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Maze Runner: Prova de Fogo"" (""Maze Runner: Really Tough Test"").","58 out of 94 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Less A-Maze-ing than the First Installment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3313747/?ref_=tt_urv","prospectus_capricornium","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37599117/?ref_=tt_urv","9 September 2015","Last year's 'The Maze Runner' was en route to a non-conformist course off the young adult/post-apocalyptic sub-genre, delivering less familiar but appealing deviations from the more recognizable standards of the category. This year, 'The Scorch Trials', its sequel, keeps some of the original beats of its predecessor, but it eventually falls into the scope of the overly familiar trope that the first film has defiantly avoided, which is a bit disappointing, considering the riveting buildup they've pulled off with the first film.      Much of this film is spent in running. That doesn't necessarily makes the film bereft of sense and extremely difficult to follow, but that fact itself, hinders the proceedings from delivering a comprehensible narrative. 'The Gladers', still led by Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), are now on the run from the forces of WCKD, the mysterious organization that placed them in the Glade. What even worse, are Cranks, James Dashner's version of zombies, joining the pursuit. After seemingly endless cat and mouse chases, you'd be thankful to see them stumble upon a resistance movement, giving them a few moments to rest (that gives you a moment to rest from following them). But that's just a bump, because as soon as alliances are formed and a hint of the government's agenda, is revealed, it's marathon-time again.     See, that's what sends this sequel spiraling down from the heights the first film has soared past in 2014. It lacks genuine emotions, and there are barely plot developments well- knitted enough to spark interest. The marathon extravaganza hampers the characters to fully connect with each other, and engage in a conversation, lengthy enough to help us understand. That's maybe the problem for someone who hasn't read the book like me, ever loaded with 'how's and 'why's, which this sequel seems uninterested in answering, until the final chapter.That being said, there are still some few things to commend, like the fact it has retained, if not improved, its scares and thrills. The Grievers are now replaced by hungrier and grotesquely more vicious Cranks, and the obstacles are updated, to provide more hair raising creeps. The first movie's $340million worldwide cume against its $34million budget has given this sequel a bigger financial resource for production, and you would thank that for 'The Scorch Trials' stunningly choreographed setpieces, looming up in and between adrenaline- propelled pursuits. Some new characters, like Aiden Gillen's Rat-Man, are introduced, but the rest or more than half of movie's payroll's new names, are barely, if not efficiently, utilized. That's an inevitable additional layer to the heap of flaws that piled up for this outing, but it's extremely hard to completely shrug off the film, especially with an interesting, and riproaring climax, that pretty sets the stage for the trilogy's final phase. While that last chapter is yet to happen, let's pray for the last film to never get split into two. 6/10","72 out of 124 found this helpful.

The Maze Runner films are not great. They are good, but not that good. While the film was fun to watch it was full of already seen scenes. Not really original. Director did a good job, not that bad. Screenplay could have been better. You expect to see some of the cool post-apocalyptic cities and landscapes, but you do not get enough of that. A lot of cliché moments in the film. Should have been a little shorter. Also there are some illogical decision that characters made in the film, cannot really get into it without spoiling something. They tried to give it a little twist but it was not that surprising. Irritated me a little bit. Acting was good. I actually liked how they edited it out, not bad. Cinematography is good. All in all a good, fun film to watch. Everyone knew it was not going to be a masterpiece.Arguably maybe it even deserves 6/10.

So, comments like ""you ruined the book"", etc. don't make sense to me. I saw the first movie on a DVD and this one in the movie theater. For me it was pure entertainment for the entire duration of the movie! I liked the thrilling scenes and the chase from the zombie like people. At some points I could not help but thinking that it a PS4 game and at some point they would turn over the control of the actors to me and I would be left alone clicking on X or L1/R1 to run as fast as I can! I liked that but many may not like it. For me this was awesome!The acting was OK, as expected and really similar to the first one. It's not like you wait to see an Oscar-winning performance there, right? I really enjoyed all the special effects and the amazing scenes from the cities that are crumbling and falling apart. The movie seemed a lot longer than it is. The action-packed and full story behind it, gave too much information and left me feeling really ""full"" after watching it and this was not because of the XXL pop corn that I ate! I will go to the movies to see the third one, with excitement! And yes, it definitely is an ""8"" in its genre. ""7"" felt like a minimum, so I would easily give a ""7.5"" with pleasure! If you don't like this kind of post-apocaliptic stories, wait till it's out in DVD, don't spend money in the movies. If you do like them, go and see it, like yesterday!","89 out of 143 found this helpful.

Whereas for the ending of Maze Runner, I was like... ""Here we go again???""For sure... part 2 did not have the novelty of part 1, and for that reason alone some people might give a lower score. In fact, this movie felt more like a zombie survival movie with long screen time in darkness, jumpscares and all, so this is another reason some fans of the first part might not like Scorch Trials. It has a darker atmosphere.It also has many cliché moments, and scenes taken right out from other movies like Jurassic park. Unoriginal ideas, but well, they worked OK in this movie.As for the acting, I liked it. I thought everyone did a pretty compelling job. I liked the twist at the end, which unlike in many movies, doesn't feel forced.All in all, Scorch Trials is a very different movie from the first. Different settings, different environment, different atmosphere. Once again, it did not have the novelty and originality the first part had.But with that said, I can't say it wasn't exciting and entertaining, and made me look forward to the next part.","27 out of 48 found this helpful.

Besides the character names, lightening, and some sand, NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING about this movie resembled ANY part of the book. Nothing. I read the book in one day, two days before I saw this movie. I was so excited to see this fantastic book come to life, and I left sorely disappointed.I'm not sure if the author of the book was involved at all in the decisions that went into the writing of this movie, but they completely bastardized, completely changed EVERYTHING about his story. Even the core motivation behind the 'who and the why' was different.It simply was not the same story at all. I've seen many books made into movies and I'm familiar with the huge and often disappointing changes they inevitably make, but this was off the charts.

I was wrong. First of all, Mr. Wes Ball, do me a favor and never produce another movie again, and if you so feel inclined to embaress yourself again, maybe actually read the book before making a movie about it. The movie was so far from what actually happened its disgraceful. One of the biggest concepts of the plot of the book was the actual ""Scorch Trials,"" which was never even explained or touched in the movie, it was just teenagers and a middle aged man running in a post apoctlyptic town with zombies looking for ""The Right Hand"" which doesn't even exist in the book. There was no plot and a bunch of characters and scenarios were added for no reason. The book has 360 pages of pure gold and the director just went completely rogue and made up his own concept. quite honestly, the director could have did that exact same movie and just gave it a differt title and changed the characters names and no one would even make the connection that it was even The Maze Runner series, thats how completely far off it was. and yes, I could not even finish the movie. I was that furious ans disgusted with whatever it was Wes Ball did.

"8","/10","More entertaining than the first installment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3314613/?ref_=tt_urv","do-arellano-mayra","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46116314/?ref_=tt_urv","10 September 2015","Let's get this straight out of the way. If you are tired of movies based on books that present a young cast, you won't find something here to convert you. However if you found the first movie to be a surprisingly entertaining, solid action flick;or if you don't mind the age of the main characters as long as the story deliveries, there's plenty to like here. Specially because there are some improvements over the flaws of the first film.The action sequences are gripping, well directed and have a feel of raw realism. It's evident that the ensemble of actors- young or mature- gave it all physically. It seems as though the stunts doubles had little to do in comparison to the average action flick.If in the first movie you got 2 or 3 action scenes to keep you in the edge of your seat,in The scorch trials you'll find action almost from the beginning.I'm not a fan of non-stop action, but I was particularly impressed with Barry Pepper who I heard filmed his action scenes with a broken ankle. The acting is extremely good. Not only the young lead Dylan O'Brien and his young co-stars, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario, Rosa Salazar and Thomas Brodie Sangter, deliver strong performances, but also the supporting cast of mature actors. By the way if you have read or heard that the very talented supporting cast of mature actors is there only for their paychecks or that ""they have better things to do"" you are hearing a biased opinion by unprofessional reviewers who are tired of ""YA adaptations"". But just because some reviewers are tired of this ""subgenre"" doesn't mean that plenty of talented cast and crews aren't fully involved with these kind of stories in spite of the studios greedy intentions. This movie might not be perfect, might not be for everyone but one thing that you can tell for sure is that Barry Pepper, Alan Tudik, Aidan Gillen, Lily Taylor, Patricia Clarkson and particularly Giancarlo Esposito gave it all. They have amazing chemistry with the very talented young cast and they seem to be screaming ""100% commitment to my role"". It became clear to me through their committed performances that they believed in the project and that they trust the director Wes Ball. There's plenty of character development opportunities and these mature actors take advantage of them all even if their screen time is limited. Ava Paige as played by Patricia Clarkson started the movie as the archetypal ""evil scientist"" and by the end of the movie I was somehow rooting for her. She really needs to find a cure to this mysterious disease called ""the flare"". Giancarlo Esposito started limited by a role that seemed at first written to fulfill a quota of the typical ""evil adult vs. innocent kid"" trope. However, as the movie moves on we discover that he is far from being a cartnoonish ""evil adult"" and that his character is full of humanity. A scene in which he is concerned over his protegé was one of my favorites of a film from which I was only expecting mindless entertainment and non-stopping action.The problem is that this brilliant cast was limited by a script that seemed to go nowhere. I'd say the script is not as strong as the one of the first movie and that script wasn't particularly good to begin with. There are some improvements. This time some clichéd lines have gone away, there's more backbone to the characters and a little more of ""showing-not-telling"". But if you are thinking that everything that didn't make sense in the first one will make sense in this movie you might end up disappointed.One more time the movie ends in a cliffhanger although this time there's not a last minute info-dump. If you don't mind these minor flaws on the script you might end up enjoying the ride.In my opinion, the strongest part of the movie, besides the thrilling action and good acting are the visuals. I enjoyed the shots of the scorch because the cinematographer took plenty of risks. I want to see the movie again just to appreciate these shots better. There were also interesting shots in terms of composition.The VFX is extremely well executed. I thought the director was going to get overboard with the CGI usage but he wisely balanced the visual effects with the emotional arc to take the audience to a journey through this devastated lands in which under each nook, each skeleton building lies a new danger, a new story, a new world which I'd love to explore. As if this wasn't enough to make me want to see the movie again, Joe Paesano's score (Daredevil TV series, The maze runner) was masterfully used and added a special feeling to the already beautiful visuals.

I thought that the action sequences within the maze scenes were all quite exciting and very entertaining to watch. However, after all the excellent suspense and tension built up in the first two- thirds of the film, at the end nothing really gets explained clearly. It felt like an incomplete film on its own. For those it gets interested though, this sequel is expected to give answers to questions raised in the first film.While under the care of a high-security facility, Thomas becomes increasingly suspicious of Janson, the man in charge. When he overhears a sinister plot hatching, he gets his fellow Gladers out to brave the arid desert called the Scorch outside. However, it was not only the elements they have to worry about, there were still a horde of killer zombies called the Cranks out there to contend with. Thomas and his gang survive the Scorch and unite with the rebel group in the mountains in order to fight the danger foisted on humanity by the increasingly mysterious Dr. Ava Paige and her WCKD organization.Dylan O'Brien continues his good portrayal of the ever-doubting Thomas. In this film, his character would need to make a lot of difficult decisions and O'Brien convinces us that he can make those hard choices. The other young actors in his gang do not really do too much to stand out. Aidan Gillen, the ever-slimy Littlefinger on ""Game of Thrones"" brings his smarmy charms in this film as the Rat-Man, Janson. One look at him and I cannot really separate him from his TV character. Rosa Salazar gives a strong performance as Brenda, a survivor within the city ruins whom Thomas encounters. She registers better on screen than the main female lead Kaya Scodelario, who plays Teresa. It was good to see another ""Game of Thrones"" actress in there, the attractive Nathalie Emmanuel, who plays Harriet, one of the rebels. Veteran actresses Lili Taylor and Patricia Clarkson lend class to their rival scientist characters, Mary Cooper and Ava Paige, respectively.The excitement build up strongly in the first act. However the second act in the Scorch felt a bit slow as the Cranks overstay their parts too long. Their horror scenes were effectively creepy at first but they get a bit too repetitive. A protracted hallucinatory party scene can also be quite head-scratching. The third act though hikes up the explosive climactic action and revives anticipatory audience excitement for the next installment. The production design of elaborate setup of the WCKD laboratory and the ruins of the huge city looked very good. At the end of the 130 minute running time, there are still a lot of questions about the true intentions of WCKD, or is that name alone already a giveaway clue?There was no more maze in this movie anymore for the characters to run through. However, the maze is for the viewer who has to try to absorb this whole labyrinthine dystopian world that James Dashner hatched in his novels. Director Wes Ball does his best to make the complex plot engaging, exciting and entertaining with some pretty well-executed action scenes. Overall, when compared to the first ""Maze Runner"", this sequel was the more satisfying film for me. 7/10.","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

Here Thomas & his crew are on the run into the dangerous desert wastelands called The Scorched Earth, a place full of Danger & most dangerous of all are the Infected humans who have turned into Zombie creatures called Cranks. These ""Cranks"" look Awesome & make for terrifying creatures that are out there ready to rip-apart any human. This film has a more Horror feel to it & that's why i loved it best. There's an incredible, intense & exciting sequence where Thomas & his gang are in a buried building in the sand & it's dark & scary & full of ferocious killer Cranks that chase them through the big old building/Mall type place & it's so intense & scary & a proper Horror movie scene.
The characters are all great again here, especially Thomas as the troubled leader of the group & we get, much later in the movie, a great Little role from Barry Pepper, one of the most underrated actors out there & one of my personal favourite actors ever!!! Here the always intense & rugged Barry Pepper plays a tough wasteland warrior named Vince & although it's a small part for Pepper it's a great role & he steals the show as soon as he's on screen.
Here Thomas must survive the scorched earth & evade the evil WKD empire. A thrilling adventure.The Scorch Trials is a blast of Action & Apocalyptic sci-fi Horror with a great ensemble cast & great effects.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

What a great movie!From beginning to end, I was on the edge of my seat. Unlike the first, there's a lot more violence and death in this movie, and the Cranks are OH SO HORRIFYING!And as you may have expected, along with the Cranks comes lots of JUMP SCARES!This movie is super intense and action-packed that you won't want to look away for a moment. Also, there's a single scene about 35 minutes into the movie that shocked me. It wasn't meant to be a plot twist, but the way they pulled it off was incredible. Giving that away would be sad, so I want you to see it for yourself.Let's just say that it involves an quiet, emotional scene with a gun and a slowly growing infection through someone's body. Moving on...The thing I dislike is the lack of character development in the new characters introduced. Here's some random kid shown near the beginning, then when he only appears in the background and basically says nothing, I'm like 'Wait, who is he again?' when he finally begins to speak.The first movie was all about the action, but this one is all about the action and the PLOT. Oh yes, there is a plot twist near the end I didn't see coming, and it kind of involves a familiar character.So much happens in this movie that leaves your mind blown, and it leaves you off with a sort of cliffhanger. It will leave you saying 'The game is truly on...' except the game will be on in 2017. Shame.Overall, I say IGNORE THE CRITICS! They see this as Young Adult, which technically it is, but it's more of a Young Adult horror movie! It's certainly interesting.8/10.

Its as though the writer / director said lets throw everything into the story that we can and see what sticks, and then when it came time to edit some of it out, everything cost so much to make that they didn't want to remove it.This means the film has a running time in excess of two hours and its a lot to digest. There is so much action that we as a viewer get exhausted watching it. The gang of kids we never really get to meet. Only Tom has a purpose, the others I couldn't even tell you their names. I guess they could have been left out the script as none of them were useful. One of them started complaining at the start, suggesting a possible conflict but them he just shut up for the rest of the film.Then there are all the new cast members who become redundant mere minutes after being introduced. Eventually you start to wonder if some of these people could have been left out the movie to make a much tighter edit. The sets are however outstanding. The scorched Earth is something I want to see again. You do start wondering though - if all these giant mazes are apparently around the place, with green pastures inside. Why would anyone live in the desert when they can live quite happily inside the maze? The action is great, most scenes make sense (although there is one jump cut from we have to take cover from the storm to the next morning). There are times when you have to ignore logic like needing food and water, leaving guns behind and stuff like that. But this was an enjoyable film which is very fast paced, if perhaps a little too much of a good thing but still a great film that you need to see on the big screen.","34 out of 67 found this helpful.

The story picks up, where the last one left off, with the Gladers now on the run; in a deserted outside world, filled with zombies. The young survivors are desperately trying to find clues, about the corrupt organization known as the WCKD. The film was once again directed by Wes Ball and written by T.S. Nowlin (the two made their feature film directing and writing debuts, with the original movie). It stars Dylan O'Brien, Ki Hong Lee, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Kaya Scodelario and Patricia Clarkson; all reprising their roles from the first film. They're joined this time around, by newcomers Jacob Lofland, Aidan Gillen, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosa Salazar, Barry Pepper, Lili Taylor and Alan Tudyk. I was somewhat impressed with the original movie, but I found this sequel to be pretty uneventful and boring.The film begins with the survivors of the maze, in the first movie, being taken to a facility; for their protection from the outside world. Thomas (O'Brien) becomes very suspicious, of what's going on at the site, and starts snooping around. He learns that the leader of the establishment, Mr. Janson (Gillen), is actually working for the WCKD. Thomas, and his friends, decide to escape (as a result); and learn more about the motives of this ruthless organization. They have to survive in 'the Scorch' (the outside world), while being hunted by the WCKD, in order to do so.The film is very long and drawn-out; but most of all it's just plain boring. There's some decent effects, and action scenes, including several zombie attacks; but they're mostly uninvolving, and kind of thrill-less. There's almost no plot, or character development, in the entire movie! I could have cared less, what was going on, at almost any point in the film. I didn't feel this way about the first movie, at all. I've also heard, that this film is almost nothing like the book (which I haven't read). It's mostly just a waste; and a pretty big step backwards, for the series. Hopefully the conclusion is a lot better!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And I was pleased to see it, as the first film leaves everything open and raises our curiosity for what comes next.In this film, Thomas, Teresa and the boys from the labyrinth goes to a place where there are other young people, from other labyrinths that apparently existed elsewhere. However, it is evident right from the start that the place belongs to the terrible medical organization that had kept them trapped in the maze. After they manage to escape, they discover themselves in a ruined, arid and devastated world, where the only human beings who are there are sick and maddened zombie creatures.The film is a good sequel and rises to the level of the previous film. The only thing that disappointed me was really seeing that the sick humans were similar to the living dead of a thousand and one films and series like ""Walking Dead"", for example. I expected something different. In any case, it was not unpleasant and allows for good action scenes and runs amid the ruins. The plot twist near the end is intense, unexpected and in fact allows for a very well done finish. The pace of the film is pleasant too.The film has a very good cast, and maintains the hard core of the previous film, as it had to be. Dylan O'Brian remains a good protagonist and does a very safe job. Scodelario received better material and her character was much more developed in this film, which allowed the actress to do a more interesting job. The love interest of O'Brian and Scodelario's characters is developed and credible. Ki Hong Lee and Thomas Brodie-Sangster also do a very good job on this film. Giancarlo Esposito is a welcome addition. Rosa Salazar is more effective as an action figure than in the inglorious task of making a love triangle with Scodelario and O'Brian, where she fails miserably. Patricia Clarkson is a weak and uninteresting villain, although she tries to look bad. Aidan Gillen was more effective in this task.The film has excellent production values and there is a lot of money tied up in high quality CGI that makes the whole world look like a deserted, inhospitable, poisoned and ruined place. Infected human creatures, as I said, are the least positive thing in the film, as we have seen better zombies in other films, where it is clear and assumed to be zombies. The film has excellent cinematography, is visually magnificent and makes the most of light and colors. However, it is darker than the first film. The soundtrack also deserves mention. Composed by John Paesano, whom I did not know, it is an intense soundtrack, with an epic and deep sense.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Full of action and with a great production dsigner and visual effects, The Scorch Trials happily points to darker paths in episodic acts","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6722314/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","20 March 2021","Maze Runner proved that it could be one of the recent hits amid so many children's adaptations around Hollywood. After the good performance of ""Maze Runner"" in 2014, it was not long before 20th Century Fox gave the green light for the adaptation of the second book of the trilogy created by James Dasher. As soon as they left the premiere, the entire team on that tape has already started working on this ""Maze Runner - Trial of Fire"", in a rush that did not affect the final result of the production.""The maze was just the beginning"". This time the marketing campaign is not exaggerating: while Maze Runner - Run or Die, it brought a single scenario and a precise obstacle (to overcome the maze). Now Thomas, Teresa, Minho and the other young people have to deal with a very different reality: The Earth's surface has been burned by the sun, they must combat an infinite number of mortal dangers. When they escape from scientists, they must survive the desert crossing, when they pass through this stage, they must deal with misshapen creatures called Cranks, then with rebels, then a lightning storm that seems specifically aimed at them. All the people, beings and machines around want to kill them; every shed that could house the group hides new traps. The world is really cruel.In this context, Maze Runner: Trial of Fire considerably expands its universe to become a great action film, with many special effects combined with the rules of other genres (zombie films, post-apocalyptic films, catastrophe films, teenage adventures). This production has a larger budget, and also broader ambitions, aiming to seduce the adult action audience. Unlike the tense and gloomy ambience built with great care in the predecessor iteration, here we already see the unspeakable influence of futuristic dystopias that, without a doubt, begin to draw more parallels with audiovisual and even literary franchises that began in the last century and last in a saturated way until today. The result is agile and technically impressive, however, in the desire to please everyone, perhaps it will not delve into any genre.Again directed by Wes Ball and scripted by T.S. Nowlin, the feature begins exactly where its predecessor left off, with no introduction for newcomers to the franchise - that is, it is necessary to watch ""Run or Die"" before venturing here. Upon discovering that their ""saviors"" work for the CRUEL organization and that they would be used in a scientific experiment, the boys flee the place where they were placed, discovering that the outside world has turned into an inhospitable place, where the climate and the people affected by a virus that turns them into zombies makes the survival of the group doubtful, to say the least. In search of contacting a resistance group to CRUEL, Thomas and his friends find the young Brenda (Rosa Salazar) and her tutor Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito), survivors in the midst of this post-apocalyptic scenario that serve almost as guides for them in this not admirable new scenario.By opening the film with a prologue that shows how Thomas ended up in the hands of CRUEL and further developing the interior of the organization headed by pragmatic Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson), the script adds depth to the conflict between the gladers and their pursuers, something that makes Teresa's dramatic arc (Kaya Scodelario) become much more intriguing and even tragic, making this plot the best of the film, mainly due to the young Scodelario's compositional work, effective every time it is triggered - and it is a pity that she no longer has screen time. That's because Thomas's dilemmas are certainly the film's weak point. The character of Dylan O'Brien continues to lead the group with his inexhaustible arsenal of virtues: he is intelligent, charitable, beautiful, friendly, courageous, tireless, he devises the best plans, runs like no one and never leaves anyone behind. Even if the person in question already has a certain death, Thomas prefers to risk his own life to accompany the dying person. As he always makes the right decisions, without hesitation - unlike Katniss or Tris - the hero becomes uninteresting, somewhat superficial. Fortunately, O'Brien is an actor with resources, bringing some hesitations to this bastion of morals and good manners.Wes Ball maintains the level of the previous production, only this time he is a little more restrained. If before we had a camera shaking all the time and quick cuts, now the director is betting on the most agile and frantic narrative. Along with the script by T.S. Nowlin and Dan Zimmerman's editing, Ball's conducting works very well, not letting the film bummer when you link one action scene to the other or even not making room for many expository dialogues. On the other hand, the production continues to insist on excessive suspense as a resource to prepare the ground for a sequence - which, obviously, ends up hampering the progress of history. At one point in the projection, for example, one of the characters tells Thomas that he asks a lot of questions. In a way, this is how we stay for a good part of the tape: full of doubts, because we are being introduced to a series of new elements all the time, but they are not very well explained. At first, this tactic may even work, producing some effectiveness; when we reach the middle of the film, however, the resource begins to irritate and, in a way, leaves the viewer lost due to the amount of new elements that are being inserted without the slightest elucidation.Despite the rush to set the tone of the narrative, there is an interesting plot behind this rampant pursuit. While the first part of the trilogy focused on allegories such as the myth of the cave and themes taken from ""The Lord of the Flies"", here the central plot is based on an inversion of the natural order, with the elders seeking to kill (or ""harvest"" "") The youngest to try to survive and recover the old social order. Children have their roles demarcated from an early age by adults and a role to follow, not being given the right to choose their own destiny, but through struggle and rebellion.The great difference of this second film is its episodic character, which approximates the plot of a sadistic video game. Assuming that the audience already knows the characters, the action develops without any brakes, bringing each new segment with its scenery, its characters, its ""villain"" to overcome, as in the stages of a game. Overcoming that danger, young people are ready to run to the next trap. Perhaps this frantic road movie lacks a sense of purpose: where do the characters really intend to go, if nothing around is trustworthy? Among the post-apocalyptic worlds of children's books, none is as bitter and nihilistic as that of Maze Runner.In adults, the highlight is Giancarlo Esposito, who embodies a survivor with a spark of humanity within him, represented by the love he has for Brenda. Aiden Gillen, on the other hand, maintains the sinister and seductive kind that he presents in the ""Game of Thrones"" series. Patricia Clarkson this time has time to develop her Ava Paige, the ever-expanding Alan Tudyk basically caricatures a drug dealer, while Barry Pepper and Lili Taylor basically bridge the gap as the leaders of the resistance.Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is also interesting and slightly superior to the first, but it has silly flaws in its content, problems that could be solved with a better observation of the script. Among the nonsense seen in its long duration, I mention some that are difficult to swallow: there is a scene in which an armed boy revolves using bullets against oncoming security guards instead of shooting the lock that holds the exit door. It also sounds forced to flee quickly to a mall very close to the premises, and the place is not even surveyed by the soldiers, even though they know that the young people have just escaped into a desert storm and are looking for shelter. And then the scene in which Brenda (Rosa Salazar) is supported by a glass - similar to what happened to Julianne Moore in The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) -, and it starts to crack with each movement of the girl, but it doesn't break when a Crank falls on top and there is a fight on the spot. Not to mention the fact that young people run away from the laboratory and spend days in the desert without food and little water...While in the first film, the production design and the action scenes were praised for their originality, here Wes Ball decides to appeal to something more common. Despite the correct design of the CRUEL installation, the post-apocalyptic world of ""Maze Runner"" is not very different from that seen in the ""Mad Max"" franchise, for example. Even the zombies and the set pieces themselves involving the creatures seem to be pulled from the game ""The Last of Us"", with the filmmaker showing a worrying lack of originality in his second feature. However, we must praise the battle that marks the third act of production, very well conducted.Towards the end, the production happily points to darker paths, with mention of sex, drugs, bloody fights and some morally questionable decisions. The target audience remains the teenager, but director Wes Ball's ability to suggest adult ideas within the PG-13 censorship is commendable. The characters would become much more complex if they let their adolescent drives flow in this extreme war scenario. In addition, the announcement of the third film as a ""revenge story"" looks promising. If the writers manage to create a cohesive story and reduce Manichaeism, the third Maze Runner may indeed represent the culmination of this story. After all, the franchise discusses important topics, such as the exchange of freedom for security, the limit of the intervention of science in nature and the role of the single state in relation to the will of individuals. We just need to find space to develop all these ideas in the midst of so much rush.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

After being aggressively annoyed about how bad the first film was, the second actually did the series justice. Besides from being extremely intense, fast paced and enjoyable, the characters were actually better this time around then in the first; The Scorch Trials actually tried and made the characters likable rather than sappy, clichéd teen messes.The Scorch Trials is good, but does suffer from some unnecessary moments that ruin the momentum of the film. Though more well rounded than the first film, it lacks the full drive that you want to see from the film. Fortunately it is saved by decent directing, but you can't help feel that it is time to up the ante and make this film more realistic and adult then this child targeted movement.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

If you've wondered where exactly the rescued are being flown to by the helicopter at the conclusion of that film, the answer lies in the recently released second installment of the trilogy, 'The Scorch Trials'. Upon landing in an apocalypses world of wasteland and chaotic battle of people, the clan is rushed into an enormous security facility, in which a high tech vault door shuts behind them shielding them from all the dangers of the outside world. Upon meeting, Mr. Janson (Aidan Gillen) whom is the head of the facility, he explains that they are here among many other survivors from similar mazes. The clan's secure feelings of being in a safe haven become short lived when circumstances reveal to Thomas that Mr. Janson is not who he makes himself out to be. Discovering that the clan and all the other youths are being targeted and set up as guinea pigs again for another test due to their immunity to the world-wide virus outside, the clan escapes; only to enter a world almost beyond recognition. Running away in a big city lost in sand and rubble, they also fight for survival from bizarre weather occurrences caused by the solar flare epidemic explained to them in the end of 'The Maze Runner'. They embark on a journey where they must seek to build alliances with apocalypse survivors; however having the shaky task of trying to discern who really is good and who is bad. What I particularly loved most of all in the world that director Wes Ball has created was the exterior settings. Unless I missed it, there has never been mention of how long ago the world's fallout was supposed to have occurred. However; in contrast to many apocalypse themed movies where you find empty damaged cities with freeways with old cars frozen in space on the roads long abandoned, the wastelands here reminds me of the ancient ruins you'd find of Rome. Freeway overpasses are only half in place, skyscrapers look like building skeletons, and tall bridges are sunken into tower high piles of sand. While I've always got the vibe that since film number 1 that the fallout occurred as long as a century ago, the visuals seems to suggest of what America might look like thousands of years from now if it were to fall. Like many science fiction movies that are made for entertainment but also has undertone spiritual or political themes that not everyone may catch onto, for me, 'The Scorch Trials' seemed to have some themes that are relevant in today's society. I will restrain myself from pacifically declaring what theme that would be since I believe it would clue off too much of a spoiler about plot, but for the time being, think about that old rationalizations philosophy by some people who believe the bad things must be done for the greater good. While there are many eerie far-fetched things that you will experience in seeing what happens to humans inflicted with the solar flare virus, Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) whom works amongst scientists, brings to surface something that could be seen as a plausible scenario in the far future of America. I believe that what this character wants to do in this story, echoes an issues that you will find in today's media in a much smaller scale. Along with the already great established cast, two interesting new actors show up in portraying both the antagonist and uncertain antagonist. Probably best known for the slick, charming manipulative character, Littlefinger in HBO's current hit, 'Games of Thrones', Aidan Gillen nicely plays one of the head men from the lab who puts on two faces. Then there is Giancarlo Esposito whose been playing projected bad guys in TV over the last several years: such as the rebel and militant Tom Neville in (2012-2014) 'Revolution', the iconic double personality Gus Fring in seasons 2- 4 in AMC's, (2008-2013) 'Breaking Bad', and even time to time appears in ABC as Sidney Glass/Magic Mirror in (2011- ) 'Once Upon a Time'. Here Esposito plays a personality who wrestles between antagonist and protagonist as an ally of the youth clan. If you are like me whose been waiting to see this film until the last minute, now would be the time to see it; as it is now appearing to me that the lifespan torch of 'The Scorch Trials) is about to get snubbed out in the town I live in. Personally, I enjoyed the first 'Maze Runner' a little bit more than this new installment probably because the maze was such a mystical place of mystery. However; I did at the same time find it just as enjoyable.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

It moves into a completely new direction and introduces a new set of ""monsters"" creating a completely new feel in the same world. It still kept the original ""run to live"" theme as they traveled on. The characters were solid, no terrible acting or wild actions.Cons: CGI of ""monsters"" was mediocre at best.

There is a hint of a non-conformist commentary behind the ordeal of escaping the ""Glade"", but lead to a twist that makes it quite complicated. This sequel is supposed to unravel much of those questions and surprisingly, it's actually introducing more worlds, characters and questions that makes the narrative even more complicated. But just like the first one, it's the action that outshine every mess in the story. Many might be dazzled by this gloss, but the story deserves more clarity to be considered as a good sequel.It takes a lot of time for the heroes to find out the truth behind their enemy that we already knew from the first one, and yet the film doesn't quite establish much of its characters, even the new one who just joined their journey. And once they're on to their actual quest of finding resistance, they do not have a definite destination, which can be understandable, giving a suspense of doubt for their survival, but that is actually what most of the film is, apparently. It's fine if the movie is all mystery, but it's not an impressive ambiguous experience if the story still bringing more information that keeps their journey even longer and less simple. Every moment they stop by after an action scene, they mention a place that is supposed to be refuge, then it introduces another character to give more exposition and then they reveal another twist and turn. It could be the film's way of saying that they have a rich universe and it keeps expanding every time they spill more exposition, but mostly, this felt repetitive. It is supposed to be some disorienting phenomena that you may experience in a mind bending film, but that doesn't seem to be the film's intention. They're just saving too much surprise and that makes the experience exasperating.A great excuse for this issue is to at least develop any of these characters. So far, it's still Thomas who has more characterization among the others. Teresa has some development at some point, but she is still stick in the mud like everyone else. And there's also a new character who had a crucial purpose at the beginning then suddenly becomes a ghost at the middle where we hardly notice he was still with the crew until the plot once again needed him. And then we keep getting introduced with new characters. Only the older cast can be bring the real pizazz since most of them embraces the villainy or the over-the-top nature of their roles.The serious redeeming factor here is director Wes Ball. Without the maze, the action is a little less snazzy; we instead get deserts, thunder and even zombies, but those were handled well. This in fact could be worth seeing for these action scenes alone. Again, in an age of over-CGI-ed spectacles, this is one of those where the action is truly defined by tension and velocity than just some impressive explosion or creature effect. And even the horror-movie-like-aesthetics remain, passionate about showing the terror of these creatures and the probability of losing any major character (if only they are well developed, but still effective in suspense, anyway.)Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is fun, but not by much. The plot is just too complicated to follow and the director really tries so hard to make something interesting out of it. Fortunately, he did, but the flaws are still inevitable. There is still so much questions left unanswered and it gets even more exasperating for leaving more secrets unraveled. Maybe the characters aren't much of a big deal since their plights were at least clear, but what. In a brighter side, in spite that this is a new environment, the film still manages to bring something cool and exciting through these worlds. It might be cooler as a video game or just a cinematic ride. The Scorch Trials is much of the same, except there is so much to keep in mind until the next installment comes next year.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I honestly did enjoy Maze Runner The Scorch Trials. Like I did enjoy the first one as well. I wanted action and science fiction and that's what I got. You can't say there is no action in this movie because that's all there is. Action from the first second till the last second. The sci-fi is also good enough for me to entertain me during more then two hours. I saw way worse sci-fi movies then this one. Better ones as well but that's not the point. This movie keeps you entertained and that's what's it all about to me. The actors are not bugging me, not a single one of them, and that's rare to me. I am already looking forward to the next Maze Runner and I am not a big fan of long series of movies, so that resumes it all. To the haters, go watch some stupid movies from Lynch or Von Trier, where you waste your time with a movie without a story, and then brag about how great it was shot.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A feel-good Running man movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3339020/?ref_=tt_urv","MegaGothmog","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48789036/?ref_=tt_urv","20 October 2015","I watched it like, 20 minutes ago, so this review is as fresh as i can make it :) To say it very short: It was a feel-good movie, that should have been given a different name.As is traditional with my reviews, i'll start with the good sides of the movie.The movie took little to no time to develop. Within the first 10 minutes stuff already goes down. Within 15 minutes, sh*t has already hit the fan. So you don't need to wait for stuff to get interesting.There were a lot of moments that were really cool. Those feel-good moments, where you can sit there and think: ""Ah that was cool!"" ""WOW did you see that?"" ""Oh man, that character was bad-ass there!"" Those kind of moments. There were plenty of them so unless you have no feeling of suspense, you won't walk out of the theater without anything to remember.The acting overall was also pretty nice. Oscar-worthy? No, hell no. But it was good nonetheless. The one actor/actress did it better than the other but i cannot complain.The visual effects and make-up all looked pretty darn good so you are also in for a visual ride. Everything did look like 50-shades of brown, but since the whole movie takes place in a desert-like environment, you can't really argue with that.Now for the bad parts. I'll try to keep everything a secret and not reveal anything.There were too many moments that were basically the same: They go to this place, find out stuff is bad, and have to run. And this goes on 6 times in a row. Why do they call it the Scorch Trials? Call it the Running Men.As i said before, there are a lot of feel-good moments in the film. But in between those moments, there is not a whole lot to see. This film basically thrives on those moments and tries to keep the scenes between those moments as short as possible. Since the movie takes no time to develop, there is little to no introduction of characters. Aidan Gillen (Janson) (and Petyr Balish from GoT) has a pretty impact-full role, but gets a 2 minute intro and that is it.There were also plenty of moments where i thought: ""Seriously? Are you kidding?"" ""Wait what? Do they even....?"" I cannot say what those moments exactly were, so sorry for that, but there were plenty of those moments, and unless you are not paying attention, you WILL notice them.All in all, the movie was entertaining, but very flawed. As i now say for the 6th time, there were a lot of feel-good moments, but also plenty of weird moments, weird choices the characters make, and once again: Thomas is the most important character of them all, and only he can save the day. SERIOUSLY? Why can't this other dude do something? Isn't it so that Thomas is not the only one in the team? Ah, screw it. I'll watch Vikings again.In total i can give it a 6.5, maybe a 7, but no more than that. I have no idea if the book is any better, so don't judge me for that :)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nowlin and is directed by Wes Ball. It stars Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, and Thomas Brodie-Sangster.After having escaped the Maze, the Runners now face a new set of challenges on the open roads of a desolate landscape filled with unimaginable obstacles.The Scorch Trials is a good movie. It impressed me in ways I didn't think possible, in the acting, directing and writing of this distopian survival drama. Every single thing in this movie is better than its predecessor.To start off the positives is the acting. It was great, that was expected. All three of the leads blew me away in the previous movie but they clearly upped their game just in time for this movie. The best of three brilliant performances was clearly Dylan O'Brien. He was magnetic in the lead role offering charm, wit and emotion to the character of Thomas. Its also blatantly obvious from his body language that the character is morphing into something bigger than what he was in the first movie, a hard trick to pull off. Scodelario and Brodie- Sangster are equal in power in their spirited portrayals of their characters. The main problem with the rest of their cast is they don't really try too hard stand out from the leads which really drags down the scenes with out them.Next up was my favorite part of the movie, the cinematography by Gyula Pados. The long shot in the desert shown in the trailer was one of the many gems put in place by Pados. It was intricate and beautiful. Along with his cinematography was the direction by Wes Ball. It was wonderful for a sophomore directorial effort and I believe he will only get better with time.The biggest problem with this movie was its script. I haven't read the books so I can only give a newcomer's look at the franchise. The movie is definitely well written promoting some good thrills but the whole movie feels a bit too kiddish. Though this movie has a darker tone it still suffers from the same problem as its predecessor, its made for teenagers. There's nothing wrong with this per say but I would've liked a more focused approach at making it widely enjoyable to any viewer, no matter what age. With all of that said Maze Runner Scorch Trials succeeds at being a fun movie for teens and an enjoyable one for the adults. It gets a B+ or a 7/10. Get Scorched!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's all as patchy as the mythology where a regime of cruel adults harvest the all important vaccine that will save mankind from the bodies of teenagers.No one will argue that these are crude works; however polished, they're exploitation films at root. One part Mad Max, one or more parts zombie apocalypse, and all of it doused in Hunger Games sauce where teenage love and freedom are suppressed by an odious government.But this is why you don't deserve to be cheapened thus. These things - Hunger Games too - don't just play on teenagers' proclivity for spectacle (or romance), they're not the same kind of thing, in this sense, as another Jurassic Park. They exploit deepseated urges in youths for escaping familiar confines, carving out your own truth outside the walls they impose on you; the precious stuff of youth that kindles dreaming.I found out today that they've come up with a name for this niche, ""young adult"". It's a good name actually, drawing emphasis to this fact, that they're not just works for kids but for young people beginning to improvise adulthood, feeling the first pulls to join the fray of existence. The real crudity then of this is in how it imposes these cheap walls around those youthful urges; a story about rebellious youths setting out on their own but that is fenced on all sides by the most commonplace devices. A cynical thing to foist on teenage minds who must genuinely struggle with these things in their own world and not in a funpark ride.US teens are better off hankering for when they can finally go to their first Burning Man; also a funpark shaped by adults, also constructs the insight in the desert, but they're free to deeply know for themselves, play on the edge of what they find out. The real value is always in having lived through something in a way that lets you know what's true and vital and what's artificial. There's usually a mixture with hopefully the latter as scaffold for the former. Not so here.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Scorch Trials follows Thomas and co. after they have exited the Glade and eventually find themselves in an even more hostile environment, the Scorch. If the environment doesn't kill them, the Cranks will, zombie-like people who have contracted an apocalyptic virus. This movie deviates significantly from its predecessor; while The Maze Runner was an intense sci-fi mystery, The Scorch Trials is an action-packed thriller bent on making your pulse race from start to finish. It lacks the mystery of the first film, but the sequel makes up for it with the unpredictable and thrilling plot and visceral action scenes. It also packs a strong emotional punch. All the returning characters have been nicely developed while new characters bring exciting changes to series' pace and style, so when the final act goes completely insane, you'll really feel for what these characters go through. By improving almost every aspect of The Maze Runner, The Scorch Trials becomes the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor, and I eagerly await the next installment.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

This time it is The Scorch Trials that out muscles and out stories the inferior Hunger Games.Scorch Trials picks up where the first film lets off. The survivors of the maze are picked up by a helicopter that is supposed to bring them to safety. But audience members know the truth, that the WCKD organization's grasp is still tightly wound around fate of these youths. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers are brought to a facility where they quickly discover that their maze wasn't the only testing location. Realizing that WCKD is still around them, they escape to an unprotected land known as the Scorch, a deserted wasteland filled with unexpected dangers. While there they team up with resistance fighters, hoping to once and for all rid destroy WCKD's power.Admittedly, I never read The Maze Runner series, so I can't really compare the film to the book. In a way, that makes me better at critiquing and reviewing the Scorch Trials as a film, untainted by expectations and bias. As a film, The Maze Runner's second film is exciting and atmospheric, well acted and engaging to the final minute.The luck and benefit of adapting a novel into a film is that the major plot trajectory and holes have already been ironed out for you. Sure, you can take creative liberties as you truncate the story for the cinema, but you really have to obliterate it beyond recognition to destroy the cohesiveness as a film. The smartest thing executives behind this franchise did was keep the same screenwriter (T.S. Nowlin) and director (Wes Ball) across both films. What you get is a cohesive narrative with a clear vision, unencumbered by creative conflict and changes personal taste.Wes Ball is really great at capturing the atmosphere of a wasteland without making the environment feel cheap. Ball knows the story and characters and it translates in the care he has for the material. Following the plot, I very rarely was left wondering or with the inclination that what I was watching was changed from the original source material. It's common knowledge that the film would be simplified in comparison, as is true for nearly all book adaptations to film, but Nowlin captures the essence without sacrificing substance.In flying under the radar and in the shadow of the blockbuster marketing endeavor known as The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner has set itself up for an understated success. Knowing that the films have changed the story slightly from that of James Dashner's novel, I'm curious to see how the resolution fares in the final film – The Death Cure.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Completely worthy of the roller coaster thrill ride reference all the professional film critics used to describe a movie. It was darker. Far darker than I would expect from what I thought was a franchise based on a novel for young adults, but considering the lead character is Thomas, The last boy to enter the maze in the first movie and help them escape it only to lead his friends into something far worse, the movie has to relate to the boy crowd that might see this over the similar Hunger Games and Divergent series.And it's way bigger than the first. Being in the maze caused for more story and creativity, but being outside the maze created an action thriller that never stops until those credits roll.And considering it's over two hours, the Scorch Trials does not feel long at all. it was the perfect movie to sit through.

No film is required to follow anything, what matters to me it is if i'm gonna have a good time or not.Spoiler Free.The Maze Runner trilogy, now released his second film, delivers a different scenario for a subject (zombies and apocalypse) already known. In Scorch Trials the protagonist Thomas and his friends are taken to a second Wickd base where they discover some new secrets worse than those find out on the maze. They get away, going through some new places, discovering even more secrets, some new plots begin to emerge and new faces joined the group. It obvious that a middle movie wouldn't deliver all the answers. Do not expect an end that explains something, but surely moves the story and introduces some cool surprises.Other reviews indicate that Scorch Trials is a waste of your time, but I completely disagree. It's a movie for entertainment, following a different story and made me interested in Tomas group, which like every other Hunger Games movie falls into cliché of be ethnically diverse, although they are very charismatic and makes you cheer for them.I chose to leave out the film cons since so many other reviews have focused only on the bad side. It's a good movie and certainly made me want to see the third one. If you didn't read the books and just want to keep up with a cool story, this is a movie for you.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I personally have always loved zombies so this was not a problem for me. This movie was definitely more mature than the first one. The themes can be downright disturbing, such as the harvesting of the kids bodies for their blood while they are still alive. That's messed up. One character is infected and chooses to shoot himself. The zombies were very gruesome, especially in the scene in the sewers in the city.This is definitely an action-focused movie. The action sequences are OK, but are plagued with shaky-cam. An above-average movie, which is decently entertaining, but far from a cinematic masterpiece in any respects.6/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first third is fairly involving and the middle act watchable, however the third act is a real mess. Countless scenes of running from zombie hoards, meaningless sacrifice and betrayal sound good, but it's boring after awhile. To make matters worse the violence is so strong its hard to believe this movie didn't get an R rating. It just seemed there were two writers, one trying to adapt the novel and the second writing the next Zombie Apocalypse movie. Did not hate it, but, it's not what I was expecting or craving to see.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

And i have to say that the first film was not a fluke as this movie lives up to what the first first film set it up to be. There was more action, more thrills, different tones, and it was a more fast paced film than the first. The movie kicks off literally right where the first film cut to black so it felt good to just get on with the story as oppose to stopping to catch us up on what has happened since the last one ended. Unfortunately though, you don't really learn a whole lot more about the overarching story in this film, whatever questions you had after the first film don't really get answered, they only give you a whole lot more questions to think about while you wait for the final instalment. The elements of mystery are still there, although they aren't the main driver of the film like in the first, they are pushed aside for a more action packed sequel which really worked.The fast paced action sequences were in full force for this entire film, the film kept on moving from place to place offering a range of different exciting and fun action scenes where you always felt that the stakes were high. There were some intense gun battles that were chaotic and then you have some different action scenes that were a lot darker than the rest of the film. They were very horror like themes that got pretty freaky at times and i was pleasantly surprised by how dark it got more than once. This variety is what kept me engaged in the film. The film does slow down on occasion to introduce some new characters, sorry, i mean a lot of new characters. Every 20-30 minutes you hear of this new objective that ultimately leads to more and more new characters, i understand that they are trying to build this world but they crammed so much into this film. Driving this film were the characters, some of which you can remember from the last film and the actors again put in strong convincing performances. Even many of the new supporting cast were interesting and you really get to know them and get behind them, or really really hate them. Giancarlo Esposito and Aidan Gillen were great additions to the film and brought in some very interesting characters that play big parts in the film. One other minor thing i have to mention is the inability for the film-makers to end a Maze Runner movie well. Like the first film this one felt like it was going to end like 3-4 times before it actually decided to end and even when it did end it was very abrupt. Some people may like this but it makes the films feel like one long continuous story that has been broken up into three parts and released separately, i would rather three individual stories that all link but that's just me, not really an issue. In the end, this was a well made sequel that proved this series isn't just a crappy version of The Hunger Games. It was more fast paced and action packed and offered a lot more variety of different themes than the first film and may just sneak past it in terms of which is better. - 7.4","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Coming just a year after the first one, I had high hopes for this movie as I really enjoyed the first one. So it was a shame to me after seeing this movie I was straight up disappointed. For the first 30 to 40 minutes I was having a good time. After that it turned into a completely different movie, pace was, I was confused with the story, and I was not interested in the characters. That is what made the first one really fun for me, I cared about these characters and I was rooting for them. My biggest complaint about this movie is, it felt like the writers of this movie gave up. I found the script to be lack luster and bland. However, I did enjoy the chase scenes with the scorch zombies, and the effects did not let me down. The cinematography was good, and they portrayed this barren wasteland really well. I thought Dylan O'Brien did a good job in this movie, but overall it was a disappointed for me in the end.

The original Maze Runner deviated from the young-adult romance trope that plagued the recent adaptations after Twilight ended and it received mixed-to-positive reviews. While fans of the book series either hated it or found it ok, it was considered by many to be a much better young-adult adaptation. It had mystery, it had thrills, it had action and it had emotion. People liked it and so did I. Then, a year later back in 2015, I saw the sequel hoping it would live up to the first film, but while it was a decent enough sequel, it did disappoint me and I understand the mixed reaction from both critics and fans of the second book ""The Scorch Trials"".There are some positives that worked in the film. The cinematography is really gorgeous including the buildings and the actual desert, not to mention it's solid make-up and CGI effects on the Cranks. 61 million dollars went into the production and much like the first film, it was well spent. John Paesano, who scored the first film, did another solid job in delivering the same stuff he did from the atmosphere to the action music. Wes Ball, who directed the first film, delivered another top-notch direction. Also, the acting continues to be great with Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Alexander Flores, Ki Hong Lee, and Patricia Clarkson continuing to deliver excellent performances as did the new supporting cast including Giancarlo Esposito, Alan Tudyk, Rosa Salazar, and Aidan Gillen as the Rat Man, Jorge, and Brenda. And then, there's the action sequences which are more intense and action-packed including the chase scenes. Those set pieces alone are worth watching if anyone else checks the movie out on DVD.That being said, there are some drawbacks that disappointed those who loved the first film and the book series. First, there's the writing, which sadly does feel a bit weak and borrows sources from other zombie-genre related stuff. Not only that, it deviated from the second book despite having some bits of elements which caused an outrage to fans. Also, while the film delivered on the action and thrills, it lacked the mystery and emotion that made the first film work. Not to mention the plot and character development were severely lacking. The new characters were well introduced, but no depth was given to them. Then, there's the pacing which is sadly another weak element to the film. I don't mind two hour films but only when they have development for the characters. The original film had brisk pacing and took it's time for Thomas to interact with the other Gladers and becoming a really great leader and those characters were the ones you cared about. There's some of it here but not enough considering the weak writing and it's deviation from the source material.Overall, The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a decent enough sequel and it delivered what it promised in the trailers, but sadly, it wasn't nearly as engaging as the first film. I haven't seen The Death Cure yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed it would be an improvement. 3/5","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Turns out it was a new age alternative blockbuster with teenagers fighting for survival in a dystopian future regime (like the Hunger Games and the Divergent series). Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is the second entry of what it seems will be another teen dystopian trilogy. The first movie was a sci-fi/mystery/thriller combination, while this second one focuses mainly on action. I like good action films and this one had a lot of that but like in most cases the original first film and idea are better. Nevertheless this second entry combines the element of urgency with constant running action scenes and is a nice choice to accompany your pop corn with. Direction and sound are nicely executed and the young actors' performances are solid. Dylan O' Brien will some day become a star (of course not as big as Jennifer Lawrence). So if you like your sci-fi mixed with simplistic but intense action this one is recommended.Grade: C+ (C if you watch it on TV)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There also wasn't much depth to the various individuals, so I wasn't that bothered if they got killed off in the next scene, like a lot of them did. The actual hero in the movie, was Aris (Jacob Lofland), who done all of the hard work by getting all of the information to escape the original compound but his efforts are put aside through the rest of the film, and all of the concentration is on Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), who in my opinion, was a poor ring leader. He seemed to lead everyone into trouble most of the time, without any planning or any thought about the danger that he is putting the others in. Also, the dramatic thunder storm made me laugh because of how over the top it was, and the ridiculous zombies also made me chuckle. Out of the whole cast, none of them really stood out for me but I did like Aidan Gillen (Janson), as the villain and Barry Pepper (Vince) as the brave ""one man army"" type of character, so I'm looking forward to seeing them in Maze Runner: The Death Cure, which is due out in 2017. The whole tempo and feel of the film reminded a lot of Hunger Games, were you are looking forward to the final showdown between Thomas and Ava, just like Katniss and Snow, so I hope it doesn't disappoint like that film did. I did feel the intensity in this movie and the ending was a good build up for the final showdown in the next movie but they could have easily cut out all of the running around in the middle of the movie. My main problem with the film is the lead character, Thomas because he really doesn't have any screen charisma or the leading skills to convince everyone that they are going into battle for the good of the group. With that aside, it's still a big budget, epic movie which is definitely worth a watch but I doubt that it will go down as an all time classic. Watchable!Round-Up: As I haven't read the Maze Runner books, I don't know how close this franchise is to the original concept, so I can't really comment on the adapted screenplay. I couldn't really see what this film had to do with a Maze but there certainly is a lot of running! Anyway, this is the first major role for the young Dylan O'Brien, 24, who also starred in The Internship and the TV series, Teen Wolf. He's due to star in Deepwater Horizon alongside Mark Wahlberg later on this year, so it will be good to see how he handles a different genre. This movie was directed by Wes Ball, who also directed the original Maze Runner and is due to direct the third instalment. I just hope that there is an epic showdown because this mediocre sequel could do with a boost.Budget: $61million Worldwide Gross: $312.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/thrillers starring Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Giancarlo Esposito, Ki Hong Lee, Dexter Darden, Patricia Clarkson, Aidan Gillen, Barry Pepper, Nathalie Emmanuel and Rosa Salazar. 5/10","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is the first film I've watched that understood the value of 3D; it didn't try and fill the movie with gimmicks of something flying inches from your face, or debris that made you dodge for your life. This film's approach to 3D technology was a form of art, it was delicately applied as to truly immerse the viewer. It lent a sense of gravity to everything in the film, not just the action scenes. Every moment benefited from it. I repeatedly forgot that I was sitting in a 3D movie, which in my opinion is the moment where a technology transcends being a gimmick and gains its rightful place as an art form. It wasn't something to be noticed, it became something felt and experienced.Apart from that; the scenery, cinematography and music were spot-on. The acting was brilliant with a great cast and a good immersion into their relationships. The writing and directing of the movie flowed seamlessly throughout. This brings me to the story itself. I have read the book, and recognise the plethora of changes that were made for the film adaption. My opinion: the movie didn't suffer under it. It made the movie a separate entity that stood side-by-side with the book. I personally find the assumption that a film adaptation of a novel should stick tightly to the plot of the book, quite meaningless. They are two different media and to force a plot from one onto the other becomes detrimental to the story itself. For that reason, I quite enjoyed the differences, it made the movie far more interesting not knowing exactly what to expect. Some scenes were certainly improved upon, although others left me wanting. Ultimately, this was a film that for once got the typical adaptation issue right, in my opinion. They made a movie that wasn't just a graphical representation of the book. They made it a movie. One that told the same story as the book, but in its own way. On all accounts I have to give this film a great thumbs up, however everything together does lead to movie that was slightly too long and that had some scenes that were a bit dull. I would say that people who aren't familiar with the trilogy or the characters might find this film tedious.In my opinion, it was a great movie filled with many moments that neither excited me nor moved me, yet I was captivated. It was what all film adaptations should be. It was like reading a book in graphic form. The immersion was enthralling.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

"6","/10","I imagine this is what Uwe Boll's Fallout 3 movie would be like","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3334573/?ref_=tt_urv","xamtaro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19392148/?ref_=tt_urv","13 October 2015","Remember the unique setting of 2014's MAZE RUNNER? There constant sense of tension and mystery? The twists, the turns and the wholly original production design? Nope. In this sequel, we get rid of the maze, we get rid of the originality. What we are left delves into every single post apocalyptic video game cliché ever created, only with teens gifted with unlimited stamina.Picking up where MAZE RUNNER left off, THE SCORCH TRIALS sees our heroes Thomas, Minho, Theresa, Frypan and Winston seemingly rescued by a group that claims to have their best interests at heart and who oppose WCKD(the evil organisation that trapped the kids in the maze int he first movie). It would have been believable if not for the incredibly evil sounding Irishman leader Mr Janson. Hearing him talk, you know all this ""safe haven for the kids"" is bull. And yes a short while later we find out that the kids have been actually captured by WCKD again and are about to get their brains drained. Something about some fluid in the brain and some mutation virus caused by solar flares. No answers are given of course and in true teenage fashion, the kids rebel against the controlling adults and venture forth into the burnt out desert wasteland city known as ""the scorch"".From then on, the movie starts to resemble Dawn of the Dead: Post Apocalypse, or ""I am Legend: Teenage Edition"". There are zombies in dark tunnels and the kids only have themselves to rely on. Then they run into other humans. Some of them want to sell them, some want to broker a deal, some want their help in fighting back against WCKD. Evil organisation, resistance group, wasteland survivors, zombies, that's it! This is Uwe Boll's Fallout 3. It's like the writer started binge gaming after the success of MAZE RUNNER and just threw in what he liked about the various post apocalyptic games he played.The characters don't change much other than for Thomas, the designated hero. At least he goes from the confused mess he was in the last movie to the confused leader of a confused group in this movie. The rest are calafare at best, accessories to Thomas' journey. At least they go beyond being mere token minorities for the sake of diversity and actually contribute to the story in a crucial way.Amidst the clichés, boring characters and overly shaky cinematography, THE SCORCH TRIALS at least manages to hold on to its constant sense of tension in its second and third acts. Foe after foe comes at our young heroes, each one deadlier than the last. You have some magnificent set pieces showing off the post apocalyptic landscape in its full glory and at no time could I tell the practical sets from the CGI. But after a while, you sort of accept that these youngsters have olympic level stamina and can still look pretty escaping through sewers, trudging through ruins and hiding in holes. Kudos to the writer for continuing the ""maze like"" elements from he first movie, hence justifying the need to leave ""Maze Runner"" in the title. Sure, they aren't in an actual maze, but getting lost in zombie filled abandoned building, chased through a warren of tunnels and dodging stray lightning bolts in the dark, all call back to the dangers of the maze.THE SCORCH TRIALS could have had some brains to it. At points I get the feeling the writer was trying to tie it all down as an analogy for growing up. If the Maze in the previous film represented a youngster's school life, with its rules, unique culture, sheltered learning environment, and first exposure to girls, then the Scorch almost seemed to represent that youngster taking his first steps into an adult world. It has some nice analogies to what regular teenagers face nowadays. Conflicting loyalties, conflicting emotions, a fling with drugs or just a tempting fling. Some would give up and yearn to return to the sheltered life in school, some would become corrupted by their newfound freedom; some would sink into the same vices that have plagued the adults and yet a few would rise to the occasion, becoming better people in the process. This analogy of the scorch to the trials of young adulthood could have been played up a little better. And it was a real pity too.In the end, THE SCORCH TRIALS cannot be forgiven for its reliance on cliché, even if it was in the original book. I cannot say for certain how much it deviated from the source, but I have learned that the book involved psychic powers. So i guess the lack of psychic powers in the movie is quite an improvement. Other than that, it is yet another movie with lost potential and a sequel that is no where as good as its predecessor.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you liked the first one (like i though it was highly enjoyable), that doesn't mean you will like this as well because plot is totally different in this one (and i read that it is totally different from the book) - it is a sequel which expands this universe, and i liked the overall ""world"" which is created here, it is a much darker dystopia future then lets say ""Divirgent"" series has got. Nevertheless i enjoyed ""The Scorch Trials"" for what it is - a very solidly executed entertaining flick which is best seen with some friends in evening. Overall, ""The Scorch Trials"" isn't original by a mile, you can see type cast actors from a mile, and if you know their acting backgrounds, their characters in this movie won't surprise you. This is a well paced, executed and crafted intense action / adventure / thriller / dystopia future flick.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Now they find themselves in the Scorch, a desolate landscape where unimaginable obstacles await. The powerful, mysterious group known as the WCKD seems to be behind it all - and, joining with a group of resistance fighters, the Gladers look for clues behind this sinister organization.So I've just seen ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" and it was pretty average. Theses a lot of things that I liked in the movie and these a lot I didn't like. Dylan O'Brine did a decent job playing the main lead in the movie, as he basically carried this whole movie just like in the first movie. The first 20 minutes of this movie was pretty dam good and I was very engaged on what was happening on screen. The action scenes and the cinematography in the movie was pretty damn good. This is a good looking but at the same time cruel looking movie.Now for the bad: The movie is a bit predictable at times even in it's action scenes and the story itself. The movie dose feel rushed at times with are main characters quickly going to one place to the other just like that, and I think it's something to do with it's pasting as it jumps ahead a lot. I didn't mind some of the CGI when it was used best in the backgrounds of a clear view of the waste land, but the cgi used on the creatures looked extremely fake and completely took me out of the movie. Of course the movie ends on that 'you got to wait for that third one', dick tease that everyone doesn't question why movies have to end like that.Overall Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials was a decent watch. It wasn't that bad as some critics have been pointing it out to be. If you have interest in seeing the film I say ""see it"", if not then ""skip it"".","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I'd almost say Excellent !But the Scorch Trials is a complete waste of time. My gf and I were massively disappointed, after anticipating this movie since seeing part 1. I can only assume that the director ran out of ideas on part 1 (TMR) or that the screenplay writer simply couldn't follow the amazing job of part 1's screenwriter.It seemed that part 1 was made and everything thrown at it. And maybe they didn't think anymore would be made? Therefore when part 2 was commissioned, they went ""OH ... we have no more story ideas or direction ideas""Not really spoilers ahead ... BUT ... If you took out every clichéd chase and every clichéd scene, the movie would be an hour long. Which would be better imo. As I was willing the film to finish because I was bored. And the death of a character that we'd only just met wasn't a teary moment at all. I couldn't care less. Just met them, not bothered. The film should be renamed ""Maze Runner: The Scorch"" as there were no trials. I think the title is misleading.Won't be going to see next installment after this abysmal effort.

It's well made, the pace is good and it's entertaining. However if you look at it as part of the series, it's not that great. There's a big difference between the book's storyline and the movie adaptation and not in a good way. In the book, The Scorch Trials, actually is a trial. In the movie it's more of a renegade story. Because of that the movie doesn't make as much sense as The Maze Runner when it comes to storytelling. In The Maze Runner it all made sense because the whole setup was being explained to you as you were watching and the end was logical as the end of the movie coincided with the end of the first trial. In The Scorch Trials there is none of that. Because the storyline changed so much the logic is gone, they don't do a very good job explaining it and the end is vague at best.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Its ending all but assured i had to see the sequel, and today, i saw it...It's really really good,i loved it, i cant say if it did match my expectations or not because i didn't know almost nothing about the sequel nor i saw much about it, because i chose not to, but i can say i liked the original a bit more.The story picks up right after the first film, and it is generally about explaining the tons of mysteries left to explain in the first film (mostly in that ending), a bit more about WICKED, who are the good ones and the bad ones and what the characters want to do with all that information.Though there are still some things to explain, since in this film its all very vague and rarely mentioned, like what concretely happened to the world, and how the virus started and what really is the virus and the origins of WICKED. But i guess the sequel will explain these things.This film has a lot more action that the first, and the action scenes are very very good, overall distinctive and creative. They add some very cool new things to the story but i think that overall the first film had a more addictive story and plot. But the film is very interesting, and is still addictive, but not on the same level of the first, because there's not a precise plot, nor a highly unique or constructive one, and more they explain less mystery there is, and although there are some great twists and one that is pretty big, the first film had a lot more twists.They could have gone deeper into the backstory of Thomas, and Teresa and the Right Arm, particularly Mary, its a shame they didn't because they only talk vaguely about all this. I guess my biggest complaint about this film is the lack of backstory.The characters all return, they continue to be very cool, particularly Minho, of course Thomas is the biggest star, and there's new characters, quite a few, but Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) has to be the best of them, he steals the show, followed by Brenda (Rosa Salazar). I also wanted to know a bit more about them, but we get to know them well enough.The production values are highly good, a step up from the already good production values of the first film. The sound particularly deserves a lot of praise, its highly creative and the mixing is perfect, but the visual effects particularly the city also deserve praise. The cinematography is great. The score is very good, nothing new, but very good.The film is highly entertaining, has some very cool action scenes, has a scale much bigger than the first film, is just very good. But i don't think it is as addictive as the first, overall i think the first film is just a bit more unique. But they are almost on the same level so in the end its arguable which one is the best. Now, after another great ending, lets bring the third installment. Cant wait.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

After everything they endured in the Maze, Thomas, Minho(Ki Hong Lee), Teresa(Kaya Scodelario), Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster) & Frypan(Dexter Darden) get rescued from the organization known as WCKD. The man who rescues them from WCKD introduces himself as Jansen(Aidan Gillen). Jansen says he's here to help. However, Thomas suspects there's more to him than meets the eye. Thomas & his friends realize that Jansen & company are not who they say they are. Thomas uncovers a sinister future for him & the rest of the Gladers. The Gladers successfully escape but, now they face the insurmountable hurdles of the Scorch. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a good movie. However, I liked The Maze Runner(2014) better. The 2014 original is more thrilling, suspenseful & had more heart. This film is more about the chase sequences & action set pieces. There is some suspense in the film but, nothing that will keep you guessing right till the end, like in the original. I missed memorable characters like, Chuck & Gally from the first installment. Most of the new characters in The Scorch Trials don't leave any lasting impression. The Scorch Trials does surpass The Maze Runner(2014) in one aspect. I found the monsters in this movie more intimidating than the Grievers from the original. The special effects of the movie are great. The 3D is nothing special & seems more like an excuse to make extra money. Dylan O'Brien is superb as Thomas. Ki Hong Lee is awesome as Minho. Kaya Scodelario is brilliant as Teresa. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is amazing as Newt. Dexter Darden is effective as Frypan. Alexander Flores is great as Winston. Jacob Lofland is impressive as Aris Jones. Alan Tudyk is outstanding in his cameo as Blondie. The characters that needed to be more fleshed out are Brenda(Rosa Salazar), Jorge(Giancarlo Esposito), Ava Paige(Patricia Clarkson) & Jansen. However, Rosa Salazar, Giancarlo Esposito, Patricia Clarkson & Aidan Gillen do a fantastic job with the limited screen time they're given. I hope they're given more screen time in the final film. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a must watch for fans of the books & the first film.

Parts of the movie actually lived up to it, but only in small segments of visual stunning and little developments in the story that we were hoping for. I find the weaknesses of the movie were very partially around the casting, but more so around the conversations and story-telling of the writers for this movie.I gave it a 6, because despite how horrendous the writing was, the rest of the movie was quite well directed and still enjoyable to watch. It was almost enough to ignore the main issues with the movie.I'm quite certain there was a big meeting with the upper management of this film after seeing the turnout upon release, and they will address all these issues properly for the third installment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There's people out there who hate the filmmakers/writers of this, because they soiled on the book and made it something they didn't want to see. Can't comment on that only on how the movie felt.And it felt kinda freeing (no pun intended) to some regard. Especially after leaving the one location plot from the first movie. A lot of new characters get introduced and some nice actors join in on the act. Whether you like it or not will depend on if you know where this is going. It's going actually pretty dark and I didn't expect to see those ""creatures"" to be honest. The effects are more than decent and the movie has a nice pace to it (15 minutes of outtakes was a bit excessive though, on the disc, but you can tell they had fun making the movie)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But the extensive use of shaky cam rendered what would have been enjoyable action scenes almost unwatchable. I don't know why film makers these days have latched on to this fad. I don't get motion sick. Mostly I find the constant shaking just down right annoying. You get shots of ground or wall or the back of someone's head, instead of an action scene that is comprehensible where the audience can see what is taking place. I realize the intent is to give a sense of realism, but let's face it; we don't see the world shake and move like this when we ourselves run around. I would say somewhere around 75% of the action was done in shaky cam. On top of that, some of the scenes where the characters are just sitting around chatting is also done in shaky cam. Next time, advertise the movie as a found footage movie, so I at least know to avoid it. Wes Bell is going on my list with Paul Greenglass as directors whose movies to avoid.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

I don't get it, Brenda is a main character late on but doesn't even show up in IMDb's expanded cast list, what the heck kind of oversight is this and no one tries to correct it?!I also find it not believable that the teens have never encountered zombies, how so, and how in the world do they not refer to them as zombies? If that term is going to magically drop out of the terminology of the world that they might as well be speaking some other language, or I expect it to be revealed that this is taking place on an alternate Earth.The zombies were also too fake in my view, acted too cliché. It was also nonsensical to me how they were ""full term"" in this sewer system and yet full term was simply some nonsensical existence as... root people, so to speak.Also, Brenda... was she supposed to represent somehow the LGBT crowd, like to appease that minority part of the culture, because she looked so boyish and like a so called ""dike"". I don't understand why the director used her for a romance scene because she is not an attractive girl and her star rating on IMDb shows that. Why didn't they use someone attractive, that would have been compelling. The same thing with ""Theresa"", why use a drab plain looking girl to be the romantic attraction for the lead guy? Stupid stupid choice, they should have at least made her some sorta person with a make-up compulsion so that she looked pretty throughout the movie due to some OCD make-up habit, like hiding on her self a make up kit all the time or even ""up there"" if you know what I mean.Also there was something I found disturbing in the movie, that being Newt's comment that they could ""assume"" not everyone in their group was immune to being a zombie because one guy got infected. That word ""assume"" is wrong in the context, assume means just that, it has nothing to do with WHAT IS EVIDENT, it's a cliché that people with narcissistic personality disorder use and to the hurt of the world because it confuses logical thinking. You should never assume anything, and this movie in a way makes things worse for the world culture because not only is assuming being put in a good light but it's being confused with a comment that makes it out to be something based on what is evident!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It occurred to me how the universe wanted him to mould a situation into a story. He spun a great tale, which promised a franchise then and there. So I went with great expectations to watch this one. The fact that Wes Ball was going to direct this again seemed great too. When the movie gallops into the 'what happens next' territory I was amazed how brilliantly it ran. There wasn't a moment spared for breathing. It just ran and ran, justifying its name. Half way through, and the adventure wasn't stopping. I really liked how the director kept everyone on their feet. I liked how James Dashner had thought this through. How he arranged the bricks to build something beautiful. However, it all seemed pretty predictable. If you take some steps back and really look at it, the story is a classic zombie tale, however doesn't linger in that territory, which is good. There are situations built up deliberately to up the thrill level. Horror has been scooched in the plot to make it look rad. There are a lot of characters in the movie that keep popping up and then are suddenly put down in order to make the flick less lengthy. Then again Wes Ball fails at it terribly. Which takes us to its editing, which isn't that great after the editing. The final bits and the epilogue of the movie are really predictable and reek of mediocrity. You almost see what's coming, and who is going to say what. Given the number of characters the tale keeps on adding Dashner deserves a TV series to do him justice. However, the movie is still good and will make you want to know more just like any other franchise. A definite watch.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Apart from that, there's a lot of action in the film with a few nice scary scenes, but as mentioned by others not a lot of plot, and what little plot there is can be quite rushed and often contains the typical clichés of this genre. It's not really groundbreaking material. Also as often happens the tense action scenes seemed too contrived and conveniently timed with the heroes always just escaping in the nick of time. It felt a bit repetitive at times. Going back to the rushed plot, at the end of the film I still felt like I wasn't sure exactly what was going on and I also felt like I wasn't rooting for the main hero but rather the people who were supposed to be evil, I guess that makes me evil haha. Still, there were some enjoyable scenes as well as memorable characters, and overall I enjoyed the film. I especially liked Brenda and Jorge as they weren't your typical black-and-white characters but slightly more realistic ones with positive and negative traits and they generally made the scenes they were in quite fun to watch. The two hours I spent watching the film went by quite fast and if you're just looking for light entertainment I recommend it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It had a nice mystery and felt like a refreshing change from most of these YA dystopian future movies, which all kind of bleed together after awhile with their chosen one (usually a girl) and their tacked-on romance (usually a love triangle with the chosen one torn between a boring guy and a heartthrob). This second movie is a bit of a step down from the first one but still better than average for the genre. The biggest fault with this one is that it lacks the intriguing hook of the first film, instead relying on a series of chase scenes and action set pieces to keep viewers interested. The characters are chased by men with guns, zombies, lightning storms, more zombies, more men with guns, yet more zombies, etc. If the characters stop for more than a few minutes, you can rest assured they will soon be chased by something.What the movie is lacking in story, however, it at least partially makes up for with its strong cast. The returning actors from the first movie are still enjoyable to watch here, particularly Dylan O'Brien. It doesn't take a psychic to see he's got a big future ahead of him. Reliable pros Giancarlo Esposito and Aidan Gillen join the cast in this one; both are great. Rosa Salazar is also a nice addition to the cast. It's obviously a movie that's best viewed as part of a series. It doesn't have a beginning or an end, which is irritating but expected as the middle parts of these YA movie series tend to be like that. But at least this one is entertaining. The chase scenes, while repetitive, are exciting and the characters are interesting. Can't wait for the last in the series. I hope it's as good as the first one but I am keeping my expectations low.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The answer is lose the maze, keep the running, drop any trace of the social tension, fill the rest with Game of Thrones cast members and add zombies because why not? So this film is the sequel to last year's YA adaptation and pulls the exact same trick. Containing no mazes but plenty of running. The film takes the originals surviving characters and drops them into the middle of an entirely different type of movie, this one a desert- set zombie chase. At least - and contrary to its fellow dystopian teenage sci-fie sagas - this film sustains a bit of curiosity by leaving its characters and its audience completely in the dark about why anything is happening and what any of it could possibly mean. The Scorch Trials offers ultimately no character development whatsoever and only inch of plot advancement. It's mostly just moving a group of motivated characters from one place to another without giving much clue where the whole thing is headed. This time the group awakens a swarm of vicious zombies - the film calls them ""Cranks"" - though they're in no way different from any other zombie hordes that you have shuffled across screens over the past decade. However, the action scenes are urgent and masterfully paced. Despite an over reliance on shaky-cam and quick cuts, director Wes Ball stages a number of effective sequences. Particularly a zombie pursuit up through a collapsed skyscraper that relies more on ace production design than CGI to build believability. He also makes time for a few scenes that are so cheekily weird they may as well come from another film. Cinematically, director attempts to sustain engagement by providing each successive setting with a different combination of threats of distinctive stylistic treatment, borrowing from drama, thriller and horror genres. While the technique adds visual diversity. A significant portion of the film is devoted to filling in the narrative gaps essential to maintaining the veil of mystery that characterise The Maze Runner and the Glader's ignorance surrounding their incarceration. Ironically, as more facts emerge, they tend to undermine the storyline rather than reinforce it. When part of a larger narrative the film doesn't make much sense served by an unfocused script. Action is one thing, but the film also needs a better-developed-sense of mystery as well as a deeper exploration of character relationships. The Scorch Trials wanders between YA clichés, there's a resistance, but it's not clear what they're resisting and a zombie movie with the obligatory a-zombie-bit-our-friend scene. Finally, all of that would have been acceptable if the characters were given motivation beyond ""we need to go there"" and ""I need to save her"". Just enough to make you wish they'd just go back into the damn maze already. Overall when the dust settles The Scorch Trials is, as we're repeatedly told of WCKD, ""good"" - just not as god as you want it to be.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I won't be seeing the third as this has nothing to do with the franchise I liked.I understand that the scorch trials book is a good read but would not have adapted to a good movie, but to turn a science experiment into resident evil ruined the whole point of the books, that the kids depended on one another, And never had a clue what was going on.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"9","/10","So why is this movie so underrated?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3360484/?ref_=tt_urv","rosefors","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35472335/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2015","This is my first review ever on IMDb after being a daily visitor for some 10 years, and the reason being that this movie is a perfect example of how polarized the scoring and the reviews of movies can be on IMDb.Contrary to many of the critics who discrete this movie, I have not read the books, yet. Therefore I had no higher expectations over its sequel which I thought was quite decent, but not much more than that. And now after watching it I find it being heavily underrated and unfairly criticized so its hard to make sense of it all.Looking at the competition of zombie flicks, ""28 days later"" that is brilliant in some ways but quite frankly utterly unbelievable and mad in many other has a substantially higher scoring. An even better example is ""World War Z"", an utterly stupid movie that somehow still scores noticeably higher than the Maze runner sequel. It's a bit shameful really considering that Brad Pitt has almost consistently been part of some of the best movies ever produced, like ""Moneyball"". Therefore when considering that the name of one of the most overrated movies ever is ""Fury"", this might actually give an indication on what is going on here.But setting that a side for a bit I must say that I really liked this movie. Putting this in the same category of sci-fi / adventure / game-challenge as the ""Hunger Games"" movies as well as the two ""Divergent/Insurgent"" movies, I actually might think this is the best one of them all. I do admit that both the story and the artistry and choreography of the Hunger Games movies are on another level, but the Scorch Trials is much easier digested and in many ways appeal a somewhat more mature audience. The scenes are fast paced, the cutting is very good, the sound effects are excellent! and its not over bloated with cgi. The action scenes are actually rather believable, delivering just the right amount without tiring you down and things move about in accordance with physics and gravity most of the time. The sound effects are very finely tuned and with a 5.1 DTS track delivers some freakishly believable chopper hovering and bullet ricochets and has also some very nicely adjusted low level frequency effects delivering just the right amount of rumble to the kicker for those that have one and a sound system to match. Best of all is that you don't need to put up with all the Lawrence grunting and wining and the stupid laughter of Caesar Flickerman. No matter what he does he will never bee as super green as Ruby Rhod. But I do miss Philip Seymour Hoffman though. Hmm..Anyway, there are some scenes in this movie that I especially liked. When Thomas and the rest of the Gladers climbed down through the atrium of a huge deserted blacked-out shopping mall, it caught the atmosphere ""of the unknown"" very nicely and on par with the scene where Robert runs after Sam into a building in ""I am legend"" in terms of nail biting. But the thing that got me going is how brilliant the imagery and the detailing was and I'm a bit curious how the graphics were done. Another scene that really caught me was the hallucination scene with some really nice in/out focus, light effects accompanied with a Gabriel&Dresden version of a classic progressive tune (As the Rush Comes) remixed and played frequently by both Tiesto and Armin Van Buuren when it was a huge hit in the middle of the last decade.So, if you want to watch something not too complicated, like nice cut scenes and if you liked ""Pacific Rim"" type of movies with at least some well thought of effects, but never really adopted to ""Battleship"", ""Battle for LA"" or any other brain dead Michael-bay-explosion-oriented CGI-flicks, this might actually be a movie worth watching.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

It was a refreshing take on the dystopian YA topic. I truly wondered why these kids were being tested and how they got there. I did not like the second movie. It spent 120 minutes taking us along some adventures, which ended up with nothing being solved or learned. I know just as much as I did in the first movie and wasted 4 hours getting there. This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. Book readers will tell you this is grossly different than the book, but I haven't read it yet. What was the point of the title? Why are these kids so important? And really, what is Wicked's end game? Why does Thomas matter as much as he does?The whole narrative has crapped out.

The first movie worked only through the half way of the movie, but Scorch Trials keep you awake thru hole movie. Not even the end of the movie fails you. It just keep you to stay interest up what is going to happen in third movie. Biggest problem is that the movie serves on bits from the background story. Sometimes the whole story seems not to have any clear target and teenagers just feels to wonder around without any clear destination. That bites a little of movies credibility. Despite that The Scorch Trials is way more solid movie than the first one. Alien robots has now replaced with zombies. You only feel need more to know more about what has happened in past and how humans become to zombies, but story won't tell you that. I haven't read the book trilogy and I don't know if the third story opens that more. Certainly you do want to know some more and that could make it more interesting.3D seems to be needless in movie. There is only one scene that works well in 3D. Most of the movie just feels that there is no 3D involved. Scene inside of falling skyscraper looks great and works well with 3D. Rest of the movie doesn't. If director can't abuse to use 3D it seems to be pointless to use. Especially most of the movie happens at night and dark places. Usage of 3D makes it even more darker and makes it harder to follow the story.After all The Scorch Trials is quite eligible dystopia. It keeps enough your interest to wait what is going to come. It isn't any biggest movie in the history, but fair popcorn movie anyway.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

While I can understand and appreciate some changes in movies adaptations, I can't understand how the book author could allow and say he agreed with what the movie made of it. All that made the book great is lost in the movie and I could barely watch the action non-sense going on till the end of it. Even the title doesn't make sense anymore as in the movie going through the scorch is not a trial at all and that was the most disappointing at all, along with it being so much ""softer"", less mysterious, cryptic and cruel than the books. For once, I really loved all the casting, but the plot was completely ruined.

As we all know, the Maze Runner film has a very similar style of teen fictions as other such movies as The Hunger Games and the Divergent series, so this film will follow in that type and sense of film. Nothing really too unexpected though. However this movie has maybe the most intense of the teen fiction movies, offering up some actually scary parts of the movie that has enjoyable to watch. The visual aspect of this film is very well done and offers all the thrills needed to keep you engaged with the film. The whole movie is basically a chase and then hiding. In that sense it kind of reminded me of the amazing movie Mad Max that came out this year except most everything was on foot and not in apocalypse vehicles. One thing that I noticed is that this movie feels like a completely different movie from the first movie in the series. I mean that in the sense that the Hunger Games and Divergent both seem to follow each other very easily. They lead each other to the next film and have the same type of feel between the films. This movie did not have the feeling. It will feel to you as a completely different movie; a stand alone film. This film also will reveal some things about why things are the way they are but in a frustrating sense. They start to answer a question and then they move away from it. The big reveal seems kind of cliché to me but then again it is teen fiction so what are you going to do. Overall though, this movie was entertaining to watch but is not without its flaws. It is a little over two hrs long so keep that in mind. **Another side note, I have been told and read about that this movie is very different than the book so keep that in mind. The author and director have said that the third movie is going to be much more true to the book.Average Man Score: 6/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Virtually no character development or any reason to even care about the majority of the characters .all the best parts from the book where removed like the metal liquid taking off heads and the aliens at the end.

I didn't plan on seeing it in theaters, but did anyways. It wasn't as good as the Maze Runner, but it was still solid. The characters could have used some work, and although the action didn't leave a heck of a lot of room for conversation, the runtime could have been extended to allow for such scenes. Some characters I didn't even remember, or was never introduced to in the first place. Nevertheless, there was enough to keep you interested in them. The Scorch Trials, of course, continues where the Maze Runner ended off. It follows a similar pattern to the first movie, where it reveals a little and ends still without a full explanation and a cliffhanger. This one was a little more blatant about the fact that the series would continue, and that the next movie would be similar to this one. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to it. The replacement Grievers, called Cranks, were interesting enough. Compared to most creatures of their type nowadays they were different. Their design was unique and although the general rules surrounding them weren't really altered, they still created good, entertaining action. Overall, the Scorch Trials is far from amazing, and not as good as its predecessor, but once again shows confidence in its ability to continue as a series. Typically a sequel to a movie like the Maze Runner means that they will continue either way, but nonetheless it's good to see yet another display of confidence. If you liked the Maze Runner, then chances are you'll enjoy the Scorch Trials. It's epic, interesting, and sets up to make a solid book-based trilogy, which is rare these days. It's a sequel that succeeds, even if it's only by a bit. If you liked Maze Runner, or are interested, then I suggest checking it out.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This was a difficult watch as the movie is well done with its pace, visuals, & likable cast; however, it deviated on a large scale in its screenplay by TS Nowlin. The premise in the novel, in my opinion, made allot more sense and it was disappointing when it was not translated. I understand filmmakers sometimes need to adjust original material to make it more appealing to the masses but in this case it was a frustrating second instalment for those fans of the Maze Runner trilogy.Now, despite being one of the many individuals that was displeased with this deviation, I still enjoyed the movie Wes Ball put together. It does its job by giving it's audience more action than the first & appropriately sets up for the conclusion in Death Cure. I am sure if Dashner had have been put on as an executive producer on this film, I think we would have seen some material more true to the novel. This did not happen but I don't believe this film merits a 1/10 rating. If you enjoyed Maze Runner (2014), you'll find this second instalment enjoyable as well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

New writer T.S Nowlin has changed the original source materials into a formulaic young adult action adventure with some flaws and illogical competency of the villains but the tone has overall turned into much darker, more happening compared to the first one and less focused on unnecessary romance. The pacing of the film is slightly over rushed due to expansion of bigger field, causing a fair development of new locations and proper introduction of the new characters. However, cinematography of the film looks appealing thanks to angles of shooting, strong scores, intense action sequences, good CGIs on the Cranks, visually tremendous of the sets and firm performance from the young casts. Though with a lot of questions left behind and predictable twisted ending, the sequel seems worth to be anticipated only if it's not separated into two parts.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

They simply need interesting (and believable) characters, a novel concept, and of course, fun, energetic action scenes that provide a purely escapist two-hour long symphony of thrills and spills. A plot, while appreciated, should be kept to the point where it does not interfere with comprehension or enjoyment. The Scorch Trials, sadly, cannot make its characters interesting. They may all have elusive backstories, but they inspire little sympathy (or even interest) with their bland, emotionless performances. The film's concept feels like a mixture of Mad Max and a poor zombie movie. Its action scenes are shaky, dizzying, and often unsatisfying, save an incredible scene involving a window (no spoilers!). The plot is ludicrous and dry, providing little satisfaction or even the slightest clue to the overhanging mystery. If anything, the film spews out more frustratingly elusive questions than it does answers. Despite this, it is surprisingly watchable.The film retains its predecessor's constant paranoia. It opens as the Gladers are brought to a facility meant to keep them safe. In fact, this facility is simply another web of lies and false security, so the Gladers escape out of the facility and into the Scorch, a vast, stormy desert populated by zombies. Unlike the previous film, The Scorch Trials doesn't rely on slow dialogue and the occasional fast paced running scene. Rather, the dialogue is kept to a minimum (except for the never-ending chorus of ""Let's go!"", ""We gotta move!"", and ""Hurry!"") being replaced by, well, running. They run, and run, and run, but this didn't even have to be a bad thing. If the camera-work was less shaky and incoherent, the action scenes would have been spectacular.Despite my inability to find much good in this movie, I can't bring myself to denounce it as absolute junk. It is intense enough, probably because of the zombies that often announce their presence by approaching the Gladers in the quietest way possible, before suddenly appearing and giving chase, moaning all the way. Zombie movies are often quite fun, and this film is no exception. And although I can't say much for this film when it comes to character and emotion, there was one scene that was rather moving, despite the fact that a secondary character was the main subject. And Jorge. Jorge was pretty good.This movie is pretty bad. It rips off many other films as it strives to make sense of its frustrating plot, including The Hunger Games (sly love triangle), Mad Max (post-apocalyptic desert wasteland), Dawn of the Dead (zombies in the mall) and even Fast and Furious (random misogynistic party). But I still enjoyed it. I didn't care one jot about the characters, or the plot, or even what was going to happen next, but the film still offered some solid entertainment, which I readily accepted. That being said, when the third film hits theatres, I don't think I'll be lining up to see it.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Bunch of crazies want to eat us for breakfast, by the looks of it.""Director Wes Ball is back for this second installment of novelist James Dashner's The Maze Runner trilogy. This author's books have been a success with young adults, and the first adaptation by Ball was received well by most critics. I had a very different experience from them however since I found the first film a much weaker entry to the already overexposed genre of YA novel adaptations. From the moment we were introduced to Dylan O'Brien's Thomas I couldn't ignore the fact that he was simply a male version of Katniss from The Hunger Games or Tris from the Divergent series. An outsider who has trouble fitting in to an established group but eventually becomes a leader thanks to his unique personality traits. We get it, being different isn't necessarily a bad thing. We've all went through an identity crisis as teens and I guess that is why the premise is so appealing. The refreshing difference that this YA adaptation has with the others is that it avoids the romantic elements that seem to emerge from all these films. This is a more action packed film, but at the same time it suffers from a lack of character development. The story has several flaws and it's hard to follow at times considering I honestly couldn't remember much of what had happened in the first film. All I could remember was that a group of kids managed to escape from the maze only to discover that the world around them had changed. And this second film picks up from there as we follow the young survivors through this dystopian world being chased by an organization who believes that they are the key to saving humanity. The kids themselves don't understand what is going on and they have to discover it along the way without knowing who they can trust. And that cluelessness is transferred to the audience while we get some answers along the way. The problem is I'm afraid that by the time the third film comes out we will have forgotten much of what was going on and enter the movie scratching our heads like I did this one. All we will remember are some of the action sequences that took place, but I still have no clue why these characters were even put in the maze in the first place (not sure if they already answered it in the first film or it remains an enigma to be solved in the third). It may be necessary to revisit the franchise by the time the final film is released because the plot was a bit convoluted and many questions remained unanswered. I don't want to be too critical of this film because I did think it was an improvement over the first one. I found it a better sequel than Insurgent was despite sharing some of the same flaws. The film does seem to distance itself from what it did in the first film becoming more of an action adventure film than a YA adaptation (although one could argue that it seems to be heading towards a very similar direction as the latest Hunger Games sequel). The action scenes do feel very familiar to other films and there is especially one moment where Jurassic Park: The Lost World will come to everyone's mind. It also feels very much like an episode from The Walking Dead with the introduction of some zombie like beings known as cranks. There is a decent twist during the climactic scene, but by the time we get to it we've been overexposed to the convoluted action scenes (and not in a good Mad Max Fury Road kind of way). The pacing of this film is very much an issue and if they'd edited out at least some 20 minutes of the film it could've been much more engaging.The cast is pretty solid and Dylan O'Brien turns in a charismatic lead performance, but the issue here is that these characters aren't developed at all and the action scenes seem to take center stage. There is no time to dwell on the characters because we are headed into new action sets every five minutes while new questions emerge. Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, and Alexander Flores are all back as the surviving members of the maze. Neither of them have much to do in this film, especially Scodelario who doesn't seem to have any personality whatsoever. There are several new characters as well. Jacob Lofland joins the runaway kids as Aris, another survivor from a different maze. The kids finds shelter for a short chunk of the film with a group of survivalists led by Jorge (Giancaro Esposito who you will easily recognize for his role as Gus in Breaking Bad) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar). Patricia Clarkson is back once again as the leader of the WCKD organization that is after the kids, and in this sequel we are introduced to her right hand man, Janson (Aidan Gillen from Game of Thrones). The new additions elevated the film as I found these new characters much more appealing than the previous returnees. Esposito being my favorite addition, and he should be involved in more movies because he's such a talented actor. Despite the new additions I did find the action scenes a bit tiresome. There is one scene where Thomas states he's tired of running, and it perfectly summed up how I was feeling. The open endings are also a problem with this franchise as you don't get any closure and are forced to wait for the next film to find answers. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

It is more diverse in terms of locations: we finally get to see on a practical level what the Flare virus caused to the world, changing humanity forever. Action sequences are well directed, the movie has plenty of tense and dynamic moments, where the characters are in real danger. The design of the infected is good; the zombies are made entirely in CGI and it is noticeable, however the effects are well made and the digital monstrosities blend pretty well in a live action context. The plot is fast paced and it does not lose in pointless interactions or details, fixing the issue that the first entry had. This is what I am expecting from a post-apocalyptic film: a straightforward story, plenty of violence and shootouts, while seeing a destroyed and decayed society.The narrative universe expands by introducing some new characters that will become part of the group of teenagers, escaping from the evil claws of WICKED. The cast has pretty impressive names on it, such as Giancarlo Esposito and Rosa Salazar. Unfortunately Dylan O' Brien keeps being very mediocre, but this is the choice of the casting director and this is who we need to see until the very last chapter. Anyway, ""The Scorch Trials'' is a solid adventure, where the environment and the characters keep growing, developing pretty well the potential of this franchise. For this reason I believe that this flick deserves 7 stars out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's the same characters basically in a whole different movie. I know it's very common for movies to change a few things when adapting a book, but this is a whole new level. 80% of the movie is completely different to the book, so it's a 5/10 as an adaptation.If you can ignore that, it's fine and worth watching.

If so, you probably walked through a series of dark rooms and narrow passageways, while noticing distinct themes in different areas of the house. A variety of scary creatures jumped out at you or reached for you. The timing of these attacks probably felt as random as the nebulous identities, wardrobe choices and make-up schemes of your attackers. You knew, of course, that none of this was real, but it was just unsettling enough to be fun. Eventually, you got to the end of this bit of entertainment and walked back out into the real world. You likely soon forgot most of the details of that haunted house, mainly because you probably hadn't experienced anything really new, and none of it had a lasting effect on your life. Watching ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" (PG-13, 2:11) is a lot like experiencing that haunted house.This film is the sequel to 2013's ""The Maze Runner"" and is the second adaptation of James Dashner's initial ""Maze Runner"" trilogy (which has since added a prequel and is about to add another). The story is even more divergent (pun intended) from its source material than the previous movie was, this time preserving not much more than the mythology, main characters and the most important of plot points.The action picks up right where it left off at the end of the first film, with Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the remaining Gladers, Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa Agnes (Kaya Scodelario), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores), taken by those who rescued them to a large facility where there's food and fresh clothes. These teens find out that theirs was not the only maze and they become friends with fellow survivor Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland), who suspects that there's more to their new home than meets the eye. The facility's manager, Mr. Janson (Aiden Gillen), assures the Gladers that they're safe now and will soon be taken to a more permanent and more comfortable home. Meanwhile, their freedom is restricted and security is tight. Every day, Janson calls out a list of names and those young people head for their new home. Aris suspects that those who are called never really leave the facility, suffering a fate that is less than comfortable. Soon, Thomas is convinced too.The Gladers, now with Thomas clearly accepted as the group's leader, decide to venture out on their own into what's called ""The Scorch"", a vast wasteland where cities once stood. The earth was decimated by a solar flare and, now, what's left of humanity is struggling to survive and avoid getting a brain-altering disease called the Flare, which turns people into zombie-like creatures who roam freely and prey upon the innocent. (Think ""World War Z"" meets ""Mad Max"".) Thomas and company walk across a vast stretch of desert in search of a rebel group known as the Right Arm and their rumored safe haven in the distant mountains. On the journey, they have to elude Janson and his cohorts who believe that Thomas and his friends hold the key to curing the Flare within their bodies and want to bring them back to his prison-like complex. Along the way, the Gladers meet potential allies like maze survivors Harriet and Sonya (Nathalie Emmanuel and Katherine McNamara), underground community leaders Brenda and Jorge (Rosa Salazar and Giancarlo Esposito), and rebels Mary and Vince (Lili Taylor and Barry Pepper), but also have to contend with disagreements, treachery, injury and death within their own ranks.""The Maze Runner"" got a ""B-"", my barest of recommendations, with a fear that this saga could go off the rails with its next installment. It has. This story has all the narrative cohesiveness of a haunted house and all the significance of a Sunday morning cartoon. Notwithstanding a few nifty action sequences, this film is merely a collection of loosely-related scenes that accomplish little more than keeping the screen bright. Each of the ""Divergent"", ""Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight Saga"" movies stand on their own. ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" fails to do that, or even to prove to be a decent piece of entertainment. ""C-""","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

After all, probably not. Maze Runner 2 starts out very interesting and even exciting. The heroes find themselves in different situations. Starting with a zombie attack and wandering through the desert. Overall, the best thing about this movie is the action. It's really very good. During the first half of the film, it seemed to me that it was one of the best films of the year but the second half turned out to be boring and tedious and overall spoils the experience. But new interesting ideas have appeared. For example, zombies and a certain horror atmosphere.To sum it up, I don't even know what to say. On the one hand, the film is very cheerful at first, and captures the viewer's attention, and makes a very good impression. The action oozes from the screen and the runners continue to run, but towards the end, the narrative becomes very sluggish, and you can't wait for the movie to be over.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And to be honest, it's probably more about the way it's filmed than the content that made me feel that way.Once again, it has that good, but not outstanding cast, and by that I mean that nobody steals the limelight. The direction takes our heroes where they need to go in a way that is not difficult to follow, which allows the viewer to enjoy it, without overthinking every thing that is happening.It's the type of film you can watch and play games on your phone at the same time, especially if you've seen it at least once, although my Nephews do this through everything.I do think that I have already kind of guessed the main big ending for the third film though, but I'm looking forward to finding out if I'm right, which is all part of the fun of these films isn't it? The guessing game. Who's going to betray who? How will they win? Do they need to win? And are they running from the wrong people? Are they running at all? I hope to have all the answers to these questions in film three, but worry that it will be rushed. I think that I may be biased by my nephew who turned his nose up when I said what we were going to watch and I hope that he is wrong.706.79/1000.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The setup in the opening hour and a half is great - it reintroduces the characters well and made me intrigued in the mystery of the film. Unfortunately there are just too many repetitive scenes towards the middle of the film, and it slows the pacing down a whole lot. What saves this from a negative score in my opinion, however, are the visuals, which are surprisingly great and increase the grandeur of the film. There are some great supporting performances from Alan Tudyk, Giancarlo Esposito and Patricia Clarkson, who are clearly all having fun in their roles, and overall, despite the story not being the best, I did enjoy this, and if you liked the original then you'll probably like this one too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nevertheless I admired Wes Ball's direction and even though I wasn't in anyway anticipating this film, I really didn't mind going to see it since I had faith in Ball. Well the result is that I have even more faith in Ball, but story-wise those last ten minutes got extended to a full feature.Is there something that actually makes 100% sense here? I really don't think so. The story is so lackluster and the characters are all over the place. There isn't one event or one action that feels genuine and not artificial. Everything is so coincidental and messy. It is really bothering. This story has no idea what it wants to do or what it is about. The scenes are disjointed and bad editing didn't help this film's case. Moreover the characters simply cannot be figured out, they only speak and act through clichés that aren't even coherent to each one, they are so messy.Fortunately Wes Ball proves he has an amazing visual talent and gets us through this journey almost pleasantly, even though the script is plainly rubbish. In the hands of a lesser director this could have really been a disaster. But the director just has a sharp eye for action and tension and stages one after another, scenes that are interesting to watch, that have gravity to them and build tension. He knows how to combine CGI and practical, even though a slightly higher budget could have helped him a lot. He also knows how to use his actors to his advantage and he makes everything he can out of Dylan O'Brain's charisma and Giancarlo Esposito's charm. Moreover, a very sensible score elevates a lot of what goes on.What we end up with is a really impressive directorial effort that is trying to salvage a lackluster story, with a script that doesn't know its characters and can't make them feel genuine or speak like human beings.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

After a good 100 minutes of finely staged set-pieces and well constructed intrigue and mystery, we were given some clunky exposition to explain what the whole story had been about in the most melodramatic and abrupt way possible in order to set-up a sequel. And this sequel, for all intents and purposes, may as well be from a different genre and film series altogether. It is so bizarrely different to its predecessor that it takes a while to reacquaint yourself with the characters and the convoluted situation the find themselves in (thanks largely to Part 1's ridiculous explanation for the maze). It's all to do with *groan* a virus that turns people into mutant zombie thingys.However, once 'The Scorch Trials' gets moving it proves itself to be just as relentlessly enjoyable as the original, sans awful ending, injecting a high-energy enthusiasm into its inventive action sequences which sees it through some problems, of which there are plenty. Part 2 is extremely weak on characterisations, relying on an audience's knowledge of the characters from a previous outing to fill in the blanks, but there wasn't much to the fresh faced cast the first time around anyway, beyond some basic personality traits and physical attributes. And then there's the plot, or lack thereof. This is essentially just one long chase across a desert with some occasional pit-stops made to help save the SFX and stunt teams some money. But the set-pieces are so well executed that whenever a plot threatens to rear its troublesome head you're almost relieved to see it smacked right back down in its place beneath all the running, jumping and escaping. This is not a franchise that does very well with plot. It does, however, do action rather well.In the seemingly endless onslaught of YA adaptations for the big screen, this is above average for the genre and stands as a fairly solid romp that chucks in just about every post-apocalyptic cliché there is, but does so with great enthusiasm and energy. It's hard to dislike a film that efficiently hits its targets, even if they are hit at extremely close range. And this time, the ending isn't abysmal.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The moment I stepped into the theater, I had some thoughts of what was to happen following from escaping the ever-changing, intricate maze and dodging the Grievers that inhabit it. Sadly for Thomas and his fellow Gladers, their efforts in leaving the maze behind were just the beginning when they are finally brought out into the open, revealing a ravaged wasteland that was once hospitable. While evading Cranks (zombie-like creatures affected by the outside world's solar flares), they must venture out to this metaphorically wider maze to find any other rebels out there fighting for the same cause to put an end to W.C.K.D.'s nefarious plans.With this game of ""cat-and-mouse"" being played nearly throughout this interesting sequel, it started to remind me of (most notably) George Orwell's novel 1984 and the 2008 techno-thriller movie, Eagle Eye. Because like the latter, The Scorch Trials had this whole theme of paranoia, deception, and loyalties being tested mixed together. Whereas the main characters go through any means necessary to evade their pursuer, but strike back when given the right chance. Actor Dylan O'Brien is certainly no Shia LaBeouf, but his character Thomas is quick to act when he and his group's lives are on the line. Which I must say kind of suits the scenarios the Gladers must face when trying to elude the evil organization looking for them. With the return of Thomas Sangster's Newt, Ki Hong Lee's Minho, and Kaya Scodelario's Teresa, they all proved their part as individuals who can hold their own among the Gladers. It gives off this cohesive element of a nonconformist persona among them. Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad, Revolution) as rebel leader Jorgè was certainly a change of pace compared to his TV characters he's known well for, but his inclusion into this film series proved to be notable for his style of acting, especially since he's no stranger to post-apocalyptic scenarios.As a whole of over two hours ten minutes running time, the cast delivered great performances and the action sequences were such a nail-biter that you'll miss the best part if you turn your attention away for only a moment. Story and concept-wise, it felt like a watered-down, bloodless version of a Resident Evil movie for the young adult genre, which I think a junior high student could easily think up. Nevertheless, all my attention and adrenaline was geared towards the most complex action scenes that proved to be no easy feat as the characters continue to run near endlessly to formulate a plan. I can tell that some of them needed great practice to have it play out well on screen. In the pool of YA book-turned-film adaptations, I'd say this title is really trying to rise up to prove its worth as the other big name YA films that already came before it. Despite not having any directorial involvement in any other titles prior to this film series, director Wes Ball is starting to demonstrate that he can helm a movie on this second round of maze running. With a third movie still yet to be released, only time will tell how this conflict will turn out in the end.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I did not like it too much, but sequels can be better sometimes...Not this time, anyway. The first half-an-hour provided some questionableness and odd flaws already (e.g. did all people have different first names that they could be called up by them only; why/how the room with sophisticated technology and stuff to be concealed had no cameras?), and fast movements in the dark with occasional flashes made the distinction who-is-who? rather difficult. Again, the leading performance (Dylan O'Brien as Thomas) was less interesting than most of others, and the the choice of actors covering all genders and races to enhance audience is considered always a cheap trick by me (I have always thought that a good movie is supra-gender, -age and -race and deals with common topics). Due to the next movie already planned, the ending was trivial, and the events directly earlier were more characteristic to Seagal or Lundgren movies...In spite of the fact that I realize not being an average member of the target audience, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is just another mediocre example of movies about/for teens made during the last decade. But as the money flows in, then, I guess, stuff like this gives many people food for thought...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As an adult, I don't know what to expect from it, but entertainment was the priority. The first film was just an introduction that happened in a small and a single location like the film 'Cube'. Now it has outspread in a large extent with more new characters and takes a wider adventure in the wastelands.Many doubts from the previous film were cleared, yet a few need to be clarified and hoping for the next one to do that job. But anyway the suspense was this franchise's specialty, that simply reminds us the TV series 'Lost'. This second part can be compared with plenty of other post apocalyptic films, but still I liked it better than the first.The best thing was they retained the same director and he's going to be here for the next film as well. But I'm more interested in the prequel, I mean the fourth film than the third which brings an end to the story moving forward. Because the maze holds the key for many unresolved issues. So I'm anticipating the prequel trilogy than the current one to learn how it all began.Surprisingly, many new additions like zombies, bounty hunters in the mainstream boosted the film with its variety. Gives us a creepy atmosphere, along thrilling running and chasing. The twist was not that great, but kind of unpredictable, and again due to the mysteries surrounding it, it created more curious about what might happen next.6½/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

By looking at the reviews you can clearly see that everyone who has read the books and is a fan of this franchise thinks this movie was absolutely terrible, since i have not read any of the books i found it quite alright.Most importantly it is packed with action, for a kids movie like this it is one of the most detrimental factors, the makers of this are trying to show kids good life lessons and values, like friendship, integrity and bravery, very clearly this film is aimed at more younger audiences, i do not get why people are writing horrible comments about this little action flick, of course it is illogical, of course there is 0 plot and the plot twist is absolutely blatant and visible from miles away. But that is all a part of kids action movies like this, none of the main characters get seriously harmed, if people die, they die without any major bloodshed and there is no profanity, what exactly do you expect from a film like this? It is decent for what it is and its young audience.Overall, not so bad, had beautiful and creative scenery, more action, definitely a very big improvement from the first one, this will be one of those movies kids remember 20 years later and reminisce about the ''good'' movies of their childhood.

Fantastic work as well, by director Wes Ball for assembling fast paced action sequences that provides nail biting thrills and excitement throughout the films runtime, clearly the films' winning assets.As for the storyline & action, this unfortunately play second fiddle to the intense action. The core narrative does it's job on expounding on the truth behind the Maze and the characters' motives, but is rather simple, if not tenuous. The acting on the other hand, is as basic as it comes, specially for the supporting characters.Despite its low points, the Scorch Trials manages to present itself as a solid sequel and a worthy sci fi thriller.

That being said giancarlo esposito was pretty cool. 6.2/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yet I can't stop feeling cheated every time an artificial bit of drama is added, when every adolescent in the world (and in time) is supposed to act like a millennial and when every movie ends up in a cliffhanger to support the money making machine that produced both book and film series.The acting is good, the direction is good, the effects are decent, the soundtrack is unsubtle propaganda, the script is reasonable. What the series lacks desperately is real characters. The villains are caricaturesque in most YA movies - I mean, they're adults, what do they know? - but so are the teenage heroes and every single character in The Scorch Trials acts like 21th century Americans scared of nothing except going over the PG-13 rating. I found it impossible to empathize with any of the heroes, the emotional scenes felt like hammer blows on nails - fingernails, that is - without any sense of measure, subtlety or attempt to reach the viewer.The lack of character development becomes crystal clear as the heroes go through the same thing again and again and again and again and fail to learn anything from it. They don't grow, instead remaining the same puppet like characters, capable of only moral outrage or rebellious spirit.Bottom line: better than Hunger Games and Divergent and The 5th Wave, even if they are all essentially the same story, but the feeling of ""this was made for money and nothing more"" never leaves you.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I understand why people are angry and rating it poorly, I mean I was fuming at the Golden Compass.

After their escape they face another obstacles and difficulties in a very hostile environment.I have to admit that my expectations about this movie was higher than the first one and that was my mistake. Apparently this movie is as I wrote in my title just a transitional stage that guides us to the third movie. This movie consists with a lot of new information that makes it a little bit boring. This has as a result the action scenes of it to seem not as good as it is. The direction of this movie was made by Wes Ball as in the first one. Dylan O'Brien did his best for this movie one more time but this time his interpretation was not enough. Lastly I believe that ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" is not a bad movie but eventually when it is compared with the first one then its quality is lower.

This one, however, is not. In fact if you miss the first 5 minutes would not think this was a sequel at all but just some generic future apocalypse horror.Having escaped the maze in the first film the runners spend more than 2 hours getting precisely nowhere. There is no story, only running about in a CGI world taken straight out of Bethesda's fallout games. However at least in a computer game you can interact with the world; in this film you are stuck in an anxiety dream you can't escape from, forever pursued and unable to get away from the bad people who want to kill you. The plot twists are lame, for instance the group at one point get separated because a person, who was specifically asked to prepare for departure has to go back for a trinket she apparently forgot to collect earlier. I wrote better plots (and was chastised for them by my English teacher) when I was 11.The characters one dimensional, spending most of their time ""caught in the headlamps"" staring at stuff when they should be running. The dialog is painful; I'm used to those ubiquitous words ""Hang On"" being used in almost every film, but this film is just full of such stuff. Having said all of the above, the cinematography is pretty good and full marks for the type casting of ""Baelish"" (Aidan Gillen), an actor I never tire of.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Village Vs. Lord of the Flies, but it had a lot of heart from a first time director with something to prove on a 'low' budget and The Scorch Trials is more of the same in that respect, albeit with double the budget of the first.*Isn't it ironic that we live in the midst of a global economic crisis yet $30m is considered 'low budget' for a movie?*Politics aside, What gives this series as an edge is the energy from director Wes Ball and the cast, who give depth and instant likability to the characters, somewhat lacking in other YA films.The core fan-base is obviously annoyed that this movie deviated wildly and I understand that completely, I would be too, but as an action/thriller sequel, and separate to the books, there are a lot worse ways to spend a cold, wet, winter day.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think there are probably too many young adult dystopian or Utopian films these days, but The Maze Runner was a pretty cool refresher on how to handle the genre. The Scorch Trials was a different film all together. There is once again a lot of entertainment to be had here. You get appearances from several famous actors including Barry Pepper, Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen, and even some zombie scenes along the way. But unfortunately the film is so uneven and confusing that I can't really recommend the film to anyone.Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, leads the team out of the maze and into the hands of surprise surprise Wicked, once again. This begins the 2 hours and 12 minutes of cinema where its not really all that clear who's intentions are what and who's on whose side. The nice part is that the chemistry within the group is excellent. Unlike some other young adult franchises, you care about these characters, which is what makes the zombie scenes that much more terrifying. Speaking of which, I found the CG to be incredibly effective. The zombies were somewhat inconsistent, which may have been the point. But I thought one building action sequence in particular looked fantastic for a 60 million dollar budget film.The problem is that the film doesn't flow at all from one scene to another. Characters just show up randomly several times. It just seemed like the writers didn't know where to take the story. It's also very uneven. I didn't know whether it was actually trying to be a zombie movie or not. Plus, the lead villains are in the film for about 15- 20 minutes total. There really is no beginning, middle, and end. But there are segments that are full of entertainment, which is why I ended up having a good time at the movies. I just think for being 45 minutes longer than the first film, it had room to improve the franchise much more than it ended up doing.+O'Brien has some chops+CG+Entertaining sequences+Surprise actor appearances-Uneven story-No flow at all-So bloody confusing6.0/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There was nothing new in this compared to previous one. The same old running for survival & hope. However the effects were much better that's the reason the budget raised to $60 million compared to $30 million of previous one. The movie would have been much better if it would have a good story.

In this second installment, they go far beyond. And this new film is not just another go at the maze, which it could have been. Instead, they create a much broader world and fully utilize all of it for an odyssey that deserves to be a sequel.I was pleasantly surprised to find certain actors on this odyssey, especially Giancarlo Esposito (""Revolution""), Lily Taylor (""Mystic Pizza""), and Alan Tudyk (""Firefly"").Once again, the story ends with a cliffhanger that promises another chapter.

I didn't mind the start where they were still in captivity from WICKD , but after that it turned into this scattered constant fleeing from the infected zombie like population. New characters were randomly introduced and their backgrounds never really explored. There is simply a lack of fluidity to it.The movie tries really hard to push the connection between Thomas and Teresa, but the two have no chemistry as actor and actress and that really is a problem for the film as it is hoping to use this connection to make the ending more significant. Thomas and Newt actually have a much more interesting bond.By the end you re just kind of exhausted from a lot of repetitive scenes in which many were inconsequential.The conclusion of the film , however, was somewhat decent. It grabbed my attention just enough to encourage me to watch the final movie in the trilogy.Still, from the first movie and the sequences on the glade to where the story ended up feels like a real let down. Not sure exactly if the books do the same, but going from an interesting social dystopia with interesting character dynamics and development to simply another variant of I am Legend is quite a step down.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The scorch trials movie brought us action, suspense, and helped to develop a plot far stronger than the scorch trials book did.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Gillen has all the terror-factor of Mary Poppins and whilst Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario and Thomas Brodie-Sangster; along with a seriously hammy Giancarlo Esposito look like they are having some fun with their escapade-driven flight; the dialogue is all over the place and the story lacks any sort of structure. The effects work well and the battle scenes are well put together but, ultimately, it is a sort of ""Percy Jackson"" version of the story; watchable but forgettable and not in the same class as the first film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well, the 2014 ""The Maze Runner"" movie wasn't exactly a grand gem in cinema history, but at least the predecessor was way more watchable then this 2015 sequel titled ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" turned out to be.Granted, the storyline in the first movie wasn't really interesting, nor making much of any sense, then the storyline in the 2015 sequel was making even less sense and proved to be much less entertaining and less watchable. It felt like the storyline in ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" was just made up on the fly as director Wes Ball was making progress in shooting the movie.And it was strange that the sequel was so much more worse than its predecessor, especially so given the fact that they managed to acquire a handful of bigger names to appear in the movie, with the likes of Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen and Barry Pepper appearing in ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"".I lost interest in the storyline about halfway through the movie, yet I managed to endure the movie to the very end. But honestly, the last half of the movie was just watched with one eye on the screen and one eye on social media. Man, this was a trivial and pointless movie. There is a snowballs chance in Hell of me ever returning to watch ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" for a second time.This 2015 sequel was a massive swing and a miss from director Wes Ball, and my rating of it settles on a generous three out of ten stars. This is not a movie worth the time or effort.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Honestly, if this teenage trilogy doesn't deserve a good rating, which one does?If you are a person who likes to stay in their comfort zone and refuse to support any type of change, even if it is a good one, this movie ain't gonna be your cup of tea. The movie trilogy is slightly different from the books when it comes to timeline of events. Nonetheless, I've read the books before. I also felt it was necessary that Wes made some changes in the content since some scenes in the book we a little bit cliché, for example, the telepathy part etc. It doesn't change the plot of the story though. The story still makes a lot of sense and people who fail to see what the story is about should definitely try watching the movie one more time. I'm not sure what's there to be confusing or unclear.Other than that, the cast is beyond amazing. It is obvious that not only these young people are great actors, but they're also emotionally invested in this project and very passionate about it, which is quite rare to find in today's cinematography. I salute them for that.CGI is beyond satisfying for us, regular people who make 90% of the viewers and who don't watch movies just because we want to see cool effects but want to see great acting and content too. I'm not interested in discussing the finesse because CGI is not bad at all.Anyway, not to prolong this because it's obvious that I had a great time watching it in the cinema (thrice!)... if you are a fan of dystopian and post-apocalyptic movies, you will definitely love this sequel to bits.It is adventurous, mysterious and exciting to watch every time! I'm looking forward to the third sequel to see what they'll make of it, because in the end, It's not important how you start something, but how you finish it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I haven't read the prequel though yet and I have read the 1st 2 books Twice. I will now continue with my review for this movie after establishing that I'm an avid fan of the books. I only did this bc a lot of reviews I see got mad at the movie for certain outcomes that happened in the book. I will say that I personally loved the movie. I found it to be a worthy successor to the 1st film which I have seen 3 times. The story while different from the 2nd book in many facets also plays nicely with the 1st movie. The acting is Amazing and my favorite character in the book Jorge played by Giancarlo Esposito was Fantastic. The action was extremely well done and very riveting. The enemies which everyone should know by now if you have read the books or seen the trailers are a mix between ""28 Days Later"" & ""World War Z"". I will move onto my 2nd opinion of the story which when comparing it to the book is very different and there are certain scenes from the book that I wish they had included in the film but it is what it is regardless from that it moved along just fine. I would recommend this movie for sure if you're a fan of the books or even the movie. I also would recommend not paying attention to reviews from people who haven't read the book as they don't have the whole picture. I can't wait for part 3 being ""The Death Cure"".","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Nowhere near as gripping as Mad Max Fury Road, no pulling of the heart strings such as in The Hunger Games and no plot surprises such as in Ender's Game.There are some good actors in the movie and I feel sorry for them. Poor Aidan Gillen - from GOT to this. The silk purses and sows ear proverb come to mind as I do not think it was possible to redeem this movie no matter how good the acting could have been.You can pick the plot from only a few minutes into the film , so no surprises there. The jerky POV action scenes makes them unwatchable and that was, in some ways, a relief from the tedium of the rest of the movie.

For a start the whole point of this movie was that it was the next phase of the trials to test the group further, instead the group escape and are then being hunted for the rest of the feature. Not only this, but the group seek to find a faction - The Right Arm - however this rebellion isn't even mentioned until the third book - why has it been brought in so early? Another annoying aspect was, due to the order of the film being distorted, I had no idea when the film was going to end, therefore it felt like it was dragging somewhat after the 1hr 30min mark. Rant over.Credit where credit is due - I never felt bored during this film. Despite the constant feeling of ""that's not what happens"" it had me intrigued as to where it might be going, although I can't even begin to imagine what could happen in the next sequel. Overall Scorch Trials isn't that bad, it's action packed and is always on the move, however it's just massively disappointing that such a good book has been completely changed so that it's barely recognisable.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie is completely remote from the storyline so far.

Plus there is something else, something regurgitated by almost every horror/thriller/post-apocalypse movie that seems to be the Hollywood's running gag of sorts I will not even mention. The whole thing had that ""let's make a sequel, with a huge cliffhanger the viewers can smell a mile off, see how it goes and maybe make a third part"" feeling about it, and the ending was an unrealistic letdown.

It's probably my favorite YA series alongside Harry Potter. When I saw the first movie last year, I liked it but wasn't impressed but when I saw it for the second time, I loved it so I was very excited about this one. The first one had quite a lot changes from the book but it was nothing compared to this. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but one of the most unfaithful adaptations ever. Visually, it was great and action scenes were really intense. The acting was fine, but nothing outstanding. Zombies, actually Cranks, are really creepy and if you're a kid or a parent that is planning to go watch this with a kid, don't. It's way to scary for children. There will be spoilers in this paragraph, so SPOILER ALERT. The movie starts in a typical YA sequel cliché. The main character's nightmare or trauma and after that it throws us straight into action and it gets you really pumped up. It was clear to see from the trailers that movie will be unfaithful to the source material, but it was unfaithful way too much. You know how when you watch a movie after reading a book and then think or talk about what they changed? Here you think about what they kept. I'll tell you what they kept:the title, the characters, the setting, Cranks, Winston's death (the way it happened was different), Group B, that party scene when Thomas and Brenda are drunk and kiss, Teresa's betrayal (it also played in a much more different way than in the book) and the rest is like watching a fanfic movie. Oh yeah, and some stuff from The Death Cure, the third book like the Right Arm (with different members) and escape from WCKD. SPOILER END If you're a non-reader you will really like the movie (probably) and find it very intense and entertaining. If you're a book reader however you will probably be disappointed. I know the movie can never be same as the book and I like that, but I don't want it to be THIS different.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Missing his memories and suspicious of anyone over the age of 21, before we can even blink an eye..Thomas is once again leading a breakout from the complex he and his buds are being held in after being rescued from the maze. This includes newcomer to the group Aris (Jacob Lofland) and a new mean guy Janson (Aiden Gillen) who is up to something, but before we can find out any answers as to why kids are being ""harvested"" and what the purpose of the maze was and Thomas's role in it, poof!! they're out into 'The Scorch', a desolate wasteland and busted-up city that uses must have used the leftover sets from Insurgent – hey..I'm all for budget saving. :)As noted in my review of the original Maze Runner, this one too borrows heavily from not only other popular YA films (think Twilight, Insurgent etc), but also every other popular trope lying around. Suddenly we've got Walking Dead type zombies – we've got running up buildings – we've got a political resistance with no clear aim – And we've got more questions asked than a 3 year old at the playground. Despite the bum- numbing (ouch!) running time, as again with all this type of genre film they could easily cut out 30-40 minutes from each one, every new character Thomas and his nameless mates encounter exclaim, ""There's no time to explain, we have to go!"" to the point of where you just want to scream ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING?""There's also little time given to reintroducing some of the characters that barely made it from the first film. We know Thomas and Teresa, and that guy from Game Of Thrones, but the supporting cast are essentially just there to be dispensed with to provide some sense of jeopardy. At one point, the boys reminisce about their fallen numbers; ""Aww, do you remember Chuck? And Winston? They were definitely here."" No, I do not remember them; I don't even remember what my life was like before I started watching this film. At one point, Theresa tells Thomas a story about her mother slowly turning mad to the point she plucked out her own eyeballs. After two hours and 11 minutes, I think I felt her pain..Which is a huge shame because the first installment was so promising I truly thought that the second would be better. And it almost was for a bit..sadly it didn't remain moving in that right direction. Though I will cough up to the fact that O'Brien is a fairly charismatic lead when all he had to do was jump around the maze, but now he's given precious little to do other than run around with that chicken head cut- off syndrome.Teresa who when in the maze, set the whole chain of events into motion, is literally carried throughout by the boys and her relationship with Thomas, both before and after the maze, is not ever really touched on. A brief flirtation between Thomas and resistance fighter/soon-to-be- zombie Brenda (Rosa Salazar) has little consequence; same with what her father figure Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) who I'm still not sure if he is the 'Right Arm' they were so desperately trying to find or not. Throw in Vince (Barry Pepper) or Mary (Lili Taylor) as possible Right Arm leaders also and truthfully I was just a bit confused or maybe tired by that point. The whole film, while not bad, made me wonder if you would be any the wiser if you read the books as early on director Wes Ball dispenses with the original story and gives us a sadly DSAPPNTNG ending to this second installment of the sage.Grade: D @pegsatthemoviesScreening: Tuesday, September 15, 2015 – Courtesy of 20th Century Fox Nationwide release: Friday, September 18, 2015","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Of the ones I've seen I think I still like ""Divergent"" best, along with the second ""Hunger Games"" film that made more sense than the first one did.

Yes, Hunger Games was a smashing success but even that began to wane as J Law lost her innocent look and her voice morphed into a raspy ever-present cry of ""Pita!"". It also didn't help that I had already forgotten most of what happened in the first Maze Runner. I'm watching Scorch Trials saying: ""Who are these guys again?"" ""Where are they?"" ""Who are they running from?"" ""Why is everything in ruins?"" ""OK, I no longer care."" It is a feature length film of a bunch of guys and one girl running from one place to another while performing selfless acts of heroism to save one another without the least bit of believability. The protagonist should be nominated as a saint he cares so much about his comrades. And no, I'm not ridiculing his desire to save his friends, I certainly would too--but this guy took being a savior as a personal life goal. There was no life to insignificant to save.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sorry, but I really do not care if everything is going to be cleared up in the next movie because this one was so unremittingly depressing and awful that I would not watch the next one if you payed me to do so.From what I have read here, the books are nothing like the movies. So you have to ask, why bother? And thus, why bother watching it?

Walking into the cinema... Are dystopian young adult dramas running out of steam?Overall rating: 2 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Big questions value: 2 starsFor those keeping up with the latest in young adult dystopian fiction, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials continues the saga of Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers. They have escaped the Maze, but it is an 'out of the frying pan and into the Scorch' experience. They leave their dystopian Garden of Eden existence and find themselves at a transfer depot facility that is overseen by Jansen (Aiden Gilen). He claims to be helping the 'immunes' of society to get to a safe place that is far from the barren wasteland called The Scorch. Thomas' band of brothers and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) have to determine if the outpost is designed to set them free or to keep them captive. On top of these internal trials, after their recent maze exodus they also need to investigate the purpose of the mysterious organisation called WCKD and how Janson's outfit is involved. Their haphazard search for the truth involves a multitude of other human outposts where they run into the hands of organised crime gangs, infected zombie-like creatures and The Right Arm resistance fighters, all in an attempt to stay ahead of WCKD's special forces.Director Wes Ball (The Maze Runner) managed to deliver a fresh spin on the disquieting young-adult genre with his first instalment and developed an intriguing cinematic puzzle. Unfortunately, this relatively new director has fallen into the trap of the sophomore venture. Given the task of following up to his original creation, he has to try and make lightning strike twice. In this second outing, he struggles to determine what type of film he is trying to make. Is it The Hunger Games, is it World War Z, or is it Alien? Understandably, sampling from other filmmakers is not new for directors, but Ball seems to be get lost within the tangled web he attempts to spin. Early in the film Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) asks Thomas if he has a plan for their escape and the leader has no solid answer. The same can be said of Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, there does not seem to be any concrete direction for the story. From the first chapter to the second, the producers invested in a multitude of special effects, but seemed to have left the script writer back in the maze of the first episode. The script becomes a series of derivative lines that only serve as trivial connectors between the numerous running sequences. One appealing factor of The Maze Runner was the development of the key characters, which helped the audience to develop concern for their well being. In this venture, most of the misguided disciples of Thomas serve one of two purposes, either as hopeless running companions or the victims of the various horrors along the way. There is a richness to the visual effects journey, but the The Scorch Trials lacks much character development. Understandably with trilogies, the second link in the chain is meant to connect the series together, leaving key plot points open for the conclusion to answer, but it helps if the audience cares about the central players. The challenge in getting people to the final instalment of this trilogy will be to provide a reason for caring for this group of misfits, because the second chapter does not provide this key story element. Leaving open the question, should we care if the society of Maze Runner even survives? Taking a moment to catch a breath from all of the athletic activity, this film does have one underlying theme that is worth pondering. Thomas and the others must risk their own lives to save the remnant of society. Yet, with their best intentions, they are caught in the cross-fire of forces that seem to be attempting the same goal, saving the lives of the world's population. In trying to save the earth, is the fate of society worth the sacrifice of a a few? Throughout the film, the lines are blurred in answering the question of the sanctity of life. It is not an easy answer, but does beg the questions the value of life and to what lengths must we go to preserve others lives? God proves throughout the Bible the lengths he will go to to save people's lives, but people need to determine if they are willing to accept his answer to life. Leaving the cinema... One puzzling factor in the majority of the end of the world and dystopian style films in the past few years is they all happen in San Francisco. It is an exceptionally iconic city that is known for the engineering marvel, the Golden Gate Bridge. Yet, as a bridging film, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is far from iconic and definitely is not a cinematic marvel. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. How will the world come to an end? (Matthew, 24:36, Revelation 20:1-15) 2. What does the Bible say about the sanctity of life? (Genesis 1:27, Psalm 139: 13-16, Matthew 5:21-22) 3. What sacrifice does God make to save mankind? (Luke 23-24)Discussion questions sheet: Use the attached discussion guides.

I just don't get why they changed it. It was a good formula; WICKED sends them in the Scorch, Jorge and Brenda appears no longer after, and finally, the encounter with the girls. I felt like seeing a whole new movie, but only with the book's main characters. I also think the relation between Brenda and Thomas was not enough clear. It is crystal clear in the book that she feels something for him and we know it, but the scene in the movie went so fast that we later realize that she liked him. My favorite part: when Newt calls Thomas: TOMMY !!!!But...

But one thing i thought about the first movie was that it seemed a bit teeny with the whole story revolving around these young teens. Furthermore it did not have the broader aspect like this sequel does: now you are drawn into the real world. This movie has a much more raw and thrill-like vibe surrounding it, which i personally like better than the first one. I heard some reviews saying that this movie is nothing like the first one, and i will agree with them on that. This movie is very different from the first, but i am glad that this is the case. Because, staying in the same theme as the first movie without new plots, would only be like dragging the first movie longer. And we all know that even a good movie can be ruined by a prolonged and slow plot. So the point here is: i prefer all the new stuff happening in this movie and i am happy that it is not like the first movie. Anyways. You should definitely go watch this movie, it has many nice sci-fy aspects that u will like if you are into that genre. There are Zombies, apocalyptic world scenes, monster like mutated zombies and much more. Enjoy","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It had a more stable plot than this piece of cinematic garbage. The film is very poorly written, and the whole story is just a bunch of teenagers running around in the desert like headless chooks, trying to escape zombie looking things that have a name, but the name is that bad I can't remember. On the bright side, there are moments that were entertaining (pretty much any scene with the zombies in them). But that's about where the good stuff ends. The acting is so terrible I swear it's rather Dylan Obrien was at gunpoint to play this role, or he was just slugging it out to the end of the week for his paycheck. But compared to the rest of the Cast, he is an academy award winner. The supporting cast are just awful, and probably wouldn't qualify to act on the Disney channel. Overall, The Maze Runner 2 lacks the strength of the first Maze Runners Plot, and the acting is so bad I suggest you sit and watch this with a vomit bag, because you're gonna need it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This great second part is an improvement over the solid first movie.First of all, this second movie is much more sinister than the first part as the teenagers have to fight creepy creatures roaming in an abandoned world. Especially the scenes in the mysterious underground shelter in the first third of the movie are quite intense. Overall, the varied locations add a lot of atmosphere to the film. Light and sound techniques are executed flawlessly. The creatures also look quite haunting.Secondly, the action sequences in this film are more intense than in the previous movie. One sequence that really stands out is when Thomas, the leader of the teenagers, and Brenda, the rebellious sister of one Thomas' deceased soulmates, have to fight their way through a shaky skyscraper with numerous traps. This sequence feels like a vivid roller coaster ride.Thirdly, the movie continues to develop the intriguing characters that made the first film so successful. Thomas is shown as brave leader who secretly doubts his capacities. Minho continues to convince as athletic, courageous and resilient young man. Newt represents the intellectual side as he always asks the right questions with a careful yet caring demeanor. In addition to this, the film introduces a few new characters that are quite intriguing. Aris is a quiet outsider who turns out being an observing and smart teenager who saves his new partners from certain death. Jorge is a resilient man with an unpredictable character who can be very caring about his friends in one scene but brutally torture former partners in the next scene. His protegee Brenda is a tough girl who doesn't shy away from conflicts with older men.Obviously, the movie also has a few minor flaws. The story is quite predictable. The film has two twists, one shown in the first third and the other one at the very end of the movie. Both of them are very predictable and the fact that the group of teenagers aren't immediately aware of them after everything they have gone through in the first installment, makes them look somewhat naive. Personally, I also dislike Teresa's character. She always seems cold, distant and manipulative and never truly helps her partners. She makes me think of Kristen Stewart, not only physically but also regarding her behavior. That isn't meant to be a compliment as it's impossible to empathize with her. Brenda is a much more distinctive female character while Teresa's character doesn't seem to be fully fleshed out.In the end, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is an improvement over a good first installment and makes you want to watch the third and final part right away. This film has great atmosphere, breathtaking action sequences and intriguing character development. Those who like dystopian science-fiction movies in the key of the Divergent or The Hunger Games franchises can't get around this franchise. Make sure you have watched the first part and to watch the third and final part later on.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In this one, however, we get all the excitement of the first one, in addition to a great plot. This movie is essentially a zombie movie. It's like a PG-13 ""Walking Dead."" It's actually pretty scary. I read the books, but this movie took the excitement of them and cranked (no pun intended) it up to 1000! Seriously! Don't watch this movie alone. And don't take little kids to it. It's PG-13 for a reason, and even then it is a hard PG-13. It's not inappropriate aside from some profanities, it's just really intense. Even though I read the books and knew for the most part what was coming up, I still jumped a few times! I'm really excited for the next one, and disappointed that I have to wait 2 years for it instead of 1.

But unlike the first movie that stuck to its plot device, this film is all over the place. IT was not terrible, but it seemed very disorganized. The first film being a solid 8/10 at least, this film was very disappointing. A male targeted franchise that attempted to focus on the untapped male teen demographic, it feels like a more thrilling version of hunger games. Maze Runners franchise seemed orientated toward a broader range of mid teen to young adult males with its better action, constant use of a certain swear word that means little more than a natural bodily function, and the fact that a male protagonist is always present within most frames. Thats it aside from the various antagonists present in film.Regardless of gender based guesses at which demographic Maze Runner was aimed at , it lost any edge the films could have had since the first. Ditch it if you can and see something else, you wont miss much really the whole genre of youth in the dystopic future was played out ages ago.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But the Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is just awesome..... Waiting and excited for the 3rd part. The acting of every actors and actresses was awesome here. With Thomas already established, Ball and O'Brien are able to evolve and develop their starring hero a bit more for The Scorch Trials. Instead of a brave ""new guy"" cliché, this round O'Brien is able to explore what exactly makes Thomas such a capable and compassionate leader. Viewers left pining for answers after The Maze Runner's climactic cliffhanger, will find The Scorch Trials also adds much-appreciated context to the Glader's former association with W.C.K.D. – painting a much clearer picture of why Thomas is a hero (both inside of the maze and out in the real world).Unfortunately, as O'Brien steps into the spotlight, developing Thomas into a layered paragon, the remainder of The Scorch Trials cast is sidelined. Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and Frypan (Dexter Darden) are reduced to expository sounding boards for Thomas and other dialogue- heavy characters – rather than capable heroes who possess individual skills necessary to the group's survival. Fan-favorite Minho gets a few moments to shine but, like the majority of Scorch Trials characters, most often he's simply looking to Thomas to call the next shot. End of all,, I loved this movie a lot.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

While the first movie needed to explain more things and spent a lot of time on what the maze is about, this one shows some facets of other places. Because the main characters were already described in the first part, most of the film shows either chasing, capturing or attacking, but it does those things well. It's pretty much an action film and one that looks good.It's not brilliant, but neither are the Hunger Games or the Divergent series. It's aimed at a teen audience. And yet, the surrounding world is much more interesting in the Maze Runner series. I found this film entertaining from beginning to end and it had some nice twists.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I watched the first movie, and though it was different than the book, I didn't mind the differences. Though confusing, it wasn't too bad. THIS movie, however, is a TERRIBLE adaptation. Not only did the writers/director change virtually everything about the book, they also created a storyline that was incoherent and poorly conceived. I had so looked forward to seeing this movie, and there is very little I can say that is good about the movie. Sure, the special effects are cool, and that is about it. Some of the acting isn't terrible, but they were given such a bad script, that it's not the actors faults. By the middle of the movie, I couldn't have even told you what part of the book they were even in. I'm so glad that I didn't waste money to go to the theaters to watch this!

All of the action is quite thrilling, the glass scene being intense. The acting was also good, my favourite being Aidan Gillen from Game of thrones. He is amazing at playing a deeply unlikable villain. Certain characters are not given enough time to expand on and feel like they come out of nowhere. There is a death scene that could have been very sad if we knew the character better. The film definitely feels like set up for the next, this could be due to it being based on a book. It needed more of pay off in this film to make it feel more than just set up for the next.I liked the twists in the film, but it needed more time explaining it.

Where in the original the location for the most part was fixed and constrained now we get to see a glimpse of the real world out there and it is not pretty. Part of the enjoyment is not knowing what comes next so I will not reveal too much. What I do want to mention is that more and more Thomas seems to be embracing his leader qualities and a lot of people gladly want to follow him. I personally love these kinds of things since it makes it interesting for me. Like in the original this film is filled with great action sequences and thrills. If you were thinking that it would be hard to top the original in that department think again. Maze Runner: Scorch Trials is bigger and better throughout. While the overall tone is still quite serious more humour is added to the mix providing some welcome laughs. However some of the quieter moments do feel a little forced and I wished they would have made better use of them to deepen the characters a little more. Not that it is needed much since you do learn enough about them to know where they stand. The ending of this film sets up the third one quite nicely and again it makes me look forward to what it has to offer.One remark I have to add. I read some reviews where book fans are outraged. Apparently the films don't follow the books as they should have. Now I understand that this can be very infuriating and frustrating. But as someone who has not read the books I have found myself enjoying these films since whether they are poor adaptations or not they are incredible enjoyable movies in their own right. Well made blockbuster action adventure films like these are very rare these days so I will embrace them wholeheartedly if they come along. Trust me on this if such a movie is crap then I will be among the first to critique the hell out of them.But main point is that Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials like the original is immensely fun.

At that time I thought this movie was amazing and then I read the book. Oh my word, I love this cast because they are pretty freaking awesome, but they really, really, really went off book. I mean the main plot is the same however 99/100 things that happened in this movie are incorrect. If this is your first time seeing it and you haven't read the book just assume that everything you're watching is incorrect, because it probably is. The Cranks are overdramatized, the whole rebel gang in the desert thing NEVER HAPPENED and Teresa was pretty much NEVER there. And Rat Man, whom I love, doesn't look like Rat Man!!!!!! Plus the whole ""their blood is the cure"" thing is sooo incorrect, because the Flare infects your brain like cancer or a mental illness, which then has residual effects on the body. So to take their blood would do nothing to fight the Flare. On the other hand the movie is entertaining to watch, if you are not watching it for the story. Therefore I would give it a 7 based on how entertaining it was and a 2 for how inaccurate it was. I do have to say that based on this movie I don't think the next one, the Death Cure, is even worth seeing. If this one was so inaccurate the Death Cure will most likely be much, much worse.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

S. Nowlin to help him with the book-to-movie adaptation of The Scorch Trials.The second installment picks up right where the first one ended. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers keep searching for clues about the real purpose of WCKD while teaming up with a resistance group of survivors in the middle of the Scorch, a destroyed landscape with virus-infected humans.The Scorch Trials had a tough task to start its story considering that the ending of the first film is pure nonsense and the reason why I almost did not rate it positively. However, The Maze Runner has several points in its favor and I felt entertained throughout the movie until the last 15 minutes. With this in mind, the first half of this film surprised me a lot!The Scorch Trials starts off strong and it does not take long for the Gladers to become aware of their ""situation"" and to synchronize with the viewers' knowledge. Thankfully, the stupid ending of the first movie does not spread for too long either and Wes Ball entertained the hell out of me for one hour-ish (the other hour is when the problems start to arise and develop). He has an outstanding eye for action, there are some amazing chasing sequences that honestly left me jaw-dropped. They are riveting, tense and the camera work is incredible, even the shaky cam is very well-handled.The cinematography transforms the visual quality of this film, even though it lost its claustrophobic atmosphere that I loved in the first movie. Still, it is a damn good looking film with great editing and an excellent score. This time around, the ending at least makes sense and it effectively finishes the movie, instead of completely destroying its story like in the previous one.One of the exceptional features of the first movie is the cast and everyone that keeps portraying their roles in this one becomes even better. Dylan O'Brien is astonishing once again. I mean, this guy is extraordinary, he has a great range of expressions and he easily connects with the audience. Thomas is also the most important piece of the trilogy since everything is based on him, what he did and what he means for the future of the world, so it is a perfect match between actor and character.Kaya Scodelario plays a more active Teresa and she definitely raises the story. Her character is basically a plot device in the first film, but now she is well-developed and she actually has something to do. Teresa's path throughout the movie follows an interesting progression and there are a few cool twists along the way, even if they are a bit predictable.Ki Hong Lee (Minho) and Thomas Sangster (Newt) also have neat performances, but here is where the film starts to crumble. There are a lot of new characters introduced in this movie and some of them are actually portrayed by well-known actors. For example, Aidan Gillen (Janson) and Giancarlo Esposito (Jorge), from the famous Game Of Thrones and Breaking Bad. With so many talents added to the cast, it is a pity that their characters are not developed at all ...The second half of the film entirely changes the movie and it turns into something I've seen a thousand times in action films. It lost its originality and mystery that it possessed, it stopped looking like an intriguing story. It is literally based on running from point A to B with big action scenes in exchange for character development. There is never a sense of urgency until the last 15 minutes and since the characters just appear from nowhere, I can't care for any of them. The new characters who I enjoyed watching, I did due to the actors portraying them, not because the characters were great.Consequently, the movie's tone and pacing are deeply affected. The balance between action and story-development is not adjusted at all, the movie goes from one running scene to another with barely any storytelling in between. It is entertaining for the first 45 minutes or so, but the second act slows down and it holds too many cliche sequences for me to tolerate.All in all, The Scorch Trials starts off great, with some amazing chasing scenes and phenomenal direction from Wes Ball. The nonsense ending from the first film is quickly put aside in the first act and the original cast improve on their already excellent performances from the first movie, especially Dylan O'Brien. Technically great in regards to cinematography, editing and score, but very disappointing story-wise. The second half feels like a cliche action movie with rarely decent storytelling, consequently breaking its pacing and tone. Some new characters should have added something more to the story, but they end up not being developed at all and The Maze Runner franchise wastes its potential once again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was entertaining, and at time thought provoking, and full of fantastic performances from a young cast. The mystery of being in the glades really added to the film and wondering what was behind the maze. There were only a couple of cliché moments, otherwise I was a massive fan of it. When the sequel came out, all I heard was negativity, and some of the harshest comments i've heard for a film. I feared the first film was a fluke, and that the sequel would be like other YA films, massive budget and brilliant production design, but completely lacking in solid story telling. I avoided the film for a long time, until tonight when I was in the mood for a big budget visual film.I have to say I can't understand the negativity geared towards the film at all, I thought the sequel was a truly well made action adventure, one of the best I've seen in a long time, and trust me I watch a LOT of films. Yes there are again a few cliché moments, that make you question the characters, otherwise it really is a truly entertaining film, with some of the better action scenes I've seen this year. And there needs to be some genuine applause and adulation for the Production Designer, the sets and production value is truly amazing. I'm 34 years old, I hate stupid films with lazy writing and directing. This film has none of that, i think I enjoyed it more than more or less all the other big tent pole films of 2015. I don't care about whether the source material wasn't copied or seemingly respected, this is a film version of the book, I really can't comment on whether or not the adaption should have been closer to the source, all I know is that I thought the film was a great example of the Hollywood blockbuster.I think in many ways I actually thought it succeeded the first movie, if for any other reason, that for the roller-coaster ride it offers.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now with the help of a new ally Aris (Jacob Lofland), the Gladers must stage an escape into the Scorch, a barren landscape filled with obstacles and swarming with virus-infected people called Cranks. Their only hope is to find a group known as the Right Hand, a group of fighters who can help them in their battle against WCKD.If you came here looking for some semblance of a story, then you're in the wrong place. I will say that I have not read the series of books in which this film is based but I have seen the first film and I enjoyed it. To me, this film has forgotten all that made the first film good, the camaraderie, figuring out the maze, and uncovering the mystery of why they were there. Albeit they are no longer in a maze but I thought this film had none of the other things. Camaraderie takes a backseat here as Thomas's friends are relegated to the background and the story is often silly and full of plot holes. Being where they are in the story and where this film fits in the series, they tried to expand the film's world and tried to dazzle us with more action sequences and special effects but I felt that the story got lost in the shuffle. This film is also a little different tone-wise when compared to the first film but I didn't mind that as much. I just think that it tried to be many things but did not do any very well. It's sometimes an adventure film, an action film, a drama, and a science fiction film. To me I felt like I was watching teenagers running away from things for 2 hours. I lost count how many times I've heard characters utter such phrases as ""Come On"" and ""Let's Go"". This is type of environment unfortunately leaves little room for simple plot development making the camaraderie from the first film irrelevant as little time was used for characters to have conversations with one another in order to further develop some more camaraderie amongst each other. The story, more so than the first film, did feel cliché at times, making it predictable. At others, I found myself getting frustrated with certain characters going back to the plot holes and questioning their motives. It's unfair but also fair but being the second film of the series, it will always be compared to the first but it's still the second film so it has to try to continue with what the first film started. I don't think it did. I came in with high expectations after the first film but I ended up leaving slightly disappointed. Dylan O'Brien's Thomas at least made it watchable for me.Score: 5/10 keithlovesmovies.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I can't even imagine how are they going to close it because it's... It's just not the story I read. Many essential things were missing that made the book creepy, exciting, unique and unforgettable. Action scenes were simply erased or turned into boring clishé. The feeling of a thrill was totally gone.

It's not until Thomas starts asking questions of his surroundings that he discovers they are in yet another WCKD place, so a break out is made. Once free they journey on the dangerous, yet open road. Rather than just fleeing to safety the intention is to traverse ""the scorch"", a barren terrain with unimaginable dangers, and search for clues about WCKD and their evil motivations. Along the way they meet the remains of humanity and experience different emotions to boot.I have to admit, I didn't enjoy this as much as the first film in the trilogy - the first one was new and unique, this felt as I had seen it before - or at least seen a grown up version of it (I just can't quite put my finger on what film I'm thinking of). Cross a college movie with a watered down Mad-Max film and you are heading in the right direction.The acting is decent although not outstanding. The scripting is not too complex, and points are repeated over and over so you won't get lost if you come into this film having skipper the first film. Action and CGI are authentic enough. And those are the positives - the big negative; if you have read the book - avoid this film like the Flare virus, it'll leave you angry at home much liberty has been taken with a decent source material.Average.

It lends heavily from other plots such as I am legend and mixes in its fair share of action scenes with the expected shooting and explosion. The suspense of the unknown so very present in the first is very sadly missing in this sequel. Furthermore the explanation of why Wicked is doing what it is doing is very obvious. To its merit the special effects are quite good and the acting is not that bad (even though a bit fake at times). Camera action is quite good yet the scene portraying climbing vertically in skyscrapers does not portray the dizzying effect it should have.

Yet another entry in the ""Teen drama in a Dystopian Future"" genre, following the lines of The Hunger Games and other much better films.The biggest problem I have with this film, isn't it's poor acting, or terrible plot, or disjointed story line, or the lack of back story, or the fact that a group of 10 kids RUN through a desert without drinking a drop of water throughout the film (in about 15 minutes I might add). The fact is, every act of this film is a rip off of much better movies.The first act doesn't cover much in terms of a re-cap so yeah, you'll need to watch the first film to understand why it's called Maze Runner. There is no maze in this film.Society is destroyed leaving ruined cites and a desert landscape around the globe. (Mad max) An evil corporate network controls the remaining resources in search of a cure for a virus turning people into zombie like creatures. (Resident Evil) A group of kids escape their totalitarian like bondage and rise against the machine of the evil network WICKED. Then they join a paramilitary group of guerrilla fighters. (Divergent) ""The Flair"" has infected the planet except for a few surviving groups of people, and when you are bitten you become one of them. (The walking dead, dawn of the dead, 28 days later... my god I'm over the whole zombie thing already). Mad max, Resident Evil, Divergent, Dawn of the Dead, 1984, Lord of the Flies... it's like the film couldn't decide which movie or book to rip off for it's plot line.If it wasn't enough, the film is so inconsistent with it's plot, that you're never really sure of what the hell is going on. One minute their in a government base, next they're running through a desert, next their in a... nightclub for LSD kiddies... then the Rocky Mountains. I felt like the whole thing was a garbled mess. And by the end I was left asking myself, ""What was the point?"" I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a low IQ or don't like movies with better stories.

One of the few problems I have with the movie is that it doesn't really give an insight to its prequel. One has to have watched the previous movie to understand what is going on. They also don't really explain what certain terms e.g. Scorch, mean. This is probably surprising given that they did give quite a lot of answers to questions that were springing up in my brain while watching the movie.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie.

As an adult, I really enjoyed this film. There you go.Not knowing in great detail the story, I was picking it up as best as possible, so I'm in no position to provide spoilers or great plot reviews.For me, there were some great sections of proper suspense and tension, with some truly dark moments in the mix. The action alongside this was superbly and creatively done, and some of the characters along the way bringing a great presence to the mix. At over 2 hours long, it didn't feel it, with great fluidity throughout, the time soon went by.As youth audience films go, its much better than the Hunger Games, which to me lack the edge they could bring at times So, a big thumbs up from me and I'll head to the next installment with less thoughts about the potato suit!

The same cannot be said for this movie.The entire plot-line is completely different, it doesn't explain anything about what has happened, what is going on now, and what the kids have to do, it has essentially been made into yet another zombie movie. This was summed up by my girlfriend who hasn't read the books being completely confused as to what is going on.I understand that there are parts of books that are always changed to make a movie, however there is so little in this from the book that it shouldn't even be associated with it, I can't see how it was even signed off by the author.In summary, I wouldn't bother with this movie, if you have read the books you will just be pointing out all of the things that are different from when you read it, and if you haven't read the book you won't have a clue what is going on. A terrible effort all round in my opinion","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The screenwriter changed the entire plot. I haven't read the novel yet, so, I don't know what they are saying is true or not. But as for me, this film is also very good to enjoy.The disease known as the Flare is something that attacks the brain, but it isn't a zombie virus. People who infected by that disease will not turn into Zombies. But in this film, they changed the basis plot and turned into Zombie film. I'm not saying it's not good. I like Zombie films but changing the foundation isn't cool. If it's not Zombie in the novel, then it shouldn't be Zombie in the film too. That's the law.Anyway, except for the fact, everything is fine. The original score, the acting, the directing, the sound edition, special effects and all, everything's perfect. There are some scenes that make you excited. Those scenes can really make you excited. That's why I love this film. All in all, although there are some arguments, the film is still good and enjoyable.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This in not only a good movie, this is an incredible movie. I just hope the producers don't fall for the same stupidity that lead to the end of the sequel of the last air bender, because of some idiot fan boys that failed to see the adaptation for the screen.Now, back to the reason why so many people didn't get it: The nightmares. If you think of an apocalyptic end for humanity, this movie is as probably as close to reality as it gets, even though it looks science fiction, which in my opinion is why so many people hated it. We don't want to believe that it is possible, but we do it anyway in an almost subconscious level. We think of wars or natural disasters and nothing, I mean nothing compares to what would happen if humanity is stricken by a virus that is 100% lethal, has no cure and is turns the infected victims into walking monsters, and that's too frightening, even for a ""fantasy movie"".And at the core of the movie is humanity itself. It is not enough to fight for the ""greater good"" and choose a side for what is believed to be the ""right side"". Most totalitarian states think they can achieve their goals by any means necessary to find a cure, and the movie shows this very well, and in the end they are no different than the threat of the inevitable annihilation itself.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

As a movie, as in without thinking of the books, I thought it was really exciting and was made very well and think that everyone would enjoy it. In that case, I would totally recommend it. So yes, as a movie it was very good. It had a lot of action, the characters were amazing as always, although thought the character Aris was very unnecessary since they didn't stick to the book. Okay, so now I've explained why I gave it a good rating. But as a fan of the books, I thought the movie was TERRIBLE. It was absolutely nothing like the book. I know readers probably say that about pretty much every book that gets turned into a movie. Now, I get that sometimes directors have to cut some scenes out which I totally understand and will tolerate as long as you still get the story of the movie right and just do a great job with it. But in this case they might as well have cut out every scene in the book and just put in a bunch of confusing unnecessary and irrelevant scenes into the movie that were never in the book. Honestly, you can't even call this movie The Scorch Trials. Why would you if it isn't even the same story? While I watched the movie, right from the beginning I got mad and could already see the differences. But now, how they made this movie, I have know idea what they are going to do with The Death Cure because they changed the whole point of The Scorch Trials and based on the way it ended they have to make up a whole new story for The Death Cure because otherwise it will make absolutely zero sense. I have no idea what directors and movie companies are thinking when they decide to change so much of the story. The Maze Runner I thought was actually pretty good and stayed pretty true to the book and I thought The Scorch Trials was going to be even better since it was also such an awesome book and since they did a good job with the first movie I figured they would do a good job with the second one. But I was very disappointed. I hate that they even call it The Scorch Trials because it clearly isn't. I write stories, and I can't even imagine having it being made into a movie just to have the movie companies and directors totally change the whole story and think that they are making it better. I wouldn't even be able to handle that. What makes movie companies think that they know better? They aren't the authors. They aren't the creative ones. The authors are the masterminds. That is why there are so many fans; because of how the story already is. So, why do they take a story many people love and change it. Do they want is to suffer. Do they want us to hate the movies? I just don't get it!But anyways, I just had to write all of that down. Also, the Cranks were amazing as well as Brenda and Jorge, and of course Minho and Newt. But if you haven't read the books I think you will definitely like this movie, but if you have read the books and have strong opinions with whether it is true to the book then I think I would still see it just to see how it is and see for yourself what you think but don't expect it to be like the REAL story. I mean, I'm still glad I saw it I'm just really frustrated now. But all in all its a movie and I rated it as a movie. So as a movie it was very good and the Cranks were horrific.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Consequently, they rewarded him with a larger budget for the sequel, allowing Ball to expand the scope of the narrative significantly.While I do miss the simplicity of the initial film's premise-a blend of 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Lost'-it's hard not to admire the grandeur of the post-apocalyptic landscapes and the thrilling chase sequences that Ball orchestrates in this follow-up. While the imagery may feel somewhat familiar to those acquainted with recent AAA video games like The Last of Us or films such as World War Z and I Am Legend, the film avoids becoming overly self-indulgent in its mythology. At its core, this show remains a gripping tale of young individuals relentlessly running against all odds-and Wes Ball understands this essence well.Furthermore, the show seems to explore the theme of distrust towards the adult world, akin to motifs seen in works like The Nightmare on Elm Street Series. Characters over thirty often appear untrustworthy, and as the protagonists navigate through various systems of control, Thomas's paranoia is consistently validated. The narrative, revolving around the exploitation of youth for the benefit of a corrupt elite, and featuring a central villain justifying atrocities for the greater good, resonates with contemporary socio-political themes.However, amidst its serious undertones, the show also boasts elements of fantasy, with cybernetic monsters known as Grievers. Ball skillfully incorporates seasoned actors like Aidan Gillen and Giancarlo Esposito, lending the narrative a gravitas reminiscent of prestigious television dramas. Barry Pepper's portrayal adds a dash of charm, offering a redneck Han Solo archetype, potentially rehabilitating his reputation with genre enthusiasts post-Battlefield Earth.This show caters to a broader audience beyond the young adult fiction demographic. With its multitude of action-packed set pieces, even conventional action movie enthusiasts are likely to find enjoyment. And that's not to mention the exhilarating moment when Barry Pepper unleashes a Gatling gun from the back of a pickup truck, channeling his inner Rambo.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You'll like the beginning due to its excitement and then you'll get bored because the story can not hold up the intensity.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has somewhat similar plot to some post apocalyptic movies, yet! It keeps you on the edge of your seat at all time. It has everything for every taste, emotion, action, thriller, horror, sci-fi, comedy, adventure, and more. Made me cry, laugh, happy and sad all together. The older cast members where very good obviously, but also, the younger cast members, to me, where exceptionally amazing. Well! Most of them. I loved the technical and art work of the movie. It did give me the impression of actually feeling the tensions and/or emotions, fear or joy when the characters were going through the scenes. I definitely rate this movie 10/10 on every aspect. I had only one problem while watching it and I am not sure if it was my hearing problem or with clearly hearing the dialogues in the first 20 minutes of the movie. However, the whole composition is so good that I cannot rate it anything lower than a perfect score. I look forward for the release of the next one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

All well and good. However, I only assume that the director, screenwriter, actors and everyone else involved in this project used this point in the movie to ""get creative"". I assume in the movie business this means ""make stuff up"" and ""do action, and stuff"". I know, I know, this is what is meant to happen in fiction. But, someone had already ""made stuff up"" and it was in a book called ""The Scorch Trials"" and it came after another book called ""The Maze Runner"". So, when people go to watch a film called ""The Scorch Trials"" that comes after a film called ""The Maze Runner"" that bears a striking similarity to ""The Maze Runner"" book one must conclude that the film ""The Scorch Trials"" is similar to the book entitled ""The Scorch Trials"". Wrong! This is ""other made up stuff"". Confused? Unlike the book of the same name, this is a zombie story set in, what looks like, Benidorm post-summer season. To be fair, the movie passes two hours interestingly enough. Nothing too outrageous (given the context) and nothing too cheap (given the budget). However, may I suggest the makers of the movie alter the title somewhat so as not to confuse the film with the book, maybe call it something like ""The Scorch Trail""?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You've already understood your inclination from the first film.After the final of the first film, there isn't much left in terms of mystery in the series. By the middle of this film, you pretty much understand the rules and structure of the world. The film has a few plot twists that maintain the pace, but they're not mind-blowing.We transition from the labyrinth walls to a futuristic military compound and from there to a dystopian wasteland. All of it is visually satisfying and immersive enough, which I believe is the biggest promise of this film. Of course, there's a bit of teenage romance, but they've done it without making it too obvious, without focusing on it or overdramatizing it.I loved how the young characters were portrayed with simplicity and without exaggeration, seamlessly flowing from one scene to another.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Janson, in cold blood, kills a doctor woman from the Right Arm and that confirmed that yes, WCKD are the bad guys, but just barely. But I guess we were supposed to view WCKD as the villains all along?I'm sorry, if the world has become an apocalyptic nightmare full of zombies, I would quite like for a group of people to seek the cure by WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY. If that means fooling a handful of kids into a coma, so be it. The film states that the process is painless too. But no, Thomas and his friends are good and WCKD is bad. Why? Because that's how the movie clearly wants us to think, that's why. Thus, the concept of ""the greater good"" is kind of just thrown away and it's every man for himself I guess. Thomas cares so deeply about everyone around him and even risks his life to save Brenda, a girl he just met, but I guess the notion of sacrificing himself to save the entire planet is just too ""WCKD"" for him....pardon the pun.All of the moral questions aside, the acting is pretty much unbearable. Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) was a weak actor in the first installment but good god, his acting falls apart in this film. It is not surprising that I haven't seen him in any other movies. Secondly, why is the love interest so ugly? The actress who plays Brenda may not even be unattractive in real life but the director of the film gave her a butch haircut and made her look like a man. Thirdly, why is WCKD so desperate to obtain this group of like 5 kids? In the beginning, they have a facility with at least 100 of these kids and we know that they have people out in the world like Marcus who drug them and kidnap them. So, why so much turmoil over Thomas and a few others? Perhaps this question will be answered; I need to watch the final installment. I'm hoping that the next one will be better.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not in this case. The book was clearly his own thing, just like the movie is. You do have the same story and characters, they are just dealing with the story in a different way, a way that is probably better when you wanne do it justice in only 2 hours.Before watching it, I think it's important that you watched the first movie or else you'll be completely lost about what exactly is going on. But it's such a roller-coaster. The action is faced-paced and looks very spectacular. There are a few run and fight scenes that are dealt with in such a strong way that it had me jumping up and down in my seat. I can't stress enough by writing how much I enjoyed this movie. And most of that has to do with the incredible cast. The writers were able to put in a few heartfelt moments in there so that we don't lose touch with the human side of it all. And the acting helped elevate those moments.It's beyond me why IMDb has such a low rating for this movie.

I'm not a fan of zombie movies so that also did not help matters for me. The fact that everything always changes immediately the lead character gets in the scene gets old fast.

Bizarre plot stuff happens for two hours that looks like a blend of 80's apocalypse movies.

The casting was exactly the same and their acting was way better in that movie. It was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of breathtaking scenes. Gladly, the budget of that movie was way higher than the previous movie and the editing was way better, especially the cinematography. The 1st act (opening scene) of the movie was really good and a perfect continuation of the previous movie. The 2nd act was ICONIC, full of epic chase/battle scenes.

The basic dystopian premise doesn't make sense. What has actually destroyed civilisation: a zombie apocalypse or global warming? How did a zombie plague manage to dry up the East River under what is the unmistakable design of John Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge? Why are there sand dunes?! 2. The plot doesn't make sense. If the children were tested in the original Maze to survive in the dystopian world outside, then why are they now special children being harvested for their antibodies? This makes no sense: are they special because they survived the maze or because they have immunity to the zombie plague? What on earth has the one got to do with the other? Further, why kill the children if their bodies are constantly producing anti-plague antibodies?! You would want them to remain alive to produce more white blood cells, not die! And who kills children when humanity is about to become extinct? 3. The props and backdrop don't make sense. How are is evil organisation WICKED generating electrical power? And how are they using Wi-Fi/Internet if civilisation is destroyed? The cars outside are cars from the year 2015 and they aren't rusted, so we can presume it's about 2015. What's a bigger miracle: That WKD has working broadband in a world without working optic fibre.. or holographic comms technologies and advanced alien medical procedures that probably won't be invented for another 80 - 150 years? Also, if the teenagers have walked from New York City across Brooklyn Bridge onto Long Island, why are there Mountains in Connecticut about a days' work North through Queens? NY has some of the flattest real estate in the United States. 4. Why did the movie steal blatantly emulate animation from World War Z, post-apocalypse sets similar to both The Book of Eli and to Mad Max, and smelt at times like the Divergent series? Is it because in 20th Century Fox's race to capitalise on the dollars of the first Maze movie by quickly formatting James Dashner's second Maze book into a film, they forgot that movies actually need character development? Shuffling a group of Goonies from one reactive situation to another without depth of interaction is like having Kirk and Spock running along some desolate planet for 131 painstaking minutes, without any plot- building dialogue. Character development can be done on the run, by the way. Even Riddick, who doesn't say much, had a personality. WICKED Chancellor Ava Paige would make a good evil wife for President Snow in the Hunger Games, except the Hunger Games is superior to the Maze series on every level of dystopia. The 20% of the film that unfolded during daylight was refreshing. Most of the film was done in almost total darkness and I couldn't tell what was going on some of the time. Felt like a 1970s film where one sits and looks as an almost black screen with lots of shooting going on. 5. The most important reason I gave this film 1 star is because it under-utilised the acting prowess of two wonderful young actors. The two Gladers in question, Dylan O'Brien and Thomas Brodie-Sangster are going to be great actors if their managers find them the kind of method films that catapulted Leonardo DiCaprio to fame.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has no connection to the first movie whatsoever, except that they run fast from the ""evil"".Actually the movie is into a maze and they have no clue where they are going with it.I was so excited for this sequel because the Maze Runner left really wide area and many ideas how to continue this story. I guess thats the downfall of making movies from books. You can do nothing on your own, its already written.It starts with freaking zombies! Like, what the hell is that? We are surrounded with zombies on TV and theaters. That was the biggest failure!Also you will notice many mistakes in the movie, they are obvious. The reason for that is that they were trying to re-create old fashion scenes to build up tension. I hope they haven't forgot that it's 2015!The ending.. oh well, thats a completely different story from what you gonna expect. It will totally ""blow"" your mind and you will see something you haven't seen before! Okay, enough sarcasm. Now seriously, the ending couldn't be worse. They put every single effort to make the worst ending!There will be another Maze Runner and I cannot wait not to watch it!Overall 4/10 and I give 4 because of the actors.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

All this excess heroism from Dylan O'Brien was getting particularly annoying, like as if he could disrupt a whole institution on his own.For the vast majority, the story is weak and kinds of fails miserably at the end. Just like in the previous part, the fighting scenes are not particularly convincing and it's quite sad really that they put away the ""robots"" for these poorly convincing zombies. At the end though, there's not factual relation between the title ""Maze runner"" and what happens within the movie which just turns out to be a boring chase.Frankly, there's really not much to say on this sequel other than the fact that it is a complete dismantling of what made part one a reasonable movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While the first film was all about confusion, constant running and spooky monsters, the second one opens the perspective on the whole post-apocalyptic world, with its tragedies and hopes. Of course, main elements of the movie are standard. Evil, wicked corporation, desert thugs and rebels, and your everyday zombies - we've seen 'em all, true. Yet it is interesting to watch, because, 1. These are kids, not some motley crew of hunters/ex cops, marines/all- knowing scientists, just kids alone in the dark, without skills, smartness or inner aggression. And 2. This is not about killing zombies or even finding cure, - bit simple escape to nowhere. And the absence of rather sickly ""real scenes"" adds up much to the positiveness of the movie.I really prefer this one to the first. Diversity of scenery is new and pleasant, the town sunk in sands looks interesting, and there is a sense, feeling of the open air. The plot is not just about ""This is the maze we need to get out so run"", but deeper - the price of cure, sacrifice or betrayal, loyalty and doubt. Barry Pepper was very good at his some 10 minutes of screen time) Haven't seen him in movies for ages) Also there is a rare touch of humanity in this movie, more than in the first. These zombie survival flicks, so immensely enjoyed by many peaceful residents, safe and protected, and yet longing for adventure, tend to concentrate on the extreme violence and gore. It is understandable, those who never experienced the world of violence and feel safe, like the patricians of the ancient Rome , demand the entertainment of blood and death. But this movie is not about zombies, it is about standing together, trusting each other, and that humanity will win)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There's an interesting (though highly unrealistic) dilemma here about how to fight a deadly virus that can only be continually harvested from the blood of the young (?), but the film isn't interested in exploring that. It's never explained how building these elaborate tests, like the mazes, benefits anyone. Thomas and Friends have no plan except ""run away.""

When the first zombies appear, the first thing I thought was ""they have got out of original ideas"" and that is a pity because it could've become a good film to watch just by following the main principles of the first film. It just happens that I feel that the zombie concept has been very stereotyped and when you see one you have seen all. There are even several TV series where the main characters are zombies with the same bizarre expressions on the face and the perverse convolutions on their bodies.Another disappointment is the attitude of the main character that in most scenes has the same expression of awe in control. Strangely enough the director has made these scenes with that same expression unnecessary long which results making the film to seem boring and slow.Thus the genre of the film perhaps should evolve from science fiction to horror film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He showed up on-time which impressed me a bit as we were just going to chill and nothing more. I asked him if he would love some tea to which he replied 'yes'. While I was in the kitchen preparing tea for both of us, I heard his phone ring; I knew it was his because I was with my phone and the ringtone was different.The silence that followed was odd as I expected him to be engaged in a conversation. 'Maybe, it was a missed call..' I thought. 'BANG, BANG, CRASH' I almost jumped out of my skin. I ran to the sitting room to see what could have caused the ruckus. The sight that greeted me was one I would never forget. My entire shelf lay in bits and pieces strewn across the center rug; two gaping holes that seemed to have been made by punches stood just above where the shelf used to stand. The wall pictures that once hung on these spots where in the pile of broken mess on the floor..'I'm sorry', Thomas's apology seemed to bring my attention to him. He apparently had been looking through the wreckage and was now standing in front of my Samsung smart TV.. 'I'm sorry' he said again and I assumed (rather hopefully) that he was about to give me a plausible reason for all this commotion.. He continued, ' This is how they got me' and in a flash he smashed my TV hard on the floor. 'WTH!!!' this couldn't be happening.. I was across the room in no time and found myself jerking Tom quite aggressively but at the same time kindly inquiring what this madness was about.. He cried, 'they have found me , they have found me and this means you are in trouble.. its not safe here.. we gotta run'. I requested, 'who has found you Thomas? I do not understand what you mean..' as I desperately sought for answers. Thomas flared,' I don't know but what I do know is that we are not safe.. we have got to leave now'. Out of the corner of my eye I saw his phone in a pile of stuff where he apparently tried to destroy it. I made a move for it. He must have noticed because he jumped on my back and we got involved in a squabble. He obviously wanted to permanently destroy it and I was adamant about finding the root cause of the problem. We only succeeded in pushing the phone further and further away in our vain attempts to reach it..I had had just about enough and was about to go full-on beast-mode on Tommy when his ring-tone interrupted. The distraction was enough for him to break free of my grip and grab the phone off the floor. He made a gesture to smash the phone again and I shouted, almost begging, that he at least answer the call, 'If they already know where you are, you might as well find out what they want..' My reasoning seemed to appeal to him as he proceeded to speak with the caller. I could only hear Tommy's end of the conversation which was mostly one-word responses confirming his identity. I then noticed his shoulders sag and his breathing steady as one would when heavy tension has been lifted. 'Oh OK.. Thanks man.. I'm really grateful', then he ended the call.The look of guilt and shame on his face was overwhelming but a part of him still looked like he hadn't had his fill yet.. 'That was from the hotel manager.. I forgot my wallet at the counter when I stopped to leave some instructions with the front desk agent. I'm so sorr.....' I smashed his jaw in with a clean left hook which sent him crashing into the mess he had made then I went to the kitchen to have some tea.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Why? BECAUSE Hollywood PULLED A Hollywood AND CHANGED THE MAJORITY OF THE STORY. And they did it again with this movie.Don't get me wrong, the first movie was extremely good...but I think I say that because I saw the movie first. I read the book after and was pretty disappointed with what was missing from the movie but still love the movie. I was dying to see this one and heard bad things from friends so I waited for it to come out on DVD and was still mad I paid the $1 for the hapless mess that I witnessed. My husband thought it was okay, but I was silently seething at how much they changed the movie. They literally RUINED it! In the first they just omitted a couple (MAJOR) key points and changed a couple bits up, but this one they basically skimmed through the book and, like Eragon, changed almost everything. The thing I'm most angry about, however, is they left out my absolute favorite scene from the book. In the book, during their ""escape"" from WCKD, the gang enters a completely pitch black room and bump into things and...well I won't give away what happens but it would have been absolutely perfect for the movie and THEY WENT AND Hollywood IT. Why, WHY WHY WHY do directors/writers think this is okay?! The drugs and whores they all surround themselves with must be getting to them. This movie is an absolute disgrace to the name of the books and the author should sue the pants off of them. Writers, DON'T SELL OUT TO Hollywood BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEEM TO TOUCH A SINGLE BOOK WITHOUT CHANGING IT","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

""The Scorch Trials"" does the opposite. The more it reveals about this post-apocalyptic dystopian future, the less interesting and more formulaic it seems to become. The film gets so bogged down in overly convoluted, exposition-heavy storytelling that it's hard to care, for instance, about the discovery of an important resistance group in the final third. The 'shocking' cliffhanger is equally a ""meh"" moment. By this point the film has, like a vacuum, sucked out a lot of what was interesting about the first film.As protagonist Thomas, Dylan O'Brien competently holds the film on his shoulders. He's charismatic and convincingly physical and intense. But the surrounding film lets this young actor down significantly. It's bereft of character development. Try naming anyone other than Thomas, and perhaps Patricia Clarkson's icy villainess Ava Paige who isn't completely forgettable. Kaya Scodelario in particular flounders, appearing to give her best Kristen-Stewart-in-Twilight impression, and failing to find depths in her explicable character, who is responsible for a couple of big plot twists.The film at least manages to be fun some of the time - for the first third it is essentially one big chase scene. A nightmarish, claustrophobic and surprisingly-violent-for-this-age-group attack on the central heroes by zombie-like desert inhabitants is undeniably pulse-pounding. But even then, that otherwise-well-done sequence ends at an 'oh well', abrupt anticlimax. It's the first sign of the choppiness that will remain consistent through the rest of the film (another sequence featuring a desert storm is similarly lazily resolved - it cuts to the characters suddenly, and inexplicably, under shelter in fine weather). What are we to invest in a film that lacks the resolve to see these intense encounters through to the end?And, eventually, even the film's fun chases become a bit exhausting and tiresome. At least one could've been cut to match the first film's tight plotting and pacing. ""Trials"" is notably overlong and plodding, especially in its aforementioned third act, where all but the most invested of viewers will have lost interest. One hopes that the third film can redeem this franchise, but it'll take a lot to restore investment from the viewers - such as myself - who found this second instalment severely disappointing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Instead it is a playbook of such post apocalyptic franchises as the RESIDENT EVIL, MAD MAX and THE HUNGER GAMES films that involves a lot of running around and irritable repetitive dialogue of folk shouting ""go, go, go"", ""let's go"" or ""move, move, move"" to the point of irritation.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It had a good, solid identity, decent acting, very interesting location and overall it was something that managed to stand apart from its competition.Unfortunately the same can't be said about its sequel. The Scorch Trials pick up immediately after the events of the previous films. The kids are now out of the maze and are facing new and unexpected tribulations.The only problem? You know that maze in the first film? That humongous, elaborate and downright bizarre contraption of a trap that the kids had to escape from by the skin of their teeth? We get absolutely zero explanation for it. This group behind the whole thing doesn't even seem to be advanced or well-funded enough to have built it.So yeah, where the first film was an intriguing mystery of a situation, something unique and never before seen, this simply languishes in old and tired dystopia/post-apocalypse clichés. We get a desolated desert landscape. We get desperate survivors clinging to life while a group of super elites are living in dimly-lit labs and luxurious penthouses, away from the dangers. We even get zombies.Admittedly the action set pieces are still very nice and the original group of actors are about as likable as they were in the original film. Aidan Gillen is also still an absolutely perfect cast for a smarmy antagonist.But aside from those few nuggets of promise, this film was a big letdown when compared to the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No mystery, no plot, no character development, not even answers to questions set by the first movie. Instead all I got was endless chase scenes - by gruesome zombie knock-offs (so original), by mad scientists and their henchmen, by sandstorms, by thunderstorms -, cliché gunfights and the characters moving from one place to another without any real purpose. Characters from the first movie (except Thomas) fade into the background, while new characters end up forgettable as they hop into fights without a proper introduction. Plot is pushed aside in favor of action, which while somewhat exciting, becomes repetitive by the end of the film and doesn't offer anything that hasn't been done a multitude of times already.If you're looking for a generic sci-fi/zombie movie full of mindless action you might wanna give it a try, but if you expect anything more than that you will be disappointed.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While the enclosed space of the Glade in the first film drew plenty of similarities to Lost- the Scorch Trials has a feel similar to The Walking Dead with the zombie-like Cranks attempting to spread the Flare virus to those still unaffected. The scenery is far more expansive than its predecessor with some excellent post-apocalyptic landscapes. In particular, buildings are seen leaning on other buildings- providing the setting for an imaginative action scene with the zombies.However, the vast majority of the run time consists of the group running away from things- Cranks, lightning strikes, noises- and this begins to tire after a while. There is very little in terms of plot development in the middle third of the film. You could skip the middle 40 minutes and it would still make as much sense. What was also disappointing is that many of the questions from the first Maze Runner remained unanswered. Clocking in at over two hours, it had plenty of time to do this.Scorch Trials is salvaged somewhat with an anarchic finale which was just about enough to retain interest for the franchise's concluding film. Giancarlo Esposito is also excellent in the first performance I have seen from him since Breaking Bad. However, while the first Maze Runner gave the franchise a solid foundation, Scorch Trials has unfortunately dropped the ball.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Please lower your expectations that you had from the first one before watching this one. Do yourself a favour.5/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","The film isn't good at all for it's genre and isn't good at all overall.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3351333/?ref_=tt_urv","betamalatji","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63691926/?ref_=tt_urv","8 November 2015","1) If you're going to want to watch the film because of the books, don't. They are hardly similar. As in I can literally write out integral parts of the book's plot down in the review and it wouldn't count as spoilers for the movie because they aren't included. I know that every film is different to the books, but in this case, it's extreme and the film is an entirely different story.2) If you're going to want to watch the film because of the genre, don't. For a sci-fi, it's not very creative in dialogue. It uses so many cliché terms throughout the movie that you've definitely heard in just about every other action-packed film. But more than just that, the storyline is very weak. The characters are underdeveloped so some of the things they do seem out of character. For a young- adult film, it doesn't leave you with what you're left with from Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.So yeah, the book was a best-seller and yeah it is a sci-fi young adult film but none of those things make this movie good.It seems that along with the Divergent film series, YA films have a really bad name right now.The film is not worth your time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Action packed sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3319860/?ref_=tt_urv","mateipopescu2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58789582/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2015","This movie has hyped me when i heard that The Maze Runner will become a trilogy. I expected it to be a bust but surprisingly i liked it more than the first. The movie wasn't as rushed as the first. It took slow steps to get to the final. The action was stunning but at some parts it looked and sounded like World War Z. Good effects, a great continuation to the first that will make big at the box office, believable and emotional at parts acting and an ending that will make you bite your nails until it comes out. Dylan O'Brien as good as ever and Wes Ball with his directing skills ( A really good guy, another successful book to film adaptation ) The movie had its twist and turns but it stands up, in my opinion, a sequel better than the first. More action packed, great story and awesome effects. I recommend if you are the kind of guy that likes action, but you need to see the first to understand this one. And cannot wait for the next movie The Maze Runner: The Death Cure","0 out of 4 found this helpful.
