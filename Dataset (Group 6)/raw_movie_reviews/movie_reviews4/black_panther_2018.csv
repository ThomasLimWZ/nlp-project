Perhaps the biggest is in how the villain is represented. He doesn't really play a big part until close to an hour into the film. Until then, we are entertained by a more minor villain named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). There are several stabs at humor (not unusual for a Marvel flick), and thankfully the jokes are very good-natured and funny.Speaking of the villain, he's one of the most interesting villains Marvel's put together. He's given interesting reasons behind taking over Wakanda. Michael B. Jordan gives an energetic performance that adds a layer or two more than what you might expect a villain to have. As for Boseman, he aptly provides the heart and soul of the strong but gentle-hearted character. Lupita N'yongo gives a memorable performance as the kind Nakia. Movie fans and ""Lord of the Rings""/""Hobbit"" fans, may be excited to see Martin Freeman (reprising from ""Civil War"") and Serkis together again in an interesting scene. There are a lot of characters to keep up with, however. This makes veteran actors such as Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker have less screentime than people might have hoped for.Ludwig Gorannson's score cleverly mixes African beats with some orchestral pieces. The production design and costume design carry bits and pieces of originality and uniqueness. The visual effects, like most superhero movies, are impressive, but sometimes over-the-top. The action sequences are exciting, but the camera work is a bit shaky in places.As for the usual Marvel elements, Stan Lee's cameo doesn't disappoint. And the second post-credits scene is worth waiting for.","9 out of 10 found this helpful.

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther.","133 out of 201 found this helpful.

When it was done I looked on IMDB and saw hundreds of 1 and 2 star reviews that I can only fathom were written by people who would hate anything with an almost entirely black cast that focused on a fictional or real African culture, or dislike seeing empowered women characters. Was it my favorite in the MCU? No. Are there people who give it 10 stars just because of the all black cast? Maybe. But 1 Star? Please. That's just Alt-Right spamming. It's a good contribution to the overarching MCU storyline. Worth watching.","227 out of 380 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Doesn't quite reign king","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4081649/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2018","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox","87 out of 156 found this helpful.

Critic's seem to all love it... reviews have been rave, even before the movie actually opened in Theaters. I found it funny, touching, strong as well as weak at some points... I do have to say that it has been over-hyped. It's not as good as Age of Ultron, and many of MCU releases. It didn't have a true villain we grew hatred for, Killmonger was just some angry kid to be honest. The women, do pick it up though, I'd hang a few but all of them did this movie good. Their roles infused well with the plot, and none of them disappointed me. To be honest with everyone else, I'd pretty much say that (as a black person) we loved Black Panther for it's cast and setting... Culturally - Black Panther is one of the greatest film's ever made, but Critically - It doesn't really deserve the universal acclaim. 7/10","344 out of 678 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A.","171 out of 330 found this helpful.

Over-all, this is a fun and enjoyable movie with action, comedy, drama. There are some complex social political overtones mixed in, but it never feels heavy handed, and I feel that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a whole.

The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over.

This is different, and that old formula is so tired and played at this point in the MCU. This story, the special effects, the intrigue, and the action were all superb. However, what was truly phenomenal was the acting by such a massive cast. This just doesn't happen in action, let alone super hero flicks, even today. Those who refuse to see it for the racial reason or know people like that. Tell them it really is just that good beyond the racial make-up, then tell them a White hero actually figures prominently in the end, so don't fret... ;-)","110 out of 215 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI. And let me just say that the CGI in the movie were great, as they always are in these Marvel superhero movies.All in all, an entertaining enough movie.

I love the quality of their films, they more or less always look great, and in their films we constantly see great performances and witness memorable moments. But some of their films have stories and plots that can become somewhat predictable and washed down.This is unfortunately the case with Black Panther, it is a really gorgeous film, and it has some good performances, but nothing like we saw in for example Thor Ragnarok, where Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum delivered really memorable performances and are great villains, or Kurt Russel in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2. This movie lacks a memorable villain like these.But it's not Jordan's fault, he plays the part really well, and might be the one that delivers the best performance in the entire film. But the character he plays simply isn't all that interesting or deep, and combined with a plot that is quite predictable, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect will happen, does indeed happen.But of course, the movie has it's moments, there are many scenes that are hands down great. And some action sequences are really well orchestrated, for example a long one shot action scene inside a casino, which was quite good. And there are plenty of short scenes that brings the giggles and puts a small break in the action scenes.The strongest part of the film is the visuals, it's quite obvious this movie cost a lot of money, though DC managed to spend 300.000.000$ on Justice League, and that movie looks horrible. Maybe Marvel just know how to spend their money more efficiently. But i wished they could have come up with a better story for Wakanda, though they did manage to establish the soul of T'Challa, we now know him, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, which is exactly why i recommend you to see this film.Though not by any means a perfect movie, far from it, it's still a worthy entry into the marvel universe, but don't expect any surprises, this is a straight forward film, but it's an important stepping stone before the majestic Infinity War enters theaters in about 2 months, which is not only the most expensive film ever made, but also the movie with most A list stars ever made. And it's nice to know all the character's that will face Thanos.TL;DR - Great visuals, weak story, predictable plot, not very exiting villain.6/10 - Fair","277 out of 595 found this helpful.

However, after watching Black Panther, I think I have a little hope for movies restored in me. Without going into it, the story line was easy to follow, easy enough for kids and complex enough for adults to ponder as well. The acting from every single cast member was great, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, and Danai Guirira stole the damn show. Danai Gurira's character (Okoye), I think stole the fight scenes, and I wasn't mad about it. The fight scenes were great, really took me back to the glory days of movies (without too much CGI). You definitely get character growth and development in this movie. Kudos to the director and cast for putting 100% authenticity into this movie.

My experience after watching it twice and also planning watching a third time, believe the hype.Ryan Coogler does an excellent job and the actors are incredible. He knows who his strong actors are and they deliver 110%. He made Michael B. Jordan's role as Killmonger so complex that you didn't know whether to dislike him or be on his side despite how menacing he was. I cannot wait to see him in Creed 2 so I can be reminded it that he really is a good person lol!This movie doesn't really show heavy action for Black Panther (you get that intro in Civil War) but it introduces you more to how he operates as the new king, and the choices he will have to make. However, leaves you satisfied just the same.Ludwig Gorranson who does an excellent job with the music score, is no stranger when it comes to working with Ryan, as he has worked with him in Fruitvale Station and Creed. The music score is a character within itself, as they literally speak for Black Panther/T'Challa and Killmonger during their quiet moments. The research and tours with these excellent musicians during his visits to so many countries in Africa really showed, and I understand why Coogler likes working with him.I do hope people do not fall for these bad reviews which are obviously there to try to scare people away. My parents are not even into comics and they enjoyed every second. For a lengthy movie, it didn't even feel like you were there that long. Go see the movie for yourselves. Everyone isn't lying when you hear the majority saying something is that great.","155 out of 316 found this helpful.

So I will keep it 100 percent positive i.e. all things good. I want to start with positivity. It was a good movie. Solid 7/10.Chadwick Boseman, playing the protagonist King T'Challa/Black Panther, has nailed the parts of ""a good man"", ""king"" and ""warrior"". The Kingship, channeled through his acting, peaked in the scene where he raises his voice in front of the preceding black panthers (in 2nd limbo/dream/ other world sequence) to make a point, his point, a point to bring change, a point that challenges the orthodox thoughts of the preceding Kings/Black Panthers. That is the sequence when the audience learns that the King has arrived(BAM!!).
Killmonger, the antagonist , has also been acted very well. Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger, brought a mean/maniacal/destroyer look to him, which was enhanced by the upper body scars created by the makeup department, each scar stood for a kill. (There may be a technical term for the scars, Please comment if you know). Martin Freeman's character could have been more explored, because to me his look was too similar to BBC Sherlock's Dr. Watson. I was getting confused as to why or what Dr. Watson was doing in Wakanda? (Watson-Wakanda, maybe there is some connection.)There were multiple story arcs that were pondered upon in the film. The rise of a king, the revenge of an outcast (outcasted without his fault), a general's loyalty towards throne or the man sitting on the throne, a son dealing with demons created by his father and many more. On a personal note, I think the arc of Killmonger could have easily been taken to some other direction. His character has got such enriched background and history that so much more could have been done with his character.The visual effects were superb. Scenes such as the entrance to Wakanda, the dreamland/limbo sequence, the Black panther cave, the Vibranium structured city stood out amongst many others.Another uplifting thing about the movie was the comedy. The comedy that erupted between King brother and prodigy-scientist sister and between Dr.watson and Man-ape/M'Baku were the ones that stood out for me. I could narrate some of them in fresh fashion but I do not want to spoil the joke! So just watch it yourself.Costume design in the movie is another area that must be applauded. The Black Panther's costume is like Deadpool's costume. There is nothing fake about it. You don't need to CGI it. You can put a jacked dude in that costume and you've got yourselves a Black panther, looking person. It just feels real. The vibrant costumes worn by all the cast such as Queen mother and different tribes and people of Wakanda had a fresh feel to it. The costume design was as unique as Wakanda is supposed to be.Overall a good movie. Worth a watch in a theatre.SUMMARY- A ""good MAN"" must become flexible in his/her ways if duties of ""a king"" are to be performed aptly.","32 out of 60 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Overhyped but entertaining.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4253863/?ref_=tt_urv","NpMoviez","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69508929/?ref_=tt_urv","26 July 2018","Well, here's a movie that's hated by a number of people as a result of it being overhyped. It was fairly entertaining and decent. Just that it wasn't worth all the hype. The only thing it has to be a unique MCU film would be that it had was the majority of people from black community as its cast members. I am not criticizing that, but that's NOT a legit reason to hype it up so much.Good.
It was whatever the first Thor movie couldn't be. In other words, it was ""Thor"" (2011) on Wakanda and better. It has some fantasy elements regarding the ""Black Panther formula"" and at the same time, it is quite of a sci fi too, and on the sideline it's also a crime film. These themes hold together very cohesively and make the movie a solid piece of art, on the whole. For the first time in an MCU movie, a villain was good. Killmonger is probably my second favorite MCU villain till date, the first one being Thanos. That character was well written to say the least. We knew where he was coming from, his motives, what he is up to and why. He is the best part of this movie. Many of the heist and crime film vibes it had was very interesting in the scenario they set up for this movie. The character interactions and the dynamic between various characters were good. Some funny scenes and dialogues land properly (while some don't, it's an MCU movie, after all). While watching this film, you won't want to skip any part of it, even though, in the end, you might be saying, ""is that it?! Dafuq?!!"" But most importantly, it gives you a really good introduction to Black Panther. We can get behind this hero for good. The character arc they give to him is excellent.Mixed.
A lot of it feels like parts of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The ""sci fi"" part feels quite like the stuff going on between Batman and Fox. The establishment of the character of Killmonger was (in an undertone) similar to how we got introduced to The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" or to Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Also, some scenes are quite similar to interrogation scenes of ""The Dark Knight"". I am not saying that it was a ripoff of Nolan's films. It might be the same in the source material they adapted, I don't know. But noticing those themes being dealt in a similar way, makes it kind of a mixed bag. The movie, also, apparently ""kills"" off a character, which doesn't feel so compelling because they were to be back in future films (which had already been announced or were seen in the trailer of Infinity War). Not saying that the way they killed off the character was bad. If we didn't know about him being back in Infinity War, it would've made a solid impact. But, we know about him being back. So, it wasn't much interesting.Bad.
Many fights and scenes in the film are super clichéd. Not only that you can predict what will happen, you can even predict what kind of a dialogue will close that scene, and what will be the immediate consequence for the character who gave that piece of dialogue. The third act of the movie was just plain generic third act of a superhero movie with a lot of clichés and dumbed down ""Captain America: Civil War"" conditions with some of kind of ""Lord of the Rings"" vibe.Conclusion.
""Black Panther"", for me, was some kind of a mixed bag. It was surely overhyped, but wasn't so bad of an overhyped movie. On the whole, a solid entertainer. Not something like Infinity War or Iron Man or Avengers or Civil War that will be talked for a long time.Rating.

1. It's Marvel. Even a middling MCU venture is still worth the price of admission.
2. It looks sensational. Everything just looked really, really cool. The city, the technology, the natural splendor, the costumes, etc. Very, very cool.
3. It's something different. Basing a movie and a superhero franchise in Africa is refreshingly different.
4. Little sister. The ""Q"" of Black Panther. Tough not to love her.
5. Angela Basset is as lovely as ever. Lead actor was terrific.
6. Pretty good plot twist.DISLIKE:
1. I fear this whole superhero genre is starting to reach the end of its tether. All of the story elements are just starting to feel a little stale.
2. Although very good, Black Panther is nowhere near as good as X-Men, Avengers, Ragnarok, Spider-Man, and almost any other MCU production.
3. It seemed like it was pretty difficult to break away from the tentacles of The Lion King. It was really tough not to be thinking about it though the movie.
4. The racial elements seemed a little heavy-handed and clumsy.
5. I think I'm getting Forrest Whitaker fatigue.
6. These superhero flicks really need to reevaluate what a climactic fight scene is supposed to be. I was getting bored out of my mind during the last twenty minutes.
7. The opening weekend hype was pretty ridiculous.Overall though, another trophy on Marvel's overflowing, jam-packed shelf. Go see it, if and when you have the time. Just bear in mind it's nowhere as good as the public was led to believe.","44 out of 88 found this helpful.

Although It trys to grasp at the idea of western colonialism and racism, it only scratches the surface never really deciding were it stands. Although this has been championed as one of they greatest diverse films it is not and I would recommend you to check out '12 years a Slave' , 'Get Out' or 'Moonlight' who do a much better job than this meager attempt. The plot is by the numbers the direction is nothing special. Chadwick Boseman's acting is rather stilted and you can never attach to his character. Michael B Jordan is a one note villian who also struggles, phoning in a performance spouting monologues about messages that never really click. But where the movie really falls on its face is the third act which is cgi heavy and looks like its out of a video game. Black Panther by no means is terrible its below average and the concept of Wakanda is an excellent and well excuted idea. But this movie just needs to go that little bit deeper and seprate itself from the tired superhero formula.","93 out of 200 found this helpful.

All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners.","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

So I went to see the movie expecting it to be another good movie from MCU ( you have to admit they do have a good track record). And what I got instead was pure gold. 
I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie. Hollywood movies always paint Africa in colors that matches its name under British colonization, ""The Dark Continent"". We see movies of slave trade, blood soaked diamond industry, starvation and poverty. I've always wondered this can't be all that Africa has to offer. Though it is based in a mythical country and superpowers, it gave us a glimmer of what Africa would have looked like if European and middle eastern invaders sucked it dry of it's resources. In black panther we see a world set in Africa with bare minimal of those usual stereotypes about the continent. It is a breath of fresh air.The splash of color was a balm to the eyes and music, well i might need to write another review about how good music in this movie was. The end credits score for the movie was phenomenal.
Every character had his\her moment to shine. And all the actors did their characters justice. Black Panther's little sister Shuri was a delight to watch. Micheal B Jordan as the Killmonger was exceptional and up their with Loki when it comes to Marvel villains.","94 out of 192 found this helpful.

That is not to say it is bad, because there are many things that it does right. The soundtrack is easily the most interesting of any film in the MCU, as it uses a combination of typical superhero/action movie score, African tribal music, and modern hip-hop that blends very well together. Also, the acting and characters are done very well, with three standout performances. Lupita N'yongo is great, Andy Serkis is exuberant, and Michael B. Jordan portrays one of the most interesting villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and he provides a great foil with a potent motivation that is presented as pretty obvious social commentary. But even though it is on-the-nose, I did appreciate that the film actually attempted to get political. However, it is not without flaws. The first half drags a bit with a mix of dialogue-heavy scenes and generic action scenes. In fact, the action scenes throughout the film, save for the car chase and a fight between Kilmonger and Black Panther, are very bland. The filmmakers tried to recreate the same style of action that worked so well in The Winter Soldier, but they fell flat with some poor lighting, lack of grit, and CGI overload (particularly at the end). Overall, the movie is presented in a very generic way, with many of the same beats you would expect from every other superhero movie in the cinematography and editing. Despite these issues, I thought the positives outweighed the flaws and that the movie was an entertaining experience. I'd give it a strong 6/10.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason

heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,

There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself.It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them.Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music.Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date. Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challla's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored.","81 out of 169 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa in this film who is the King of wakanda, an African Country that is hidden by technology. Michael B. Jordan plays a kid a kid from California, Erik Killmonger, who believes that he has been cheated from the throne and decides that he will challenge T'Challa for it. These characters both want to prove they are not possers of the power and are not pushovers.
This movie was fairly entertaining, it had very good visual effects and fun action scenes. The movie just didn't hit that big not for me that it seemed to by everyone else. I had fun watching the film but I didn't think that it was great in anysense if the matter. The story seemed like a very played out of a man who thinks he should be king so he fights the king for it, just with superpowers. It was fun but again just not the best superhero film of the year or the past couple of years.
This movie came out early last year following the huge buzz that was Captain America: Civil War, where the Black Panther was introduced. The movie didn't need to be another origin story and it wasn't so I give props to the filmmakers for that part of it. I just do not see how this movie got nominated for an oscar, all of the performances were fine, the dialogue was fine and the story was fine.
All aspects of this film were done great, I believe with the script that the movie had it did the best it could on every level. The editing and sound were put together well to create seamless scenes and fights. All of the dialogue seemed real, for the most part. Not that the lines weren't written well, but the film takes place in an African Country and have been in that country forever, advancing far past the world, and staying hidden, but they all speak english. This is something that bothers me in a lot of movies, it might be very convenient but why don't they speak some African language, they have accents. Even the tribe that lives up into the mountains who seem to be a little primitive, when looking at how far they have advanced looking at how the other tribes have, they speak english as well throughout the film. Other than that though technically this film is very well done.
Going through and watching this film There was a scene that I really enjoyed, the scene in which Erik challenges T'Challa for his throne. The scene takes place in the throne room, Erik is taken into the the room where he is being prosecuted. Only to find out that his has rights to be the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther. The camera use in this scene is very minimal, just cuts to who is talking going back and forth. It is a very common technique used to just show what everyone's thinking and feeling and that was probably the best way to go with this scene as what was happening was shocking a lot of people so all of their emotions. There is nothing notable about the lighting, the scene is in a room with a big window during the day so you can see everyone's face well. What I like about this scene is something that has been done a million times over is the build up with music until you find out what Erik was hiddining from them when he revealed his blood right and that he wanted to be the king. Just a simple build up in music before that delivery was done well. The pacing in this scene was fun to watch everything seemed fine and going a nice pace, then once they start to exchange information back and forth the camera cuts begin to speed up. From this scene which has no action you can see that on a technical aspect there are zero problems with this film. Another problem this film didn't have was acting, there was an all star cast. Everyone does really well to make their character believable and give true emotions for what is happening and what might happen for them in the future.
I have only seen this film three times, in the theaters, once when I caught it on tv and when I just rewatched it this week to give a review, I do not have that big of a problem with the film, I am not a big fan of it though, as I have said I think that there are better superhero films, even better redemption films, which is a big element of this movie.
With all of these different grips with the movie i do not want to give the impression that I hate this movie, just a tad bit overrated. I enjoyed it for the most part and if you like the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than you would probably enjoy this film as well. If i was tot give this a film a rating from one to ten I would say 6/10.

For me the best aspect of it are the political and social themes that underpin the characters and their motivations. To have a story so explicit about the historical treatment of African peoples and the plight of African communities around the world as a main stream cinematic event is a breath of fresh air.There are numerous strong, positive, non-clichéd, male and female African characters, in a movie led by an African Marvel superhero. The main protagonist journeys through an arc that leads him to an important decision that impacts the entire world. The antagonist is complex and fighting a cause worth fighting for, but in the wrong way. Through this it delivers an important message that is very relevant in today's divided world.Within the seriousness there is a lot of humour through dialogue and performances. Shuri has some great moments of witty banter along with Everett Ross and M'Baku.The visuals are for me a mixed bag. I love the cinematography, colours, lighting and editing in many scenes. Whilst the effects are brilliant in some parts I find the CGI action spectacle at times to be cartoonish, distracting and over the top. This for me hurts a film that carries such importance, as the messages get lost in mess of video game type spectacle.On a more positive note, the performances from all cast are excellent. Chadwick Boseman is every inch the title character, whilst Michael B Jordan is up there with the best of the Marvel antagonists. The supporting cast are superb with Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Angela Bassett, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Winston Duke, Daniel Kaluuya and Martin Freeman all perfect in their respective roles.It is a 7.5/10 for me but I round upwards.","32 out of 62 found this helpful.

Of the main characters, only 2 are Caucasian, the rest of the cast (including almost all of the supporting cast and the extras) - AND the Director are people of color. This has, rightfully so, created a ""buzz"" about the significance of this. It is a watershed moment for SuperHero films (much like last year's WONDER WOMAN was a watershed for a female led SuperHero film). But the question remains - is it a good film?The answer: Good Enough.Diving deeper into the character/hero T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) who was first introduced in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film, we learn more about the backstory of this man/character as well as the world in which he lives and the burdens he bears. It also, interestingly enough, pretty much ignores the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for much of it's 2 hour 14 minute timeline. It mostly concerns itself with interior issues in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda and I think this tactic is a welcome relief from the giant, CGI-laden, characters-heavy Marvel films of recent memory.Director/Writer Ryan Coogler (CREED/FRUITVALE STATION) decides to focus the attention of this film inward, rather than outward and we are rewarded with a rich, Shakespearean family drama that works because of it's simplicity.Much of the effectiveness is due to the charismatic cast that has been drawn to this picture because of the significance of it as well as the richness of the characters they inhabit. Bozeman is regal and strong in the title role - no hint of the suffering, ""I don't want this"" SuperHero angst so often seen in these types of film. Academy Award winner Lupito Nyong'o joins in just as strong and independently as Nakia a ""Spy"" and erstwhile romantic foil for T'Challa - though Coogler is wise to avoid the ""will they/won't they"" cliche as well as eliminates, entirely, the ""damsel in distress"" subplot that would have been so tempting.Helping these two out are a veritable ""who's who"" of actors of color - Angela Bassett, Forrest Whitaker, current Best Actor nominee Daniel Kaluuya and Sterling K. Brown - all turn out for fun (albeit brief) turns where each one of them gets a chance to show what they can do. Special notice should be made to Danai Gurira (TV's kick-ass Michonne in THE WALKING DEAD) as Okoye - T'Challa's chief general and bodyguard who must choose duty over honor (or does she) and, especially, Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger, wise-cracking sister - who also happens to be the ""Q"" of this film. She jumped off the screen and shone brightly (but not so bright as to wash things out) in every scene she was in.And...of course...there is Coogler favorite Michael B. Jordan (he's been in all of Coogler's major motion picture) as the villain of the piece - Erik Killmonger (the name says it all). Jordan does a nice job of bringing 3 dimensions to a character that was written a little too 2 dimension-ally, if you ask me. This character could have just been an ""angry young man"" cliche, but with Jordan, he becomes something much, much more.This being a Marvel SuperHero film, the Special Effects are terrific, showing a highly secretive, highly technolized Wakanda that is hidden beneath the surface.Is it a perfect film? Well...no. This is, in essence, a ""family drama"" with some hi-tech action scenes and the obligatory ""two armies fighting"" finale, and while the acting is good enough to hold interest throughout, I would have liked to have seen a little more action thrown in.But...ignoring the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a good move - as was casting such strong, believable and likeable film actors.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","31 out of 60 found this helpful.

I don't understand all the negative reviews, its obvious some are just DC fans hating on the movie and some people are just nitpicking very small things, but of course the movie does have flaws. I am a big Marvel fan and a very big fan of the MCU, when I go to see movies in theaters I normally have high expectations as many people do, with Black Panther I did as well. What makes a movie good is different between every single person though i have very high expectations as long as the movie has a good plot, great fight scenes and characters I will be impressed whether i have high expectations or not. Black Panther had a good plot, it does not bore you and keeps you interested but it isn't unique it can be predictable and a bit cliche but throughout the movie i was very interested and wanted to carry on watching . The whole idea of ""Wakanda"" is great and is different from normal superhero movies.Characters are very great in this movie, Chadwick Boseman's character T'Chala was great through out the whole movie, he showed that he wanted to be king and had great chemistry between other characters. Considering T'Chala was introduced in Civil War he's character was developed but through Black Panther he's character develops slowly. Chadwick Boseman once again was excellent playing the character. The Villain Erik Kill-Monger was really good he was intimidating and he's ambitions were clear, although it was slightly cliche he was fantastic! Michael B Jordan did an amazing job and acting was good throughout. I don't want to make this too long but characters had good chemistry between each others and are very likable.To summarize this movie the plot was good,characters were fantastic because they had a good casting choice as well as brilliant chemistry among each other, fight scenes were bad ass and make you love the character BP even more.the jokes throughout this movie are not overused and not forced its just the good old marvel humor as well as the script was well written. Of course this movie did have it flaws the final fight scene between the protagonist and antagonist was disappointing and heavy CGI was used and it was obvious the characters were full CGI and the fight could have been much better. (also forgot to mention CGI was great in the movie at times it wasn't the best but shouldn't bother you) there was probably a few plot holes and predictable at times but didn't bother me too much.Overall the movie was fantastic and you should watch it, of course there are flaws but to me it did not bother me and i was entertained throughout, as I said before we all look differently to movies I said I have high expectations and the movies flaws did not make the movie bad for me but that's usually for most movies. Go watch this movie, lives up to the hype and you will love the character BP more!","47 out of 96 found this helpful.

Following the death of his father during ""Captain America: Civil War"", T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned its new King. He discovers that agents both within and outside of his homeland believe that the country should be doing more with their advanced science and technology to help the oppressed around the world. At the same time, Wakanda's most wanted, the only man to see hidden treasures and escape its borders, Ulysses Klaue, commits a daring robbery and may finally be vulnerable to capture. It's a beautiful looking film, and feels authentic to the region, even though Wakanda is a fictional land. Its debates about the morality of interference outside its feels like a genuine cause of conflict and Killmonger, excellently played by Michael B Jordan, is a villain whose motivation you believe in, even if the MCU's villain was/is family to the hero trope is again in force. However, I did find myself feeling at times that it was a bit po-faced, especially when compared to last years near comedies of ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" and ""Thor Ragnorok"", though the times when it is funny, usually revolving around Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister - Shuri - usually hit the mark. Another criticism I'd have for the film would be the editing, particularly in the earlier fight scenes. Modern action films are plagued by fight scenes shot too tight on the participants, which creates for a kinetic energy but, to my taste, makes it difficult to determine what's actually happening. Fortunately, for me, this stopped in the later fight scenes. Also, and very unusually for the MCU films, the CGI is occasionally a little subpar, particularly in the climactic battle. Though not breaking into my personal top five films of the MCU, there is much to enjoy with the characters and plenty of story scope for Black Panther 2.","19 out of 37 found this helpful.

Black Panther is a special film in a number of ways. Not only is it the 18th Marvel film and the last one before the big third outing for the Avengers, but it's big for black culture and Afrofuturism, being the first big blockbuster superhero film featuring a black lead and, more importantly, a nearly all black cast (and crew). It's a step in the right direction for an increasingly out-dated and politically incorrect Hollywood, with arrogant 'white males' quivering in their seats. More than this, Black Panther is an incredible movie, more than a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The aesthetics are inspiring, every inch of Wakanda utterly African, each scene evoking a strong and exemplary sense of Afrofuturism. Black Panther is absolutely committed to the African cultures it portrays and the effect is not only different, but visually stunning and incredibly colourful. More importantly, it never feels forced, gimmicky or frequently mentioned, constantly reminding people how PC they are. Instead the blend of African cultures embodied in Wakanda feels natural and organic and its detail is wonderful at every level.In fact the aesthetics throughout the whole film are gorgeous. CGI, as expected in a film of this calibre, is second-to-none, but the cinematography alongside really captures the beauty of Wakanda, the wonders of a fictional technologically-advanced African country brought to life. Wakanda, stunning as it is, also feels fresh; Black Panther isn't just another superhero film with the titular character fighting their way across New York City. This freshness stretches throughout the whole movie, making it seem like a new kind of superhero film and putting to rest any doubts that Marvel's films could become stale or repetitive.It is a Marvel film though so there are some aspects that we come to expect; some that are welcome and some that are happily missing in this movie. One is the comedy, which is abundant throughout Black Panther. With plenty of laughs from beginning to end - coming from M'Baku (Winston Duke) and Shuri in particular - it helps in allowing Black Panther to fit effortlessly into the broader personality of the MCU. Origin stories are also expected in superhero films, but here that is forgone, something that adds to its strength. It never gets bogged down in origins or unnecessary details explaining comic book lore; instead, like with Spider-Man: Homecoming, it just gets going and tells us what we need to know as it goes, letting exposition fit neatly into the film and never letting it slow down the pace. Superhero action too is worthy of praise as it is some of the best we've seen yet. With multiple films of this genre coming out every year, it's understandably becoming difficult to impress an audience. However Black Panther has a slightly more fresh approach to its action; not too deep-rooted in unrealistic sci-fi/fantasy, the action is fast-paced, fun to watch and brilliantly choreographed with varied action. This latter point is largely down to Black Panther being almost an ensemble film. While the focus of the story and a lot of the action is on T'Challa, he's not the sole interest of the film. Instead we often see him fighting alongside Nakia, Okoye and even sometimes Shuri. Each with different personalities as well as fighting styles, this lends a varied approach to the fight scenes and make them so much more interesting to watch. Yet the highlight is still the titular Black Panther, with expert martial arts and gymnastics blending together to be an absolute joy.The joy doesn't stop with the action though. The quiet times are sometimes just as much fun, with the cast clearly having a blast. Chadwick Boseman builds on his debut in Captain America: Civil War, still retaining the characterisation from that film, but expanding it and making us love this character even more. Wise, strong and determined, he makes a fine King for Wadanda; but funny, sweet and loyal, he makes a fine superhero for the MCU. Boseman excels at bringing out all sides of T'Challa and we can't wait to see more of him in later this year with the rest of the MCU by his side. By his side this time though are a fine group of characters who could maybe even give the Avengers a run for their money. Okoye has a harsh-edge to her and watching her fight is incredible, yet Danai Gurira gives us a soft edge that she only reveals occasionally, making her enigmatic character more appealing. Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o too bring so much personality to the film, often stealing scenes from the titular hero himself. Michael B. Jordan makes a worthy antagonist, actually being one of Marvel's best villains yet. Since their history of villains hasn't been great to date, you could assume that that isn't too high an accolade, but despite that he is a sympathetic villain with a likeable, funny side - the sort of villainy that made us all love Loki - supported by fellow bad guy, Andy Serkis returning as Klaue. Though not appearing much, he certainly makes his mark and lives up to the character's reputation. Martin Freeman's return as Ross is also very welcome and never a gimmicky, unnecessary reference to the wider MCU; instead he is allowed to develop a part that was too small in Civil War. This time he fits in organically and his American accent is as impressive as Andy Serkis' South African.It's safe to say that all the hype for Black Panther was worth it because it really is everything we wanted it to be. With exciting and varied non-stop action, plenty of comedy and an excellent ensemble of characters it fits into the rest of the Marvel cannon seamlessly. And while this one forgoes the sometimes unnecessary origin story, dives into a great plot and actually gives us an enjoyable villain, the best thing that stands out about Black Panther is how fresh it feels and looks and how committed it is to the inclusion of African culture and inclusivity. Yet again Marvel have delivered another outstanding film that instantly soars towards the top of the list.","40 out of 82 found this helpful.

The argument as to whether a nation as powerful as Wakanda has the right to remain an isolationist nation; or the moral obligation to help those other struggling nations around them was very thought provoking. The movie was very well acted with Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger being the standout in the cast.  The action and special affects were top flight.. It had just the right amount of humor so as to add levity to film without turning it into a complete comedy like most Marvel films tend to do.

The hype around this film, almost gave it an impenetrable force-field for negativity. Coogler and the creative team set themselves up for a lot of clear nitpicks, due to the predictability, extra dose of plot armor, and a decent amount of plot gaps and filler. With Ryan Coogler being one of the best up and coming directors in the game, he didn't really impress me here, but he still kept that Marvel vibe going, while adding in a lot of his own spices, sprinkled throughout the film. He made this more of a stand-alone film, but he tied in some nice, subtle references from the saga. Coogler utilized this huge cultural aspect, that worked well with the film's premise, while not jamming it down your throat, every opportunity they got. The issue with the premise; Yeah, it may have had a few enjoyable moments, and interesting ideas, but it felt exactly like The Lion King, just in a superhero format. The way that Ryan Coogler structured and placed the scenes, just didn't flow right, having a real choppy pace, making it feel like two different films, on some occasions. With just a couple of scene swaps, I feel like this film would've already been that much better. With the pace being one of the couple downfalls of the film, it brought the twist aspect of the film drastically downward, considering it was presented very sloppy and forceful.Sarah Finn had her hands full, again, by casting this wonderful group of talent. All of the characters were really fun, bringing all their A-games to the big screen, but the creative team had a tough time trying to balance everyone. One of the biggest issues of the film, is that the Coogler and Cole did their best to make everyone equally important, but it doesn't carry much weight, because you lose a lot of the value in the main characters, that we should be worried about, so when it comes to a high stakes moment, that feeling gets somewhat diminished. Chadwick Boseman is a fine protagonist, that's easy to root for, due to his backstory, with a great heart and wits, but he can get kind of boring and bland at times. He has more than enough to do, but he doesn't do much at all, until the final act. His character development was very predictable, and fast paced, by the end of the film, it doesn't really feel like we know that much more about him. With how his character is written aside, Boseman puts on a really good performance as T'Chala/Black Panther, fitting the Avengers like a glove. With Letitia Wright as Shuri, having the best chemistry with Boseman, she was one of the most entertaining characters, the film had to offer. Although she was nothing more than a plot device, she was a really nice addition, bringing some fun laughs, and great wit to the film. Danai Gurira was another great addition to the film, bringing this amazing women power feel. She was an excellent compliment to everyone, while serving her purpose well. Danai Gurira may have overcooked her performance just a little bit, but she was one of the best additions to the film. Lupita Nyong'o was the biggest disappointment of the film. Nyong'o is one of the best actresses in the game, but her character was written so poorly, being one of the biggest wasted potential of the film. Her character had a lot to offer, but due to insignificant writing, her character felt unconnected. Forrest Whittaker, Angela Bassett, Winston Duke, and Martin Freeman all had their own things to do, fitting their roles nicely, but they were all used strictly as plot devices. We finally got another taste of Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, and he stole every scene that he's in! While not having the most screen time, he made the most out of it, serving his purpose really well! Our main antagonist of the film, being one of the best villains on the MCU, is Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. Every single time he's in frame, he brings this dominant presence, being a real savage and memorable villain. The screenwriters did a great job fleshing out his motive, making it easy to get behind his character, and somewhat understandable why he's doing what he's doing. The only issue I had with his character, I just needed more of him. If they added little sprinkles of him through the long duration of when he wasn't around, it would've made things a lot more tense and exciting.The screenplay by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole did a pretty decent job overall, but there was a few holes that needed some patching up. The way they attacked the emotional aspect of the film, just didn't click right with the premise, feeling pretty weak, and dry. The humor was here and there, but it thankfully wasn't over saturated, because it wouldn't have worked with this film.One of the best things about this film, is the production. Coogler crafted these beautiful scenery shots, with so many bright colors that just pop off the screen at all times. This is one of the prettiest films the MCU has released, on the side of Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange.The action was really just okay. They had some fun combat scenes, but the overwhelming amount of CGI, almost completely threw me out of the film. The CGI was just super clunky, with a lot of pieces that looked unfinished. The score and soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson, was really enjoyable. It fit really well with the scheme of the film, enhancing every scene that it is included in.Overall, I do not hate Black Panther, but this film definitely has more than enough flaws to be talked about.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

This review is my tribute to Chadwick.This is one of my most favorite films in MCU. This is one of the best films in MCU when it comes to storytelling. The biggest strength of this movie is the characters and their motivations. The outline of the story looks like a throne fight between two brothers but inside it is more than you think.Chadwick stars as the titular character and fits that role perfectly. As a king, he chooses what is best for his people and also the world but he is the same king as previous kings in Wakanda. Everything changes when the killmonger arrives.Both Hero and villain journey are more than interesting. The film respects African people and their culture, history. This is one of the MCU movies with a lot of female characters and justifies them. Black Panther is a triumph of universal appeal and demographic specificity.The film is comparatively light on action, and the pacing occasionally stumbles in the back half, but the sharp character work and rich production design make up for nitpicks here and there. And when the action does arrive, it is brutal and to the point, with a second-act car chase combining real-world action with Wakandian technology that I could watch on a loop for hours on end.The first act is dedicated to setting up the world of Wakanda (an isolated nation shielded from the outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably a What if Africa had never been colonized fantasy) and T'Challa's from prince to king coronation process.After we get a real introduction to our key villain (Michael B. Jordan) that we really get down to business. The movie asks knotty questions about reaching out to help those like you who have been persecuted, even if you yourself have escaped the world's subjugation and thrived by virtue of your invisibility. In a time of great social and political upheaval, the question of how much allies should be expected to sacrifice even if the rot hasn't personally affected them yet may be the defining moral question of our time.The film keeps its righteous anger mostly in the hands of its villain, and it works as a rousing superhero adventure for kids who want to see a black superhero doing the superhero thing. But it is still refreshing to see a Walt Disney superhero movie taking for granted that America is intrinsically detrimental to black lives.Black Panther is a fine stand-alone action drama that deals with the consequences of a modern civilization made possible by widespread colonization.The cinematography also very neat and the visuals were stunning. The ancestral plane sequences were top notch. The first fight between Tchalla and kill monger is well choreographed the end fight is full of CGI. The production design and costumes perfectly suited the African nation. The musical score is one of the biggest elements in this film. Salutes to Ryan coogler for this Marvelous movie.Thanks for giving one of the unforgettable heroic role #RIPCHADWICKBOSEMAH.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

That is false in my opinion - Thor Ragnorok and Guardians 2 were by far the best so far - full of action, humor, and good stories. Black Panther movie does not even do much for the cinematic universe as it all takes place in Wakanda. The end credit scenes do tie it in but that's it really. PROS :

I have gone online and read multiple reviews about how it's one of the best of the 18 MCU movies to date and for me, it's not even in my Top 5. I've been trying to figure out why it didn't do it for me, and I'm not sure maybe it's because it comes right after Thor Ragnarok (best MCU movie so far), or it comes before Infinity War (we've all seen the trailer, like give it to us already!) I feel the first 30 minutes or so was a drag, albeit the cinematography and costumes were astounding (google the Filipino influence on the female warriors' costume), but was necessary in order to setup the movie but I didn't get reeled in until maybe Laetitia Wright as Shuri, the black princess (Disney's 2nd, progress!) that can give Tony Stark a run for his money (literally and figuratively) showed up and somewhat stole the show. Danai Gurira imposed herself very well as Okoye, Black Panther's General and leader of the fierce all-female badass army Dora Milaje. Lupita Nyong'o held her own as the requisite ""damsel in distress"", Daniel Kaluuya as BP's right hand man (hated him but still love him) and last but not the least, Michael B. Jordan who I'm thankful they rescued from the dreaded Fantastic Four reboot as one of the movie's antagonist. You know who I'm not raving about? Chadwick Boseman. He seemed okay in Civil War and I don't know if he had to stay stiff because he was royalty but he was boring as a brick. As in don-the-suit-already-and-scratch-my-eye kind of boring. I was actually thinking Chiwetel Ejiofor would've been a better choice but he's already come up as Mordo in Dr. Strange. Storyline was interesting and current, fight scenes were worth the wait, the ending could've been better but is good enough.So to recap, good movie, great visuals, impressive supporting cast, exhilarating fight scenes and we want a Shuri, Tony Stark face off.Favorite quote: We must find a way to look after each other, as if we were one single tribe.","24 out of 47 found this helpful.

The world thinks so and the proof is in the box office sales: another $100 million on it's SECOND weekend in theaters.The problem is that seeing powerful, wealthy, advanced black society just doesn't sit well with some people and that's what these overwhelmingly negative reviews on IMDB mostly reflect...shock, discomfort, disbelief. People are using this forum to talk down this movie (they actually promised to do so BEFORE the movie debuted) and vent frustration over seeing blacks achieve, whether it's the black director and black cast or the fictitious characters they've portrayed. For once, they've made a big-budget movie about Africa that isn't about slavery or people dying of disease and being ravaged by war and poverty....and some rac*st folks just can't get behind that. Because that's not the Africa they know and believe in. They'll tell you their only problem is with the plot, the action, too much hype, etc. Sure...Cool story. Be above that kind of pettiness and go treat yourself to a top notch entertainment experience. It's just a movie, you're not conceding any sort of victory to black people by you simply enjoying a good show.","51 out of 114 found this helpful.

I welcomed this like a breeze of fresh air, and not only because of the aforementioned diversity of the characters but because of the quality of the movie as such. After being misrepresented lately by dull and ridiculous movies like the last installments of Captain America and Thor, the famous entertainment company can now promote Black Panther as a good sign of recovery.Well acted, fun, humorous and passionate movie. This time Marvel allocates the epic and eternal battle of good and evil in the African continent, having its people as the protagonists of the story. Combining science fiction and fantasy, the decently written script leads the spectators through a well passed course of actions, supported with outstanding visual effects and a colorful and imaginative depiction of a richly recreated African universe.A most welcome addition to a cinematic universe in need of fresh renovation.","27 out of 57 found this helpful.

Though Facebook took that group down, the completely fabricated and racially tinged dislike of this movie by many of the 3 and below star reviews makes it obvious the plan was still a go. I love the Marvel universe films, and this one did not disappoint. The CGI and effects were just as good as any other film, the fight and action scenes were just as well choreographed. If anything the hand to hand combat scenes were more impressive than I've seen in a Marvel movie in a long time. Most of the time people are wearing their uniforms etc..., not shirtless on a waterfall. The story line was one of the most complicated and multilayered in Marvel history. And for those who don't believe a superhero movie should have any politics in it: Are you Serious? What IS a superhero movie without some political agenda. You are literally going to the movies to watch superhumans who are supposed to save the world! Where was this dislike of political agenda with the Hydra/Nazi storyline that has been on going for Captain America and the like? Was that not politics? The fight to stop the resurgence of a radical enemy who tried to take over the world and is still operating today? Come on Son! The biggest problem many will have when they see this film is perspective. If you are someone who can't relate to characters that don't look and sound like you- then don't see this movie. If you have a larger less myopic world view, you'll enjoy this. By the way, my theater was ethnically mixed, and we laughed all the way thru the film. If you are only going to ""hate watch it"" then don't go. Save your money. As for the political agenda- the only one I see is situating an Brown Skinned Superhero at the center of a superhero story. One who comes from privilege and not poverty. Offering little children of color to see themselves reflected on screen in a positive and empowering light. Giving them the idea there is a place for them in the super hero catalog. If that is a radical political message you don't support- that says way more about you than the film. And what it says isn't good.","27 out of 56 found this helpful.

The black community barely has any past, not to mention modern super hero's, it's not a race thing but for real. No one said Ant-man, Thor The Dark World, justice league, Wonder Woman and Venom was overrated. It's actually underrated because of the amount of people calling it overrated. Black panther isn't your typical marvel film, it tells a symbolic story of power,pride, loyalty and honor. It's obvious we come from different lifestyles and won't be able to understand each other, cause your so used to having things your way and everything having to do about you that when you see something different you don't know how to act.. because it's out of your normal supremacy reach. Black panther has been a influential character in the Marvel comics since the 60s it was based on the comics. Blame Stan Lee A WHITE MAN for the story. All the racial bias this movie is receiving is why the movie is so successful you bunch of ignorant bashing fools, on top of the fact that it actually was a well made film it also circulates around an entire race of people, culture and continent exist. It envisions something that can and could be possible and it takes the viewers imagination to a different world that people enjoyed and it's a lot only cause it had an entire black cast as I read many ignorant people here saying. the fact that all of these negative people can't appreciate what Black Panther has meant to the world and are instead focused on their own ignorant biases scheme is sad. You can hate all you want but that doesn't change all the achievement it has won.

Some Shoots were too dark and some scenes had some annoying jump cuts, so overall it was decent to good, and maybe one great action scene. The pacing of the movie was odd at certain times, but nothing that can damage the movie.Very solid acting all over the place, even from minor supporting cast. They were able to introduce some comedy through the personality of some characters organically, and sometimes the females characters took the movie and had great spotlight's, making the main character look like a secondary character.The Villain...oh my, take Loki away, this is the best villain that MCU has right now (for me, even better than Loki). That is very apparent when you can understand and agree at some extent with is point of view. Even when you know his plans will bring chaos to the world, maybe because of his charisma, you want him to win at some extent.Great shoots of Wakanda and great world building.Great Story, with political views, they even manage to give appropriate screen time to all the characters, with essential dialogues and action.I will give it a 8.0/10.It´s definitly a very good comic movie, but i need to see it again, to make a final judgement. Right now, is not better then The Avengers, CA: WS or CA: CW (this 3 are on another level), but i think that from the 18 MCU movies, maybe he deservers the #6 or #7 spot.","31 out of 67 found this helpful.

After the first thirty minutes, the movie jumped the shark for me, and I was so bored.
It's too stale for a high budget film like this it had box office success but that shouldn't matter when the movie is not extraordinary and lacks originality.

The male characters (with two exceptions) had zero personality or depth. T'Challa's sister, girlfriend and general were the only reasons this movie held my interest. Give them their own movie already! Chadwick Boseman is a great actor but he's given so little to do in this other than act tough. Such a one-dimensional character. And Daniel Kaluuya's switch from good guy to bad guy back to good guy came with no apparent reason or explanation. And wait...did he have a relationship with the General? Don't know. And Forest Whitaker was DOA the whole movie. Wait...wasn't Sterling K. Brown in this? Can't remember. Come to think of it Angela Bassett was also given very little to work with. Snore. Martin Freeman's character had more charisma than all the above-mentioned characters put together. Such a waster of talent!At least Michael B. Jordan and Winston Duke's characters were given some personality that let them stretch their acting skills a wee bit. CGI was also pretty lame and plot holes were pretty wide. And what's Black Panther's super power anyway? He puts on a suit (created by his sister) and leaps around punching and scratching? The armored rhinos were more interesting and deadly. The best character in the movie was Wakanda itself. Make a movie about a high-tech country in the middle of Africa with a girl genius, a kick-ass female general and an endearing CIA agent. Leave out the super cat and all his stoic compatriots. I'd watch.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is certainly not helped by running that trailer before the film and instantly removing any jeopardy by showing us which major characters live to appear again in the future movie!More importantly though, how do Michael Bay style fight scenes still exist in a world where John Wick choreography is available and Marvel money is on the table? Honestly, I hated the last 20 minutes so much I felt like I was watching a Transformers spin-off. Not just the war-rhinos, which were utterly, shockingly bad, but the entirety of all three of the final sequences were poor CGI, poorly shot, poorly choreographed and added absolutely nothing. Also this is the first Marvel movie where I simply didn't care about any of the characters. No-one was relatable. The closest I could get was to Killmonger, who at least had reasons for his overall behaviour and a character arc that goes somewhere. But if I have to associate with a murderous villain who kills his own friends for no reason that isn't endearing me to the film.","40 out of 91 found this helpful.

Many times movies can't live up to it. This one? Exceeded all my expectations! The casting was perfect. The visuals, amazing. I was amazed at the detail that went into the costumes and jewelry, and how they reflect those of real African people from around the continent. And the story was great. There were some kinda predictable things, and it did fall into a pretty typical Marvel trope of the good guy getting help from the ""bad but not as bad"" guy. However, it was never trite or boring. The character development was wonderful. Speaking of characters, I am so appreciative of the fact that the women in this movie were fully recognized humans! They had their own thoughts and feelings and actions separate from the main character, which isn't all that common. This movie deserves every bit of hype around it. Can't wait to see what Black Panther and the rest of the crew from Wakanda do in Infinity War and beyond.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

I am a bit disappointed with the film now and I think that it is one of the worst in the MCU.Firstly, I didn't see the great badass Black Panther from the previous movie - he was powerful, confident and inspiring in Civil War. In this film he was totally different character and I had the feeling that Killmonger entirely deserved his moral victory. Erik was an interesting villain, one of the best in the MCU - Michael B. Jordan did a good job in this film. I would also like to praise Martin Freeman and Daniel Kaluuya for their performance (I give this 7/10 mostly because of these two phenomenal actors). Overall, Black Panther is OK, but it is far behind Thor: Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy (1 and 2) and Iron Man (1) in the MCU.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

Weakest parts of the film were a couple of minor CGI action sequences and the unnecessary Martin Freeman character. Strongest parts was the rest of the action throughout, a fantastic cast who acted their roles perfectly and the solid storytelling.

All of the special effects were very good, and the parts were acted very well. The problem is that it kind of lacked this groundbreaking substance that we're being led to believe is there. The concept is great, but I just didn't feel like there was adequate character development to get you really invested in the ideological clash and manner of resolution they were working toward. For that reason I didn't leave feeling as uplifted as I could have for the theme that was used. It was just kind of, ""oh, alright...well he's a really decent human being."" I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, those are NOT credible critics. There's no way. It's in the top ten, and it was better than a lot of other movies over the last couple of years, but come on. All of that being said, it's worth watching. but maybe just temper your expectations if you've only been following the ""big name"" reviewers.","17 out of 34 found this helpful.

I've grown up around Nigerians and Kenyans and I can tell you for sure the acting was spot on. They captured their culture and mannerisms in a respectable manner. 
I've seen most of the marvel movies and was growing bored until this movie. It actually has a message in it that's not to be missed. I've never experienced that within marvel movies. It usually features the same plot and the same cheesy ""good overcomes evil"" message. But the message portrayed in this movie is one that highlights current issues and should truly be taken to heart.
On another note, I feel so proud of the lighting, makeup and wardrobe used to highlight the beauty of black people. I often feel the lighting on black people within movies and TV still in this day and age makes them look washed out and grey. This movie truly makes their colour shine like pure gold! It was beautiful just to watch this even without the plot. 
My hope is that the character of Black Panther can bring depth into the Avengers movies and take the plot to a whole new level.","67 out of 160 found this helpful.

That unfortunately a lot of people are unable to relate to. The critics gave this movie incredible reviews because of what not only was done cinematically but culturally as well. The acting is special and I believed to be heart felt. Considering this is a first of its kind I was pleased that it didn't feel like it would be the last of its kind. The music speaks to you and gives you a great feeling of pride. No matter where you come from. I battled with the decisions the characters were making and the challenges they were faced which is a great thing because the movie made you think on several different levels. I read someones review and he/she stated the story was ripped from The Lion King but yet they rated it a one. If that's the case are you mad because you felt it wasn't original or did you dislike The Lion King too(another movie involving African culture). Lol what a misguided childhood if you didn't like the The Lion King.
Is there a large use of CGI yes but name a movie even without action that doesn't. Marvel/Disney are giving us awesome affects. Appreciate it! This is a superhero movie! I completely wish people that are bias would stop seeing these movies eyes wide shut and live a little. Watch this movie think outside the box. It's now one of my favorites from the Marvrel Universe and they are not at all giving us bad movies especially not ones that you could possibly put the rating of a 1 or under a 6 for that matter. Ones,twos and threes are for B movies with terrible visual effects and absolutely no plot. Know the rating system so you don't give people the wrong ideas! 
Lets just be honest people drug this movie across the dirt more than any other Marvel superhero movie. Why is that?? Oh you know why! Totally didn't deserve it!

i admit that this movie is a good addition action flick to another marvel films that ever created until now, but i'm just expecting something more as a marvel fan, cause of the trailer that they always drop before the movie.
There are some weaknesses, such as a rather slow start, and some battle scenes that are somewhat forced timings .
there is a scene where t'challa is inaugurated as king and a black panther that should have an extraordinary scene but it looks rather dull and boring like nothing just happened.
nevertheless, the movie has some great moments and cool scenes even if it does not make an impression on my memory.
by the way, andy serkis gives a great performance here, he deserves more attention and I respect himIn conclusion, if you're a marvel lover, you might like this because infinity war is coming and everyone is waiting for it, and this movie is just a great addition to the other marvel action flick.

Let's get that out of the way first. It's not the best movie ever, as some claim. It's probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it is at least worthy of that conversation, which is saying a lot.  Black Panther ascended to levels of hype and promise that seemed nearly unreachable-and it reached them. It's virtually unprecedented for a movie to live up to these outlandish expectations, but that's exactly what it did.  So, what is this movie that climbed all the way into the top five all time at the U.S. box office? Enter Wakanda, a fictitious African country posing as just another third-world nation, but it is secretly the technologically advanced nation in the world because it rests on a mountain on vibranium, the strongest metal in the MCU. Wakanda's king, T'Chaka, was recently killed in an attack, so his son T'Challa is set to assume the throne. T'Challa also fulfills the role of Black Panther, a cunning and powerful warrior featuring superhuman powers supplied by a Wakandian plant and stylish and functional suit made of vibranium.  Wakanda is fiercely loyal to its traditions and to its people. It opts to interact minimally with the outside world and lets in no outsiders, as to protect its secret wealth. This way of life is threatened by the resurfacing of buried stories from the past and the arrival of an outsider who believes Wakanda can no longer sit comfortably as billions in other countries across the globe suffer. T'Challa is forced to deal with the challenges of being a good man and a good king as he navigates the dilemma of staying true to Wakanda's rigid tradition or adapting to a more progressive philosophy.  Chadwick Boseman plays the role of T'Challa with exceptional poise, grace and an absolutely regal accent. He would have been the true standout of the movie if not for several other standout performances. 
Danai Gurira (Michonne of The Walking Dead) shines as General Okoye, the king's go-to warrior. Her love, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), though on screen less, plays just as significant a role, as he is one of the strongest voices pushing for change to Wakanda's international policy. And, of course, Kaluuya steals a few scenes with his remarkably expressive acting.  Additional shouts to Winston Duke for his role as an intimidating leader of a Wakandian tribe with a dark sense of humor, a low-key warmth, and a penchant for barking. And another one to Sterling K. Brown for playing T'Chaka's brother, a spy dispatched in Oakland who sees the struggles of people firsthand. The greatest standout of the all the standouts is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. His intense presence fills the room in every scene he enters. He exudes such charisma with his American street manner of speaking and swagger that I almost found myself rooting for him, despite his violent and murderous tendencies. Even in his worst moments, he is always sure of his purpose and his message, which is a compelling one. This message, paired with his backstory, make him easy to empathize with.Another thing: Killmonger is powerful and scary. He's more than a worthy adversary for Black Panther. At times he appears to the be Black Panther's better. Like Bane in Dark Knight Rises, an intelligent villain capable of physically overwhelming the hero, he feels like a real threat. We legitimately believe he can win. It comes as no surprise that his fight scenes with Black Panther will leave you breathless. The action sequences deliver all the thrills you would expect from a Marvel movie and from a Ryan Coogler movie (he's now 3 for 3 in his directorial efforts). But the deeper social themes and inner conflicts of the key characters are what elevates this movie to elite status. Yes, seeing a movie with predominantly Black actors and a Black director is also important. It's important to viewers, young viewers most of all, and it's also important to movie studios. Hopefully Black Panther's booming success will finally dispel the myth that movies with Black lead actors don't do well in the box office. Before I wrap up, I have to give credit to Andy Serkis for his rare non-CGI performance. The guy comes in and throws 100mph from the jump and manages to be hateable, funny, and fun throughout. And final shout outs to Angela Bassett, for playing the royal and majestic mother of T'Challa, and to Letitia Wright, for playing T'Challa's wisecracking tech genius little sister, Shuri.  Apologies to anyone I didn't spotlight. This movie is flooded with incredible performances, so I had to omit a couple mentions to keep this review to a reasonable word count.  Bottom line: go see Black Panther. If you already saw it, see it again. It's that good. It deserves all the praise, and I hope to see it next year at the Oscars.","24 out of 52 found this helpful.

And as you can see, I am not dead!""Black Panther was such a cultural signpost for everyone, and a great MCU superhero movie as well. As a young Marvel reader, I always wondered why the character was not used more at the time. He had a great origin story and was pretty kick ass. But finally, his time arrived, and he showed them all. Director Ryan Coogler was a great choice to make this movie.This movie hits all the usual superhero beats, while also being a landmark moment in black culture. It's a real honest to goodness epic tale. Wakanda comes to life so wonderfully that you wish it were real. So many great actors get to fill these roles we've only ever just read about previously. It does all this and still pushes the larger story of the MCU forward.Michael B. Jordan plays the rare villain in that you can almost relate to him, except he lacks any nobility in his actions. Andy Serkis steals all his scenes as a psycho bad guy you can't take your eyes off of. Danai Gurira as Okoye shows the world just how bad-ass us Walking Dead fans have known her to be for awhile now. Seriously, she's impressive. Letitia Wright as Shuri was another personal delight, such a fun character, great casting.Chadwick Boseman occupies the role of T'Challa/Black Panther with so much grace, strength, passion and just plain old aristocratic grandiosity effortlessly oozing from his very center...that it would seem practically impossible to consider a recast for future Black Panther movies. He was perfect and it's still hard to believe he's gone.Whatever happens in the future, we'll always have this movie to watch and enjoy.Wakanda forever, rest in peace, dear king. 👑💔🐱","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

I had an empty feeling when I came out of the cinema as I felt it could have been so much better. This is my unbiased opinion. I really wanted it to be good and awesome and different.There were good points. I liked Chadwick Boseman as the black Panther and there were great visuals and colours throughout the movie. However I wanted a bit more from T'Challa and the plot was pretty weak and many of the characters were under developed. I feel with many other Marvel movies they try to at least make the characters and concepts somewhat plausible but this one fell short.I mean ok I can accept that they got their power from vibranium which came from a meteor but like it didn't give any feeling of how they utilised it to the extent they had and Shuri just seemed so wooden. She looks like 16 or not much older and is supposed to be super intelligent tech woman with all this out of this world stuff, but she did not come across as a believable character in her field of expertise. She just came across like a teen who tried too hard to be funny. I mean at least with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner you get a feel for why they are so clever.Also the villain was bland and I was hoping for more street action outside Wakanda and many of the Wakanda people seemed flaky, like W'kabi. Some of the African accents were a bit off too.If you like most Marvel movies you will still probably enjoy it but don't expect it to be as good as the hype makes it out to be.","19 out of 41 found this helpful.

It ended up surpassing my expectation by miles (and i was expecting a lot). It was truly an exquisite film. Chad Boswick acting as the Black Panther was perfection...not one thing was forced, everything he did, he did with grace and ease. Danai Gurira as Okoye was beyond words; she was fierce, elegant and a total badass. Lupita Nypngo, Letita Wright, Micheal B Jordan, Martin Freeman etc..were incredibly stunning as well. The heartfelt acting shined through every actor and actress. The visuals were glorious, the portrayal of African culture in all its beautiful halo was something of a sight to behold. And i can go on forever talking about the beautiful African costumes worn by almost everyone in the movie. This is a film that is educational, honest, visually stunning, humbling and historical. It does not bullshit or gloss up anything. No matter what others say, DO yourself a favor and go watch it. You will love seeing people at the theater dressed in their finest, happy and proud as hell.

It delivers a witty, action-packed epic moments and brings a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to.It tells the story of T'Challa who, after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T'Challa's mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.Okay, even if you are not a fan of superhero movies... you may find the issues explored thought-provoking. It is well acted, dazzlingly shot by an expert cinematographer Rachel Morrison and full of humour. Black Panther is an untold story in modern cinema; a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.This movie has a fast beating heart because it ain't just sincere for good sake but it is a heartfelt epic that doesn't fall flat. It's the kind of art that's star-strikingly theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel forced.The score is authentic, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum.In the context of values, Black Panther serves as an intelligent if broad debate between revolutionary rhetoric and the responsibilities of leadership.In a nutshell, this is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got a whole lot more interesting.Black Panther doesn't just hit its marks. It leaves many many marks. Landmarks. So get in the queue now, people.","66 out of 169 found this helpful.

I would consider myself a pretty average superhero fan, holding Marvel movies to a basic standard of good action, fun dialogue, engaging plot and thought out characters. This movie easily checks off all of those categories, while bringing others into the spotlight such as stunning visuals, well developed world building and lore, diversity in casting, thought provoking villains and complete badass-ery. As much as I can rant and rave about this movie, I noticed one critical flaw. There's a point in time where the writers decided to force the rotting corpse of a dead meme down the audience's throats that really took away from the atmosphere. Not one person in the theatre laughed, while lots were groaning in disappointment. 
Black Panther has it's own quirky dialogue between characters that counts as ""fun"", but if you enter the theatre hoping for Antman, Avengers or Guardians, you will be let down. Try and appreciate the movie's more serious tone as they tackle heavy topics such as classism, racism, segregation, globalism, terrorism, and many other ""isms"" worth addressing on the big screen. They do all this, without making the movie feel like a college lecture, but an entertaining superhero flick. Ultimately, Black Panther gets all of the right kinds of conversations started. To me, this movie outshone the spotlight, raised the bar for all other superhero movies, dropped the mic and left me speechless. I don't want to go into much detail so as to prevent spoilers, but let me leave it at this: you NEED to see Black Panther.","18 out of 38 found this helpful.

With that reason and T'Challa's presence in Civil War, I had very high hopes for this movie... The good: the cast is charismatic and works well together in most cases, even Boseman's delivery as he grapples with his move to king works well. The near break-out character is his sister, who is easily the most animated and gets the best lines in the movie. Vistas of Africa and inside the Wakanda capital are impressive and great eye-candy for a time. A thematic plea that we are all more alike than different and should be better people is present which frankly we all need more, which brings the films worst failing - more on that later. The bad: actors clearly were locked into roles without much input, the feel in most cases was very wooden at times, even Boseman which is a shame as his extra dimensions in Civil War helped put it over the top. The set designs are good, but the CGI is rough by current standards, and in typical Marvel budget much of the fighting is at night, to reduce costs, a real shame as Black Panther looked awesome in full daylight combat in Civil War. The story as many have noted is just rote... but hey, it IS a Marvel movie so...The ugly: for a film that purports to make a statement about moving to one human tribe, it is unconscionable that the two main white characters are portrayed as either evil post-colonial opportunists, or at best a stumbling federal agent who is so out of touch despite his connections to the events of Civil War that he is just dumbstruck and unable to comprehend quickly the state of Wakanda. Two light anti-white racial pejoratives were thrown around, which undermines the movies message of moving forward and not grouping people and making assumptions or unfair associations. At its simplest, Black Panther is a very routine Marvel origin movie, overlayed with a well thought out sociological black diaspora politic analysis it all with a nod towards greater unity and an ascendant Africa, which makes its willingness to allow and in effect condone anti-white stereotyping all the more annoying. See it for the overall message, and be willing to realize that like society in general, it's not quite as advanced as it thinks it is.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Even their lesser known heroes are making hit movies.T'Challa made his initial appearance in Captain America 3: Civil War. In Black Panther he returns to his mystical homeland of Wakanda to become king after the death of his father. Wakanda so far has kept his its powers, wealth, resources and technology hidden.However T'Challa's late father hid a dark secret about his own brother, who wanted to use force to aid his fellow black brothers in the USA. Now the dead brother's son, Killmonger wants to battle T'Challa for the throne and he wants Wakanda to lead the struggle for black power and cause chaos around the world.The film pulls a nice trick in having two foes, at first we are led to believe it is going to be Klaue.However I found the film rather choppy and in some ways predictable. At times I kept thinking back to the Lion King.I liked that Marvel is not afraid to enter the debate about discrimination and whether it is right and legitimate to use force to overcome it. It is something Marvel Comics has tackled from its early days.A well mounted, good looking action film but it lacks substance. The box office figures are shocking. It is good but not that good.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

The entire plot revolves around 'vibranium', a fictional unobtainium-like element in the MCU, out of which you can make anything that the plot requires or that would look cool on film. Wakanda, a hidden paradise in the heart of Africa, sits on a mountain of the miracle metal and therefore has technology, including weaponry, far beyond anything else on the planet (outside of Tony Stark's workshop and similar MCU hero/villain enclaves). The Black Panther is the super-powered king of Wakanda, whose costume can be stored in a necklace, allowing him to change instantly (where his civilian clothes go is not clear to me, but certainly the tightfitting cat suit can't be worn over his Savile Road suit) and, as The Black Panther, he can do pretty much anything (regardless of physics). Despite its sophisticated technology, the rulership of Wakenda is decided by brawling, so we end up with two Black Panthers: a good one and an evil one (maybe semi-evil, as he seems to be possessed by murderous good-intent if you are a fan of race-wars). Needless to say, this narrative bifurcation is resolved by a huge melee and a Black Panther mano a mano (easily the worst part of the film from a CGI perspective). Even by MCU standards, most of the characters are pretty much cut-out dolls (especially T'Challa's trite Q-like sister) with the exception of Micheal B. Gordons ""Kill Monger"", an implausible but at least interesting character. As these sorts of movies go, 'The Black Panther' is fine. The look is novel but the script and story are pretty typical of the genre, so perhaps ground breaking in the sociocultural world of big-budget comic book adaptations but otherwise, not much new. Maybe I just don't get it, but Wakanda is this incredibly wealthy enclave in Africa but these elite 1%ers don't seem willing to do anything to help out their troubled continent. I can accept ethical reasons for not using their hyper-advanced weaponry to solve Africa's problems but there seems little excuse not to surreptitiously assist with their hyper-advanced medical technology (I suspect that these are awkward questions best avoided in a movie based on a comic book in which they are the 'good guys').","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

He is after arms dealer Ulysses ""Klaw"" Klaue who had previously stolen vibranium and caused mass Wakandan deaths. Klaw is working with Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who seems to have intimate knowledge of Wakanda. In 1992 Oakland, the former king killed his brother who assisted Klaw during the heist.Arguably, the MCU is the top box office franchise of today and it's nice for them to spread their influences into other niches of cinema. This is tackling some cultural aspects within the MCU superhero structure. All that is admirable but the question remains whether this is any good. The answer is that it's plenty good. First, Boseman is exceptional and projects a regal personality. The villains are great although I don't see the need of Killmonger working for Klaw. He should be killing him at first sight. There are a few things that concern me. The final battle feels obligational due to the superhero structure. The other great aspect is the women of Wakanda. They are all great. I also like the humor sprinkled among the action. It's not jokey but actually funny. The MCU is hitting on all cylinders and this is another solid hit.","28 out of 64 found this helpful.

Viewing it in standard format was probably not the best choice, and it is quite possible I would have given it a higher rating after watching it on an Imax screen. The pros- Chadwick Boseman did a great job as the Black Panther. He was a strong character and was fun to root for. Some of the visuals were very well done. Many of the set designs are also effective. 
The cons- Michael B Jordan as Killmonger was not very good. His street accent was on the verge of comical. The CGI was not horrible but did get a bit much at times. The storyline was generic. Summary- I would recommend to see the movie, just do not waste the money to see it in the theater.","26 out of 61 found this helpful.

I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash.","106 out of 194 found this helpful.

Black Panther first appeared in ""Captain America: Civil War"", with Chadwick Boseman donning the suit of Black Panther, and alter-ego T'Challa, King of Wakanda, a technologically advanced nation hidden in the African continent. After the death of his father, T'Challa, son of T'Chaka, the King, takes the place of the throne, faced with obstacles as soon as he is initiated. Andy Serkis plays Ulysses Klaue, a mercenary stealing technology from Wakanda and selling it, is one of the main antagonists of the picture, giving a fantastic performance as a nonchalant, cockney thief, escaping the claws of the previous king, and now hunted by Boseman. In fact, what makes this film stand-out, is the back-up cast. The sister of T'Challa, played by Letitia Wright, and a clan leader, played by Winston Duke, are two characters who particularly stand-out, and serve as comic-relief for parts of the film. Whereas on the other side of the film, with Chadwick Boseman, are phenomenal pieces of lightning and choreography in a lot of his early battle sequences, paired with a purple-glowing suit (possibly the best suit produced by the MCU for any hero), any action sequence featuring him is exciting and awesome, especially the early battles, where the audience is introduced to the power of the Black Panther, discovering just why this guy is a hero. Speaking of costumes, the costumes of the citizens of Wakanda all vary in colour, being interesting and obviously well made. Despite this, it seems as if the costumes are trying to ""spread the colour"" with some, obviously blatant scenes of (costume) colour segregation. This is not helped by CGI which is successful for the majority, but falls short at the scenes of actual animal life, i.e. rhinos. Even though ""Black Panther"" is home to some of the best choreography for a Marvel film, the script lets itself down, with a dragged out plot and unnecessary sequences of ""falling only to rise once more"" (both literally and metaphorically). From the get go, one thinks, this is close to being one of the best Marvel films of all time, but, short of falling flat on its face, it stumbles over its own plot annoyances, making it equal to ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"" when it had the capability to surpass ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (although it would have had to be extremely good for that to happen).","29 out of 66 found this helpful.

Having been introduced in the Captain America: Civil War, the Wakandan prince returns to the big screen as Black Panther. This is not exactly an origin story, but it's more of a continued chapter of T'challa's life after Captain America: Civil War. The movie tells us the legend of Black Panther and the life in Wakanda which has distanced itself from the rest of the world. The metal, Vibranium plays an important part in all of this which itself is pursued by the evil arms dealer Ulysses Klaue. After his father's death at the UN bombing, T'challa has to prove his worth to the throne while he tries to rid of Ulysses Klaue for good. But the pursuit leads him to know the truth about his uncle and cousin. T'Challa has to protect the misuse of Wakandan resources by fighting his cousin Erik Killmonger who takes over Wakanda by defeating him in a fight. The plot of the movie is simple and also similar to many other superhero movies. However, the cultural and racial backdrop makes this movie very different from others. The city, Wakanda is one of the important aspect of the movie. It is technologically advanced than most part of the world and yet sticking to its cultural roots. Wakanda takes you to a different world altogether. This experience is enhanced by the background score which is very African and amazing costume design. Out of the very few scenes involving the outside world, the Seoul, action scene is a treat to watch. Black Panther lays out a perfect platform for the coloured actors in Hollywood to showcase their talents. Driven by the commercial power of MARVEL Cinematic Universe, this film is going to be a career highlight for most of them. Chadwick Boseman has literally incorporated the phrase 'actions speak more than words' into his acting. He nails the African accent so much that it feels weird when the other characters speak in an American/British accent. Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger is a supercool villain this movie needed. While the movie fails to provide much substance to the characters of popular actors Angela Basset, Forrest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and Lupita Nyong'o, it surely has a lot to offer for Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright. They play the characters Okoye and Shuri respectively, who are almost like side kicks to Black Panther. Marting Freeman as agent Everett K. Ross has a slightly funny role. Black Panther is not as entertaining as the other MCU movies, but it surely has its own charm. A new wave is coming to the Hollywood and Black Panther might have laid a very strong foundation to it.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

I think this movie could have benefited by connecting it more to the MCU - perhaps having a secondary hero like Bucky, or any applicable ones from Civil War play a role in this films plot.

Of course, it's crazy to think we're even at this point in 2018 where Black Panther (not the first overall) but the first mainstream superhero movie to have a black lead in years and the first one in the now 18 film long Marvel Cinematic Universe.To just say this film is important is an understatement. Diverse representation in films is among the most talked about things in the world of filmmaking these days and Black Panther makes another big step for the industry, especially looking at the box office results of opening weekend. Luckily, the film itself isn't just a step forward in representation, it's also a dang good piece of filmmaking. It should come as no surprise that the guy who made Fruitvale Station and Creed once again knocked it out of the park with Black Panther.Let's start with the cast because even before a single trailer, the cast was the thing that stood out of the most. For me, Chadwick Boseman stole the show in Civil War a few years ago. He made an even bigger impression than Tom Holland did as Spider-Man. His calm but fierce presence was unmatched and brought an entirely different vibe to the characters already in place in the MCU. Boseman, who has already played some pretty iconic people (Jackie Robinson, Thurgood Marshall, and James Brown), is perfecting the role of a lifetime right now.Alongside him is an incredibly talented supporting cast including Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and of course Michael B. Jordan. Nobody is wasted and all of them are well-written and fleshed out. Jordan instantly ranks in the top 3 or 4 Marvel villains (which isn't the hardest thing to do), and his performance as Killmonger was full of thoughtful planning and empathetic beats. So much so that I understood what he was doing and why he was doing, even if I don't agree as to how he was accomplishing his goals.But I've gone on far too long without mentioning the ladies of Black Panther. Wow did I love Gurira's noble and powerful turn as T'Challa's guard Okoye, Nyong'o's gentle but courageous turn as Nakia, and Wright's hilarious and energetic turn as Shuri (who is essentially Q to Boseman's Bond). There are other great beats by actresses in the film, but those 3 women are absolutely incredible in this film. There are some familiar story beats from say Thor or Iron Man, but I always say that even if a movie isn't original in story, but is presented and executed in a new way, then it's all worth it. Which is a very long way of saying , Black Panther is a uniquely satisfying piece of cinema that might as well change the way superhero films (perhaps all films) are directed, produced, written, and acted worldwide.

Just when you think this might be an intriguing movie there is a deus ex machina moment, plot convenience, or a really over-long CGI fight scene to remind you that this is simply another Marvel movie sliding off the conveyor belt. The ending speech that re-explains the plot is especially annoying.There's a lot of inconsistencies. The suit can absorb a grenade with no noticeable impact yet he is blasted back by an RPG ten seconds later. Also for some reason the suit can redirect damage some moments but not others. Chalk that up to ""plot armor"" I guess.In or out of the suit he is impervious, which leads to the major problem with Black Panther: the main character. He has no arc and has no flaws, unless you count being too humble and trusting. It's an incredibly boring character. I was actually rooting for the bad guy if only to make the film interesting. This is one of those weird films where the bad guys all have more personality and complex motivations than the good guys.The royal family for first half of this movie is smug and unbearable, and for the second half are hypocrites defending a system they suddenly realize is horribly flawed, but only when it disadvantages them. But that is never explored. Their main motivation is revenge and to usurp the throne for the sake of ruling...exactly the motivation of the bad guy, except he actually has a nuanced backstory, charisma, and a philosophy he wants to put into practice.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie will keep you entertained for the runtime, but unless you're a diehard Black Panther fan you will probably never watch it again. It's a generic Marvel movie that follows the classic Hero's Journey almost exactly, but strangely enough without any training between the first defeat and victory. The visuals were mostly good which is to be expected of a Marvel film. A lot of people loved the setting of Wakanda but I found it to be one of the weakest parts of the film. The costumes look interesting, but it doesn't really make sense that technology would advance while culture remained the same, this has never happened in any civilisation in history. A prime example of this was the use of battle rhinos and spears in a civilisation that has access to cloaking shields and hover vehicles.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Did I think it was as good as the critics say - not by a long way. Do I think it is worthy of all the awards and plaudits it has received - not entirely. Do I think it's been talked up due to the ethnic diversity contained in the film, particularly the cast - yes (sorry). Is the diversity a good thing - of course it is.Black Panther introduces the Marvel universe to Wakanda, the fictional home of the Wankandan people and their king/leader/superhero saviour - the Black Panther. In a nutshell the movie is this - a new king is born metaphorically), he doubts himself, the crown is threatened, a new quasi king emerges and dethrones the old king, the new king turns out to be bad, conflict ensues to the point of civil war, fights occur everywhere, the old king realises his worth and fights for the crown and his people. By the end of the film everything is ok again, the end.Chadwick Boseman plays a good role as T'Challa, but I felt that Michael B Jordan played a better villain in Killmonger. Boseman does display a wide range of emotions as he learns his worth through the plot, he is solid enough, but it is not really anything new. It is this that was slightly disappointing for me - I was more enthralled when he made his appearance in the Captain America movie. It is refreshing to see a black superhero, but the critics seem to have forgotten that there has been a black superhero before in Wesley Snipes's ""Blade"". With a more diverse script to work from and a character that portrayed a wider range of emotions, Jordan slightly outshone Bosenman for me in this film. Both were let down by the CGI fighting/ballet dancing though.The coolest things about the film were the weapons and tech, the best character was Shuri (Letitia Wright) because she delivered humour as well as action. For the good things that Shuri brought, it also felt like I was watching a scene from a James Bond 007 film, where she was Q, and she was explaining to Bond what a gadget did. Playing the queen, Angela Basset delivers poise and grace, but again drawing on comparisons, she could been portraying a version of M from James Bond 007 films too. The whole tribal council thing felt like it was from a Star Wars film too - a kin to the Jedi council.The plot was average because it has been done before, in fact I'm pretty sure that this wasn't far off the plot of ""The Lion King"". This was the biggest let down for me, not only had it been done before but it was plagued with light, throw-away ideas that weakened it. It didn't feel like a polished Marvel film that I was used to seeing, and it certainly didn't feel as good as the critics had been raving about.
I have an issue when superhero's fight practically identical carbon copies of themselves, for example; the worst part of ""Antman"" was Antman fighting Yellow-jacket as they were practically the same. The worst part of the Iron Man films was when he fought against carbon copies of the Iron Man he had made. I even hated computer games that did that - Ken/Ryu in Street Fighter - SubZero/Scorpion in Mortal Kombat - It is lazy and it's cheap! Black Panther sadly does exactly that. Throw together two black panther suits, identifiable mainly by the varying shades used on the trim - and then the action scene's just look like lazy CGI dancing, something you'd expect to see a college computer design student make. On the topic of CGI, it was in abundance here. Usually Marvel does it in a way that the film looks natural enough, but in this film it was that overused that it felt at times like I was watching a cartoon.I think this movie got the acclaim it did because 99% of the cast were black - for me I don't care what colour, race or religion somebody is - film is about the story, it's about losing yourself to something fun and exciting. There are some seriously great films out there with a black cast, but they do not get the praise they deserve - I'm sure there will be excellent films in the future with black superhero's saving the day too. Unfortunately, this film felt like it had already been done before a hundred times over. For me, it did not live up to the expectation of hype I'd read into. I really wanted a lot more from Black Panther - I just hope that the next instalment has a better and more original story line. I'd love to rate this higher but the best I can give it is 6 out of 10 because it didn't feel original or fresh, it looked good in places, but it didn't have the substance within it to make it a classic for years to come.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

However not only black power a main symbol in his features there's only one actor who has collaborated with the director in every one of his films; Michael B. Jordan. 
 
Black Panther opens not long after the death of his father King T'Chalka, which would then conjure up his revenge in Captain America: Civil War. Here he has swapped from being a supporting player to being the main feature, he's just about to be crowned King of Wakanda, the fictional African nation which has made an occasional entry in other MCU movies. For the ceremony he has to take on a challenger in gladiator-style combat, there's African-drum music in the air and the Wakandan natives are chanting to the beat. This is an important scene, one that changes the world of cinema in an excellent way, granted on occasion there have been a few films that make a few homages to a homely place, for example 2009's Avatar had the main character going to meet other tribes and there would be different design's to their clothing. Coogler follows that same insight. Like Taika Waititi before him who paid energetic homage to his home of New Zealand by adding his Antipodean style humour in Thor: Ragnarok, here Coogler is the polar opposite, he swaps the humour for the colour of the country and their natives who dress in African-style colours from bright reds, through yellows to the bright greens, even through the Africani accessories. Coogler's attention to the detail is exquisite. With that in mind, it's also an important film one that shows how much 21st century has changed and you could argue that it's for the better. After becoming king, T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) has to face his biggest challenge, to protect his country against the invasion of a former soldier with a mysterious past Jordan's Erik Killmonger (which sounds like a gaming profile), who wants to overthrow the king. So that's your average Marvel movie storytelling right there. However, Coogler doesn't make it the average Marvel film apart from his exquisite hand in the Africani detail, it's perhaps the most visually stunning comic-book movie, and the Panther's suit changing colour, the sand-like holograms and the amazing cityscape which shines thanks to Rachel Morrison's gorgeous cinematography. 
 
There's so much good in Black Panther, excellent action, stunning visuals, gorgeous cinematography and a director who pays an energetic homage to Africa, but the real standing point here is the female characters, from Danai Gurira, through Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o to T'challa's mother played by Angela Bassett. Who all put in excellent performances along with another standout performance by recent award's darling Daniel Kaluuya. Boseman and Jordan are excellent too, but here they're made into supporting players by these brilliant performers. In short, Coogler's go at the MCU and his third feature is a brilliant entry to his growing filmography one that takes an important scratch in cinema.
 
VERDICT Like Waititi before him Coogler pays energetic homage to his past life in the MCU's latest super extravaganza.","46 out of 120 found this helpful.

I wonder what societies nowadays have similar rituals, and how they function, as rituals that extreme can have consequences as shown in the movie.In the end, however, this is again a movie about revenge as are so many of the Marvel movies. The film takes revenge, technology and race as center motives.It was definitely refreshing to see this, though. Black Panther, yay.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Accents and languages and a few characters deserve some fleshing out, but a lot of the confusion about the plot comes from lack of knowledge.And normally I would never write a review but I feel there are either so many very young people of color and non-people of color that miss the plot, simply because they are not part of the culture they are viewing on screen. The movie's core was a long standing unspoken discomfort (putting it lightly) between American black people and Africans. This movie took some of those discomforts and pain and put it front and center. Those of us who have seen and understand that very convoluted ""thing"" understand what we were seeing. It's essentially the parent (Wakandans or Africans)that left the child (Killmonger or black Americans), the child was abused, left to fend for themselves, and then the child growing to see that not only did the parent leave them, but the parent was happy, comfortable and did not care about all the evil that had befallen them.And on the other side is the parent who had no idea, what happened, but assumed from what they had seen from afar, the child had every opportunity and decided to just not take them. The child instead decided to be a menace. Therefore the parent has a negative view of that child and really doesn't want to be associated with them in any way.What happens when they meet up? T'Challa and Killmonger in the throne room.Hate it if you must, but this storyline has never been on screen before. This painful under current has never been publicly mentioned. And I can see why it could confuse. But people of color, both Africans and black people, got it..and it's started a wonderful discussion. If any of you are confused and care to learn, a quick spin around YouTube to look at videos on what Africans think of black Americans, would start to give you some insight. If not, then oh well...you're going to be confused about a lot of non Anglo movies in coming years.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The comedy was, once again, good. Killmonger was a brilliant villain, with great motive and backstory. The love interest wasn't that great, but also not a dealbreaker. The only stuff, I didn't enjoy, was the visual effects, and the fact, that the suit charges energy. The more he gets hit, the more he can hit back. That just feels like something a kid would make up.

And, I also must admit that I don't watch all that many superhero movies any more because the genre has become too glutted for my taste. I mention all this up front because my opinions doubtless will not be of the diehard fans out there...and I can respect this and understand my insights are not necessarily of the majority of viewers of ""Black Panther"".So why, then, did I choose to watch this film when I am rather tired of these films? Well, because ""Black Panther"" is so radically different from other superhero/Marvel films...reason enough to give it a try.The story is set, in part, in the fictional kingdom of Wakanda in Africa. To the outside world, it's a third world place...poor, uncivilized and backward. However, this is all a ruse, as long ago, the Wakandans received a great gift...Vibranium. This is apparently the world's strongest metal (Captain America's shield, incidentally, is made from it)...and it also has some magical properties.As for Wakanda's kings, for many generations they've chosen to maintain this ruse. And, this includes staying out of foreign affairs...which is the big struggle in the film. Should Wakanda allow Africans and black people around the world to be exploited as they have for centuries OR should they use their advanced weaponry and Vibranium to conquer the world for a greater good? Much of the film concerns this power struggle for the throne and the hearts and minds of Wakandans.The plot is amazingly fresh and unusual...a major plus in the film. It also is never dull! But it also is incredibly violent and parents might want to think before allowing kids to see the movie. It is odd that the film is rated PG-13 mostly because there is no nudity but the violence level is intense to say the least. Overall, despite this violence it's well worth seeing and is a nice break from the usual Marvel stories.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

Up until now Marvel has taken the high road with this but they have dipped their toe into the politically correct cesspool that is losing Hollyweird millions of fans and dollars.

Adaptations of Superheroes, Comic Books, and Graphic Novels have been driving the movie theatre box office for a few years now. Where the financial success of a film was once measured in tens of millions, it's now hundreds of millions. Beyond that, these enormous productions are pressured to make political and social statements ... providing the hope of which real life leaders seem to fail. This latest from Marvel and director Ryan Coogler (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION), carries all of that plus the expectations of an entire gender and race. It's a heavy burden for a comic book character, however it seems, regardless of one's perspective, it's likely the film delivers, satisfies, and ... oh yeah ... entertains.The bar has been set so high for action sequences and special effects, that we take the great for granted and only speak up on those that falter. What allows this film to take its place among the best of the genre is a combination of story depth and the payoff for showing us a world we haven't previously seen. The cultural aspects of the (mythical) African country of Wakanda are not only interesting, but the setting itself is breath-taking. An explosion of color, texture and technology blended with intriguing and multi-dimensional characters bring the film to life and draw us into this wonderland of tradition, culture and humanity.It seems ridiculous to speak of a comic book film in these terms, but the number of talking points raised during its runtime are too many and too varied to discuss in this format. What we can make clear is that it's cool to watch an entire movie where people of color and women are strong, confident, and intelligent. Chadwick Boseman has played Thurgood Marshall (MARSHALL), James Brown (GET ON UP), and Jackie Robinson (42), and here he takes on a fictional icon in King T'Challa/Black Panther. He perfectly captures the pensive nature of a King balancing tradition with the needs of his people to evolve and transition. His chief adversary ""Killmonger"" is played terrifically by Michael B Jordan (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION) as a man out for revenge and power. For most movies this head to head battle would be enough ... but not this time.Lupita Nyong'o (Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), Danai Gurira (""The Walking Dead""), and relative newcomer Letitia Wright play Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively; a triumvirate of three of the strongest women you've likely ever seen on screen. Nakia is the love interest, but also carrying out her own humanitarian missions, while also proving to be beyond adequate as a soldier. Okoye is the ultimate warrior and absolutely loyal to her country, while Nakia (T'Challa's sister) is a contemporary version of James Bond's Q - the ultimate technology whiz, and one with the zippiest zingers. Any of these characters could be the basis for a standalone movie, but together they elevate this to something much more than a couple of dudes in sleek suits fighting.Martin Freeman (THE HOBBIT), Daniel Kaluuya (GET OUT), Sterling K Brown (""This is Us""), Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker are all contributors, and Andy Serkis is a frenzied standout in an all-too-brief turn as Klaue. The strong cast delivers even in the few moments when the script lags. In fact, the only piece of this puzzle that didn't seem to fit was the traditional hand-to-hand combat to determine the next king. Why is it that a nation so advanced still relies on primitive courses of decision-making? Perhaps this is merely commentary on our society, though providing a more intellectual solution would have been in line with the rest of the story.The world of Wakanda is stunning. The costumes are sleek, colorful and fascinating. The characters are multi-dimensional. The action sequences are top notch (armored rhinos!). The cinematographer is Rachel Morrison, who recently made history by being the first woman to receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography (MUDBOUND). It's these factors that allow Mr. Coogler's film to achieve the level of importance that most comic book films wouldn't dare to strive for. On top of everything, it accomplishes the one thing I demand from these type of movies ... it's quite fun to watch!","21 out of 50 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Good but much overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4065853/?ref_=tt_urv","mbkalkan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5353613/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2018","Being an avid book reader, I have watched all but 2 or 3 comic book adaptations since the late 1970s. I have witnessed the change in tone and approach, as well as the the whole world-building process take root in the recent adaptations as the times inevitably changed. What Marvel has done so far is much more commendable than DC, and many examples of Marvel movies of the last 10 years are the living proof of that. However, not all of these adaptations are on par with what we may get to call all-time greats, and I am afraid -despite all the high grades given to the movie by critics- Black Panther is one of them. Black Panther actually happens to be one of my favorite characters along with Thor, a few X-men and Green Lantern. Time and again, I have read it with utter joy and fulfillment, and have always looked forward to the next issue. Therefore, this movie was one which I looked forward to with extreme enthusiasm. And maybe it was this same enthusiasm that ruined the movie for me, but I sincerely doubt it. So, as to how I see the movie:OK, so the casting is right on target, no quarrels there. And so are the visual effects and the setting of the story. However, the story is somewhat shallow, and needlessly comedic at places where it shouldn't be.Marvel (Disney) has lately started to follow a certain pattern of writing scripts, just like in the Bond movies. A hero, a romantic interest, a villain, a side-kick (or someone who takes on the role of Q from those Bond movies), a moral dilemma... and we are set. This one here is no different, only -as I have said before- somewhat shallow. Also, there happens to be more than one coincidental occurrence which make the story a lot less believable, if you care about those things. All of a sudden, an unexpected piece falls into place, a miraculous twist happens, someone appears out of thin air, and voila... all is well.The movie that could have delivered so much more at us, ends up delivering a script which can be summarized in just 2 sentences, and a story full of plot holes.So, how come such a movie garner so much praise, and such high marks? I dunno, honestly, but I have a theory. Ultimately, I feel like it would be safe to say that this movie was sort of a hype created to promote a black super hero in these trying times and during the re-emergence of needless and disturbing racial tendencies. It was during these times the movie was shot and as such promoted to emphasize equality and fairness among all people. Which is all good and fine, but it still could have done that with a stronger script, with a more coherent and fuller story. The fact that it gets so many high notes is not because of the film that it is, but because of the film it was intended to be. At least, this is my take on the movie, and how the film was reviewed so highly.I just hope the next installment in the Black Panther saga delivers more, just like the Winter Soldier delivered after the first Captain America adaptation.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

There were some great characters fleshed out really well with a great cast, plenty of standard comic book action and some funny banter/quips between characters which never felt out of place (T'Challa and his sisters banter is really enjoyable).Even though there's a lot of technology on show the films never feels too ""techie"" and, at it's heart, it keeps grounded and true to it's tribal kingdom roots. The main arc T'Challa character arc of taking on the Black Panther/King mantel, the tribes and storyline around that is really well done.Outside that there are some regulation car chases, shoot-outs, fights, etc which are pretty standard Marvel fare and nothing great. They look good (obviously) but are a little OTT and distracting from the well acted, grounded plotlines. There's also the annoyance of the overacting, ham-master himself Andy Serkis.All-in-all, it's a very solid comic book movie with some great sections (see above re: grounded, realistic story bits) and some decent standard Marvel schlock. Better than most Marvel movies it's fare to say, and yes it does have a great cast too!Definitely worth watching but not, as some have said, a 97% hit or as good as the critics are trying to have you believe (I assume that's more a case of pushing it's first black superhero thing - Blade might not have been the first but it wasn't that long ago, was it!?!?)","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The main attraction besides the production values, sets and special effects is obviously the late Chadwick Boseman who has delivered a memorable performance as King T'Challa who has taken over duties of King of an African nation Wakanda after the death of his father. His ascent to the throne is challenged by a a tribe leader M'Baku, a duel is fought and Chadwick emerges victorious. But all is not smooth sailing for him as there are a number of impediments. Wakanda is technically advanced due the extensive use of a modern metal called vibranium. The movie is a thrilling mix of the old and the new with a mix of African tribes with protocol, a CIA operative, London city museum , gambling tables of night clubs, high speed car chases and crashes all made exciting with special effects and technical wizardry. Where there is burning ambition there are bound to be plottings and palace intrigues and both are in plenty. The attraction is the hand to hand fight sequence in knee deep water watched by many against a picturesque backdrop of cliffs and waterfalls. This remains a highlight of the movie. Definitely a movie worth sitting through as it transports you to another world. Some superior acting from Chadwick Boseman supported by Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong'o and Forest Whitaker. It was in later years that Chadwick got the Oscar posthumously for "" Ma Rainey's Black Bottom "" and Daniel Kaluuya got the Oscar for ""Judas and the black messiah"" . Waiting now to see "" Black Panthers Wakanda Forever"" later this year.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Just like The Last Jedi this move flops in many key departments making Disney's cash cow a boring uninteresting standard run of the mill Marvel movie. Before I dive in there is some good things about this movie like the villian. Michael B Jordan does a wonderful job making his character, Erik Killmonger, a sympathetic villain and easily the best part of the movie. Anyways my first problem with movie are how generic just because it is about an Africa does not make it deep. The main character is really just your standard superhero there is not much to him which weighs down the movie since we spend most of our with him. Most of the side character are not fleshed out at all and really do not feel anything for them when they are in danger. Another bad thing is the action scenes they just look to fake. Whenever an action scene happens Black Panther is Cgied and so are most of the backgrounds making them really dull and not entertaining. The only good part of the film the villain is given little screen time when he is easily the best part of the film. Even though the movie does a good job fleshing out his motivations I wish he was given more screen time so we did not have to deal with the other characters. The movie also tries to weigh in on politics without doing anything thought provoking or powerful. This movie was very disappointing especially since the critics praised it so much.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's the story of a young king and his greatest challenge against a jealous enemy. This really sets up the story for Avengers: Infinity War (which I have yet to see, along with Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Two). I liked how the casting went, with mostly African-Americans as the main characters and one Brit named Martin Freeman (from the Hobbit movies).

"6","/10","Politically relevant, but ultimately mid-tier Marvel.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4066170/?ref_=tt_urv","Troy_Campbell","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22164449/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2018","The hype surrounding Marvel's newest cinematic instalment was stratospheric. A predominantly African-American cast and crew generated the initial publicity, then a knockout trailer turned that buzz into genuine excitement. Perhaps with such high expectations it was always going to be difficult for writer-director Ryan Coogler to deliver; the timely political themes, big-budget blockbuster requirements and Marvel connectivity all vying for his attention. Let's get the bad news out of the way: the action is underwhelming. There are a few decent sequences-a casino showdown boasts an ambitious unbroken tracking shot, a ritualistic cliff-side clash between two major characters is brutal-however, the set pieces largely leave a lot to be desired. Majority of the action is a blur of choppy editing and dimly lit cinematography, making it hard to appreciate both the choreography and geography of the fighting, whilst the finale is a disappointingly banal battle featuring, wait for it, CGI rhinos. Where this movie thrives though, is in its story and characters. Undoubtedly the MCU's most politically relevant instalment, the central plot revolves around oppression, equality, power-sharing and class, all tied up into a potent narrative that gives its characters room to breathe and grow. As the eponymous hero from Wakanda, Chadwick Boseman is endearing as a confident but conflicted King T'Challa, while his opposing force Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is riveting as an unstoppable tornado of fury and revenge. Yet this film also gives us three of the strongest female characters of the franchise: Lupita Nyong'o as royal spy Nakia, Danai Gurira as fierce warrior Okoye, and Letitia Wright as exuberant tech-wizard Shuri. More often than not it's this trio who make the sound decisions, save the hero and kick some serious arse. Credit to Coogler and his crew for successfully weaving in so much African culture too. The stunning production design and costuming combines traditional African symbology with the high-tech world, whilst the score is a low-key fusion of hip-hop, customary African tunes and standard orchestral overtones. Its social and political commentary gives Black Panther a pertinence and edge most MCU flicks don't have, but as an action blockbuster it's merely mid-tier Marvel.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

A very laudable idea, but the implementation is so bad that it has the opposite effect. Furthermore, it focus so much in the racial topic that at some points it is almost racist with continuous stereotypes about black people being in a given way. If the director would be a white person, I would sue him for some of the things in the movie (black people acting like monkeys, jokes of them eating people, etc.). In this sense, if someone is interested in good movies that present strong characters from African background I rather recommend ""Hidden Figures"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (sic.).That regarding the social topics that the movie was supposed to cover. But that's not all. The scrip is rubbish. After 5 minutes, one can imagine exactly what is going to happen. Most dialogues are such, that one knows the next sentence before the actor/actress has opened his/her mouth. The script is filled with cheap emotional sentences that seem taken from some fortune cookie. Most actors and actresses in the movie try to speak with some short of Nigerian/Kenyan accent and the outcome is ridiculous. The movie even managed to produce a ridiculous character played by Martin Freeman.The special effects of the movie are rather disappointing. Specially after movies like ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and similar ones, I expected at least the minimum ""Marvel"" quality standards regarding special effects.The soundtrack was also rather disappointing. One good thing in the movie were some of the action scenes. The fighting choreographies are quite good. Also the car chases (surprise!) are pretty decent.Another good point about the movie, is that if you happen to watch it with a funny group of friends then you might have ""cheap jokes"" for a month. In this sense (too), the movie falls into the category of Sharknado.Watch at your own risk.","174 out of 345 found this helpful.

Neither my point of view nor the way of my reasoning is on the main stream political correct path. I've contributed a review to imdb several days ago, but obviously it didn't pass the censorship, so here again, I'd try to give a review with more kind words to this film. I have to say it again, this film actually sucks big time, poor script, poor acting, the overly messy background paintings with the poor CGI effect, making this film like a rush job to meet the release date. The scenarios also feel contradictory enough since futuristic tech somehow only belongs to a few, the traditional weaponries, such as spears, axes, knives and fist are still the main fighting tools used. There's only one flying machine and the tribal council and the council members sitting around to have a meeting looked more like what we've often seen in ""Star War"". Why the leading character got to put on the weird WWE mask before facing or dealing with any new situation? Does it mean the mask would give him some super(natural) power? But even this guy put it on, he still looked very deadbeat tired and emotionless. There's no showing of any passion or even enthusiasm from him at all, even the fighting for his dominance at the big Fall in front of his tribe, he still look half-hearted tired without energy; maybe because he didn't wear his mask? I really think he was a miscast.Anyway, you deserve it, this and that.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

But it was not the case. And this was not a conventional Marvel movies either as usually origin story was made first before the superhero appeared in other movies. Regardless though, the story was made a bit short and went straight to the time when T'Challa would be made king. Plus the how he came to know Everett Ross was not shown which made me felt the movie was not too complete as an origin story. Other than those minor shortcomings that I personally felt, the movie definitely had some good moments. The action sequence in Korea plus the climax scene was awesome. The special effects (apart from few brief ""a bit obvious"" computerized scenes of Wakanda in the background during the time T'Challa was going to be crowned king) were very good. And there were also a bit of funny moments which involved Shuri plus surprisingly from M'Baku (Winston Duke).I would really advise you to be fully concentrated from the start to understand better on the earlier parts. To my personal opinion, the movie developed to be more interesting when the villains began to appear and the fights started.I get the appeal of this movie to critics due to its rather complex character development of T'Challa plus the appearance/representation of the African people in a world where third world country were still looked down. I myself as a simple minded movie audience preferred a more intense superhero movie, which I thought I did not really get in here. Therefore, even if the movie was hailed as one of the best in Marvel Cinematic Universe, I personally did not feel that. It may be good, but certainly not the best. Again this does not mean the movie was bad at all, even my wife was able to truly enjoy it. But as I felt it was not the best superhero origin movie & the fact that the action sequence were not too much, I still prefer other such MCU movies like the first Iron Man, Ant-Man or Captain America. Oh another thing, there was not a lot of surprises here, even 1 or 2 supposed surprising moments could have been guessed by my wife and I. As usual, there would be end credit scene which was having 2 of them in this movie. So wait till the very end to make sure you see them. In conclusion, my personal view is that this movie was probably a little bit over-hyped.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

There are three possibilities. 1) The complainers have never seen another Marvel Movie. 2) They aren't perceptive enough to recognize politics in most movies or 3) their racism is showing.This was the best superhero movie I've seen and I've seen almost all of them. It had an origin story with roots that run deep into a rich mythology. It wove in a contemporary and relevant theme and the players, hero and villain alike were human in the best and worst ways.The writing was solid and thoughtful. Superhero movies so often fall to employing A deus ex machina in the end or otherwise insult the audiences' intelligence. Black Panther did neither. It told a solid story with good action and left you with a sense of hope in the end. Thoroughly enjoyable. I hope to see it in the theater again.

A pretty generic storyline, stretched to over 2 hours and missing any real depth.

If this is the standard of MCU movies to come, I think they best just give up now.
It isn't terrible, but if people keep praising things that aren't good, all because they believe it stands for something else, then we will keep getting sub-standard productions.

Marvel's movies have gotten a little derivative for some, and I think Black Panther is something of a multicultural response to that criticism: the movie evokes The Lion King, Skyfall, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Thor and Wonder Woman while creating an identity of its own; the panther is no Batman clone I can assure you of that.Ryan Coogler writes, co-produces and directs the film with surprising ease and boy this man knows how to infuse style into franchised movies; we've got the first blaxploitation superhero movie of the age, and it has A LOT to say about war, entitlement, morality, political (& cultural) unity and feminism. This movie is a broadly appealing triumph of genre filmmaking with culturally distinct aesthetics that are otherwise outside the typical Western mainstream. African-American filmmaking got a tonne of coverage in the 70s, and it looks like that with the likes of Black Panther and Get Out, filmmaking made by, and centered around, black people is making a long overdue comeback into the modern mainstream. With Hollywood stars like Forest Whitaker and Lupita Nyong'o gracing Black Panther it's amazing that there are directors like Coogler are at long-last getting into the blockbuster scene.I love this film; it's a global semi-political-conspiracy thriller that takes place in Africa, South Korea and the United States and utilises those locations as beautifully as any of the very best James Bond films.Black Panther is a must-see of the highest order, and good job on MARVEL for making all of this possible!","21 out of 54 found this helpful.

All in all, the most exotic entry into the gigantic Marvel Cinematic Universe exclaims a powerful battle cry that announces probably one of the most important films of the franchise of superhero films, as it finally establishes a hero that properly represents the black community and gives them someone who they can look up to, but regardless of the enormous social significance, it sadly suffers from a formulaic, predictable and mediocre story that doesn't add anything to the genre or is worth being called outstanding or innovative, and neither did it deserve any of its Academy Award nominations. After hearing about the devastating news about the passing of Chadwick Boseman, my best friend and I decided to honour the influential actor by watching the first solo adventure of the comic book character he made come to life. To me it was a first-time watch, and I only have heard about the usual things, such as the surprising Oscar nominations. As already mentioned above, I can see the importance of this film as form of social statement, but as a film itself, I wouldn't call it outstanding. It is the usual MCU quality, and that is not a terrible thing at all. It just isn't as outstanding as it is made out to be. One of the greatest factors is undoubtedly the film's stylish blend of the African wilderness and futuristic environment, as it just looks great and creates the atmosphere in the first place. Also, the idea of the different tribes in the same country was somewhat fascinating, but other than that it suffers from the typical comic book film flaws. In a story that shares a striking resemblance with the second outing of the ""Iron Man"" films, villain Erik Killmonger is both interesting yet predictable and his potential not fully realised. Aside from the fact that he was more right than wrong, he was too underused and wasted in terms of what he could have been. In the end, the film assembled a decent cast (of which no one really acts outstandingly, though) and became a production that is more eminent as a political statement, rather than as a cinematic achievement. The nominations for the technical categories might have been deserved (well, at least it wasn't nominated for the CGI, cause that was terrible PS2 game quality at its best), but the nomination for Best Picture is nothing short of an insult to comic book adaptations that haven't received this recognition but were tremendously better than this (""The Dark Knight"", ""Logan"", to name a few). I don't want to say that it was a terrible film at all, quite the contrary. It is the usual dose of Marvel fun. Black Panther has already become a necessary icon. I just don't think that it is the remarkable cinematic achievement it is treated as. Nevertheless, I hope you are going to rest in power, King T'Challa.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman give live to T'Challa and The Black Panther. He is yet another example of the amazing choice for casting lead MCU roles. The rest of the cast shines in every moment, from the main support cast to the little roles and cameos. Michael B. Jordan is as Killmonger is one of the best MCU and Comic book movies villains of all time. His motives are clear and relatable. He is used in the right way and where he is needed to. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright as the main women of the film execute their roles in an spectacular way. They are selfaware, bold in ther choices and fun to watch. It was very pleasing to see that Freeman get a more deep role through the movie than just a short cameo. Andy Serkis made Klaw crazy and unpredictable, and a very good second villain for the movie. But one of the most terrific things in the movie is the representation of Wakanda. It looks and feels alive. Every shot is an art. Accompanied by the soundtrack it increase the richness of Wakanda and its mythology.The movie only flaw is that it doesn't have much of a turning points. It's pretty straight forward. Maybe there are one or two, but not on the level, let say of Civil War or Thor Ragnarok. However this doesn't hinder the great story of the movie and its narrative. There is some noticeable at the 3rd act, but it's doesn't take you away from the action in any way.
Black Panther is another solid entry for the MCU. It feels different and for the most of it's parts self contained(for a 18th MCU movie). We can hope to see the greatness of T'Challa yet again in Infinity War.","36 out of 101 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, one of the villains from the backstory isn't really quite Disney, so the film mixes a Bond lack of sentimentality at the beginning before going full Lion King at the end. The political points do hit home properly, but don't stay with you. The design and look of the film was as spectacular as sold, and mostly everything makes sense. It is this that will keep Black Panther going. There was a certain elan, which is missing from many other Marvel works. The afrofuturism provides an ever present thematic anchor.The film follows the 'first in franschise' template that states you must see lots of Wakanda and its denizens. Yet when it is slightly mysterious it is much better. Consequenly too much time is spent with the royal family and it feels like Thor in Asgard. The film was strongest away from there.At the end you can feel that this film was carefully guided down a safe path to protect it, but it could have done with less of that. Character development suffered because the Avengers gets all the good dialogue work. The final fight was the usual weakly choreographed fudge, a decades old format now. And the Black Panther is as strong in his mask as he is lightweight without it.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So, the Black Panther movie is not just about a hero, but also politics among nations. The term hero is because the source of Black Panther energy is made only for heroes and the term of politic is main of whole story plot. It is about a new King replaces former King, but the former King had some mistakes on the past, so that the new King must remove and heal the wound of the nations, but in the same time, he must also take sacrifices to do the right thing for protecting Wakanda people. That's why the tagline ""Wakanda forever"" becomes viral and now everybody wants to do tourism in Africa because the landscape is so beautiful and the Director could mixed up the African continent with highly technology, as similar as other sci-fi movies. The plot also contents the girl power; because the highest military commander of Wakanda is a woman and all women had their essential parts for the development of the movie character. Some of wardrobe of women look like Xena the warrior princesses, that is compatible with wardrobe of the men that is more modern. The story is easygoing, not to hard, because the reverse memories are only in some scenes, so that the other scenes are just going forward. We hope that there will be Black Panther 2!! :)","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Part of me was like, yes its a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so it'll be big. The other part was like wow this is blowing away the box office and is quite the phenomenon. The final stop before Avengers: Infinity Wars so of course I was ready for it. The introduction of Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War was one of the highlights of a super hero studded action blast. Overall, I quite liked what I saw here. Its not mind blowing and nowhere near the best the MCU has had to offer, but its a welcome addition to the Universe and is a good vehicle stand alone for a superhero who deserves it.The film takes place slightly after the death of T'Chaka, and T'Challa (his son) becoming the new King of Wakanda and becoming the new Black Panther. Wakanda is a nation that seems third world to outsiders but the nation is actually thriving in science and technology because of its abundance of vibranium. However, outside forces are made aware of this and T'Challa's throne and kingship is challenged. The film has an absolutely wonderful cast at its helm. Boseman, Jordan, Nyong'o, Kaluuya, to name a few. Visually, I think this film is on par with the best Marvel has to offer. The futuristic and scenic display of Wakanda just pop on to the screen. Boseman does well as a soft spoken yet unmistakable leader of his kingdom. I really like the Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler collaboration and it works once again here. Killmonger is a good villain and its easy to rate him highly among the other MCU villains we have seen. Letitia Wright is also a real highlight of the film and likely has a bright future ahead of her.Something else that really sticks out for me is the costume design in the film. Black Panther probably has the sleekest and best looking suit in the Marvel film universe. Add to that the suits capabilities. That whole absorb kinetic energy only to redeliver it moments later onto foes is so cool. A lot of the lore of what is capable in Wakanda with vibranium is really eye catching and does well to add to the mystique of the nation.Some of the film feels formulaic though. Also, there aren't many gripping shocking moments, as the films plot unfolds into a predictable place. The action set pieces are quite nice, although the final battle is a tad bit disappointing. The mix of traditional African music and modern hip hop for the soundtrack/score was a bit off putting as well. I don't have that many complaints about the film but its also missing a bit of the awe factor that other films like Thor: Ragnarok and Civil War were able to bring.All in all, I'm glad a lot of people have been praising Black Panther and have felt really inspired by an African hero. I have to say though I think its not in that upper echelon of Marvel films, but is still quite a respectable entry into the Universe. I'm ready to see Black Panther and his Wakandan allies in the Infinity Wars. Ryan Coogler is officially three for three in solid films. Pretty content with this film.7/10","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Whoever is heading that unit needs to take a vacation, along with the staff. Immediately. This is a serious request.Because what we have been led to believe is Black Panther is the best superhero film ever made on the legendary African warrior.This film is nothing of the kind. Instead, it is a compelling and competent drama of greed, loyalty, vengeance, and social standing. Other reviewers have pointed out that this film is quite overrated and not worthy of the hype. To be very honest, that was my feeling as soon as the credits rolled. It was a few minutes later that my appreciation of the film's tone and import started to change. This film is not about a fictional kingdom or a mysterious metal or other tangible things. It is more a study of who we are as a human race and where we stand today.I will try not to spoil the film for others. There are numerous scenes where characters wrestle with their inner conscience, confront a dilemma or two, and balance critical decisions with consequences. These scenes are not hoisted out of reality, we experience moments like these ourselves. Circumstances can make past decisions look outdated and wrong, even. At the same time, embracing change a little too quickly has pitfalls as well. There is a line said by a male character, which goes thus: ""It is tough for a good man to be a leader"". And it is true. Not everyone is born a leader. People learn and evolve over time, dealing with situations that sometimes are beyond their control. And by presenting those situations, the filmmakers have chosen a path that can be a little underwhelming to viewers at first, but relatable to us in some ways. I would even go as far as to say the overall theme of this film is more about what we are willing to do to protect who or what defines us without losing sight of what unites us all. It does sound serious, but the film manages to tackle these topics. Not expertly, but in a reasonably convincing fashion.The cast is near-perfect. While Chadwick Boseman could have done better by adding a little spark to his T'Challa, he has an extraordinary screen presence in the guise of the titular hero. A simultaneous ninja-statesman, his brand of aggression, without any outward weapons, is ferocious and decisive. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are excellent as General Okoye and War Dog Nakia respectively. Their fight sequences are superbly choreographed, along with those of the others. Michael B Jordan's acting chops are legit, he exudes menace and power as Killmonger. Daniel Kaluuya is a strong addition to an already-impressive line-up. But I was most impressed by Letitia Wright as Princess Shuri, the feisty younger sibling of the King. A firebrand techno-genius who can handle a skirmish quite capably, some of her inventions make Iron Man's creations pale in comparison. I expect to see more of her in future installments, if the post-credits scene is anything to go by. Seasoned veterans like Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, John Kani, and Sterling K Brown support the main cast with their renowned expertise. And not for the first time, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis' scenes together are a delight to watch. While Freeman does provide some comic relief, it is also refreshing to see him get actively involved and bring his own skills to the table. As for the crew, one important point first: bear in mind, the director is a relative newcomer in the competitive world of big-budget superhero franchises. I have not seen Fruitvale Station or Creed yet, but Ryan Coogler had a lot on his plate when entrusted with the enviable task of directing this highly-anticipated venture. He delivers a really watchable film, even if some adrenaline junkies might complain that the action sequences are few and far between. By choosing to focus on drama and intrigue instead of fast-paced, mind-numbing action (my number one reason for hating Avengers: Age of Ultron), Coogler makes a calculated move to pose questions about ourselves. His crew back him up admirably, whether it is Rachel Morrison with the camera (some of the wide-angle shots were gorgeous), special effects, or music. The production design is top-notch, the sweeping, high-tech interiors of Wakanda contrasting rather charmingly with the rustic, almost-idyllic outdoors. At just a touch over 2 hours long, the pace is neither too rushed nor sluggish.My sincere advice to those who have not seen this film yet: if possible, erase the sky-high expectations caused by Marvel's hype-machine and watch for what it really is. You will probably enjoy it more.8/10","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

""Black Panther"" celebrates African culture, Pan-Africanism, and Black Power with stunning visuals and excellent fight scenes. I especially enjoyed seeing African-American women portrayed as highly intelligent and strong. Almost anyone who loved the female warriors in ""Wonder Woman"" will really enjoy the fierce African-American female warriors in this film. I also like that the film does not reduce the fictional Wakanda to an African utopia. ""Black Panther"" shows intertribal conflict and violence.Overall, Black Panther is a highly entertaining and somewhat politically ""woke"" film. I do not know if typical Marvel comic books fans will appreciate the movie's very visible political agenda. I do know that the movie has broken box office records and that Hollywood executives worship profits. ""Black Panther"" appears to become a highly profitable venture for Disney. Perhaps this movie's success will prompt Disney to make and distribute more movies that feature African-Americans and other people of color as superheroes. ""Black Panther"" demonstrates that highly political comic book adaptations can be very profitable. I think that is a very good thing.","32 out of 90 found this helpful.

I like that the movie is more serious compared to other marvel movies ut the few jokes that it has, dont work for me at all. Yes, the villain is good, has good motivations and is an actual threat, but besides him and Black Panther, I dont really like any of the side characters. I find this movie very average and to see that it created such a hype and was praised everywhere makes me think that people only say they liked it while they find it also to be average because if they didnt though that they would be cancelled or something. Thaats just a thought I have, cause all my friends and family think the same as me.

This was my biggest concern walking into this movie, so I kept my expectations low even throughout all the praise that Black Panther has been getting. I didn't wanna see the same story for the 19th time. Well, may you rest at peace because Black Panther is NOT that, it's an exciting, fresh take on all the tropes that we are so bored of. I would even go as far to say that it may be the most memorable and highest quality film Marvel has produced since Civil War. Sure, Doctor Strange was visually cool, Guardians was okay, Spiderman was better than other Spidermans and Thor was fun, but Black Panther stands out from the crowd. For the most part, it solves my biggest problem that 99% of superhero films struggle with, which is pointless and weak villains. The movie starts off with (super minor spoilers?) it's secondary villain, who is a familiar and exciting character that I really enjoy seeing on screen - Ulysses Klaue. He's fun, energetic, crazy, unpredictable and cool. But later as the movie is developing, a new brand of Marvel villain emerges, Killmonger. He has everything that modern villains lack - moral dilemma, comprehensive motivation, solid plan. You understand him and you sympathise with his reasoning, understanding why he has to do what he's doing. It's not your typical pure overpowered evil forces from outer space here to conquer for no reason. It's a human who wants to fix the world and do something right, someone who believes that they are doing good. Also, I enjoyed that the conflict of the movie was scaled (for the most part) and we didn't see any ""world ending"" implications or over the top CGI laser spewing magic boss battles (that look more like a video game cutscene than a movie, I'm looking at you Justice League). Both Black Panther and Killmonger were equally matched. Nobody was overpowered. The stakes were set at the exact right level, which gives me really high hopes for the upcoming Avengers movie. I don't know if this movie necessarily will withstand the test of time but what I know for sure that I really enjoyed it. In fact, it's a great movie that could be watched as a stand-alone film outside of the MCU, that doesn't require previous knowledge of comic book lore. From a cinematic standpoint, I really enjoyed that this movie mashes so many of the familiar things that you know and love and puts them in one movie and NAILS it. It doesn't feel forced but you feel the genuine love and care that was there behind scenes. You can tell that this was a movie made by people who like movies. There are moments where it feels like it could be a scene from the universes like James Bond, Fast and the Furious, Lion King, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and a million other things and it feels good. It was an awesome and epic ride that made me feel like a kid again. Other than a few cheesy jokes that felt a little bit out of place à la ""hey there fellow kids"", there is really nothing to nitpick. 
I have to applaud literally every single department that's worked on this movie - the cinematography, the special effects, the set design, costumes, music, sound design, acting, etc, all of it was top notch. Overal, fantastic watch that's worth going to the theatre for. 
Also, for those who are concerned that this is a liberal aimed progressive movie that's gonna shove ""social justice warrior"" things down your throat? You're just plain wrong. It doesn't feel forced at all, in fact, it felt more natural than a LOT of movies that are coming out these days.P/SBetter than Wonder Woman, which I also enjoyed.","18 out of 46 found this helpful.

What can I say? It's just a fantastic movie that finally showcases a demographic that have been CLAMORING for a flick showing positive imagery for A LONG TIME. Basically we've been waiting FOREVER and a DAY, for a serious Black Superhero with excellent supporting cast, and magnificent writing from a black man/crew. In a word the movie was STUPENDOUS. It was great seeing Black people portrayed in every way possible in one film. Whether they were the warrior, the villain, the usurper, the tech-wizard, the King, etc. it was fantastic to see this many black people in a movie that doesn't have to do with slavery, or drug-running, or ghettos, or ratchet behavior. A superhero film portraying a black person in a black setting, with positive imagery ... it was worth the wait.I love every moment of this movie. On criticism though - I actually wish it was a little bit longer. Like around 25 minutes longer. A couple more fight scenes and more background on other character would have been nice, but otherwise it was an almost perfect movie!

6 is good. 8 is really good.. 10 is excellent.... There is just a handfull of movies that can have a 10..

You can't miss this extravaganza, because if you do so then actually you are missing an art film which is crafted so well that each frame is splendid. Since release, people are talking about this movie and already broke some opening weekend collections at the box office surpassing major superhero/action films.From the start to the last, every scene is scripted well in a manner that you will definitely realize how a king should be. It took 10 years & 17 movies to bring this connection between characters especially the king T'Challa aka Black Panther. Last you saw him in Captain America Civil War which made everyone want this character more and led this epic movie to be a success.The movie is all about a fictional nation Wakanda (in South Africa) and element Vibranium (fictional). The story revolves around T'Challa his family, foes and loved ones where Politics is much more highlighted. The strong bond between T'Challa & Shuri is really appreciable which is rarely seen in any movies. The tech used by Wakanda is far more ahead than any of Tony's techs. The leader of Special forces/chief security head of the king is loyal to the kingdom. In between, you may feel that you are seeing Hollywood version of Kattappa (Baahubali).Movie lags in between which is correct because Director Ryan Coogler wants the audience to understand the character very well which they can later connect him with other members of the Avengers team. He is not only the King of Wakanda but also the King of MCU and he deserves the respect. Because many questions will be answered at the end and we can expect some blast in Avengers Infinity Wars. Actions sequences are for more well choreographed. Wakanda kingdom, people, traditions etc are visualized beautifully. Official movie runtime is 130 minutes which is honestly acceptable for this wonderful movie. Many things to be said, but this much is enough and rest you can experience at nearby theatres.Tony Stark is definitely going to be jealous of him. Must watch movie for everyone.Bold, Beautiful & Epic. Ratings: 4.5/5","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Black Panther is one of the best films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What were they seeing that I did not? I see excellent plot-line, action and special effects, and a message of hope for Wakandans working towards world peace and mutual cooperation with many nations towards world peace. It seemed they were ready to join the 21st century by sharing their technology to make the word a better place.This is the least boring I have seen in years, Chakwick Boseman who was fighting cancer during the filming put in an excellent performance as T'Challla, and I will miss him in the next Black Panther film. Lupita Nyongo was excellent as Nakia, and I loved Letitia Wright as little sister Shuri, with all those fascinating gadgets and gizmos.I admit there were some slow scenes in Korea with Klaue, the villain and setting up with Killmonger for later scenes. That's the only negative thing I can think of without giving spoilers.I love this movie. Don't pay any attention to the naysayers.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

However, I kept hearing how great and awesome this ""masterpiece"" was, so I decided I would go see it (and at this point, it really is just something that's expected, which is fine). So, I went in with marvelous expectations (aside from some criticisms I had heard beforehand), and... how was it?
Well, let me just say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly. It was WAY better than I thought it was going to be, and it was really fun to watch. All of the performances are generally great (except for a few which I'll get in to), and the plot is good as well. There are some issues, however, that bring the movie down, which I'll go into spoiler free at first. Some of the special effects are just downright bad (there are bits where you can actually tell the person is standing in front of a green screen), and there is dialogue that is spoken that just seems... off. I don't know, it just seems misplaced and weird-sounding. Also, it is hard to ignore the fact that yes, the plot is good, it is certainly a Marvel plot, if you know what I mean.
My biggest issue with the movie, and the one that brings it down so much, is that there is a side plot that is completely unnecessary, and completely ruins the tone of the film. Basically, the only reason this side plot exists is to add a little more to the end, and to give the main characters a little more motivation. That's it.
In conclusion, check this out if you want a fun superhero movie, that's better than a lot of recent ones, but also has a few problems (7/10).","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""...","535 out of 1,152 found this helpful.

There was no surprise we didn't get in and sure many people suffered similar experience. There is no doubt that the almost entirely black cast and hype certainly packed the the people in. Well done to the guys who marketed the movie.Black Panther tells the story of the secret African society the Wakanda which is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world. T Challa (the Black Panther) is the heir to the throne and the film focuses on the challenges he faces. The plot is a bit clunky at times, but the film is always watchable. The acting is good and the visuals are particularly good. Sure we'll be seeing plenty more of the Black Panther in future years and looking forward to seeing more.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

So Marvel fan will have a blast, and im sure this movie will pick a large audience, not only Marvel Fans. It's a great action flick, with a great soundtrack too ! It's just not different from what you have already seen. It's good, go see it if you are interested, otherwise I don't think you will enjoy it, and will be rather disapointed with all the good reviews its getting (87/100 on metacritic).

Chadwick Boseman reprises his role from Captain America Civil War. The rest of the picture also features an great ensemble of well known actors. These include Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. All of whom give serviceable performances. After the events of Civil War, T'Challa (Boseman) returns to his home Wakanda, a land that is deeply hidden within the African forest. Wakanda has been hidden from the majority of the world for centuries, Challa has to make a choice when an unexpected enemy comes to take his place. Boseman plays Challa / Black Panther with a mixture of wisdom, patriotism but also a lack of experience when it comes to the world. This is a interesting combination that really pays off when T'Challa meets with the main villain of the film played by Michael B. Jordan. The idea of a advanced culture with innovative technology that remains hidden from the world is very interesting. The majority of people from Wakanda believe that this makes the world a better place. However when Killmonger shows up these ideas are challenged through his character. Killmonger is the best villain the MCU has had since Loki, this is because both T'Challa and Killmonger can learn a lot from each other. This aspect is easily the best thing about Black Panther, unfortunately the film only becomes compelling after we pass the first act. The first act consists of a generic superhero plot in which T'Challa and his team race after Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to capture him. This is important for the story in the long run but left me very emotionally empty. It also gives very little attention to Killmonger who only becomes interesting after the first hour. There is plenty of humour in Black Panther, the best jokes in the film came from Shuri (Letitia Wright) who plays the sister of T'Challa. She added plenty of self awareness that made myself and the all of the audience roar in the theatres. Unfortunately Black Panther also suffers from the same issues that Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 and Thor Ragnarok suffered from and that is the fact that jokes are implemented in the wrong scenes. Sometimes a scene is meant to be serious until a character cracks a joke killing the impact of the scene. The action scenes also let me down, most of the them were too cgi heavy and I would've prefered some more realistic stunt work (but that's personal taste), especially because the director's previous film Creed had one of the sleekest looking fight scenes of recent years. Many of the special effects in Wakanda also felt unfinished, the look itself were breathtaking. However there were many set pieces that felt incomplete and too cartoony. The costumes and music of the film is terrific though, they really give this exotic african feel, it makes the film a lot more authentic. After the first hour passed, I really enjoyed this picture. There were some minor gripes with special effects and tone, but for the most part I had a lot of fun with it.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

3. Impact - What I felt was the film did not have the right impact on the audience as they do in every marvel movie. This movie just felt unfinished. 
4. Story line - Well that is one thing I loved about the movie so much. The story was really great. It was far better than a lot of other superhero movies. If you are a marvel fan, you should watch this one to get to know Wakhanda and where the Black Panther comes from. Overall it was alright! Not a bad one. People definitely had a lot more expectations and it has just been overhyped that way. Don't listen to people who have been saying it is worst marvel movie or the best one.

Whatever I say about the movie will be a little. Definitely ""Black Panther"" takes its place as one of the strongest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cast is probably the best in a Marvel solo movie. ""Black Panther"" shows an unseen part of the MCU - Wakanda, their tribes, secrets and their way of life.Indeed, one of the strongest features of the film is the acting of everyone in this movie. I can't say only one name, but Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Andy Serkis, Danai Gurira, Angela Basset, Letita Wright and Forest Whitaker are just some of the best characters in this movie.The story is really strong, which makes the movie so good. Michael B. Jordan played the role of Erik Killmonger brutally. After the movie ends, the villain gets stuck in your mind, just because you understand his motivation and is presented perfectly, in two words ""memorable villain"". If you have not become Chadwick Boseman's fan in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" it's inevitable now! T'Challla must lead his people, be king and hero at the same time, which is a heavy burden.Every scene between him and his sister Shuri is a pleasure. She is only 16 years old, but her intellect can be compared to that of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.Special attention should be paid to every action scene. Movements and choreography are just unparalleled. You will make sure you see Black Panther, Killmonger and Okoye in action.The colors in this movie are unique! The effects are great, except in some in some places in the final battle.The soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar is great. After the end of the movie, you will want to listen the songs of the album.The movie introduces us the story of Wakanda in depth and gives us many new characters, all of whom are great.In the future, ""Black Panther"" will be one of the often watched Marvel movies, as T'Challa is a person who easily gains the audience's sympathy, and you will not have passion to see him in ""Avengers: Infinity War"".In conclusion, if you want an amazing experience, watch the movie as soon as possible!","55 out of 171 found this helpful.

The trailers looked amazing. Unfortunately, the action scenes in the trailer are, pretty much, the action scenes in the movie. For more than 2 hours, I sat through a live action Lion King without the humor or the cheery songs. The movie is certainly beautiful to look at - the graphics are stunning - except for the last fight scene that doesn't even look as good as many current video games.The actors are...fine. Their performance run the gamut from okay to good. That's it. Everyone seems to be angry or sad all the time. The humor in the movie comes from the leader of the outcast tribe and, of course, the great Andy Serkis, who seemed to be the only one enjoying his role.Frankly, the critics astound me. This movie was derivative and far too self-conscious. Unbelievable as it may seem, of the few negative reviews from professional critics I have read, the best is from Armond White. Do yourself a favor and read it.Ultimately, the measure of a good movie, for me at least, is how likely I would be to watch it again. Like Iron Man 2 and 3, I probably will never watch this movie again. Ever.In short, bland and derivative.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

They string high-budget action blockbusters one after another, maintaining the level with small variations. There are no masterpieces, but there are no failures either. Although I understand why they do it, personally, I don't like that approach, because all their movies follow same pattern and resemble each other. Without risk, there's no danger of failure, but there's no opportunity to make a really good movie either.""Black Panther"" is visually stunning, fast-paced and entertaining. The combination of tribal features and futuristic costumes and technology is in perfect balance and the landscapes of Wakanda are beautiful, while the action scenes are directed to leave you breathless. The acting is good, but the characters and the story itself could be much better developed. Rather than to provide a good script, and then take advantage of big budgets and modern technology to make this story as impressive as possible, I think that Marvel films are based solely on the visual spectacle, leaving the story in the background.I watched the movie in the theater and I'm not sorry, I enjoyed it and had a good time. But I believe that in a couple of days I will not remember what the film was about, which is happening to me with almost every Marvel film.7/10","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

We all know how Justice League ended up. The going has got tough for Marvel because of Marvel itself. Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok in their own way set the new gold standards. Also, as new characters enter the MCU, the treatment needs to change too. A comic book blockbuster today needs to be more than just a comic book blockbuster- and that is what makes Black Panther great. With gracious heroes, quipping villains, rocking car chases and fantastic weapons, it is an out and out enjoyable comic book blockbuster for sure. Elements of espionage sagas with homage to 007 Bond, paired with Afro futurist themes along with some Shakespearean twists gives the movie it's own flavor. Marvel movies are increasingly getting interlinked, so for someone who has missed Civil War, there is a lot to catch up. For someone who hasn't, we jump straight into Black Panther roots and origins. ""Ulysses Klaue: Tell me something. What do you know about Wakanda?
Everett K. Ross: It's a Third-World country. Textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.
Ulysses Klaue: All a front. Explorers have searched for it, called it ""El Dorado"". They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. I'm the only one who's seen it, and made it out alive.""Welcome to Wakanda- blessed with mountains of vibranium, it is the most advanced society in the world. Fearful of the world's reaction to it's vibranium reserves, its culture and people, for centuries Wakanda has hidden it's true progress from the rest of the world. So while the motto is not ""America First"", but it is ""Wakanda Forever"".While T'Çhalla wants to stay the path, there are others who feel Wakanda should share it's success with the rest of Africa, who have been brutalized by invasion, exploitation and colonization. ""To be or not to be the savior of the oppressed world"" - this Shakespearean choice for the characters forms the crux of the story. The hunt for Ulysses Klaue sets in motion the plans of Erik Killmonger- an American mercenary wronged in the past by the Wakandan royal family, and scarred by his experiences in the real world. T'Challa will need to draw up on every ounce of strength, and all the friends he has to save Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler is coming off Creed, and he delivers here too by crafting a movie that isn't about fighting gods and robots, or chasing aliens, but more about the rights to privilege. In Erik Killmonger, he has created a villain to whom at least half the audience will agree too. Wakandans have thrived while the rest of Africa has burned. Killmonger has a point. He has also assembled the finest set of black actors working today- Chadwick Boseman plays Black Panther with pathos, Lupita Nyong'o exudes radiance as Nakia, a covert agent, Michael B. Jordan plays Killmonger with feral intensity, Forest Whitaker plays Zuri, the royal shaman while Angela Bassett plays Ramona, the queen mother. The standout characters though are Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, and Okoyo, played by Danai Gurira. Said to be smarter than Tony Stark, Shuri is the Q to T'Challa's Bond, and goes about her role with vibrancy and style. Okoyo is the badass leader of T'Challa's bodyguards, stars in the action sequences and also delivers some of the funniest lines. And I especially loved Andy Serkis in front of the camera as a maniacal Klaue! Coogler has really soaked up the culture of the continent and let his imagination run wild. Wakanda is a riot of colors, steeped in spirituality and culture and because it was undisturbed by colonization - also a technological marvel. Is this what Africa could have been?Bottomline- Black Panther is not only a fun movie, it is also a very impactful movie. Marvel getting marvelous, really!

"7","/10","I don't know if this is ""grand and revolutionary"", but Black Panther is a very entertaining movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4068922/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2018","In this day and age, the studios are under a lot more pressure to represent different nationalities and backgrounds. Those that are asking for it are right; it's important for black children to have black role models as it is for LBGT individuals to have role models that are just like them. Many artists and directors want to adapt and give people something different, but they also understand that studios are still trying to make a profit. That's not to say an African-American lead can't draw an audience, but movie making is expensive, so they have to make sure that whatever they put on the screen can draw in all people of interest. In the case of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they've done well so far with bringing in black stars. We've got Samuel L. Jackson for Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie as Falcon from the Captain America films, and Don Cheadle as Rhodes from the Iron Man movies. One of the surprise popular characters to debut was Chadwick Boseman from Captain America: Civil War as the Black Panther. The character has not only led his own series in comics that's still running, but is the only African-based hero I'm aware of. Let's see how he does on his own in Black Panther. In the hidden country of Wakanda, it has created groundbreaking technology, thanks to it's source of a rare substance called vibranium that landed via comet thousands of years ago. Though much of it could have benefitted mankind, the leaders and previous kings have made the decision to isolate themselves from the world.After the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa (Played by Chadwick Boseman) is crowned king and reigning heir to the mantle of the Black Panther. It's revealed that along with the suit that's made from it, he gets his internal powers from vibranium. When he hears that a Wakanda artifact is being sold underground, he travels to Hong Kong along with his sister Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), his ex-lover and spy Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), and proud warrior Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). Though they capture Ulysses Klaue (played by Andy Serkis), he's broken out, thanks to his boss Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Played by Michael B. Jordan). By the time T'Challa and his group return to Wakanda, Erik reveals his identity as a tribal son and challenges him for the throne. T'Challa loses, is thrown down a waterfall, and Erik gets ready to ship out much of the Wakanda technology to black markets. Will T'Challa manage to stop him?Many people have been touting Black Panther as a grand and revolutionary super hero story that different. While I don't know if I can call this different and revolutionary, Black Panther is a very entertaining movie regardless. It's clear that director Ryan Coogler (Creed) not only wanted to show a different hero, but a different world together. The two best elements to the movie are the side characters and the setting.When it comes to who the movie is following, it tries to give us a lot of characters...and it does work. I liked Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurria, Andy Serkis, and especially Letitia Wright. The winner here is Michael B. Jordan who plays one of the better Marvel villains. While he is physically powerful and intimidating, he also makes a compelling case for the mistakes that Wakanda has made by it's isolationist polices. While he isn't bad by any means, the least interesting character was the Black Panther himself. He does carry a royal energy of leadership; he doesn't seem to have that same struggle for mistakes of his countries history that I got from Michael B. Jordan. I think the script could have done better with that, and show him how he earns his mantle back. The movie does try to show out hero at his worst before he tries to fix everything, the story still succumbs to typical superhero tropes. Now having said that, what they do with Wakanda is really cool. This design reminded me of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, in which things are very colorful and lively. It seems the overall goal was to create an African utopia and everything from the architecture to the costumes are great. I wish there was a video game to Black Panther, just so that I can get a better glimpse into this country and it's culture.I'll give this seven Black Panther helmets out of ten. In a large sea of superhero movies, and even within Marvel superhero stories, Black Panther manages to remain it's own unique thing. I had fun watching it and families will probably be pleased with it. Give it a watch and see it's powerful roar.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

As with many superheros, you have to consider the context of the time period in which they are created. Black Panther was created in 1966 at the height of the US Civil Rights movement. There are several areas that do not make sense. For example, if Vibranium (really?) were that powerful, then why wouldn't Wakonda be a leading world power? Why would it hide its superiority? That makes no sense.Bottom line is this is just more Marvel eye candy that has no depth.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Watch the movie for yourself and decide for yourself whether you like or dislike the film. I understand people who just did not care for this genre, fine I get that, but if you are doing this because of some predisposed thinking then go back to you ignorant holes where you come from!

The cast is affable, performances are good and the spectacle is what would be expected from a big-budget MCU offering. The ideas that drive the plot are initially compelling. But it's all in service of a story that's trite and bland. The filmmakers try to paper over gaping holes in the plot and a boring narrative by pandering to some vague pan-African identity. It's all rather lazy and predictable.

"","","Slick and entertaining even if interesting elements are impacted by the superficial sheen of the bigger franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4306833/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","27 August 2018","This film was very well received and praised by critics on arrival. The cynic in me still believes that the social importance of the film means that many people were willing it to success even before seeing it. To be fair, the film is a good standalone entry in the Marvel universe of films, but at the same time it is still a film in the franchise - not some magically new type of beast. The high percentage of the cast who are black and positive characters is probably the most obvious thing highlighted by the critics, although it does seem like window dressing at times, with the African culture laid on thick on everything. Interestingly, the film reinforces negative images of African-Americans through the view characters from this specific group - not overly so, but enough to notice as it clashes with the main presentation.Outside of its value as social tool, to show studios yet again that they should not assume what they assume about their mass audience, the film itself is fun, lively and mostly interesting. The plot has good pace and nice developments, although it is not as morally murky as it could have been. Some of the cast do play to this aspect, but the film never really wants to be in a grey area so much as to have clear goodies and baddies. The action sequences are good and play out with the usual humor and high production standards. The cast is well led by Boseman, who has charisma and presence. He is very well supported by a deep cast - with Jordan in particular making a great 'villain'. Ironic in a film praised in America for being a positive challenge to the sort of 'OscarSoWhite' world of Hollywood, that so many of the cast are British but regardless so many people are good here with few weak links.In the end it is still a Marvel franchise film, and first and foremost it does what this needs and does it well. The social aspects are important, but not while you're watching it - which is fine because it is enjoyable and slick enough to hold the attention and be worth a look.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Along with the supporting cast, the actors performances throughout the whole film are very good and a lot of credit should go to the way in which they portray the hero's and villains in the movie, especially by the females in the film.
As much as I feel the second half of the film lacks a large amount content, the first half is superb. Brilliant set pieces, funny dialogue, even though one particular joke feels as though it is straight out of 2015, and a large amount of intrigue. 
I mention the action scenes, they are superb a lot of action and a lot of emotion behind them
Some of the music is fantastic to listen to, some of traditional African music played throughout the whole film fits really well with the premise and setting of the movie. Cons: The green screen creates some of the WORST backdrops I have ever seen in the film. Completely taking you out of what should be some very intense scenes.
I never feel as though there is a lot riding on the story. It is very simplistic and it appeared to me as though if Tchalla was not to overcome the conflict in the film, very little would happen. The world created would not be in a worse place than before, and that is a problem.
As much as I liked the traditional music, the forced trap beats and songs that are jammed into it feel as though it is simply their to relateable to it's teenage audience. Although in some cases it works, they are few and far between, with it often not fitting well within what is being portrayed on screen. More of the traditional music would have been a welcome change and some more suspenseful scores for the car chase scene would have worked a lot better. However, I would say go and listen to the album, that is very enjoyable.Conclusion: I came out of the theatre dissapointed with the movie. And even though I believe it is over-rated I now, after looking back on it, feel as though it is a very good film that is well worth watching. Despite the issues that people appear to be looking over it is a very enjoyable film. Don't go in with the high expectations that people are putting out online as there are some problems with the film. All in all a very good, but flawed movie. 7/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman's regal portrayal of T'Challa, the king of Wakanda, is both powerful and charismatic, anchoring the film with a strong central performance. The film editing seamlessly blends traditional African culture with futuristic technology, creating a visually stunning and immersive world. Its strength lies in its message of identity, heritage, and the responsibility that comes with power. The music, composed by Ludwig Göransson, adds a unique African flavor to the score, and the cinematography captures the vibrant landscapes of Wakanda. ""Black Panther"" is a cultural milestone and a superhero film that goes beyond the typical genre boundaries, reminding us that heroes can be both superhuman and deeply human, and my liking for it is as profound as the film's impact on popular culture.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Imo ONLY the character T'Challa does the community justice. A lot of the practical shots blending futuristic architecture with ancestral scenery were captivating. The script and plot are laser focused so the film moves seamlessly. It's technically good not bad. Where I think the film falls short is it's soundtrack, underwhelming action sequences, use of cgi and Michael B Jordan's overacting in some scenes. Hip hop as a score doesn't draw the same emotion as contemporary or Orchestral soundtracks and would've preferred hip hop being an addition to rather than a focus giving an amateurish feeling... and I love hip hop, but just not as a way to set tone. A cringeworthy scene is when Killmonger gets in the ambulance and makes out with his side chick. LOL and the cgi in almost all instances at no point garnished a realistic impression. Unlike the Whedon or Russo entries it felt like a cut and paste superhero flick. I can praise the film on presenting an Influential antagonist, strong performance by Chadwick, cinematography and the effective pacing. I will revisit this film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

After he appeared in Civil War, there was much hype for Black Panther getting his own solo film. After seeing it I think this is the best MCU movie since Civil War. Is it the best MCU movie? No. I feel like every time one of these comes out now everyone praises it as the best in the MCU. Critics said that about Thor Ragnarok when that came out. I liked that film, but really it was an okay film at best. Black Panther is definitely better than Ragnarok. I'd it's actually a genuinely good movie, but not without its faults.The general cliff notes plot is as follows. With his father dead, T'Challa/the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is now the king of his home country of Wakanda, the most advanced, and secluded, nation on Earth. However, our main villain Killmonger challenges the new king's reign and attempt to use Wakanda's advanced technology to dominate the world.First I'll delve into the positives. Firstly, I really like the Black Panther as a character. I was already impressed with him in Civil War, but I wanted to hold off judgement until he got his own movie. Now I can say Black Panther is my second favorite MCU character behind Captain America. The side characters were pretty decent too.The film has great cinematography as well. The majority of the film takes place in Africa/Wakanda and it looks fantastic. Not only that, but the film does a fairly good job delving into the culture of Wakanda and its inner workings, backstory, and political stances and issues.Most of the action was good and shot very well, with a couple exceptions, which I'll get into. I also like the style this film has, from its opening and closing aminations, to its score, to even way of using text and credits. You'll know what I mean when you see the film.Killmonger, in my opinion, is one of the better MCU villains, up there with Loki and Zemo. His goal is rather basic, but his motivations are understandable to where you can sympathize with him to a degree. Michael B. Jordan does a great job in the performance as well.The film is not perfect though, as I've stated. The movie has the same issues the Thor movies do. The scenes in Wakanda are great, but the scenes in our society, while not bad, don't measure up in comparison. While most of the action was good there were a couple underwhelming scenes. The opening action in particular was shot too dark and filmed with much shaky cam that it was hard to enjoy. The final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was also too short and underwhelming.Lastly, the minor villain played by Andy Serkis I did not care for at all. Andy Serkis is a great actor, but this was definitely not one of his best performances. I don't blame Serkis, but more the lines and direction he was given.Overall, Black Panther is a very solid entry in the MCU. Is it the best like so many say it is? No. Is it revolutionary, like many claims? No. Nevertheless, it's still a good movie that's worth seeing if you're a fan of the MCU or just comic book or action movies in general.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

But its fundamental sin is the high ambition to impress its audience. And it does it. But not always inspired. It is an impressive film, no doubt. But, maybe writing the bad word, it is...too impressive. It is more an eccentric show than a reasonable film. Sure, it must be a blockbuster and I am happy for its succes to the young public.

I'm gonna start off on a high note with the positives. First of all this movie is largely very well paced, you can easily define each act of the movie which aided in storytelling. The characters were all quite enjoyable and fit there roles especially the titular character, Chadwick Boseman felt so natural and comefortable in T'Challa. Fun additions to the cast were Andy Serkis and Letita Wright. The film was shot very well, I enjoyed the cinematography and it featured more vibrant colours than I would've expected. Unfortunately where this movie loses it's steam is in the script, it consistentaly put the characters into positions which lead to a predictable story, there were so many things that I knew were gonna happen before they did, not too many twists and turns to keep things interesting. Another thing that bothered me was the unrealistic technology, it consumed most of the action sequences with, ""hey look at this cool thing"", tech played an important part in the script but the unbelievability of it just took me right out of the story. The dialogue was also very campy from time to time and not in a self aware kind of way. The character motivations don't always make sense, I felt the conflict wasn't properly resolved by the end. And the action scenes took a dive into ""lazy cgi punchfests"" so to speak, I thought we were over that, especially after the scathing reviews this film recieved. I'm honestly shook this film has such a high metascore, I really don't believe it's that good. The positives are there I just think it suffers from a fair bit.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is a good MCU film but nowhere near the best. There are two main problems with it:1. Although the villain is strong and has a good motive for his actions, this film falls into the classic Marvel plot of 'villain is in a similar suit to the hero; villain's suit looks more advanced; hero is knocked down; then eventually wins' - it's a bit old and generally Marvel are thankfully moving away from this rather dull story device but it's well and truly alive in this film.2. The women absoltuely steal the show! This is almost a good thing - how wonderful to see both black people and women portrayed as strong and smart and I don't think there was even an inkling of women just being there to be pretty or love interests. This is one of the best films I've ever seen with regards to female equality and portrayal. However, the movie's titular (male) character is almost irrelevant. Not to slate Chadwick Boseman's performance, he did a fine job, but the story would not really miss him. The women seem far stronger and more capable and don't particularly need him for anything. He has his own story but this film is about Shuri and Okoye and either one would probably make a better and more interesting hero.Nevertheless, this is worth seeing just don't believe the hype. It's a bit more Bond than MCU for the most part which is an interesting take so if you're looking for a mystical 007 adventure in Africa, Korea and London then you'll enjoy it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't think the movie could live up to this hype and felt a lot of the sentiment was probably down to what the movie signifies and stands for, rather than the quality of the movie itself.I was right I feel, but only just. The movie has a fairly straightforward solid plot. Its characters are quite well rounded. Its visuals are quite beautiful. But for each of these positives there is a negative underneath the surface,The plot itself is pretty light. there really isnt too much to it. And I think for a complicated villain- which is what they were trying to create, the plot, his motivations and more importantly the way he planned to execute those motivations was too simple.The well rounded characters are just too many really. You cant in a 2 hour movie really get to grips with 10 characters, who are all largely new to you. At times Boseman seemed on point- at other times, it just seemed that his deep contemplation had nothing behind it. Having a slightly longer run time- they could have used more time for a couple of moments of personal reflection. Or one or two more moments where Tchalla and Killmonger spoke alone.. to talk as intelligent people, with a mutual understanding and awareness. we got this, at the end. But for me it seemed to hard a shift. from the aggression of killmonger and the unwillingness of t'challa to really try to avoid the fight.. to now a moment of sympathy and empathy. i wanted to spend more time with killmonger, when was just him.. not giving orders, not forwarding the plan or plot. the supporting cast could have also had more time, but thats a more minor point.finally the visuals in terms of landscapes were beautiful. The country of wakanda which they created, was this amazing mix of tech and earth.. but the moment there were any fight scenes, you got the same shaky cam, too close, too blurred rubbish which is very popular in movies these days. The fact that the hero and villain are both cgi only made the action look more fake, and harder to make out.. in a way it reminded me of transformers and the awful fight rendering. you just dont feel there is actual weight/gravity.. it all looks quite doll like.The above being addressed, would have made this one of the great movies.. As it is, it is one of the great comic book movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

""Here comes another PG13, CGI action sequence"".In terms of all of political hub-bub, I'm not really going to comment on that except to say I'm not sure why *anyone* is pretending like there has never been a movie starring a black dude before. Who knows.Aside from the dumb jokes and derivative visual effects, director Ryan Coogler was also cool enough to make sure to shoot all of the fight scenes with shaky cam, a la every movie from 2005-2009.

However, the plot is wracked by common Marvel-brand movie problems and for some reason the CGI is incredibly lacking. The love interest plot could be removed to no detriment of the movie and tension is sorely lacking. There is no concern or worry regarding the characters throughout the whole story and the resolution feels basic. The characters push it along well, however, and still make eh viewing very enjoyable.The reason for a 6/10 is that I believe 5 is average, and everything above that should be earned. Black Panther's issues are the type it never had to have and were so obvious that minor adjustment could have fixed them. It seems as if the movie was rushed and a bit of the humour is painfully dated. I would still recommend this movie, particularly if you enjoy the MCU.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jordan, Lupita Nyongo, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and the list goes on. 
Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Prince T'Challa is about to be crowned king of Wakanda, but when a long buried secret is uncovered it threatens the country of Wakanda and the rest of the World! 
I really liked this film! And for a number of reasons. First of all this is a very well directed film made by the very talented director Ryan Coogler. The entire film feels original new and exciting thanks to his vision!
Whats also great about this is Wakanda it self. This beautiful land is so well realised on the screen. It serves as one of the most interesting locations in the MCU. 
What set Black Panther aside from the other Marvel films is it's great story that suprisingly tackles a lot of deep themes. 
All the actors are great in it, espescially Michal B. Jordan as the villain Killmongor. Killmongor is by far one of the best and most compelling MCU villains so far. His backstory and viewpoints are explored and you really get where he is comming from. However there was not quite enough of him. But whenever he is onscreen you are on the edge of your seat!
All these factors makes the film much more than just your average Marvel movie. It makes it into a film with a strong message and compelling characters. 
Black Panther is absolutely one of the best Marvel movies and highly recomended!

But at times I missed Tony Stark, I mean he would kill to have access to Wakanda's technology, and what about Captain America pledging for Buckys fate?The worst thing IMO is that this one doesn't fit at all with other Marvel movies. It may be an average solo film, but nothing else, very much like Wonder Woman.Even with all the action, there's really no sense of danger, its supposedly going worldwide but the threat never leaves wakanda. Its like no one ever knew they were in danger.
Ragnarok went over the top on comedy, but here, its non existant, I think I only giggled with Stan Lee's cameo.
The plot twists a la GoT don't have any impact.
Also the villains were dissapointing. Ulysses Klaue was promising and I expected him to have a bigger part but it ends too soon. Killmonger is just a kid in a tantrum.Heck even the post credit scenes sucked.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I hoped to see some amazing adventure and action by Black Panther in this movie but what I got was a family power struggle for the throne of a kingdom/country. Many action scenes and a big part of the storyline doesn't even involve the Black Panther with all his powers and abilities. That was a bit disappointing. At the end, I remained thirsty for some Black Panther action involving his powers and abilities. The movie is good in what it's trying to show but I disliked the acting by the mostly Black cast in this movie. That doesn't mean I don't like Black actors; I have admired many times acting by Black actors/actresses. I don't know. Even Daniel Kaluuya whom I liked and appreciated so much in Get Out, seemed like a novice actor in this movie.The end credit video song is awesome in my view and it's worth purchasing the whole movie ticket for. I am not talking about just the song but also the picturization and the way it's perfectly fits and harmonizes with the whole movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now that that is out of the way...The movie is a visual spectacle, now, I know many movies are nowadays. Besides it just looking good, it feels good. It has strong female characters like we havent seen in a while. Which is refreshing. The plot, predictable but satisfying. Acting, top notch and all in all an extremely enjoyable movie.My 10 star rating is like the 1 star ratings. Not really the rating it deserves (i would give it 8 stars) but I feel like I need to at least do something about that.

It's a superhero movie that follows a super hero plot - of course its essential plot infrastructure (of good triumphs over evil) and character basics (of T'Challa bring the humble, kind, merciful warrior and the antagonist being full of hate and essentially tyrannical) are going to be predictable, that's how it works! Black Panther hit a perfect balance between plot substance and action - perhaps people are upset because there isn't an overwhrlming presence of action? Winter Soldier has mostly high ranking user reviews, but it was 80% action and 20% plot making it incredibly boring and far more ""garbage,"" ""irritatingly bad,"" ""over rated,"" etc. deserving than Black Panther. Great Marvel instalment that was far better than Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron, and Civil War. Who knew people hated to see a film about a rich country's entanglement with a man who wants to rectify the poverty stricken environment he grew up in? Doesn't sound interesting for a Marvel movie AT ALL when it's bretheren typically only focus on fighting each other or some weird, nonsensical quest to defeat a robot... and fight each other.

But really? Just this was enough to get you 1B+ in box office? Wonder woman was 10x better as a movie. Maybe they were right in 2016. America IS more sexist than racist.Anyway, the movie itself was very bland. The plot made zero sense. I know the Avengers universe was supposed to be very fiction, but still, this was stretching it. A small country in the middle of Africa being sooooo advanced? And if it's so advanced, why do people still wear those half naked clothes and fight so primitively? Why is their election still so savage? Whoever wins a fist fight... Geez. And why would a kid raised in America for his entire life, who went to MIT and everything, have no ambition other than to go back to this African country and be some stupid king? And really? You grew up in Oakland. I thought this would be one of the less oppressed places for POC. He recites the history textbooks like he lived 300 years to see all the slavery. I mean at least write some plot that makes sense.The characters were very one dimensional as well. Black Panther himself was super boring. Nobody had any personality. Killmonger was a complete douche. I mean I thought in recent years Marvel made sure to write characters with life stories and end games that made sense. Killmonger was like one of those 60's Disney villains that just wanted to burn the world. In the end, everything's predictable, and you're just waiting for the movie to end.I'm a die hard liberal.

The script is good, the cast is great and the main character and villain are well defined, the motives that made Killmonger became the villain made sense and were credible.The battle sequences were also good and well choreographed.The cinematography is stunning, the mix between technology and nature makes for a unique look also in the interior sets.
The CGI in this movies is great as always, however there were some moments were it could have been better and the green screen was noticeable, and the script although is good it´s a little confuse in the beginning and predictable in a moment.

After all the message of Dr. King was one grounded in the truth of Jesus Christ and which borrowed from Ghandi's own movement against similar opposition from the English and yielded success, that coupled with the support of JFK who likewise borrowed from Abraham Lincoln and we have a model that cannot be denied. Therefore let us all pray as Dr. King prayed for peace, forgiveness, harmony, oneness, understanding and respect for everyone and everything which is a center piece of the beleifs of Ghandi but which all Christians must likewise support. This movie inadvertently appears at a time when the movie makers decided that enough controversy exist (Captain America's Civil War and last years sad and disturbing KKK riots in Charlottesville, we are not in the 60's anymore! ) in the world that it would generate enough interest and thereby sales to garner success for its efforts. While the marketing strategy succeeded, the moral implications should not be ignored specifically as mentioned above regarding all efforts toward harmony and peace in all areas concerning the social attitudes, beleifs and values of all the peoples living in this great country. It with great hope that the writers show every bit of responsibility in the upcoming films to remember that this is the true direction of a hero such as the one played by Chadwick, is for peace, forgiveness. Letting go of the past and embracing the future as harmonious beings seeking to heal and help each other as we work towards a brighter future must be the aim of our leaders that must be seasoned in the lessons of our past and dutifulminded to steer clear of repeating them, forgiving the wrongs and adhering to the right in our evolution to continue to raise the bar for the human condition.

One last note regarding DC and the new Black Lightning t.v. show, the actor is great but the costume is really lame, he should have a black costume with small yellow lighning bolts near the neck or the left breast and a simple black mask that covers most of his face. The costume could be bullet proof but not mechanical, he is not Iron Man and he can fly via the lightning powers, finally he should make his debut in the Justice League Movie. One more point the actor who plays Martian Manhunter (also an African American actor) is really great in the role as the Martian, except his powers due to a low budget on the Supergirl series expires quickly, can you give him his full powers and have him also in the Justice League movie, he has always been a major character in the series.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

For the traditional Marvel Fan, I'm sure there wasn't enough fighting, crashing, noise and conflict going on to satisfy today's adrenaline addiction but if they could allow themselves to shift, they would realize what in fact they are experiencing isn't just a movie, but a whole culture that is foreign to a lot of us in America. The calmness of the characters, the steely keenness of their strategy and cool collected demeanor are all new. If you can appreciate that, you can appreciate every aspect of this film as a work of Art and something that young and old everywhere will remember for generations like the early days of Superman. Black Panther isn't just a Superhero Action Film, it is the beginning of the mythology of a Legend.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

It opens in Oakland, California and flashes back to a fictitious African nation with a super metal which has been hidden from the rest of the world for many years. Thhey fight with other countries and with themselves in this two hour and fourteen minute epic. The CGI is top notch but the film could have used some editing, as it feels a bit too long. Otherwise, just sit back and relax and enjoy an adventure in order to escape the every day realities of life.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Best Marvel film to date (not just MCU but Marvel)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4770783/?ref_=tt_urv","hotrobinproductions","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46169466/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2019","I already know the hate this review will get. But it's true, this film transcends the marvel films into territory they haven't been able to even brush upon with their other films. From performances to script, to cinematography, this film has it all. I'm very concerned at the reviews on here where people are literally complaining about CGI. The landscape culture and the vibrant way it was shot was amazing. The CGI is solid, I don't get why people use it to bash films. If I were to watch a 1970s or older film I'm not going to bash it because the effects. I will judge the film off the film alone, how was the plot? How was the characters and acting? How was the cinematography? How was the script??? Like don't get me wrong. if it has impressive effects I will give them that and acknowledge it, especially for it's time, but I don't understand these people that complain about CGI and expect everything to be real. Let alone they expect every film to be some James Cameron focused CGI. Don't get me wrong, I love me some epic CGI especially when it pulls off so well, but I'm not going to judge the film so harshly on that alone and it's not fair that people do that. You should only do it if it's honestly distracting you from the plot or vibe in a moment of the film I guess, but even then I guess you can hate all the old films that came out back then because effects weren't the best JUST SAYING. Tired of these CGI fest people. ANYWAYS, this film delivers AND THEN SOME. It deserved to win best picture I have no idea why green room won over it but it did. This film achieved so much that it's a shame some audiences wouldn't know a good film if it was slapping them on the face. The performances from each character feels so rich and vibrant and everyone learns and changes to the end of the film. The VILLAIN is kick ass and by far the best villain in the MCU (over thanos as well) Michael B Jordan bounced back VERY hard after his failure in fan4stic. This film has the traditional superhero story but adds so much more with its own unique take. The director has such good talent using the amazing script. My only minor issue is the plot feels like 2 different films just minorly though. The Andy Serkis villain was great but his character kind of drifts away because something happens to him but then it shifts to a different film somewhat. It was a twist in a way but felt a bit fast and plot changing. Either way the characters still developed and didn't feel forced. The film is so beautifully shot from wakanda to the culture to the beautiful message of helping everyone around the world. The soundtrack is amazing and the music is SUCH heart wrenching and really captures you into the moment. There is some forced politics thrown in there here and there but it makes sense because it's an African country that has the utilities to help Africans when they were in slavery. Why wouldn't messages come up? I wouldn't say they were forced though it didn't feel forced for me. Captain Marvel forced their politics down our throats. From the feminist power, to ""illegal alien"" skrulls running from Donald trump... UGHH. But that's another story. I think black panther has it all AND more and for me personally it's definetly my top 10 favorite superhero movies of all time and definetly my #1 marvel film ever. Logan might be ahead MIGHT. But idk this film just has so much going for it.Plot 10/10

Special Effects 10/10Overall, Black Panther deserves the praise, the Oscars and It most certainly deserved to win best picture. Christopher Nolan, The Genius in filmmaking even acknowledged that it should have won. History is history. At least the academy acknowledged it. Either way this film was by far the best film of 2018 and it was nice to revisit the film once again to see if I wasn't crazy. When I'm sure I wasn't. It's a beautiful achievement in modern cinema. Not even superhero movies in general but in movies as a whole. It's definetly a film that stands out much more than meets the eye. I'm more of a DC guy but I can't deny marvel knows what they're doing. Good Job. Give the film a watch if you haven't. And if you have and don't agree then watch it again and take into consideration and try to focus on how it's such a huge achievement. And if you have seen it and agree with me, just watch it again because it deserves to be watched plenty of more times for it's beauty.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Jordan is able to bounce off of that incredibly well in his great performance as Killmonger. The MCU really lost a great talent in Chadwick Boseman, his performance helps provide an extra layer of elegance to this film, future films could have really benefited from having him as the franchise's centric figure.The first two acts are incredibly well done, it shouldn't be surprising as Coogler proved his talents as a director in Creed (2015), but the third act does not help this film at all, it feels like it was done without him on set. Lots of terribly noticeable CGI and green screens, and the huge fights that always at the end of each Phase 3/4 film are very uninteresting, especially with those Rhinos.Overall, the story, themes, and characters are the strongest aspect of this film, with the ensemble cast being the highlight. However, the third act feels a bit anticlimactic, and its technical weaknesses are very distracting. Very solid film, but not as great as everyone says it is in my opinion.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Just everything about his character gave me goosebumps-every time i saw him on the screen. Unfortunately, I was not able to watch the movie in IMax, but after watching it one time in standard, I would very much want to experience the ""IMax experience"" for this movie.

The central portion of the film is really good and the characters are all engaging while the villain delivers motivations above and beyond the usual Hollywood standard.The problems I found with Black Panther really only came at the beginning and end of the story. For me it took quite a while for the story to actually get going (not till Michael Jordan's character shows up in Korea does the the story really start to pick up pace) though as they were establishing both the characters and setting this is perhaps understandable and I would expect this not to be such an issue in subsequent films. The ending I found a little rushed by contrast and wish they had spent slightly less time on the set up and more time on the pay off.The other major problem I found were with the fight scenes, which I found slightly repetitive; the 'challenge' scenes were quite well done however the confrontation between the hero and villain at the end felt underwhelming, certainly when compared with the rest of the battle taking place elsewhere, that however is not uncommon in Marvel films.Overall well worth seeing and I look forward to more Black Panther films.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But I honestly expected a bit more from the story, since I had not read anything about the Black Panther from the Marvel comics before. At times, the movie took to long to progress, which made it boring at few points , as the movie is 2h and 15 min. long.

Let's be clear it's not a bad movie but it's just simply boring there's not enough action in the movie there's alot of talking and some glaring mistakes and poor acting. I don't want to blast this film because there is good things about it ( the black panther suit and eric killmonger where the coolest things about this movie ) but it's overrated and a movie I probably won't watch again unfortunately.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Waited 2 hours or so just to watch the cut scenes.To elaborate, this movie lacked a decent storyline, instead it was rather dull. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and as such cared little for their success or failure. Much of the hype I believe is due to the dominant African American cast. That's fine, when I watch a movie I don't care what colour people are, but in this case the hyper seems to have heavily depended on that fact and ignored more important aspects of a movie like storyline etc. The lead character was rather bland. Wait for this movie on netflix or something. I gave this movie 3 stars because Andy Serkis was funny","476 out of 1,069 found this helpful.

Surprisingly no one in this film finds that problematic.The plot doesn't make much sense either, as we have a lost son coming home wanting to hand over advanced weapons to some unstated black people terrorist groups around the world, somehow expecting them to fight for their freedom. A freedom they already have in most countries with Wakanda itself being a notable exception as we learned above. To make matters worse, the ending is so US-centric that it's unintentionally cynical but at this point you probably switched off your brain anyway.The action however is captivating as usual, Chadwick Boseman does a great job in the lead role and the setting is refreshing at least. Together this is enough to make this movie worth watching despite its shortcomings.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Director Ryan Coogler may have started out with independent dramas but his style feels at home within the MCU.Set not long after CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, the film follows T'Challa, the newly christened king of Wakanda as he combats evil forces from outside and from within his own nation.From a visual standpoint, BLACK PANTHER has one of the most beautifully rendered superhero worlds since the cosmic setting in both Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The city and landscape of Wakanda are artistically stylized as one might expect from an advanced African metropolis. The costumes and props seem practical within the MCU universe. Amazon warriors, prosthetic cannons, battle rhinos, and combat by waterfall don't seem out of place in this continuity. The nearly all-black supporting cast is mostly strong. Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis are both excellent as the villains; Jordan is especially great and perhaps the best and intimidating MCU villain since Ultron. Lupita Nyong'o is that rare capable love interest that you don't see often in comic book movies. In fact, all the female characters are strong, resilient, and play a role in the plot. Given the comparatively darker tone, both Leticia Wright and Martin Freeman lighten the mood as Black Panther's sister and CIA contact respectfully so.What's interesting is its tone and subject matter. Unafraid to incorporate politics into its plot, BLACK PANTHER boasts the usual stuff like action and spectacle, but its timely message of inclusiveness and altruism versus hatred and revenge ring so true for the present day. It's bold for a blockbuster, especially a superhero movie to proudly embrace the creativeness with an African setting and all black cast. Even rarer is the maturity to call attention to pressing social issues but condemn militant retribution as more radical elements often call for. Yes it addresses racism and other problems suffered by black people. There is already a backlash against the movie because of this. But it's conscious enough to not take the stance that means 'white people are evil' or 'black people should riot or take over'. For heaven's sake, the main antagonist Killmonger (Jordan) is an embittered black nationalist whose actions are condemned in favor of more peaceful measures. One would think the internet would be happy that an SJW is the villain but whatever. Sporting high tech gadgets, a wide cast of memorable characters, a kickass soundtrack, and even social commentary to boot, BLACK PANTHER starts the year 2018 right.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

It had a really nice story with a lot of heart and overall gave us a new experience. 
The whole cast was great and thanks to them and the directing team they have made a very good addition to the Marvel family. 
Fight scenes were pretty and the combination of technology was very cool.I did feel it jumped a bit too much in certain scenes.
However I was worried, I found that recent Marvel films like Thor tried to hard to give us a comedy and failed with other emotions. 
Spiderman homecoming was good but for me it had a few issues like every character had to be funny except Spiderman and he suddenly lost his ability to use his suit despite being incredible in Civil War. But I came out surprised and happy with Black Panther! So overall I am giving it an 8 
The reason I didnt give it a 7 is because this is the last film before Infinity Wars so the Hype is at a new level!!!!Hope you enjoy this honest review 
Enjoy Black Panther And most importantly enjoy Infinity Wars!","29 out of 91 found this helpful.

The problem is once you look beyond that it's really not a great movie and probably one of the weakest in the MCU (along with the first two Thor).The plot itself is very unoriginal, the action scenes much more limited versus other Marvel films and most noticeably there is little humour - often a staple within this universe. I also found myself finding very little chemistry between the main characters but that may just be my take.Overall it's not terrible but lacks a lot of what makes Matvel great once you scratch beneath the surface.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

First thing first, I enjoy and loved the film as it stands out on its own. Plus the world building of MCU, now were introduced to the world of Wakanda, were technology is advanced by a few decades than everywhere else around the world. But it is also kept a secret except for the people from Wakanda. It was beautiful visually; it had some good action sequences, and an inspirational plot. I will throw this out there, I feel like the movie is overhyped. It was a great movie. But when you put this up with other Marvel films. There are other great ones and better superhero movies than this. The pros about this film. Lets start with the plot. It does not feel like a Marvel movie at all. It is a good thing. It starts after the events of Captain America Civil War. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) heads back to Wakanda. He is declared King. When he sees that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up on the radar selling vibranium that only belongs to Wakanda. And the rest of the world is not ready for this technology. T'Challa chases Klaue down and discover a mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) may be his biggest challenge yet. When Killmonger wants to take over Wakanda. Plot is inspirational, about a king that does not think he is ready. But is faced with an ultimate challenge politically when he wants to do what is right for his kingdom and the rest of the world. The action sequences were good. May not be an action packed wild ride compared to other marvel movies. I ll be honest about the opening action scene was terribly lighted and dark and filled with close up camera shots and quick editing. When Black Panther attacks a convoy to rescue one of the hostages. But it gets better throughout. It has a few good action scenes. From the casino when T'Challa and Okoye (Danai Gurira) fight through some bad guys. To a car chase scene with Black Panther. And than a climatic battle Killmonger's followers and a fight between him and Panther on a futuristic railway. Director Ryan Coogler could have made some action scenes fun. When offered a 200 million budget. He really tried to be careful to not over do it. But he could have tried for a blockbuster approach. The visual effects were great. The music score stands out on its own as a MCU film with an electronic chant music. Chadwick Boseman was great as Panther/T'Challa. Michael B. Jordan was also good. And stands out as a villain. When his motivation is slowly revealed after a tragic past that made him what he is today. Lupita Nyong as Nakia was great as T'Challa's love interest and wants to do something about the real world's conflict outside Wakanda. Danai Gurira has a lot more screen time and is good too. Same with Martin Freeman, who has more to do than his brief appearance in Captain America. And Letitia Wright as Shuri was great as T'Challa's sister and is the brains in offering new technology and gadgets. Overall, Black Panther is a great film. I loved it. It is visually entertaining. The action was not top notch but it was good. The plot was great, it was a little too much in the political side than being a personal character story, and the huge cast ensemble was good. If the movie were standing alone as a superhero it would have been the best movie. But being part of the MCU, there are other great movies better than this. I feel like this film was lacking in the fun energy than the last several MCU films had. I still recommend seeing this film in theatres for its exciting action, an indifferent plot, and also there is two post credit scenes, I think the final end scene was a nice nod to a character. I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars.","22 out of 66 found this helpful.

Referencing the preceding (and forthcoming) films in Marvel's repertoire only fleetingly, Black Panther is a largely self-contained, by-the-numbers superhero flick. Which works both for it and against it. In one respect, that enables the entire cast to establish themselves. Safe from the need to constantly pay homage to Tony Stark or Thanos, Panther's supporting players thrive and King T'Challa himself goes through a complete character arc. On the other hand, it often feels like we've been here before. Maybe not specifically, as the film goes to great lengths to set up Wakanda as a unique culture with authentic customs, but certainly thematically.As a ""back to basics"" approach with well-timed, socially conscious values, it functions very well. Its flavor is like nothing else we've seen from Marvel so far - a bright, optimistic blend of tech and nature that really works - and the wide diversity of the on-screen population is both effective and appropriate.A complete, enjoyable new entry in the publisher's stacked catalog of characters, and a short breath of fresh air, if not a complete breakthrough.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So how does this film hold up, I gotta say pretty well. Action scenes are pretty well done, like in any other superhero movie. Fight scenes are awesome to watch. And the effects are mind blowing. Chadwick Boseman gives a likable performance has the main character, I mean you really route for him all the way. Let's not forget Michael B.

I ended up seeing it again because I wanted to rewatch it with some friends who still hadn't seen it, and to also see their reactions. They of course loved it. Also loving Kendrick Lamar makes the movie and the overall feeling watching it ten times more enjoyable, as I ended up having the Black Panther album on repeat in the months after the movie came out. This movie most notably elicited a very memorable and important moment in time for a lot of Black audiences/creators, who unfortunately aren't used to superhero's that look like them represented so well, and not just one but a whole cast of incredible Black talent. Daniel Kaluuya who I remember from Skins and Black Mirror (where he was literally the definition amazing), only for Get Out to come and blow our minds entirely. Things like that is made the film incredible and impossible to forget. RIP Chadwick! Listening to the music and watching his other work since his passing has created a painful, but humble emotional nostalgia within me that no recent films can compare to, and I'm grateful for him and his impact, as many are.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

The lead villlian is a bit of a caricature who lacks any real motivation other than being a resentful child with daddy issues. One of the most annoying aspects for me is that the fight choreography is generally quite poor. Unforigiveable for a film like this! Super quick editing and super close camera work make fight scenes impossible to follow. The final 'big fight scene' between the 2 panthers is just by the numbers genericness and quite possibly completely CGI. The actresses/characters who play the tough and loyal General and Black panthers technological genius sister are the most interesting and unique in the film. While the actor who plays the Black Panther just about carries it off. One of the most interesting aspect of the film is the idea of Wakanda. A futuristic city hidden in the middle of Africa. Its a nice idea and kind of joyous celebration of African culture and uniqueness. Though one might object to the fairly incongruent mash of traditional tribal stereotypes and futuristic technology. It's not overly believable. But it is a sci-fi fantasy after all. Overall I'd say it's one of the weaker Marvel superhero films but still entertaining enough if you can forgive some of the sillier African stereotypes.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Black Panther then suddenly took home 3 Academy awards and has grossed more money than any other MCU release. Also the metascore gave it an 88/100.It has it's moments of clarity and emotion but Black Panther as a whole is very average (in my opinion) referencing todays generation of meme's such as ""What are those?!"" It's like it's attempting to woo the audience with modern social references, it just comes across as cringy.This movie won an Oscar for best costume design, which i agree with as it's over view on african tribe traits was brilliant but the special effects were sour at times (No Oscar for that). It just didn't really have that spark.Deffinetely worth a watch just don't get all hyped up.

If I were to compare this to another MCU movie I guess it would be Thor. Both T'Challa and Thor are the heir apparent to their kingdoms and must challenger to the throne. However, whereas you could sympathize with Loki's jealously of Thor, the level of hostility that Killmonger has towards T'Challa never seemed appropriate to me. Nor did I totally accept the circumstances surrounding T'Chaka's little secret. While the film may be worth seeing just to get a better view of the 'black' perspective of the world we live in, these small story details really dragged the movie down a bit for me. I really wished they spent more time with Killmonger's background as he had the potential to provide the most complex character/villain in the MCU universe. But instead we're left with just another standard villain who is overcome with rage and just wants to kill everyone.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, the process changed Wakanda's future with a new threat that Wakanda had been hiding for years.Bringing up the Black Panther character is indeed a special attraction in the body of the MCU film. Black Panther does not just introduce Black Panther characters and other characters, such as Queen Ramonda, Shuri, Killmonger and even Ulysses Klaue. Nor is it by introducing the conflict of fighting for the throne to become the next king, but rather the cultural elements of African society that adorn this film. Many references to African culture are used in this film so that this film enriches the use of culture and history that exists in the world in the MCU, including the extraordinary African culture. Black Panther has an interesting and cool beauty in describing the country of Wakanda as a country with the use of cutting-edge technology. The design of the cities and even the technology displayed also attracts attention. In terms of the premise of the story, Black Panther presents a pretty good story to introduce the situation of Wakanda and Vibranium in the future of the MCU. It is worth appreciating the performances of Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. Featuring fraternal conflicts is like a medieval film in a power struggle. It's unfortunate that in some fights it seems that the CGI quality is not perfect, especially when the fight scene is in the cave.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

He brings regal charisma and depth to the character, making T'Challa a relatable and inspiring hero.Black Panther stands out in the superhero genre for its rich and vibrant depiction of Wakanda, an advanced African nation hidden from the rest of the world. The film's stunning visual aesthetics, costume design, and world-building create a captivating and immersive experience.The film's supporting cast, including Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger and Danai Gurira as Okoye, delivers powerful performances that add layers of complexity to the narrative. The characters are multi-dimensional and provide a refreshing departure from one-dimensional villains often seen in superhero films.Black Panther's thematic exploration of identity, legacy, and responsibility is thought-provoking and resonates with audiences on a deeper level. It raises important questions about social justice, the consequences of isolationism, and the importance of unity.Director Ryan Coogler's vision and storytelling skill shine throughout the film. He expertly balances action-packed sequences with poignant character moments, creating a movie that is both entertaining and emotionally impactful.The film's representation of strong and empowered female characters, like Okoye, Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), and Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), is commendable and sends a powerful message about the importance of diverse and inclusive narratives.While some may argue that the film's CGI effects in certain scenes could be improved, Black Panther's overall impact on the superhero genre and its cultural significance outweigh any minor technical criticisms.In conclusion, Black Panther is a groundbreaking and empowering superhero film that celebrates African culture and representation while delivering a thrilling and thought-provoking narrative. With its stellar performances, rich world-building, and powerful themes, it has left an indelible mark on cinema and popular culture.If you're a fan of superhero films that go beyond the standard formula and celebrate diversity and empowerment, Black Panther is a must-watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, it's better than most. So let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons. Let's stay positive for a minute. The costumes, designs, music, and acting is all really good. I especially like Michael B. Jordan's performance. It was a different beat to everyone else in the film. This movie is also a lot more colorful than most Marvel movies, which are typically kinda drab. This one pops with colors, much like Thor: Ragnarok and the Guardians movies, so that's great. Now let's get to the part you've been waiting for: the villain. Killmonger is probably my favorite MCU villain so far (I haven't seen Infinity War yet, so I can't say anything about Thanos). The main reason I like him is not so much the motivation, but the impact he has on Black Panther. Killmonger's vision makes T'Challa change his mindset, which no other MCU villain has ever done. The things I didn't like. The CGI was not always good. In some scenes, it looked like PS2 graphics, which is embarassing. This is my only big complaint with the movie. Overall, this is not the best MCU movie, but it's definiteky not the worst. It's probably in my top five.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Dumb yet entertaining...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4065838/?ref_=tt_urv","invisibleunicornninja","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur85371862/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2018","I went to see this movie with my friend in theaters without either of us knowing anything about the character. The biggest thing that took away from my experience of this movie was some a**hole who thought it would be a good idea to go on their phone during the climax and light up the theater. In case you're reading this review before you watch, I'd like to let you know that there are two end credits scenes. If you like watching them, be sure to wait around until the very end. This movie probably doesn't deserve the high rating I gave it, but I had a lot of fun watching. Cinematography - The CGI in this movie was a bit inconsistent. Some scenes looked really fake while the majority was extremely well done. Most of the fight scenes were done very well, while others looked terrible (there was a fight scene at the beginning taking place in the middle of a forest that looked terrible). Overall, this was a very colorful and aesthetically pleasing film. Characters - The acting was amazing all around, bringing these characters to life. Though most of the characters were intelligent, I did find The Black Panther's dad to be one of the most stupid and infuriating people to ever exist on this planet. Most of the characters had some kind of motivation for doing what they were doing, which just made them even more believable. Plot - The plot was predictable. I i figured out the majority of the events before they even happened. Though I had a lot of fun watching this movie, the plot was pretty cliche and formulaic. There weren't too many character arcs and a movie that had so much potential fell a bit flat. There could've been more conflict and possibly some kind of internal struggle within the main character to make it more interesting, but for some reason they decided not to do that. The Fight Scenes - Save for a few shots of your standard hyper edited Marvel movie fight scene bs, the majority of the fight scenes in this movie are well-choreographed. Despite there being no tension (because all the ""good guys"" are basically invincible) they are pretty fun. However, there is a scene where a woman gets her throat slit onscreen and there is no blood. There are actually a lot of scenes with people getting stabbed and there being no blood. This is a movie that will drop the f-bomb but avoid blood at almost all costs. You can't just pull a spear out of someone's abdomen and had it be shiny and clean THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. The Humor - The movie mostly fails at this. There are a few funny elements to this movie (like the leader of the mountain tribe) but most of the ""humor"" consists of outdated memes. There is actually a scene where a character makes a 4-year-old ""what are those reference"" and everyone in the theater cringed loudly (there were a lot of people in that theater). However, later in the same scene the same character is involved in a pretty funny gag where she kinda pranks The Black Panther by withholding information on his new suit. Like the CGI, the humor in this movie is inconstant in quality. Technology - Unlike other movies with futuristic technology, all of the tech shown in this movie looked convenient and actually useful in some way. Sound Design - The soundtrack for this movie was amazing (in my opinion) and unique. The sound design also helped with bringing to life this futuristic world. I have some hearing difficulties an usually have a lot of trouble understanding speech (at home I usually watch movies with the subtitles turned on) and especially people with accents different from my own, but at no point was I struggling to understand an English-speaking character in this movie. The music and background noise doesn't drown out the characters speaking. Also most everyone in the theater was polite enough to let everyone hear what was going on. I'm just mentioning all this because it was greatly appreciated. I realize that not everyone is going to enjoy this movie like I did, and there are plenty of people who will get bored by the 2 hour+ runtime, but I was throughly invested for the entire duration of the movie. I believe I've explained my reasons. If you don't like Marvel movies, don't see it. If you think that a sci-fi superhero story with incredible new worlds and a fun story sounds interesting, go see it. If you are someone who thinks that this movie is in any way trying to be political, I'd recommend that you go see a psychologist. There is nothing political about this movie. Its a fun dumb superhero movie with black main characters. I don't see why there are people using this movie in discussions about race.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

This movie in my opinion was telling the story what it needed to tell the audience perfectly but there also alot of flaws. A non-marvel fan speaking so i mean it when i say this gave what needed and the whole movie makes sense and i understand the story line but there were A LOT of some specific scenes that could have tell the meaning better or the villian's story that could have line it to have more meaning or the CGI that if you know this fanchise this movie could have done a better job on that part.but overall? This movie was great the casting the story and cgi are definitely better. The star of this movie which is T'Challa is cool. Very cool but the plot and origin was kinda make you say ""that's it?'' the pacing was good but compare a stand alone superhero movie like captain america or ironman this movie is below the rank from how this hero become a hero. The part that i love is that the fact that we finally see some more of cool super hero that aren't just blone hair and blue eyes type of hero. No hate to other movies but if you really think about it, you will see the pattern. This movie has potential to be the one of my top superhero movies but the dialogues,origin story of characters are less interesting but look in the positive over all of this movie? It is not AS bad but also definitely not the best. I just wanna say that i enjoyed it as much as it gave so would say that i love this movie. Also this movie has the best endcredit song ever!! I got chills.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa has actual character growth throughout the film and it makes for an incredible journey. I even think Killmonger may be the one of the best villains to date. The main reason I wanted to write a review is because I think it is awful how many horrible reviews have been popping up on here about this movie.

The acting was reasonable for what they were trying to accomplish, the villain had more nuance than many other marvel bad guys (although I felt this was at least partially because it's 'wrong' today to create a black character that's irredeemably bad, but considering I want all villains to be treated like this I can't complain about the double standards too much). I had a few questions about how having a better metal makes them basically a futuristic sci fi society (stronger metal doesn't automatically equal flying cars, that's not how science works), but it made for a visually spectacular film. It suffers from the same syndrome as Asgard where for some reason their army forgoes ranged weapons in order to use amped up swords (despite being futuristic) oh well. All in all, not a terrible film, not amazing, but not bad","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

As in this
It's mr freeman's turn and it seems we're sort on us actors as he was supposed to be a American
Y not just keep him British or even get someone else. But then I remembered I think marvel have used most American actors alreadyI def expected more action only action last around ten min in Korea 
Go watch Andy lau films better action in South Korea all thru 
To me people just scared of saying don't like it
I'm not
Reminds me when I was in USA when avatar came out everyone goin on how grt it was I walked out of cinema thinking what a waste of three hrs and never watched again how he conned studios to make 2-3-4 lol
Well it's like this with marvel we all like comic book movies but getting to many I mean pt 1-2-3 etc y not do Thor 4 hrs or avengers 4 hrs with break in between like yrs back Bollywood do. But no BECAUSE they want us lot to listen to PAID reviewers and press and waste our money it's s scam tbh needs stopping rt IMDb all dodgy scores but get away with it
I for one would welcome a independent review
Most press screenings they get Little keep sakes now I wonder what's in them I really do
But watch enjoy but don't expect to much if u like it grt if you don't its grt again","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

You could say that from a movie that got only a dozen reviews but not in this case with more than 2000 reviews. I've seen dozens of movies where the ratings were rigged but Black Panther is not one of them. That you don't like this movie is your right, but don't talk about fake reviews, because in this case you're the one with a fake review, giving the lowest score possible is just a joke. You're not going to tell me that this movie was one of the worst movies you ever saw, or I can only conclude you never watched alot of movies before. I'm not a big fan of Marvel movies, most of the time I'm a bit bored, but with Black Panther I didn't have that feeling. The story was interesting, maybe not perfect but at least it wasn't boring. The acting was okay even if it was not world class acting. The computer generated images were in most of the cases good, sometimes they could have been better, certainly with a high budget like that, but nonetheless it was all entertaining. And entertainment is exactly what I expect to get when watching this kind of movies. So for the negative people I would just say to get a life and rate it fairly, like a four or five stars but not a one star because that's just ridiculous.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

In my vision, Black panther is the Marvel version of Batman. So, before seeing the movie, I didn't have any high expectations to this character. Just another version of Batman.
But let's face it - this is an different movie. 
First of all, whole film some feeling would get a hold in my mind. Am i watching a modern interpretation of Lion King or Marvel version of Agent 007 ? 
I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. And at the same time, a classy DISNEY film. That is not to say it is bad, but film where Black Panther supposed to get his own movie, not about his character a bit disappointed me. They focused way too much on portraying a political, racial, African cultures and futuristic African dreamland ""Wakanda"". Where illustrated how powerful black people are, even females in this movie were intelligent and extremely courageous. #feminism The Black Panther character was used just only as driving force to next scene. Despite this issue, the plot is solid and the actors are excellent. Especially Michael B. Jordan character (Killmonger) who provides a great contrast with a potent motivation. I can say, one of interesting villains in Marvel universe. Other characters are just complimentary for this movie. 
As usually Visual effects and CGI were stunning, there was a little gaps with some poor lighting, but probably problem accrued from quality of our local Cinema. 6 out of 10 (If i have to classify this film as Marvel film)

Black panther stands triumphantly as it's own story, understood to be taking place in the grander scheme, but telling a story firmly rooted in it's own world, and not leaning too hard into being an infinity War lead-up. Compared to plethora of MCU films, and even to the current deluge of films in the super-hero genre, with releases this year from Fox, Sony, and others, Black Panther is a fun solid start to 2018's year of the superhero.The film has spectacular action sequences, a beautifully moving and creative score, design work evoking African culture while melding with fictional advanced technology. However, the film is not without its faults. The plot is predictable when it's not all over the place. The script fails to endear us to characters in the way the score is begging us to feel. Many characters' motivations are constantly undefined. And the 3D conversion is nauseating (and that's coming from someone who ALWAYS chooses the watch a movie in 3D if available).There is a moment in the Avengers where Thor says of Thanos' intentions that his interest in Earth stems from the fact that Earth has demonstrated they are ready for a higher form of war, and Black Panther asks the audience to accept a higher form of superhero film, and while I applauded it for its attempt, and for the moments where it succeeds, that just makes the moments where it falters all the more disappointing and unforgivable.You can't ask an audience to come along on a more intellectual movie and then hand them a B grade superhero flick. I don't fault critics for being so overwhelmingly positive about this movie, it's a good movie with a positive message, and I'm rating it positively too, it's just not the movie we needed, it's not the Messiah that it's being hailed as.Wonder woman needed to be good so that we can get other female led superhero films. Black panther needed to be good because we need better minority representation in films, in genre films specifically. Not just in characters, but in story. And in that regard, it will undoubtedly succeed in making sure studio executives believe investing in movies like Black Panther is a good idea and will bring audiences to the theatres in droves. In that way the movie has most definitely succeed.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Refreshing hero in a fun, but underwhelming narrative","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4062593/?ref_=tt_urv","paulijcalderon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21101534/?ref_=tt_urv","14 February 2018","""Black Panther Down"" is the movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Orlando Bloom for 2 seconds. Alright, I'm just joking. It's been a long day, but I got the chance to check out the new Marvel movie, which I had no real expectations for. The marketing didn't get me hooked and it all sort of felt underwhelming to me. But I wanted to see it since I liked the Black Panther a lot in ''Civil War'' with his ""I don't care"" attitude. The character did grow with his own little story arc, so when you see him now, he's become a more responsable man. The movie was fine in my eyes. It's your usual Marvel picture when it comes to story and visuals, but at least it's an entertaining flick with enough craziness to keep you locked in for two hours. That's something I feel that the guys at Marvel aren't afraid of anymore; to go all out with the comic book weirdness and sometimes campyness. Now they wanna embrace it. Which has been strongly evident in the last ""Thor"" movie. That's not to say that there isn't any grittiness, because there is. It's all combined into one here. I'll applaud them for going to new places. But the end result didn't stick out to be more than mainly a fun time with popcorn at the movies.I would have probably changed the visual style more if I was the one making it. Can they use less green-screen next time, please? It's Africa! I wanna see the savannas and the fantastic nature sights. There's an over-reliance of just resorting to fake digital backgrounds rather than using real locations. The digital gloom over everything lessened the visual appeal for me. But, hey! That's just the look. How's the story? Yeah, it's decent. I liked the grounded stuff mixed with African culture and/or mythology. The Wakandan technology and civilization was jarring to me at first sight. Not even Tony Stark has that level of tech. It was too much of a future city for my taste. Although the question of why the Wakandan tech has never been heard of before is brought in the movie as a major plot point. So I thought it was nice that it was addressed. The characters are fun and everyone brings a nice charisma to the screen. Chadwick Boseman, Lupita NYong'o and Forest Whittaker give their absolute care to the movie. It's no paycheck day for sure. It feels like Martin Freeman basically just hanged around on set. I was happy to see him there though. Because he would see and react to Wakandan culture like we, the audience would. The villains are good, but like in most previous Marvel films; they get sidelined again. Andy Serkis brought a fantastic personality to his mischievous guy, but his screen-time is limited. That was an unwise choice. Michael B. Jordan (AKA Creed) is also very interesting and unique. Not very often these days when you can understand the villain's motive so well. The main group are, like I mentioned, good and all.. But, the biggest problem I have is that the story line goes to all the expected places. It's pretty much like ""we've done all of this stuff before"". I wasn't surprised by where the plot ended up going because it's usual business and all so going through the familiar beats. It would have been more fun with some different twists. The action is entertaining. You even get a ''Skyfall''-like casino scene, but with some additional slow-mo fighting, of course.Did I care for the story? Sure. There are neat moments and a fun adventure with good heroes to root for. None of it was captivating enough to raise my enjoyment unfortunately. I could see the emotional things and what they were trying to do. But, I didn't feel it. Black Panther is a superhero I've known almost nothing about. That's the reason I decided to go in as blank as I could. I would have loved to have been surprised, but I got a fun action movie with like-able heroes instead. Ultimately the character is sort of a mix of ""The Phantom"" and ""Batman"". I'm a fan of both those two and if you haven't read the Phantom comics, then I would highly recommend them. I wanted to see more of the tone you'd read there. It's grounded, but it feels a little fantastical too. The jungle is dark and mysterious. Filled with many legends and roads to unknown adventures. Well, I think my review has ended up too long, so I'll wrap it up. I'm sure Black Panther can become even better down the line, if there's more focus on delivering something less predictable and maybe more personal. Oh, and delve into the mythology and the mysticism more next time. It did what it had to do; to entertain and make audiences feel familiar with Wakanda. Now my thought is that ""Infinity War"" better deliver. Show me what 10 years of this Cinematic Universe has been leading up to. Do not play it safe, please. Any way, ""Black Panther"" was fine. It's a good time, but it should have had more weight.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

Just another superhero film but with a strangely realized African spin.I could not quite get over how the Wakandan culture made no sense at all. They somehow became a super advanced country courtesy of finding Vibranium yet didn't get around to ever working out how to develop a democracy or proper legal system but rather having totalitarian regimes ruled by Kings who are chosen on their ability to physically fight each other - i.e. stone age tribe stuff. And when they get injured there's no sign of the super-duper technology but rather they're reaching for some healing plant or other. It's like you discovered some primitive tribe out in the depths of the Amazon rainforest and found they happened to have iPhones. Weird.I can't work out if it's politically correct garbage or racist garbage. Are we being shown that black African cultures could be super advanced or being shown that even if they were, they'd still be acting like primitive tribes - which by the way, they're not even now.All that aside, I found much of the acting pretty awful and the rest of the plot and effects just bog standard. Overall very average. Defo will not be eagerly awaiting Black Panther 2","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

But praise for ""Black Panther"" was over the moon, and people were specifically saying that it broke the super hero mold and gave us something unique and reflective of our times. To which I say....""Nope."" This is just another super hero movie, and it follows all of the safe, bland super hero movie conventions.I do appreciate that the film is driven by African American characters and themes, because Lord knows if any genre needed a dose of color (or estrogen for that matter), the super hero genre was it. And I also appreciate how the film uses a super hero movie setting to explore questions of black identity in the larger world. But folks are giving it way too much credit. I was actually shocked by how poorly directed the film was, especially the climactic battle scenes, a hot mess if ever there was one, and how terrible the visual effects were. The film looks incredibly cheap.And it's all just so silly, which is how I feel about all super hero movies. In super hero world, everyone wears ridiculous costumes and speaks in formal, portentous accents, and says things like ""vibranium"" with a straight face. This movie, like others of its ilk, would do well to plant its tongue a bit more firmly in cheek. No, ""Black Panther"" benefited from timing. It was the movie people needed in the cultural moment, and I think audiences were seeing what they wanted to see in it whether it was really there or not. But divorced from that specific cultural moment, the film doesn't seem like anything special. Grade: B","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. Kudos to production designer Hannah Beachler, for making Wakanda look absolutely gorgeous & otherworldly. Chadwick Boseman is brilliant as T'Challa/Black Panther. Boseman effectively portrays T'Challa's various emotions & inner conflicts. Michael B. Jordan is spectacular as Erik Killmonger. Lupita Nyong'o is outstanding as Nakia. Danai Gurira is excellent as Okoye. Martin Freeman is awesome as Everett K. Ross. Daniel Kaluuya is excellent as W'Kabi. Letitia Wright is amazing as Shuri. Winston Duke is great as M'Baku. Sterling K. Brown is unforgettable as N'Jobu. Angela Bassett is impressive as Ramonda. Forest Whitaker is good as Zuri. Andy Serkis gives the performance of a lifetime, as Ulysses Klaue.

The villain, despite a likeable actor, was a weak and uninspired one. The son of traitor who trained in the army and has returned to take the throne.

That's saying a lot from someone who's used to routines throughout the week.
They pack a lot into this chapter for the panther. I haven't taken the time to actually research the comic book character. Thankfully, there's plenty of exposition at the beginning, which is a good thing considering that there has been plenty of hype for each Marvel movie that comes out. It really helps the audience because this day in age, most people won't bother to do any research. For some movies, yes, you should get on Wikipedia or YouTube the character and see what pops up.
There's a lot that Black Panther is, and there's a lot that it isn't in the way of comic book adaptions. Marvel is getting better and better at keeping the superheroes fresh for the intended audience. The problem with DC is the way they've been handling their superheroes, but that's a whole different topic.
Yes, this is a bit of a political storyline, but at the same time the political side of the movie thankfully doesn't overpower the rest of it. There's plenty of action, ripped guys w their shirts off for the girls to leak their hormones all over, plenty of comedic moments and everything else in between. Martin Freeman's character is rather left hanging on as the comedic role, considering he's done this before w The Hobbit trilogy. 
As far as the culture of Wakanda, it's a mix between Iron Man's work and something you might see in Bruce Wayne's Bat-cave. Several parts made me think they could've used some of this technology in The Dark Knight trilogy. That is one impressive cave the panther has. The only thing that really stood out to me that was different was seeing that one guy who had that ornamental piece attached to his lip, ;-)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've learned to stop reading reviews and what critics are saying about movies today because all they ever do anymore is shred the filmmakers to pieces. I want to be entertained, not to go into a theater to judge a movie. The rare exception would be sitting down to some Batman movie that would be similar to Batman & Robin. I'm a huge Bat-fan.
Well, I certainly enjoyed this entry in the MCU. Would probably get it when it's out on home video, or available for streaming off Amazon.","18 out of 55 found this helpful.

This movie was spectacular. Saw it 2x and it's even better the 2nd viewing. I see a lot of average movie going fan boys looking for a certain atmosphere that very familiar in the other marvel movies and yet are unaware that this film breaks all of that with food reason. After seeing some of the mixed reviews it's VERY CLEAR that these so called Marvel fans don't read comics as much as they say. Particularly with Black Panther. This movie does does no set ups for sequels or other movies. (Unless u wait for end credits) It strictly holds its own as a solo superhero movie. And of course it speaks to black audiences like no other before it. So obviously NOT EVERYONE will relate to the allegorical messages. However, unless you've been living under a rock, those same messages SHOULD help you understand the perspectives. It's not convoluted nor complex in it's narrative. And I must say.....THE.....BEST....VILLAIN.....EVER. Yes Loki can take a seat. Kilmonger was vicious, dangerous and........relatable. As well as the rest of the cast. Phenomenal job with everyone. Ladies......you killed it!!!! This movie has indeed set a new bar for marvel and I hope they press foward and take notes with what they did with BP. Great job.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

Special Effects: Good, with a few very good parts, especially in a couple of the vision scenes. 2. Acting: All characters were well cast, keeping with Marvel's record (in my opinion). Very impressed with Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa. He is believable as a king new to the throne and a man with a good heart who wants to be a good ruler. There was good interaction between him and his cousin, too.3. Story: Average, as stated above, it took a while before I really got into it, probably the longest out of any of the MCU movies.4.

Not because the movie and marketing didn't ask for it, but after watching the film, the movie is really nothing more than another marvel film. The movie does things better and worse compared to other marvel films, but as it stands outside of the spectrum, it's predictable and isn't anything more than a superhero film. I'm very glad we have a superhero film that is this heavy in the representation of the black community during this age of popularity in superhero films, but that's really as far as any ""political stance"" should go into this film.As a movie, it's fine. There wasn't any moment in the film where I felt impressed from what I was looking at, and there were times where I know Marvel can do better. Lets start with what I think it did superior to other marvel films.1. The music. I think this is hands down the best original soundtrack we have gotten from a marvel film, and this is easily on par with the actual usage of their soundtrack outside of the guardian movies. Instead of being generic samey orchestra music that is used in every marvel film, we now have a soundtrack that sticks out from others in the franchise. 2. The villains. Marvel has been getting better with their villains since Guardians Vol 2. And this movie has two. Both of which were my favorite performances in the film, being Michael B Jordan and Andy Serkis respectfully. It's really refreshing also seeing a villain you can root for this time around.3. The designs of the characters, world and weapons. How the CGI looked is a topic for later, but i loved the world of Wakanda and watching the characters walk around it. And every character had something in their design that felt right for the character they were playing.And that's really about it. And those things listed above aren't anything real impressive, just good. Now for the negatives. The CGI and all the effects were horrid. And I can't believe some people are trying to say it was passable. Every time the camera was zoomed out and black panther was on screen he looked straight out of a video game. It was superman in Justice League levels of bad. This goes for most of the environments, spaceships, animals etc. I know CGI is necessary for this movie and I'm not bashing CGI, but when you film outside couldn't you just use the outside? what's the point of the green screen and why does it look so bad? Anytime they were in a room that didn't have anything more than 1 level, it was clearly CGI city. Also the jokes. Marvel movies are known for being pretty funny and generally I agree even when the jokes ruin perfectly good scenes, (cough cough Ragnarok, cough cough Guardians 2) the jokes in this movie gave me a smile at most. And I think a dreamworks executive might of mixed his script into this one because there is a ""what are those"" joke, a ""I make it rain"" joke, and a ""whip her hair back and forth"" joke. Way to slap a stamp on this movie that says ""this was made in the 2010's""While the negatives of this film affect my overall score pretty greatly as they are significant parts in the film, the rest of the film is very okay. The story and plot is okay. The dialogue outside of the jokes is okay. The action is okay. If it wasn't for the original setting and feel of the theme in the music this movie would be right alongside Doctor Strange and Ant Man as just another stepping stone for the marvel franchise. I'm glad I watched it, I still enjoyed it, I'm just really not rushing at all to see it again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nothing less, nothing more. I wasn't as impressed by it as with some other MCU movies, and there were definietly a few flaws, mainly in the action and CGI department. That being said, the positives in this movie most definietly outweigh the negatives. The plot is engaging and showcases the fictional culture of Wakanda nicely. I liked how different it felt than other movies in the MCU, and how it was more about internal political struggles rather than The End of the Entire World as we Know it. The characters are great as well, T'Challa and Erik were both nicely fleshed out, and the side characters were mostly good as well. The chemistry between them all is very delightful. The pacing is solid as well, and so are the emotional moments. I have a few problems with the movie though. The cgi is way too overused at some points, especially the final fight scene. The action itself also feels a bit stiff, the fighting feels a little too slow and unimpactful. The movie also tries to be funny at some points, which more often than not feels extremely tedious. Still though, those flaws aren't enough to make the movie bad, not in the slightest. It's a well told, well written, pretty powerful story that ties nicely into the MCU storyline, and I have no regrets about watching it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Pros
1: the entire fate of the world / galaxy / universe is at stake. Not some alien creature yet again destroying some planet / world / universe yet again, until our costumed heroes stop them yet again.
2: Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger. Not just your usual 'Enemy of the Week Who Will Be Dead by the End of the Movie'. His ""you killed my father, prepare to die"" Inigo Montoya routine seemed very same old, same old that the reveal of his motivations initially left me fairly dubious. But Michael B. Jordan is so charismatic he sells it.
3: Letitia Wright's absolutely delightful, scene-stealing performance as Shuri in the film, I hope she is used in other movies. Shuri could schoolTony Stark on technology, and I hope Marvel put this in a movie. Wright's portrayal was a bright spot that lifted the dour moments without becoming just lame comic relief.
4: The supporting cast is solid (Not always the case with Marvel) General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira (Michone from Walking Dead). Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, or Lupita Nyong'o, all of whom are excellent in their respective roles as well.
5: Daniel Kaluuya performanceCons
1: The combat scenes are a real problem. The casino battle was too dark and difficult to follow what was going on. The final showdown didn't work as well for me. CGI Hero fights someone with identical powers in a different-coloured CGI suit. How many times have we seen that in Marvel movies?? 
2: The CGI was quite poor at times
3: A bit predictable at times. I appreciated the foreshadowing with the introduction of the second suit, though. As soon as it turned up in Shuri's lab, it was obvious what it would be used for
4: Daniel Kaluuya (he is on both lists) The screenplay really doesn't do him any favours at all!! His character arc is basically ""We're best friends!! Wait. You lost one fight with a guy I hate, so I'm supporting your rival. Then, I've changed my mind, let's be friends again now that my side is losing!"" W'Kabi isn't portrayed as a weaselly character that bends whichever way the wind is blowing!! He's just an underwritten character who just goes back and forth as the plot demands.
5: It lacked an emotional connection for me. When Forest Whitaker died it is played out as a moment that should have left us devastated, but I just wasn't bothered. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it's not up there with my top Marvel movies, let alone my favourite superhero movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There wasn't the regular reliance on quick witted jokes when fight scenes were becoming boring which have become commonplace in Thor, Dr Strange, and Avengers. Instead each fight scene was important for the development of the plot and the character arcs often showing us the struggles characters had choosing their loyalties between country, humanity or their loved ones.
This movie avoided, for the most part, the cliche of the all powerful object which if the enemy get their hands on it will bring about the destruction of the universe as we know it. In Black Panther the story trying to be told is of the dangers of isolationism and the conflicts and caveats to blind loyalty to your country not the normal story told in Marvel films of fighting against the threat of the destruction of the universe. There a thread of ideas weaved throughout this film, illusions to the injustices of colonialism and slavery, and the many injustices that persist in our world today like the ever widening wealth inequality on earth and across the USA. This change of tone may have thrown some regular Marvel enthusiasts off slightly but it is vitally important. I believe that the inability to see these messages or the rejection of the truth in them is something that has driven many bad reviews on this site.
The director and writer managed to build multiple interesting characters all with developed characteristics and understandable reasoning behind their actions. Our main antagonist for example had an important relatable world view and his motivations were not so different from many of the hero's of Marvel and DC.
I am thoroughly shocked at the amount of negative reviews on this site and have noticed that the only criticisms they have been able to conjure could be applied to any comic book based film from the last 10 years. It seems they've been placed here to slander the film when there is little evidence that any of these 'critics' have actually taken the time to watch this film.
I need not mention the great things this film has done for the empowerment of poc and women. As a white man I may be the wrong person to represent what Hollywood's acceptance that a film like this needed to be made means to the world. With a nearly all black cast and strong female characters in positions we wouldn't normally see them in technology and war we're finally seeing some progress. I'm happy to see that Hollywood is changing its ways and I hope this isn't just an isolated example.
Along with Winter Soldier, Guardians and Wonder Woman I rate this as one of Marvels greatest successes, I hope they continue to make movies like this in the future and less of the over reliance of Bathos that we've seen in recent years in Dr Strange and Avengers.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has plenty of decent action, a couple of scenes in which you think to yourself ""really?""But all in all rating it 1 star says more about you than this film. Can people PLEASE start making their reviews AFTER thinking first. Don't let the over hype anger you and then rate it 1 star.

Unfortunately, 20 of them were little kids who came on a church bus and talked loudly through the whole movie. The plot was solid and the action was great. The CGI was pretty bad in a few places, (a missing arm that you can kind of see). We liked the tech and there were a couple of laughs. The bad guy was believable with motivation that was on track. There was a romance that played well. Overall a great effort from Marvel. The politics kept us away and when I said it was 4/5 stars on FB it only took a few minutes before someone called me racist. Like Wonder Woman (which was also a 4/5 star film for me), they don't get the absurd statement. If you like a movie because it has a woman you are sexist just as if you dislike a movie because it has a woman. Same thing here with race. Race did not play into my enjoyment of the film. It was good. It wasn't in my top 5 superhero movies. Maybe my top 10. I'd recommend it. One of the best things about it is they kept it PG13, no cussing or nudity or over the top violence. I really liked that.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

They are babies, they don't pay attention what happens on screen when there is no fight going on. Of course they are getting bored. They woud like to see a Black Panther movie like 90 minutes about hero fighting ANYONE.They right however, this film is not an average Marvel movie, however i would use the word BETTER, not worse. What I really like that side characters have been built up better than any previous Marvel movie before. Strong acting, but it is true that the lead character should have been better.
Wakanda representation was also OK for a 120min movie which is not a documentary film. This film also give time for such serious questions like migrants, technology sharing, moral decisions.The villain has clear motivations and they found an excellent actor for the role.Actions scenes are pretty good, although i have to mention the CGI had some quality issues, luckily only few times.I recommend to watch this film, but only if you don't want more than a popcorn superhero movie with more fight, less explanation","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not just for Marvel Studios as they continue their effortless cinematic universe, but for the multicultural film industry. The biggest blockbuster featuring a predominantly black cast, I have to applaud every single contribution made...they never succumbed to the pressure and have produced one of Marvel's stronger chapters. T'Challa returns to Wakanda after the events of 'Civil War' and must prove to be a worthy successor to the throne. Meanwhile, the precious resources secluded in this region are slowly becoming noticed by other nations, to which a worthy adversary soon arrives to challenge T'Challa. We are presented with an ever present scale. Either securing an extremely powerful material for the benefit of one nation or distributing it to other countries to establish a sense of hierarchy. This subtle political message adds that additional layer of depth amidst the hectic action. Boasted by energetic engrossing performances from all cast members, and we have ourselves a successful blockbuster. The story surprisingly was thick with plenty of world building, memorable characters and a few shifts in motives that provide some complexity to the narrative. A barrage of humour, some jokes land and several lines do not...I'm looking at you whoever included ""What are those!?"". The fight choreography was well executed, particularly during the ritual challenges. The visual effects were put to good use, Wakanda's architecture and technology was creatively inventive. The human CGI still remains mediocre, and is ridiculously noticeable during the final battle. The soundtrack masterfully blends African drums with American beats, highlighting modern and cultural significance. Oh, and finally a villain that just doesn't want to destroy the world. How refreshing. It really does come to no surprise that Marvel Studios continue their current dominance in blockbuster cinema.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Just a humble reminder, this review is SPOILER FREE,so read along.
Firstly, you aren't a true marvel fan if you are reading this, but if you are not sure and are confused about the mixed reception this movie is getting, then may be you should consider going through this article.
CAST-
The casting, as every other marvel film is just perfect. Chadwick Boseman, who was last seen dawning the black panther outfit in Captain America- Civil war has done justice to the role, and we all loved his performance as king of Wakanda. Micheal Jordon who plays the lead antagonist in the film is rumoured to be the best marvel villain after Loki (and of course excluding the titan Thanos) but I would like to disagree. The role did demand a level of seriousness, but I loved Andy Serkis as Klaw.He did cracked us up with his great coming timing and funny behaviour.Coming to the female lead Nupita Nyong'o, am I the only one or she really looks similar to Jennifer Lawrence? The rest of the cast faithfully presented as their respective soles demanded.The writers did an amazing job in telling us a story of Wakanda, and linking it to El dorado. It does gets a bit predictable at times, but you do have a good share of scenes where you involuntarily will go ""Ohhhhhs"" & ""Ahhhhhhs"".
The action scenes are few but brilliantly executed,and the Wakandan empire, the most advance country in marvel cinematic universe does blow your mind with all its science and technology.I can identify why people are not appreciate the movie and the ratings are also not what it deserved. The first one being inadequate action (perhaps?). The trailer packed us all with loads of excitement,but the movie was more of a great plot and drama but a bit less of action. Also, there are obviously going to be comparison between this movie and the last marvel film, Thor-Ragnarok. The third instalment for the Thor series, is considered,by far, the best marvel film ever, and mainly due to its superb comic timing. Black panther too does boast scenes which tickle your funny bone, but we also need to understand that this is the first Black panther stand alone movie, and considering that the movie is fit to be called a blockbuster. Not to forget what marvel movies are famous for, a good Stan Lee cameo and a post credit scene as well, which I not going to reveal.DO NOT READ this paragraph if you haven't watched the movie till now.
The greatest disappointment was that there was no sign of the soul stone. There were a lot of valid arguments and speculations about soul stone to be introduced in this movie, which didn't come true.My conclusion is that no matter what the world thinks,this is a marvel film and YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!","7 out of 29 found this helpful.

The characters successfully animated diverged narratives and choices that are possible to a people who had suffered a history of terror and oppression, and the greatness of a true king who stood for what is right. A great feast for both eyes and the intellect.","18 out of 56 found this helpful.

I did like how the story was about Black Panther, and his origin as king, not really about him becoming BP (he was already that in Civil War). There were lots of people saying things like ""breaks the Marvel mold"" This is a brave new direction for superhero films"".
It doesn't and its not. The only one that has changed the mold was Winter Soldier, a movie that was a spy thriller first and a super hero movie second, but we are not talking about that movie here.
The acting in the movie, for the most part, is fine. Some actors really did need to step up their game, but they didn't get too much time wasted on them.The villain, though better with his motives, was just as forgettable as the rest of the villains in this franchise.If you are a marvel fan, yes you will like it, if you are a super hero fan, yes you will like it....will you need to come back and see it again...well I don't, but hey maybe they hype worked on you....","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

Maybe I had too high expectations for it due to the hype but a lot of elements felt way worse than other marvel flicks.The action(both fight scenes and action set pieces) ranged from semi-decent to God awful. The final fight in particular had terrible CGI and wonky physics. The normal fight scenes weren't that good either. They were both shot(sometimes it feels like the cameraman is having a seizure while the combatants are having a slap fight, sample of what you're going to get I guess) and choreographed terribly. It's like they watched the fight style of the Raid films but forgot hire good stuntmen and choreographers.The MCU can do really intense fight scenes like the elevator fight in TWS but nothing in this movie comes even close to that. So anyone expecting badass fights based on BPs scenes in civil war, you're going to be massively disappointed.Edit: sample of the final fight I am talking about as wellThis isn't a work print. This is what you will get in the cinema. I got called a troll for saying it. So you can look at it yourselves.If anybody thought the CGI in wonder woman climax was a turn off , then you're certainly not going to like this and unlike WW the CGI is like this in most CGI heavy scenes in the film.(particularly the car chase yikes).The world building is good if you think Bright and the Star wars prequels had great world building. It just felt artificial for the most part(again partly because of the mediocre CGI), you're not going to get a memorable location like the cantina bar or the Troll market from Hellboy 2 which feels like real places with it's own unique personalities. Wakanda for the most part like Asgard has a few cool establishing shots where we see some interesting designs but they're are not really fleshed out much and again the uneven CGI isn't exactly helping.The villain is above 99% of other marvel villains for he mere fact he has a lasting impact on he hero and for being somewhat sympathetic, though I felt the characterization itself was a bit disjointed. However his dialogue is often absolute cringe, he seems to awkwardly switch on and off his AAVE which just seems forced. I thought his final piece dialogue for example was absolutely forced and cringeworthy. The actor, I think did his best with what he got and he felt more interesting than the rest of the characters in the movie.The music was decent in this movie(though I didn't care for the rap which was mostly centered around Eric but then again I am not huge rap fan, so don't out too much weight on my opinion on this one). Most of it's themes are pretty obvious and blatant as well.This movie definitely isn't going to win any awards for subtlety.Overall, the movie just felt generic.I know movies are subjective but anyone who says this is a masterpiece or groundbreaking in anyway whether it be effects, acting,action or even the plot(I don't think this movie does anything new or anything that's even new for CBMs except for the nearly all black cast I guess) is quite frankly a fanboy or someone who hasn't watched much films.That's all I have to say about this movie. It's solid 5/10 for me but I am guessing if you liked the previous MCU films you'll probably enjoy this as well but for others go in with tempered expectations.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

If you haven't seen the numerous other Marvel movies, fear not. Black Panther stands on its own, and doesn't feel like an episode in a series like many of the other Marvel films. Most of the film takes place in Wakanda, an African dreamland that is both traditional and futuristic. When the film jumps to other locations around the world like London and South Korea (got to target that Asian market) I found myself wishing they would go back to Wakanda just because it is so visually stunning. The plot is solid and the actors are excellent. So much in fact, I wish they had spent more time on character development. The film seems to focus more on the villian, Killmonger, than the hero, T'Challa. I'm not complaining though, because Killmonger is an interesting character, and Michael B. Jordan is captivating. Black Panther brings up some heavy themes, and I think they could have gone further with them. Maybe in the sequels (I hope there will be sequels!) they will. The set design, costumes, and especially the music of Black Panther make it a joy to watch. I highly recommend it.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

With it's pacifist warrior lead (Chadwick Boseman) it offers up a less stoic more in touch with his feelings super hero that resonates beyond the action with underlying statement but ultimately relies on it's bread an butter action to seal the deal.Oakland gang banger and rightful heir to the throne of Wakanda, C'halla, is recalled to his country to take up the crown and deal with a crisis involving vibranium, the key to the country's incredibly advanced society. C'halla would like to promote the technology to help oppressed people throughout the world but it has fallen into the wrong hands and his attempts to retrieve it are being distracted by challengers from the throne; first from the imposing mountain people and then a crass one man war machine from the USA by the name of Kilmonger (Michael B. jordan). Kilmonger is no pretender to the throne however and is allowed rightful challenge to the crown.Panther breaks no new ground as the first all black Hollywood production but it certainly is a step forward in the evolution of the black film in Hollywood from the well intentioned Halleluah (29) to the talent laden Cabin in the Sky ( 43) to the abysmal The Wiz. Unlike the cliches, the patronizing and mocking (in the case of The Wiz just an incredible waste of talent) Black Panther maintains its dignity from end to end but most importantly offers a welcome twist to the Marvel franchise to film in setting, character and plot.Boseman is an approachable an amiable breath of fresh air without the stilted stoicism as the super hero, his actions involving a lot more familial activity with a precocious sister to play off as well as have a partner with a backbone. This well grounded humanity may serve him well in future episodes, creating problems and missteps on his part, causing him to drop his guard when it calls for steel resolve, enabling for chaos and confrontation and allowing the action fantasy film to do what it does best in this age of technology, speed, blowing things up and super human effort in making the Universe a better place.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But most of them are in low detail. Characters do get impaled, but then again it looks fake (Looks like someone took a spear split it in half, and glue the ends between the person with red dyed glue). There are tons of explosions, a few shootings with armed or weak armed people. It is more violent than any other movie from marvel (if we exclude the Rated R ones) from the last 5 years, but it's a great deal. Only a few kissing and make outs and nothing more. Men are shirtless, but for tribal reasons, and never sexual. The action scenes get pretty tense, tight, understanding, shocking and emotional.

Everyone on the cast does a really great job of bringing the characters to life. They aren't two-dimensional, and have rich backstories, that aren't cliche. My favorite part of this movie has to be Micheal B. Jordan as Killmonger. He does a really good job of portraying someone who has dealt with a tremendous loss in thier life, and is fueled by grief and rage. It's nice to see a villain who isn't really a villain, just a person who is doing bad things, but for (to some) good reason. The film itself is visually stunning, with long drawn out scenes of sunsets, and skylines. Unfortunately, the green screen effects don't always work, and that is a big disappointment, especially when some of the scenes are breathtaking. I personally don't love the films ending, but that didn't really make the movie any less enjoyable.

Like many parents, I've taken him to many superhero movies. He loves them; each time, though, we're sitting there seeing white people/men doing amazing things in America or Europe. How refreshing, then, to sit with my brown-skinned (foster) son and see a cast of people who represent him for a change, doing amazing things in Africa and doing so without white people rescuing them. How refreshing to see a vision of Africa without colonisation; how refreshing to see a hero character who learns something from the villain and where Africa has something to teach and give to the world. How refreshing for a South African audience to hear a South African language in a mainstream movie. How refreshing to hear the round of applause as the audience recognised their stories being told, the laughs of recognition. I don't think my foster son is aware enough of the context to appreciate the significance of this movie, but I was moved and thrilled. As a white Western male I've seen too much of an idealised vision of myself on the screen; I want my children to be able to see themselves in films like this, with inspiring women and the stories of black people being told in films that are both good and fun.

Which is something that's rare and has been underrepresented in the MCU, and cinema in general. I thought the writing and directing were all very good. And also the film is technically an excellent movie. Visually Black Panther is stunning. The cinematography (especially in Wakanda) is incredible. The visual effects used during the fights/action set pieces are excellent ( tho the CGI is dodgy in most parts). I also like the costumes, in particular those of the various Wakandan tribes. The make-up effects also deserve some praise. The soundtrack is very impressive; the rhythm of the drums give that authentic African feel; and the modern music is integrated perfectly to intensify the action. In terms of performances; Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa does a pretty good job. As the new King, he has so much going on around him; Not only must he deal with the external matter of preventing someone from using vibranium as a destructive weapon but he must also face internal challenges for his crown. T'Challa could have sat back and enjoyed his position, maintaining the status quo. Instead however, he felt it a duty to consider what he believed to be the failings of past Wakandan monarchs and do what he believed was right for this generation.
Michael B Jordan as the villain Erik Killmonger is also amazing. The character's motivations, albeit villainous could in a way almost be justified. This is what made him such an interesting character. The rest of the supporting casts are good in their performances.
On the whole, Black Panther is being deem as a perfect film, which I don't agree but I still think it is a well done origin superhero flick. The cast performance is terrific and the technical aspects are all good.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Seeing Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was amazing and I was looking forward to seeing him in an actual film.So this takes place right after Captain America Civil War when T'Challa returns back to this nation Wakanda after his father dies in an attack. While there, he decides to take his throne and rule Wakanda until suddenly a powerful enemy N'Jakada invades the nation and has intentions of destroying Wakanda. How T'Challa defeats N'Jakanda and protects the nation of Waanda is basically what this film is all about.Creed fame Ryan Coogler introduces a superhero film also ""the first black superhero"" of marvel (not racist but praising Marvel for their generosity of how much respect they're showing towards human race). His script was abit of a dissapointment because the movie had a very predictable story and eventually after 45 minutes of the film, the audience will for sure find out what will happen to N'Jakanda. The pacing was a bit slow but that still doesn't shy away for mbeing a perfect.Luckily there things that were integral to Black Panther such as showing a science fictional version of Africa to traditional clothing. The VFX was fantastic and that is all hats off to MS (Marvel Studios). The look of Busan and Wakanda was just commendable and delightful to watch on the big screen. The action was well choreographed and seeing Marvel with their remarkable efforts doesn't lack justice.Acting was a phenomenon. Chad Boswick playing T'Challa/Black Panther will just knock your socks off. He was exhilirating and edgy which proves how he is superhero material. Michael B Jordan was the major highlight of the film and his villainous attempt as N'Jakande shows a perfect match of subtlety. Lupita Noyong'o and seeing her as the African spy was defintiely worth devouring espcially how she manages to come clean with ther accent.Overall, this film may not be perfect because of the average writing but the entertainment of it is something the audience should go and experience. 3.75/5 - Atleast it is a perfect film for the audience.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

The strengths of Black Panther are quite obvious: the traditional African setting, score and rituals (in the eyes of us Westeners) mixed with the tropes of the MCU. It is a refreshing take on a by now familiar superhero story. The thematic references to slavery and racism are nice touches to a comic book story. The fictious world of Wakanda is interesting in the details and the backstory of villain Killmonger makes him one of the more nuanced bad guys. Great performances by Andy Serkis and Letitia Wright. But Chadwick Boseman is not as charismatic as Downey Jr or Pratt. Michael B Jordan is more impressive (sorry you Boseman fans). In the final analysis Black Panther is a refreshing take on a typical superhero tale.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Storyline was similar to any Marvel movie. There was humor in between and the fight scenes without the suit looked realistic. I think Black Panther could have more powers because he is a Super Hero who has gained his strength from the past. Wakanda seems to be portrayed as a safe place for fighting Thanos in Avengers. I also believed that there exists a place called Wakanda after watching the movie. However, if there were any sequels to Black Panther, i would not be much interested.

I will be honest I didn't know a lot about this character before reading about him recently and seeing the film. The story line crosses both racial and cultural lines which has made this super hero a fan favorite for more than 50 years and I really love him now too. He is a fierce fighter and is empathetic to those around him. He has a big heart and wants to do his very best.T'Challa is haunted by the mistakes of his father and is also a flawed person but puts a lot of pressure on himself to be the best king he can be for his people. During his transformation to King he goes to the land of his ancestors and is able to have a brief talk with his father. His father assures him he will be a good king but it will be hard because he has a good heart. This is a weakness and something he has to figure out how to balance with his leadership and superhero roles. I really enjoyed watching Mr. Boseman as this character and he brought not only a fierceness to the role but also a sensitivity and a humor that was just so human and optimistic. Things might be hard but he tried to come with an openness and we saw more of that come to fruition as the movie progressed.I loved the entire cast of this movie and felt like the right people were put into the right roles. I can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The performances were incredibly strong although I definitely felt like Shuri, T'Challa's sister played by Letitia Wright, stole the show. I just loved her character! She was strong, funny and intelligent. She is the force behind inventing much of the Wakandan modern technology (if this was Bond, she would be Q) and most specifically the Black Panther suit. On top of all that, she is a character girls are going to look to and be inspired by. I really loved the chemistry between all of the characters and felt like they genuinely liked or loved each other. It didn't feel forced.I felt like the action really kept in line with what is shown in other Marvel movies. In fact I felt like there was less fighting and violence in this film than in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and some of the other Marvel Studios films. There is sword play and a couple of scenes using guns but the most dramatic fight scenes are hand to hand battles for the throne.After seeing this movie I couldn't help thinking back to last year and seeing the new ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing a woman yield such incredible power, yet being allowed to also be tender, hit me so hard. I walked away from Black Panther with the same feeling I had with ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing fierce, powerful, intelligent, tender women standing up and being a part of the action spoke to me and I cheered for them every time they picked up a spear or showed the technology they created or acted as advisers. I really liked that the women were treated as equals. There was equal ""saving of each other"", never portraying the women as weaker and needing help. They worked together. This spoke to the message at the end of the film that we all need to learn that we are one tribe on this earth and we all need to look out for each other. We highly recommend the film!","15 out of 45 found this helpful.

The characters lack depth. There is a fair bit of hyperbole and even over-acting in some scenes, which might appeal to the younger audience.There are several plot holes and some attempts to conceal plot holes are ill explained and contrived for the sake of subsequent action scenes. So, it seems the writers made and attempt to create a coherent narrative but did not do a good job of it.If the movie kept itself to a simple comic action movie fanfare, then it would be fine. Unfortunately, the movie delves into mature territory of race issues and falls woefully short of reasonable treatment of this serious topic.Implicit in the movie is the confrontation between the politically left-wing 'black panther' and his right-wing cousin. As the movie progresses, the black panther becomes a politically centrist (essentially Obama) and the antagonist becomes ultra right-wing (almost Trump). Consequently, Black Panther could also have been called Obama vs. Trump. The Republican audience in US would call the writers of this movie as 'snowflakes' for the movie is clearly biased in favor of the left-wing 'black panther'. The humor in the movie came from the confrontation between Gholum (Andy Serkis) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) as they were both after 'Precious Ring' (Vibranium metal) which gives great power for global conquest. Martin Freeman also plays the 'token white friend' in the movie where the joke is the inversion of the 'token black friend', but Martin Freeman's character has to be schooled in movie logic that 'token friend' has no meaningful dialogue.Overall, Black Panther could and should have been much better than it was. It had the obligation to make a bold statement without the need to pander to people's prejudices. That after all is what art is!!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This Panther is a true superhero, whose cultural triumph is even more important than its storytelling propose.'Black Panther' Synopsis: T'Challa, the King of Wakanda, rises to the throne in the isolated, technologically advanced African nation, but his claim is challenged by a vengeful outsider who was a childhood victim of T'Challa's father's mistake.Predictable to a fault, 'Black Panther' is a zesty blend of mesmeric action & predictable cliches. Having said that, there's no denying that this worthy critical & commercial smash never fails to engage its viewer.Ryan Coogler & Joe Robert Cole's Screenplay is up for the claps as it rightly establishes Stan Lee's raging Superhero. And make no mistake, the experience & joy of watching an Black Cast delivering explosive action & drama, is one of its own. The Writing is well-done, although the second-hour does give inn to many cliches, that do effect its impact overall. But, for the most part, the Writing is nicely sustained. Coogler's Direction is superb. The Director seems to be confident & assured in his first blockbuster directorial effort. Cinematography & Editing are done with merit. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics are top-notch. Action-Sequences are simply spell-binding. Ludwig Göransson's score is rocking.Performance-Wise: Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, is charismatic all through. He has the heroic presence to hold his own. Michael B. Jordan as N'Jadaka / Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, is over-the-top. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, is charming. Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi, passes muster. Danai Gurira as Okoye, is first-rate. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, is a strong, persuasive menace. Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross, is effective. Angela Bassett as Ramonda, is adequate. Forest Whitaker as Zuri, does not deliver. His role appears forced. On the whole, 'Black Panther' offers a strong impact & its cultural importance, is impossible to ignore. Lets Marvel This!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I thought acting was good for the genre it was in (again, what kind of Shakespearean depth can you expect in an action movie? What are you comparing it with, Iron Man? Please.). I absolutely loved the visuals, the costumes were great. The idea of having a magical yet also cultural narrative to a superhero film makes it that much more like an actual movie. The female warriors and the general male-female dynamic is quite a statement in itself for a movie in this genre as well. I guess those who hate on the film are not able to appreciate these aspects. It's sad to see so many people calling this (and those who reviewed it positively) political.

If you google, 'black panther movie cast' and click on the cast icon, It shows 48 cast members of which 38 are black people, 8 white people, and 2 Asians. Don't you love the diversity in this movie? Movies and tv series have been changing characters from white to black lately. To give examples: Superman(Michael B Jordan's Superman), Mary Jane Watson(Spiderman), Kingpin(Daredevil), Catwoman(The Batman/Catwoman), Jimmy Olsen(Supergirl), Johnny Storm(Fantastic Four), Perry White(Man of Steel), Harvey Dent(Batman), Deadshot(Suicide Squad), Heimdall(Thor), Nick Fury(Marvel Studio Films), Martian Manhunter(Smallville/Supergirl), Alicia Masters(Fantastic Four), Pete Ross(Smallville), Iris West(The Flash), Electro(Amazing Spiderman 2), Baron Mordo(Doctor Strange), Callisto(X-Men Last Stand), Manchester Black(Supergirl), Starfire(Titans), Hawkgirl(Legends of Tomorrow) to name a few just in the Super Hero genre. If you are going to diversify and change the vision for the creator's characters, you are essentially changing the essence of the characters themselves. To give you examples: Black Panther, Luke Cage, Storm, Amanda Waller, Aqualad, Black Lightning, Bishop, Green Lantern John Stewart, Shadow Hawk, Spawn, Ironheart, Sunspot, War Machine, Lady Hawk, Misty Knight, Falcon, Shadowman, and Blade...let's diversify and make them WHITE. You are probably thinking no way those are black characters, right? Well what the hell do you think they're doing when they make white characters, BLACK?!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Most everything about it is at least competent (except for SOME of the lesser CGI effects), but the final battle is less than compelling or entertaining, sadly drowning out some of the really great things in this film that would make it more worth a rewatching. For most of the film's running time, I genuinely enjoyed it, particularly in its first half. There is some really good humor (although there were a few moments that were rather eye-rolling in their unfunniness), some great action (I thought every action sequence was almost perfectly handled UNTIL the lengthy and frankly boring battle the film climaxes with), some very interesting concepts explored in a very fair and well done way, and an extraordinarily compelling villain whose arc does contain some real sympathy and understanding. Much of the film is a fun, entertaining ride, but towards the end it does unfortunately fall apart and breaks into some pointlessly loud and disorienting scenes of generic action and such. A very good film that could have been groundbreaking if some flaws were fixed. Not as bad as some w/overly high expectations or even an alt-right-esque racial agenda might have you think, not as great as some liberal critics and hyper reactionary twitter users may have you think; instead, it is a bit of a fun improvement of the standard Marvel affair that contains various elements that I feel could have made up a masterpiece but were sadly put slightly down by some of the film's weaker ones.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

And I couldn't have expected any better, simpler, crispier father-son narrative on why wakanda is the way it is!
Black Panther covers most of Marvel's ingredients, but it feels to have gravely lacked in finding the proportions. There were hardly a couple of scenes that was really funny. Neither the story nor the plot felt fulfilling. Story was weak, didn't cover much but just revolved around the technical advances of Wakanda's super secret city and its rituals. Plot could have been better, didn't have much coverage either. VFX was really good, and that was it.
Killmonger was shown the main villain, but for some reason Klaw seemed a better and audience loving villain who got killed in a jiffy. Killmonger needed a stronger background and story showing him more competitive to the black panther, but it was just his muscles, attitude and an american accent that took more coverage (oh i missed ""Nay"". You'll know what i mean).
 Black Panther is not as much a negative movie as i might have made it sound, but the expectations for various reason were so high, that the movie just failed to meet it. Although it is a definite 1 time watcher, but one lacks the content of having watched a full-package Marvel movie simply because there just wasn't enough of everything.Black Panther a one time watcher if you are a Marvel's fan. Else the film will interest you only in parts.
IMBD's 7.6 as on date is almost justified, although i would give it a 7.1/10 in the long term.","5 out of 23 found this helpful.

I read some reviews before seeing the movie and was surprised at the wide range of ratings. Going in I was willing to give it a ""7"" going in, just because it is Marvel. I haven't seen a bad Marvel movie yet. Black Panther was no exception, yet it possessed a strange dualism. On the one hand, the movie was superbly made, cleverly written, possessing great cinematography, exciting special effects, top-notch acting by all the principals and several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. I would not be surprised if Black Panther received Oscar nominations for more than special effects.On the other side I felt, as a Conservative, that Coogler and Cole were intent on lecturing me from their Leftist-Globalist political ideology. There were subtle but obvious jabs at the Trump Administration. I suppose we should give T'Challa some slack since he is so new at governing. He (indeed the entire MCU) ignores the threat of Radical Islam and he hasn't considered what he would do if millions of illegal immigrants showed up at the gates of Wakanda for their slice of the pie. Killmonger did offer a valid reality check that as soon as the world became aware of Wakanda's scientific advancements, other powers would want to come and take it away from them.Wakanda, of course, is a fantasy. While it seeks to reflect African culture and succeeds in various ways, it fails to represent the diversity of the continent of Africa. Many times in the movie speech patterns, idiomatic expressions and mannerisms reflect black culture in America rather than Africa. One aspect that is accurate is inter-tribal competition, which in the history of Africa resulted in internecine warfare. Africans have not historically manifested the philosophy of ""one tribe."" ""White people"" are presented in the film as colonizers (which Everett Ross rejects), but ignored is the fact that Christian missionaries brought medicine, hospitals, schools and improved agriculture. Yes, white people engaged in the horrific slave trade, but conversely white people ended it. White people have given over and over for the good of Africa and Africa is the better for it.Frankly, I liked Black Panther better in Captain America: Civil War where he wasn't preaching at us. I wonder if he will try his Liberal ideology on Thanos. Nah. Thanos does not believe in sharing the wealth.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact. Wakanda is, in essence, an African fantasy, one in which the continent is able to withstand white oppressors and consequentially has the power to build an empire off Vibranium, a natural resource that is more powerful than steel. And many of us enjoy seeing people of color on the big screen. After a century, Hollywood may be waking up to the fact that Black heroes are actually bankable. Surprise!Wakanda is hidden behind clouds and mountains, and a fantasy rain forest canopy. But wait a minute. It is a sci fi film with advanced aircraft. Doesn't that mean the world possesses radar, and satellites? Well, then why have the clouds and rain forest kept this place such a secret for so long? DO NOT ask questions like these, of this film. If you are the kind of individual who can suspend your reason and intellect for two hours, and just watch, you may enjoy this. Personally, I felt alot of pain while watching this film. I might put it in the category of Lone Ranger, and Wild, Wild West. It really stank, as a story. The capital is from the evils of white colonizers, but any sort of imagination is left in the back seat when it comes to this emerald city onscreen. It's a missed opportunity on the part of Coogler because, after all, this is an MCU movie set in Africa! I wanted to see the savannas and the fantastic natural sights and beauties that come with this fascinating and colorful continent, but instead, there's an over-reliance on fake digital backgrounds rather than real on-set locations. This is detrimental to bringing any kind of humane connection or absorbingly artful feeling to the film, which quite frequently feels artificial and computerized rather than lived-in and three-dimensional.To sum it up, if you like comic book films, you may like this one. I do not like comic book films, and I really, really did not like this film.","103 out of 226 found this helpful.

Directed by Ryan Coogler, The plot follows the events after Captain America: Civil War, where T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman ) , is to be crowned the king of Wakanda where he have to face his nemesis in the form of Erik ""Killimonger"" (Michael. B. Jordan) who has a past related to Wakanda.
Now I have to say that this is a more matured movie after Civil War. There is action and fun in good amount but the story is given more depth. Add to that the African Culture and background gives the film a new look and from the view of the MC universe.
Technical matters of the film are all done well. Be it the Cinematography, Editing ,Action or the exhilarating Background score..
Now to the performances...
Chadwick Boseman has done a perfect job as The Black Panther. Although he appeared in a brief role in Civil war, the depth of his character was felt more in this film. Equally brilliant was Michael B Jordan in a negative role bringing in the required menace and can be considered another best villain in the MC universe. The supporting cast was efficient. The ones who require a mention is Daniel Kaluyya,
Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright. Andy Serous in a small role has done well.
So all in all Black Panther is another feather in the cap of the MC universe and is a must watch...

Being a sure staple in Black Peoples' entertainment must-watch playlist, this would appeal not only to its assigned audiences but to the general public as well. Chadwick Boseman did not fall short in portraying a grieving superhero seeking revenge and protecting his domain. He was so effective in the role that if this movie was released in the 90's, he would have been a bigger star. The deliberate changes in accent was a little disturbing for me, though.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's a lot about the MCU from a scriptwriting standpoint I couldn't stand, but this and Ragnarok prove that we are thankfully far away from the days of Iron Man 2 and Captain America 1. Black Panther is so much more thematically dense, rich and driving that many others in the franchise, and unlike Ragnarok, the emotional conflict drives the core physical conflict that is the cause of all the explosive action scenes. The film does not shy away from the obvious political bent; the dying lines of the villain lean so hard into the theme of oppression vs. the potential/imperative to improve upon it that I almost can't believe the soulless heads driving the Marvel project let them get away with it.But you have to make it to the Forest Whitaker exposition scene around the midpoint. Until then, Black Panther doesn't feel like it has much of a story. The first act is all set-up with one action scene and not a particularly great one at that, and with only three more big setpieces to follow it doesn't actually get to show off the Black Panther toolkit much at all, even with all the Chekhov's Guns going off in just the right places. So while I think this is one of the best Marvel movies from an artistic standpoint, there are others, like both Guardians and Ragnarok, that are better paced, better delivered movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.I actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.The story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.The characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less...well...stupid!Personally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.Special effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.On the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie.

Before you start commenting ''Oh you are racist'' just hear me out.Obviously there are good bits about Black Panther, not many but, even Ready Player One has good parts to it, so of course Black Panther will as well.To be fair to Black Panther, the costume design in the movie was fantastic, mostly due to the rathertalented Ruth Carter. Black Panther won the Oscar for costume design, where Ruth Carter became the first black designer to win the award. I would argue that The Favourite and Sandy Powell would have deserved it more, yet I wasn't too bothered with this win of theirs. The costumes used in Black Panther are fantastic and apparently very costly as well. These costumes include futuristic designs and African tribal designs, Ruth Carter does a tremendous job on the costume design.Black Panther had a very impressive production design, a rare sight for Marvel films, who have a reputation of having a poor production design. Again, Black Panther was nominated for an Oscar in this category, and for once, I would agree that they should've won in this category. The production design is so impressive in Black Panther. Hannah Bleacher, the production designer for Black Panther essentially created a whole society, in Wakanda. She created a sub-Saharan country, and used essential real-life elements and incorporated in this fantasy world. She made an futuristic city in a country that is clearly located in Africa. Hannah Bleacher used the costumes designed by Ruth Carter as inspiration for the production design. Bleacher clearly worked extremely hard in order to create this world, in fact, she traveled around Africa in order to get ideas on what Wakanda should be like, and other settings. Despite my hatred for the movie, I put my hat off to Bleacher as she does a great job with the production design.Music is ok, nothing much to say, can't judge music. It fits well with the movie, and I thought the music was appropriate.Now onto to the political commentary. Most of the reviews to this movie were politically motivated, due to the political commentary in the movie. But the political commentary in the movie is basically that Michael B Jordan who plays Killmonger in Black Panther wants to kill all the white people, and Chadwick Boseman who plays T'Challa wants to stop him. This movie attempts to make a commentary about how black people are treated in the United States, but it's so bad. Zootopia has better political commentary in it. All these reviews are so deluded, and think the movie is a great movie because of its message it sends. The movie's target audience is so mainstream, it targets everyone.The director of this movie, Ryan Coogler, is a fantastic director, and has directed great movies, such as Creed and Fruitvale station, but he has no experience when it comes to making a Marvel movie. He is an extremely talented director, and his talent is put to waste in this movie, he is unable to express his full creativity, and clearly wanted to steer the movie in another direction, but was unable to due to Marvel wanting to sell this movie to a mainstream audience. He has a 200 million budget to work with, yet can't express his true directing talents. He uses the basic marvel structure to a film, making the directing poor and unoriginal. The storyline was basic and lackluster. The action scenes in Black Panther are badly shot, and extremely lazy. Ryan Coogler had no past experience with filming action prior to become the director of Black Panther. Let this experience be a lesson to him, he is much better off not filming big blockbuster movies that's sole purpose is to gain a large financial reception.The main character who is portrayed by Chadwick Boseman is T'Challa or Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman is solid in his performance as Black Panther, but the character is so uninteresting. He is just boring. He seems to be good at being a king and a warrior, and seems to be unbeatable, making the movie very predictable. He's the son of a king, and a warrior for Wakanda. He is a very uninteresting, yet I think Chadwick Boseman is a good actor, just doesn't have a script to work with.The villain is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan. Michael B Jordan isn't a very good villain, despite the villain being one of the best parts of the movie according to the critics. He is a very generic character and doesn't have a good motivation, just wanting to take over Wakanda and use his power for the better. This is a regurgitated motivation, and is used in so many movies. Michael B Jordan is really poor in this movie, despite him being such a great actor. Again he can't work well with the script. He was a forgettable villain, and was a completely overrated character. Compare Killmonger to The Joker from The Dark Knight. The Joker is almost better in every single way. He has a better motivation, Heath Ledger portrays him perfectly, and is so unforgettable. Exactly the opposite of Killmonger. There is also no character development in Killmonger. He has a two minute backstory in the middle of the movie, which doesn't explain much.Forest Whittaker, who is a fantastic actor, and played one of my favourite roles of all time, in The Last King of Scotland as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, does a poor job in Black Panther, he plays the exact same character he did in Rogue One.Just look at this video and you'll know what I mean;The visual effects in Black Panther is so inconsistent. Sometimes the visual effects are amazing, but sometimes it's awful. As you can see in the video just shown, Black Panther had some horrible CGI.Not much to comment on the cinematography of the film, it's so basic, and uncreative, but what can I expect from some a bland looking movie. The color palette of the movie is basic, and the CGI, as I said before is inconsistent. Ryan Coogler doesn't know how to direct film scenesLarge parts of this action sequence is badly shot, and again throughout the action sequence you can see the inconsistency in CGI.The dialogue is one of the worst bits about the whole movie. It's so weak, and bland. The dialogue is so predictable and bland. Every character speaks their mind, it seems like they don't think before they say anything. It is a superhero movie, so I wouldn't expect an amazing script, but dialogue this bad?The movie is so cringeworthy at some parts, and the humor is so bad. At one point they make a ''what are those joke''and it made me want to kill myselfOverall, Black Panther is a bad movie. It's extremely overrated and didn't deserve those oscars it was nominated for. The movie failed on so many levels. The plot is predictable, unoriginal and doesn't start until halfway through the movie. A movie doesn't need a good plot, as seen with the lobster, which has one of the craziest plots I have ever heard. The plot of the lobster is a man needs to find a wife in 40 days or else he'll become an animal, the plot is stupid, unique but bad, yet it is executed so well.Black Panther has bad dialogue, basic cinematography, okay music, no humour, inconsistent visual effects, bad acting, poor characters and a bad plot. The movie is a really overrated movie, and has been completely overrated by critics, who think the movie as much deeper than it actually is. If this movie was a superhero with majority of the cast being white, it would be compared to the third reich.I give this movie a rating.... 4/10","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Not as good at the hype suggests, but still a solid chapter in the MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4120650/?ref_=tt_urv","hunter-friesen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45060413/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2018","Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther was one of the best characters in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. He was the ultimate hero; cool, confident, and determined to stop evil. Two years later, he's starring in his own film that shifts him into the leading role. While not being the best superhero film or even an overall good film, Black Panther is still a solid experience that makes for another adequate chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The film follows the reign of T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), aka the Black Panther, over the country of Wakanda. On the surface, Wakanda is a poverty-stricken country, but behind smoke and mirrors, it is revealed that it is actually the most advanced civilization on earth. This advancement comes from the extraterrestrial metal vibranium, which landed in Wakanda thousands of years ago and allowed them to advance further than anyone else. Fearing the outside world, they isolated themselves inside a hologram projection system, never allowing themselves to open up to the rest of humanity. T'Challa is a firm believer of isolation, but his views are challenged by a new wave of Wakandans, ones led by the villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan, marking his third collaboration with Coogler). They see the world as weak and ripe for conquest. A rebellion soon breaks out that threatens to tear families and ties apart, as well as the whole of Wakanda. For boasting a revolutionary cast and director of newcomer Ryan Coogler, Black Panther never really feels original. It very much follows the typical superhero formula where the hero saves the day at first, a villain emerges and beats the hero, hero and his team regroup to fight back, and finally, hero returns and overcomes previous obstacle to beat the villain. I know almost every superhero film follows this formula, but this film was sold on the message that it would be different than the rest, when in fact it's the same as everyone else. Black Panther also has trouble with inconsistency when it comes to dialogue. The range of quality is all over the place as some lines are delivered really well and some are really poor. The script felt like it was written a couple years ago and never updated. Some of the jokes fall flat because they rely on trends that have faded away, such as the ""What are those!"" joke that was old a few years ago. Where the film stumbles in writing and storytelling it makes up for in its wide range of characters that piece everything together. There's a rule that no hero can truly work alone and that rule definitely applies to T'Challa as he is aided in his journey by his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a tech whiz that serves as the Q to his 007, and Okoye (Danai Gurira), a fierce warrior that never backs down from a fight. Also acting as support is T'Challa's queen mother Romonda (Angela Bassett) and his spiritual advisor Zuri (Forest Whitaker).Technically speaking, Black Panther does have some of the highest production quality of the MCU films. Having the setting of Wakanda allows the film to embrace colorful and lush natural locations. The visual effects used to create the world are really well done and the expert cinematography by Rachel Morrison really adds to the experience. About every actor brings their game here. Chadwick Boseman is the standout as T'Challa. He delivers on making his character believable. He's a king and hero, but also just a man thrust into a hard position very quickly. He has his flaws and Boseman highlights those perfectly. Playing his polar opposite is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, who is probably the most complex character. He's an outcast Wakandan who was abandoned in America during the 90s. Now after becoming almost a living legend among criminals, he's come to take his revenge on Wakanda. Jordan brings the rage and molds his character really well to fit the circumstances. The rest of the supporting cast fill in nicely, except for Forest Whitaker who is caught here trying too hard as always. Many will find Ryan Coogler's Black Panther to be a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre. It's an aesthetically pleasing film, but it's not one to jump and clap for. It never lives up to the hype but the film still never has below average quality. Avengers: Infinity War is boasting one of the biggest casts of all time, and having the Black Panther and Wakanda included is something that is going to be great to see.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also the way he introduces new characters throughout the movie , in example when he first introduced Killmunger he was seemed to be the general villainous role but as the character develops we see the way that he came to be and the cause of his anger","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I sometimes wonder if I even watched the same movie they did. Even with that said, I still thought that this was a really good movie and I had a fun time watching it in the theater.Chadwick Boseman is quite good as the Black Panther, bringing the right blend of confidence and emotion to the character. There are many supporting characters who are quite interesting as well. I was skeptical about Michael B. Jordan playing the villain of the movie, but he did a surprisingly decent job.The best thing about this movie by far is its world-building. Wakanda is a wonderfully fleshed-out setting, and the gorgeous cinematography really sells the beauty and grandeur of it.The story is interesting and filled with intriguing commentary, with it only occasionally feeling preachy. The action scenes are a lot of fun, with the car chase being my favorite. I also liked the final battle.It does have some problems, though. The film dragged in some places and was overlong, and there were some instances where the CGI looked too obvious. The worst thing about this film by far is Martin Freeman's character. He had no real impact on the story and was kind of embarrassing to watch.All in all, this was another strong addition to the MCU. Even if it is overhyped and overrated, I still really like it. Check it out.RATING: B+","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story line and the acting wasn't that great, just ok. I understand this movie is really political in the USA, but I don't really get why this is a black movie, and something for black people to be proud of. The movie is a thin fairytale in the fictitious African kingdom of Wakwanda, so not that weird the cast is African (looking). One of the messages in the film was that Africa was robbed empty by others. There's truth in that and nothing wrong with it being told once in a while. But on the other hand, this can be said about every continent on earth. the last centuries the westerners are the evil do-ers, for example I'm Dutch and the slave trade of the Western Indian Company was repulsive. But before the 17th century western Europe was peripheral, where was plundering and a place where people were made slave and taken away. What I want to say is, I don't really get this playing politics of Hollywood. I find it most of the time quite pretentious, embarrassing, arbitrary and mark missing. Concerning this particular movie, to me it wasn't that (bothering) political. This movie made me think of Avatar, the nice visuals and also somewhat story wise.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as T'Challa was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michael B. Jordan's who played as Erik Killmonger, Lupita Nyong'o's who played as Nakia, Letitia Wright's who played as Shuri and Martin Freeman's who played as Everett K. Ross. Finally, I have to say that ""Black Panther"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

They both wanted to give away their technology, just in different ways. Marvel could make an entire movie over two librarians fighting over an Oxford comma. I'd like to see real deep-seated disagreement like libertarians fighting socialist. This movie belittles real conflict and makes wars and conflict seem so trivial (most Marvel movies do). They make it seem like people just fight over nothing. 
Another thing that didn't make sense was the villain waited to challenge the young king, when he could've challenged the old king and had a higher chance of success. Apparently by the movie rules he can challenge whenever he wants. 
I can see why racists won't like this movie. It's very Africa centric. The bad white guy had more character than the good white guy (there are only 2 white people).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What makes the film so special (taking into account the prestigious cast, the well-developed villain, the beautiful imagery, and many other qualities) is the mixture of cultures, never leaving the influence the environment had within it. The film innovates the superhero world after a decade of US and UK origin storyline, finally, we can afford to do so in a spectacular way, I swear this will be an iconic origin story to a bunch of new-generation flicks. Practically, I took off my hat after watching it because it signified two positive points: a) Marvel golden years are still there (since 2016 Captain America: Civil War) and, b) The film brings back forgotten characters of the MCU and moulds their appearance while expanding their complexity (take the example of Ulysses Klaue, haven't heard of that folk since 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron). When stating the performances, everyone plays a key role and does it perfectly, my personal favourites were the main villain Killmonger, who turned out to be the third best villain I have seen in the MCU; Shuri, who is an exceptionally-awesome sister, and Nakia performed by the fisrt-class-talented Lupita. Finally, but not least, there is so much going on! For example, the action pieces entertain the audience as long as you could imagine, because they are set and dynamically prepared, then, the characters' development, it constructs Killmonger's profile and builts it, in order to present a final setup.It is difficult to find some defects, nevertheless, I considered the CGI a little exaggerated, while the comedy side was lacking a little bit...

Being into martial arts, I like superheroes who are experts in hand combat, and Spider-Man is my favourite. Black Panther is a bit like him, and we got a glimpse of his fighting prowess and learned a bit about the ""magical"" country of Wakanda, in Africa. So I was excited to see a movie dedicated to him.By the way, Black Panther isn't some new superhero recently cooked up by Marvel/ Disney. The character and his Wakanda background were created by the legendary Stan Lee in the sixties, so he's been around for a while. Personally, I think that the concept of Wakanda is brilliant, and can open up some interesting stories, if played right. I wish I had read and followed him in the comics. My guess is that it's probably a bit different from the direction they took here. I vaguely remember another story, probably animated, where Black Panther was trying to keep vibranium only in safe and peaceful hands.This movie felt below my expectations. In sharp contrast to Captain America, it's all about Wakanda. And that would have been fine if the plot surrounding the villain was more interesting. Unfortunately I can't help feeling that there was some sort of agenda behind it and it's not clear what the objective was. Sure, it's just a story, and it's very clear that the ideas of the villain are rejected by the hero Black Panther and others, who speak of unity and the world acting as ""one tribe"". An ideal that I think most people applaud.Somehow though, I can't shake the feeling that they made the voice of the villain so loud that it makes it harder to hear the message of love and unity. Plus, his idea just doesn't make sense. Yes, there's still some racial injustice in the world, but what exactly is he proposing, that advanced weapons are the solution? The idea is so ridiculous that it doesn't make any sense even for a fictitious story.Also, it's disappointing to see that the most technologically advanced country would have such outdated barbaric rituals for challenging the throne. It seems to contradict their image of a wise and spiritual country, like the scene of the warrior woman meditating. That said, I very much like the idea of preserving good traditions along with technology and that's something positive about this movie. And another is that one tribe is vegetarian!The action and the visuals are good, especially when they were on a mission abroad. And I wish that had been the focus of the movie, Black Panther as a superhero out there in the world. Or even in Wakanda, but it's the plot that in my view robbed this movie of being much better. The martial arts style fighting could have also been longer and better. Nonetheless I enjoyed it in the cinema, and just enjoyed streaming it. But it'll probably be a long time before I feel like watching it a third time, if ever. Curious to see what happens in the upcoming sequel...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You'll understand some parts better if you watched Captain America Civil War and Avengers Age of Ultron. Even with that, you don't necessarily need to watch those 2 movies beforehand to watch and enjoy this one. I did watch this movie before I have watched Civil War and still understood this one just fine. Now, after rewatching it after Civil War, I liked it better.

But even that seem somewhat half-assed.So we have these very developed high-tech bunch of people, with technology far beyond the reach of the rest of the globe, yet they make decisions based on the outcome of medieval combat? There was very little incentive to like the characters. The few puny attempts at ""humour"" was at best cringe-worthy.

A few connections might have been positive, because then at least there might be something to look forward to. But as a standalone movie, this serves no real purpose for the average moviegoer.

Really wanted more Killmonger, the screen time he did have was satisfying enough. They all rose above the need for constant action in a superhero film and actually carried the film well instead of the other way round. It was beautiful and grabbed me from beginning to end. Marvels greatest score so far? I Think so. I had been looking forward to Black Panther ever since I saw the first concept for his costume and it did not disappoint. Glad to hear it could do $200+ Million opening weekend just to show these people hate will not stop this movie from being successful. We will combat your hate with Love and our wallets to show you the world will not be any scarier when Black Panther is a successful movie.

Now don't get me wrong, I think this is great; in fact I would say it needed to happen. This is something we've never seen in a superhero movie and it was quite refreshing. Erik Killmonger is an excellent antagonist; in my opinion, the best in the MCU (at least until Thanos came around). He was a great opponent to T'Challa physically and emotional due to their very apparent clashing ideologies. The reason I say that is because his motive and his cause is something that is very relate-able to the US today. Many people still feel a sense of racial prejudice and he resembled that pretty well. The only problem is that he was really only in the second half of the movie. The first half was about Andy Serkis character and his whole crusade for vibranium. I think he did pretty well, but he and the Black Panther had no qualities that really resonated well together; I just wasn't interesting in the story for the first half. Then once Killmonger comes back it's a totally different movie with a new plot. Why? Because Ryan Coogler wanted to tell Killmonger's story and he simply had Andy Serkis in the film to keep up continuity after Age of Ultron... Black Panther as a character was very boring and un-compelling to me. The CGI was mediocre at best; there were multiple times where I was taken right out of a scene because I was focusing on the background that was very clearly fake. I also thought the cinematography was questionable, especially during the fight scenes. I am tired of shaky tight shots during big action scenes, which this film has a lot of. Check this movie out of you want to, but I'd say you'll live by passing it up.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Second Film of Choice at tHe Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Black Panther. Time for another Marvel production. This was not your usual Marvel film. However it was fabulous. What made this one different is we were not bombarded with lots of superhero stuff this was more a tale of sci-fi folklore which erupted from a hidden city in the depths of Africa onto the rest of the world. This was a tale of who wins the throne and who is worthy to carry on the name and the work of Black Panther. There was much solemnity in this film interspersed with irreverence at solemn moments which elicited burst of laughter from the audience. Although slow it parts I felt this was necessary to the storyline and kudos must be given to the model makers and animators for creating a city fitting of both a metropolitan situation and an African savannah. Great use of rhinos, and some rather fancy intense battle scenes. I like the panther suit and the technology which comes with it. It was a little like watching Q from James Bond with all his gadgets, only way cooler. Although very different from the usual Marvel film I do feel this slots neatly into its place in the franchise. Once again people.......don't leave before the end of the credits.....two extras this time!!!!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

MCU left no stone unturned in investing above $200 m in the film which is huge considering its not as popular as other super heroes. But last few months it has generated so much hype that, the box office estimates have gone over the roofs.The same hype made me crazy enough to not able to contain my excitement and subsequently find out what the fuss is all about. Strangely, even when the film is done I am still asking the same question. Black Panther starts off with one of the most important scenes of the film that becomes the fulcrum on which it develops its plot post mid-way. The story without spoilers is basically about a precious metal, Vibranium which is the root reason of the secret city, Wakanda's technological advancement and power. It is about whether it should be available to the people around the world for other countries' problems and if yes, who gets to decide the right people who should lay hands on the massive power. And if no, then is it really right to continue its use for the selfish well-being of Wakanda alone?
Keeping all the hype aside (Rotten Tomatoes' 97% score, Box Office), I found the film strictly just ""good"". The characters are well developed, Wakanda city has been beautifully realized and the conventional Marvel wit adds to the charm of the whole. But the film never really takes off to build enough tension to keep us engrossingly glued. It is more of an exhibition of the tribes of Africa and their rich persevered culture. It also makes clear statements of racist atrocities and its payback, whether it is Killmonger screaming his lungs on how T'Challa should use the power of Vibranium for ""their people"" or the frequent use of ""these Americans"" in a form of their subjugation to the Wakandians. With past few Marvel films showing an individualistic innovative style of action, this film fails to offer anything that impresses you beyond the anchoring use of claws. More than the Black Panther or Killmonger, it is Andy Serkins' Ulysses Klaue that steals away your attention with captivating screen presence of a chilled maniac. Unfortunately, the appearance is limited to brief after which Killmonger takes over. Killmonger played by Michael Jordan feels like an immature street punk hip-hopping away his dialogues. When he starts talking, all you feel like saying is, ""You just lack some knuckle slaps when you were growing up"". His motivation is without depth or understanding, its too outlined to generate any taste for the villain. Even T'Challa, whether he played a king or even a super hero, always felt like a character who is undergoing a 2 month course with his shrink for confidence issues. The music shifts gears in discontinued forms from rap beats to African tribal and the usual loud score for action sequences.Overall, the film is an entertaining pass time for the well etched characters and the relationships among them, some unexpected comical expressions that was very subtly fit into the writing and a refreshing change from the usual we have been coming across.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So Africa has a super-advanced country hidden under the forest that no-one knows about, which is able to make incredible alien technology beyond anything ever seen before, without any ability or need to import raw materials to build production plants and laboratories, including Apple-esque glistening-white research centers?In fact, I am more angry about watching this film today then I was yesterday when it finished.And the totally embarrassing scene in which the white man was not allowed to talk in the company of the ""ape king"", which I quote from another character, including ape chanting and stomping sounds, which was supposed to be funny? It was horribly embarrassing, and I can only deduce that this scene was included for cheap laughs in the black community, much like the cheap laughs in The Patriot against the English 'tyrants', although The Patriot wasn't a totally bad film.It's quickly becoming the same old scenario in modern-day superhero movies: everything seems made up as it goes along because it can be hidden away behind special effects.And I totally get the need for black inclusion, which is one of the reasons I watched this movie, but it was instead patronizing to black people and included inverse and bizarre racism and parodies as well, causing Black Panther to badly misfire alongside its dull plot.","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

In this case, it is a magical herb and a magical metal. We've seen vibranium before but now they've added magical healing powers and who knows what else. Throw in the fact that a relatively small nation has hidden technology that appears to be dozens, if not hundreds, of years ahead of the world. And I don't even want to talk about the political undertones.Kudos for not having scenes that fictionally destroy millions upon millions of dollars of infrastructure and vehicles not to mention potential lives in major cities. There is still plenty of cold-blooded killing and a villain whose only character trait is hatred. When the big bad battle takes place, it's fought with weapons that appear on the outside to be medieval technology but really pack a futuristic whollop.The action and graphics are first rate, as always with Marvel. The acting is stilted for the most part. There is a story, but it's a pretty old one with no surprises.The movie also avoids one of my pet peeves with several of the latest Marvel movies. I have complained elsewhere that I want my superheroes to be like the old-fashioned Superman - people with integrity.

When a new foe known as Killmonger emerges from the shadows that has a deeper connection to him than he already knows and wants the throne of Wakanda, King T'Challa must face the sins of his family's past while saving the world from Killmonger's reign of terror. So first off, the CGI in this film was way ahead of it's time, bringing us a nation in the MCU like no other. Chadwick Boseman was born to play King T'Challa and brings us a side of T'Challa we haven't seen until now. Michael B. Jordan is absolutely fantastic as Killmonger, making his villain one of my top three favorites ever in the MCU. Letitia Wright as Shuri was a standout that brings the comedy out when it's needed. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia and Danai Gurira as Okoye were also great as well as Angela Bassett's Queen Ramonda. Other characters I thought were great additions to the film include Martin Freeman's Everett Ross, Andy Serkis's Klaw, Winston Duke's M'Baku, Forest Whitaker's Zuri and Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi. Overall, Ryan Coogler brings us a story with characters unlike anything we've seen until now in the MCU that really shows and explores the world of Wakanda. Rating 8.5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Black Panther by Ryan Coogler","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4805700/?ref_=tt_urv","lumieretrain","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62229406/?ref_=tt_urv","26 April 2019","The stories about superheroes who take part of a royal family are interesting, to see how the main characters would balance their responsibilities, between being a superhero around the world and being a king in the kingdom where they are from. The main characters would take important decisions for the good of the kingdom and its people, by making sure to not commit the same mistakes of the past that brought heavy consequences. Some of these stories would end with the sacrifice of the main characters, who leave to the people an important message to move forward with the kingdom. Other stories would end with the main characters surviving from a dangerous mission, who will then conclude with what they started. There was an interest to release in the MCU a solo movie about the character Black Panther, to see how he would move forward after the event of Captain America: Civil War. Until the young filmmaker Ryan Coogler came to release the movie about Black Panther, as he decided to make the movie differently than the previous MCU movies. In 2018 came out Black Panther by Ryan Coogler with Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. The movie's plot: The new king T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda, to assume the throne after the death of his father. In this hidden kingdom filled with incredible technologies, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) comes to Wakanda with a reason to challenge T'Challa. There was a great risk to make Black Panther, as usually innovative movies became box office failure to be then appreciated years later as important cult. Instead Black Panther surprised the audience and the critics, to become a successful movie with more than $1.347 billion box office. Usually the superhero movies explore in the easiest way the theme good and evil, which is going to be already expected how the story would end. Instead Black Panther explored the theme good and evil in the complex way, to see how some decisions bring heavy consequences which makes the movie intriguing and original. The screenplay was elaborated to be clear how the story would be told, from the beginning to the end, without ruining the narration's rhythm of the story. The movie does not use any kind of clichés to be predictable, but it surprises with unexpected plot twists to be unpredictable. The production designer Hannah Beachler elaborated the settings of Wakanda in a particular way, as she took inspirations from the original Black Panther comic book's settings and also from some of Africa's settings to make the movie creative and visceral for the audience. The lightings, the colors and the camera make some of the most emotional scenes, atmospheric where the audience would get surprised. Some of the most spectacular moments of the movie look like atmospheric paintings, which make these epic scenes unforgettable and emotional in every shot angles. The costume designer Ruth E. Carter elaborated the costumes in a particular way, which make these costumes stylish also thanks to the colors and their forms. It is also interesting to see how some of the tribal costumes, are technologically advanced which make them creative. The score by Ludwig Göransson was creatively elaborated, as it uses orchestral instruments mixed with traditional African instruments. The musician Baaba Maal collaborated with Ludwig Göransson to make the score powerful, especially on the unforgettable tracks which he sang for the most epic scenes. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent performance as T'Challa who has to take an important decision, if Wakanda has to be kept as a secret kingdom or if it has to be revealed. It is an interesting part of the movie, to see what kind of difficult responsibility T'Challa has to take for Wakanda. Michael B. Jordan was really good as Erik Killmonger, who is one of the best villains of MCU. He is a character who has so much anger inside of his soul by searching the justice, in the most violent way for vengeance which can be understood the reason of his anger. Lupita Nyong'o did a well done performance as Nakia who is a strong character, she would do anything to help T'Challa whenever he needs. Danai Gurira did a well done performance as Okoye who is a proud Wakandan and T'Challa's bodyguard, she remains loyal to the Royal's throne no matter if some kings are good men or not. Finally Letitia Wright was excellent as Shuri who is T'Challa's younger sister, she creates incredible technologies to be even smarter than Tony Stark. The special effects were specifically elaborated by making the action scenes, spectacular and visceral in every single details to be breathtaking. Black Panther is one of the best and most creative superhero movies of all time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There isn't enough cinema which focuses on African people or nations in a positive way, but this film really isn't doing that. All it is doing is perpetuating the myth that Africans believe that violence is a reasonable way to resolve disputes, and that ""might is right"".I find it very hard to believe that portraying the most advanced African nation as an isolationist dynastic monarchy/dictatorship which eschews democracy in favour of 1 on 1 armed combat, tribalism and nepotism is ""woke""? Really?This portrayal of ""advanced"" Africans primarily as warriors, rather than intellectuals (their technology is only achieved by their luck in living near the only know site containing Vibranium, rather than by their inherent ability as capable human beings to create an advanced society) is incredibly insulting and reinforces the racist stereotype of Africa as being socially backward and perpetually driven, and riven, by violence.Apart from that, it is a reasonably entertaining, if forgettable, film in the same vein as most other recent superhero offerings.","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

The bad guy ""winning,"" the good guy coming back to win in the end. While I can see what is meant by that, I have to say how else would the plot be? What superhero movie's plot isn't along the lines of that? To the people who said the plot is typical, please, name a superhero movie where the plot is bad guy ""wins"" temporarily, then good guy comes back and saves the day. The only movie I can name is Avengers: Infinity War. Even then, in the next movie, the good guys won after the bad guy temporarily wins.I also saw reviews say that it isn't that much comedy in it and only a couple of characters made them laugh. Some reviews even compares this film to other Marvel films. Have you ever stopped and thought maybe these characters are not jokesters like Iron Man, Thor, et cetera. Captain America wasn't one to make jokes a lot either. Also, y'all are contradicting yourselves. How can you be upset that the movie is too much like others (plot wise) or too predictable, but also be upset it's not as comedic as others? Shouldn't each movie have their own identity, uniqueness, something that makes them different? Y'all are entitled to your opinions, however I do think y'all may be being too critical on the film. For what reason, I do not know.I have also seen a review saying it was political. It's a Black story, what else would the debate be about between Black people? All superhero movies' plot deal with some type of politics in it. Whether it's border politics, power, the people who are whatever. Captain America: Civil War, first of all political name, is a political film dealing with the debate if the Avengers should be governess by the US. Captain America: First Avenger another political film dealing with world politics, power grabs. So, the theme of politics is prevalent in all Marvel movie, in fact all superhero movies. What's the issue with politics in this movie?Again, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But I don't understand the concern. And you can't please everyone. If everything reviews say the movie is lacking was incorporated, there will still be someone to complain about something/dislike something.I thought the costumes and music were both amazing. Impeccable acting across the board, from each and every character. The CGI was really good, too.RIP Chadwick Boseman, a great actor, a South Carolina legend!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Had his solo film expanded on these three qualities, while delivering the necessary fights and funnies that define the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have made for a good film. Ryan Coogler's Black Panther does much more.Like most of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the plot runs by a tried-and-true blueprint. This time, it follows the footsteps of the first Thor with story beats surrounding royalties, loyalties, betrayals, outcasts and family secrets that feel familiar (sometimes predictable). However, they play naturally to the majestic and technologically advanced world of Wakanda.If anyone deserves to retire as kings and queens, it's the art department. There's so much creativity displayed in the makeup, costuming, sets, and sci-fi designs that a single watch cannot absorb it all. From the striking attire of the Dora Milaje warriors to the sand-like magnetic thingy-ma-bobs that power Wakandan tech, every detail adds wonderment to a world that imagines an African culture gifted with near-unlimited resources and untainted by colonialism.The poisons of history play a big part in Black Panther - not just with colonialism, but with any past act that later proves to be problematic. This is what powers Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, a vicious yet sympathetic adversary with enough depth to make him one of the more memorable villains in the MCU.However, the true knockout stars are Lupita Nyong'o as Wakandan spy Nakia and Danai Gurira as Dora Milaje general Okoye. They're given multiple times to shine using both their heroic fists and their stand-up comedy routines while sticking to their own rounded subplots.Weirdly enough, Get Out's Oscar-nominated star Daniel Kaluuya ends up falling a little flat as commander W'Kabi, using a casual 'did you just fart?' face for almost every confrontation. His relationship with Okoye also seems non-existent until the film coughs it up during an otherwise exciting climax. But those are minor complaints for a film that feels gargantuan in almost every other way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is not only an amazing Marvel film, but it also tells an important story that resonates with audiences far beyond the genre's usual fanbase. From the music to the design to the story, Black Panther is an exceptional work of art.One of the most noteworthy aspects of the film is its incredible soundtrack. Led by Kendrick Lamar, the music perfectly encapsulates the spirit and importance of the movie. From the hard-hitting ""King's Dead"" to the contemplative ""All the Stars"", the soundtrack is a reflection of the movie's themes and message.The design of Black Panther is also incredible, bringing the world of Wakanda to life in stunning detail. The costumes, sets, and special effects are all top-notch, making Wakanda feel like a real place with a rich history and culture. The attention to detail is remarkable and adds an incredible layer of depth to the film.But what really sets Black Panther apart is its story. T'Challa's journey to ascend to the throne and confront the challenges facing Wakanda is an engrossing tale of duty, family, and legacy. The film does an excellent job of addressing important topics, such as oppression, identity, and representation, without sacrificing the entertainment value of a superhero film.Black Panther is a monumental achievement in filmmaking. It offers amazing entertainment value while also telling a powerful story and featuring outstanding music and design. It's a film that is both important and entertaining, making it one of the best superhero movies ever made.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

""Wonder Woman,"" for example, was a pretty good movie but had some flaws. It got a pass from critics because it was the first woman superhero movie. Had it stared Chris Hemsworth or Tom Cruise, it would have been treated much more harshly.""Black Panther"" does a fabulous job of building a super advanced civilization in the heart of Africa. The depth, complexity and thought that went into all of this was truly delightful. Too bad it could not have been explored in a ""Game of Thrones"" style long-format story ark. As it was, we spend almost half the movie world-building for a disappointingly small payoff in terms of story. The middle drags while so much track is being laid.The story is OK. ""Iron Man"", by way of comparison, was a great movie because of the main character's growth ark. We saw an immature and deeply flawed Tony Stark come into true adulthood. He emerges from the shadow of his father and faces the truth about the deadly weapons he creates. In ""Black Panther"" we see T'Challa also emerge into true adulthood. He starts as an admirable and nearly perfect Prince and develops into an admirable and slightly more perfect King. The growth ark is interesting but underwhelming.The truly fascinating character is Killmonger (Michael Jordan) and his sidekick Claw (Andy Serkis). We end up wishing more of the movie had been about them rather than T'Challa's angst over whether to be just noble or really really noble. Still, definitely worth seeing. The creative detail and near total immersion into alternative African culture makes up for the lackluster character development and predictable story.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has top level special effects, great action sequences, gorgeous settings and costumes. What it doesn't have is a very good storyline - it's totaly predictable and rather weak. This film also suffers - as usual in Marvel films - from the villain deficiency sindrome: the villian is simply too weak and totaly uninteresting.
As for the actors, they're all good and obiously capable of much more, but they all did what was asked of them flawlessly. But none of them will win any awards for this film, and that's the truth. Chadwick Boseman makes a competent hero, though not a very memorable one. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o stand out as two very strong and gorgeous women (I think I'm a little in love with Lupita Nyong'o, she's one of the most beautifull women I've ever seen and an extraordinary actress). Andy Serkis is awsome, as always. Michael B. Jordan stands out for the negative, as possibly one of the worst and dullest villains in movie history.
All in all, your average Marvel film, with all it's strengths and faults. Honestly, with all the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting a lot more. Wonder Woman stands untouched as the best superhero film ever made.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This visually stunning and thematically resonant tale of a young king's ascension to power redefines the superhero genre, delivering a blend of action, adventure, and social commentary that will leave a lasting impression.From the opening moments, Black Panther transports us to the vibrant and technologically advanced world of Wakanda, a hidden African nation blessed with immense vibranium deposits, the rarest and most powerful metal on Earth. This fantastical setting provides a rich backdrop for the film's exploration of themes of identity, tradition, and the weight of leadership.At the heart of Black Panther's narrative lies T'Challa, the heir to the throne of Wakanda. Following the death of his father, King T'Chaka, T'Challa must confront his own past and reconcile his desire to lead his people with the weight of responsibility that comes with his new role. This internal struggle is portrayed with nuance and depth by Chadwick Boseman, who delivers a performance that captures the complexities of T'Challa's character with masterful precision.Alongside Boseman, the supporting cast of Black Panther is equally impressive. Lupita Nyong'o shines as Nakia, T'Challa's loyal spy and confidante, while Michael B. Jordan delivers a captivating turn as Erik Killmonger, a formidable adversary with a complex and relatable motivation. The supporting cast brings depth and nuance to their roles, creating a tapestry of characters that are both compelling and relatable.The visual artistry of Black Panther is nothing short of breathtaking. Director Ryan Coogler and his team have crafted a world that is both stunningly beautiful and technologically advanced, seamlessly blending African aesthetics with futuristic elements. The film's action sequences are equally impressive, showcasing intricate choreography and innovative use of technology, all set against the backdrop of Wakanda's breathtaking landscapes.Black Panther transcends the superhero genre by delving into profound social issues, exploring themes of colonialism, racial identity, and the legacy of violence. The film does not shy away from addressing these complex topics, but rather tackles them with sensitivity and thoughtfulness. While the film doesn't delve into these themes as deeply as it could, it still manages to spark important conversations and challenge audiences to consider their own perspectives.In a genre often criticized for its lack of substance, Black Panther stands out as a triumph of storytelling. It is a film that entertains, inspires, and challenges, offering a thought-provoking exploration of identity, leadership, and the power of community. Black Panther is a must-see for anyone who appreciates well-crafted storytelling, stunning visuals, and a timeless message of hope and resilience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The idea of Wakanda is fantastical, and harks back to the afro-futurism ideas some of us know from the cult musician Sun Ra...'there are other worlds they have not told you of'.That vibe was portrayed quite effectively, tho' in the real world the healthiest way forward should probably be less iron focus on our racial identity...but the world is what it is. And Marvel were quite brave here to show us it. They went pretty close to all-in: the cast, costumes, language, music...a lot of thought went into it. As a music-lover myself I appreciated another more unique-flavoured soundtrack (after Ragnarok's synthwave vibes). The less of that formulaic orchestral vapid noise that makes up the soundtracks of most of these films, the better.The african-flavour was almost all great except for the accents: while a few of the actors were raised in African countries themselves, all the cast had to manner their speech to get it consistently technically and tonally right for Wakandan, and it shows: speech patterns are too slow, too stiff, they don't have natural conversational flow. This also put paid to some already-clumsy attempts at humour. To top it off, token ""white boy"" (Shuri's words) Martin Freeman puts on a painful American accent! But credit where it's due, the movie went there...we even got to hear a few of those typical African tutting-consonant sounds, quite special to hear it so regularly in a big Hollywood production.The plot itself, once we accept the inventive premise, is standard fare. As are the conflicts. One major issue is the pacing: the first hour was really good and nicely varied, but without giving away spoilers: the film develops the main antagonist far too quickly once he's introduced...to the detriment of our sympathies for Wakanda. In Thor: Ragnarok, while Hela also developed quickly, we had the benefit of previous Thor movies so had built up a familiarity & sympathy with the place and its people. The antagonist himself isn't very interesting, his motivations and actions feel contrived to the plot rather than a real person. So was Hela's, but she was visually mesmerising.The other characters - and the plot itself - also suffer from the main conflict escalating too easily, tho' watching Lupita & Winston was fun (both great in Peele's Us), and the Okoye character's stunts were pretty neat. The action generally was a bit hit 'n miss: some cool acrobatics, but poor CGI ideas. Wakanda - the place - was fairly well realised tho' like Asgard in Thor-1 feels like there's room for more.First hour 8/10, second hour 6/10. Settle on 7/10.Objectively, however, Black Panther is an important movie in Hollywood History. It's good that it was made.Next: Infinity War. This is clearly gonna be the Big One!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I know that his background and family tree can get messy because of how extensive it is. Started the film with a flashback speeds forward into present day to tell what the flashback means. Was told really well because at first you can be confused on who is who in the flashback. The flow of the story wasn't out of wack were you could be lost as times surprisingly so everything fit together perfectly. The CGI was amazing seeing how they obviously had to depend a lot on it, the golden jaguar and black Panther suits were done soooo well and really give you an insight of what Wakanda really is. With every MCU superhero film I've noticed that they always have a ""hero"" moment or value that they tie into the film. It's a moment that the hero can prove why they are a hero. Black Panther managed to carry this moment out very very well. Like I said I'm obviously biased but per usual Marvel Studios can do no wrong. BTW there are two post credit scenes. First one after the first credits and the second after the full credits. Got to nerd out with the people around me for a min in between credits.

His throne becomes threatened after a mistake made by his father comes back to haunt the kingdom and challenge the throne. I can honestly say, ""I love this film."" Even though I have never been to Africa, it gave me a sense of pride. I did find it odd that a society so advanced would resort back to primitive battle to challenge the throne. The visuals were magnificent with only a handful of the stunt effects appearing cartoonish. Even though the film is about T'Challa and Wakanda, I am enjoyed the different layers within the story. It helped to provide sufficient backstory to certain characters without detracting from the main storyline. Ryan Cooglar did an outstanding job bringing this comic book story to life.The acting in this film was phenomenal. I believe everyone's own flavor added to their character, especially Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan of ""Creed."" I thought I would be annoyed at the portrayal of African dialect, but I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, this film is amazing. The actors pull you into the story through their superb performances and embracing of the character. The landscape visuals are magical, and the action scenes provide adrenaline even though there are a few flaws. The story instills a sense of pride through its science fiction that I have never experienced before.

Soon after taking the crown, T'Challa learns of the re-emergance of South African arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) who stole a large amount of Vibranium from Wakanda and killed several of their citizens. However, ubeknowst to T'Challa, Klaue is working with former CIA asset turned mercenary Erik Stevens aka Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who holds a grudge against T'Challa's family and is tied to secrets in T'Chaka's past.Black Panther is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics character of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966. Attempts to adapt Black Panther date as far back as the early 90s when actor Wesley Snipes lobbied hard to play the character in an adaptation, but the project wound up in development hell thanks largely to executives who remained unfamiliar with the character and Snipes would instead go on to play another Marvel character, Blade, instead. When Marvel Studios was established, one of the priority projects was a Black Panther film and like MCU's Spider-Man the character was introduced and established in Captain America: Civil War with the Character given a strong position in that film that was well received especially for the performance of Chadwick Boseman as the character. Ryan Coogler was signed to co-write and direct the stand-alone film following his success with Fruitvale Station and Creed, and the film upon release became a massive critical and commercial success earning $1.3 billion against a $200 million budget and became the most successful Black lead superhero film ever made. Black Panther is a solid entry in the MCU that creates an engrossing world and an engaging lead character.Much like Captain America, Black Panther doesn't have the character flaws of Tony Stark or Thor and is instead a good man with strong convictions who's struggles come from his responsibilities in how he should govern and protect his nation and where he should take it in the future. T'Challa doesn't claim to have all the answers and is surrounded by several advisors and allies who give him advice on how he should best approach be it in his former lover and now War Dog (spy), Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o who believes Wakanda should be a more active in helping the world in contrast to their isolationist position, or T'Challa's head bodyguard Okoye played by Danai Gurira who is a staunch traditionalist. The movie gives us some fantastic villains with Andy Serkis delightfully despicable as arms dealer Ulysses Klaue who's given much more to do than his introduction in Age of Ultron, but complementing Boseman's T'Challa is Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger who is probably the richest and most nuanced villain we've seen in the MCU who has more in common with someone like Magneto rather than the typical Machiavellian businessmen and dictators we've seen and there's a strong sense of tragedy to the character while still making him a threat that challenges T'Challa on a physical level, but also in terms of his beliefs and principles. At it's core the movie is about T'Challa navigating two extremes coming from both his father's legacy and Killmonger's motivation and where he choses to lead away from those and it's done in a very satisfying way.Black Panther has deservedly gotten all its praise for good reason and continues the strong streak of the MCU's third phase.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This really needs a sequel, though--for although he did what was right, there must be a tradeoff, and I didn't get to see the magnitude of the sacrifices yet (although I did get a taste of them) that are needed to flesh out the whole story.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is very much like the 'Iron Man 2' so if you loved that movie please go ahead and watch the movie, do not be concerned with my reviews. 
Me , as an initial viewer of Marvel movies, did not like the IM2 movie as it lacked the action and a good story. Though, people argue that story of both movies (IM2, BP) were great and some even went on great lengths to praise it (BP) as best for some race.
But, for me this is all gimmick whatever fashion and issues are trending gets used by big companies to paddle money and common people get conned. 
(*** I did not want to get philosophical and 'conspiracy theory' about a movie which is not even a great movie anyway, but when i expressed my views some people pis**d me off so I though why not.)Last words, overall an average, fun movie and do not expect to get a **epiphany** while watching.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film's first act is enjoyable, where we are told the origin of the African nation of Wakanda and introduced to the main characters. Sadly though, the second act felt drawn-out and kind of boring, and the film never seems to regain it's momentum after that. The scenery is beautiful and it is very well-shot. Wakanda is easily one of the coolest and most vibrant locations in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I can't wait to see more of it in May's 'Avengers: Infinity War' (YAY!!!). Some of the acting was terrific, particularly Black Panther's sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), the film's primary villain Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan), and secondary villain Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). Shuri and Klaue served as the film's comic relief, and their humor was refreshing and on-point. Killmonger is definitely one of Marvel's best villains to date. He was intimidating and captivating to watch. Unfortunately, Black Panther himself (Chadwick Boseman) didn't seem to show much emotion and struck me as very monotonous. The action scenes were pretty cool, but some of them were too dark and I didn't always know who was who, which made them hard to follow. The end fight between Black Panther and Killmonger felt very CGI-heavy, which took away from the enjoyment. Although I like the design of Black Panther's new suit more than his first suit from 'Captain America: Civil War', it looked too cartoony for my taste. It was even more unfortunate that Killmonger had the exact same type of suit with a different design. Overall, 'Black Panther' was good, but fell short of great.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But overall I'd call it a solid addition to the MCU, being something a little different, and setting up Avengers: Infinity War very nicely.
The feel and atmosphere of the film was different to what we'd experienced before in the MCU, assisted nicely by a great score by Ludwig Göransson, and originals by Kendrick Lamar.One major criticism I have is the execution of the climax scene as T'Challa and Killmonger face off and Killmonger is defeated but other than that there are some fantasticly directed, one being the car chase, or perhaps the two scenes where T'Challa is challenged, specifically the Killmonger challenge.And on Killmonger, he's one of my favourite villians in the MCU. Michael B. Jordan did a brilliant job there.People who think it's dull are probably just watching the wrong film.
There are different genres in the MCU, for example The Winter Soldier is a Spy kind of movie, whereas Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok are more like Fantasy and Comedy, and different people like different genres.People who complain about it being too politicaly correct are just morons. This film (along with the entire MCU) is based on the comics, and Kevin Feige wanted to introduce Black Panther just before Avengers: Infinity War, so that the setting for Wakanda was ready to play a prominent part in the film. And for this to happen, a lot of the cast has to be black. They can't make it without the cast being black, they're basically forced to include them. So there's no way it was made just for political correctness and what not.Anyway Black Panther was a very good film, and I'd probably give it a 7.7/7.8 kind of rating which rounds up to 8 for this.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

1. Boring story - relentless boring banter between characters. Typical story that's been told a million times. Nothing wrong with that as such, but equally, doesn't add to the experience.
2. Bad acting - acting was wooden (with the exception of Forest Whitaker). Felt like you were watching a live amateur play where the characters are reading live from a script.
3. Boring action - if you can manage to put up with the boring dialogue, then there's little to gain from the action. Very average at best, something you would expect in a TV episode.
4. CGI - the CGI effects are something along the lines of a good TV series, not really up there with a top movie production.To Sum UpDue to the wooden acting, the movie lacks passion. With the predictable non-exciting story and the action and CGI being average, Black Panther is simply dull and boring.","176 out of 405 found this helpful.

Entertained me, some nice action and comedy. I liked the vast majority of the characters and the acting. I thought the story was actually quite good too.
What I didn't like:
1) Way too much CGI. There's no reason why the developers could not have had martial artists in the Panther suits for the fight scenes. That would have been awesome but instead they opted for CGI characters and the CGI wasn't that good.
2) Not even a basic explanation as to how an ancient tribe managed to harness the technology of the vibranium meteorite. Iron Man is awesome because we know how the suit came to be. Similarly with Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow etc. That's what adds so much more to a story yet here we're supposed to believe that ancient people where able to harness vibranium and a teenager is the one and only brain behind most of modern Wakandan technology. I wasn't expecting anything in depth, just some basic story behind it.
3) The injection of political opinion. And the movie was actually pretty racist. I mean black tribes hooting like monkeys? How is that not racist. Regarding the injection of politics - it is just so unnecessary. And it wasn't even accurate either, like taking the stance that black slums exist due to evil white people and how fixing up buildings in these slums is going reduce the percentage of fatherless black families.
Anyway the movie was entertaining and that's mostly all I expect from the Marvel movies. Every now and then a Marvel movie offers a bit more but not this one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In contrast, the actor wanted to make a movie to highlight the majesty of the continent. By using Marvel Comic's iconic character ""Black Panther"", he thought he'd found a way to do just that. So, no time to lose. Snipes immediately began shopping around for a workable screenplay.The project proved to be more difficult than expected, though. Soon Wesley Snipes was forced to drop out. He had been given a leading role in the movie ""Demolition Man"", and that work would occupy most of his time. With no star attached to the project, Marvel therefore decided to drop ""Black Panther"" altogether. At least for the time being...Fast forward some twenty years. By this time the re-named Marvel Studios had quite a number of successful films in its catalogue. It was time to get ""Black Panther"" back on track. After hiring an almost entirely African-American production team, Marvel put up-and-coming director Ryan Coogler in charge of the picture.Coogler's vision for Wakanda, as Black Panther's kingdom is called, was inspired by the African country Lesotho. A nation that has managed to preserve its independence thanks to a mountainous, difficult-to-access terrain. The director was also careful to give Wakanda a futuristic look in line with the original design in the comic books.Marvel Studios had barely made the film's first teaser-trailer available online before ""Black Panther"" completely dominated the conversation on social media. A few days later, the picture opened globally, including a ""cross-nation release"" all over Africa (a first for Disney). And the success just continued. At the box office ""Black Panther"" took in well over $1.3 billion worldwide. That made it the highest-grossing movie ever by an African-American director.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The acting is good, the plot is good and the villain has actually some good points. There is not as much humor in this as it was in ""Guardians of the galaxy"" but there is still some. Some of it lands, some of it does not.But is this a revoulationary movie from Marvel? No. It's basically what you would expect from a marvel movie. It's bit different of course, with the setting and the fact that almost the entire cast is black. But besides the cast, this really is not something we haven't seen before. That being said, this was still a very entertaining and fun superhero movie!

"","","The evolution of MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4103364/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieManChuck","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80046415/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2018","4/4Every aspect of this film was absolutely spectacular. This is not only one of the absolute best superhero movies of all time, this is Marvel expanding it's audience beyond movie and comic-book enthusiasts. It is also catering to the African-American community. And seriously, I think we can all agree that it was about time for a black superhero. Am I right?Chadwick Boseman delivers a very convincing performance as T'Challa, never once was I in doubt of the native-African accent. Another MCU trademark (a good amount of movies can't seem to do this), the lead actor is truly the best actor. Also, they have a Grade-A director that brings out the performances tenfold. The one overall thing I felt lacking in this movie was the signature wit I've come to expect in a Marvel movie. The few jokes seemed to miss fire more than make contact, which is unfortunate, because the movie was so good otherwise.As far as the cinematography goes, it is the most color filled eye candy around. The special effects are the Segway to the plot. The colors have a realistic feel with a slightly surreal and other-worldly tint (Well after all, Wakunda is another world) It's an absolutely beautiful film.
However, the way they shot the beginning sequence in Oakland was irritating. It was a low-light rapid transition hat I totally missed into the jungles of Africa. However, it was revealed later through a flashback exactly what happened.The soundtrack is another revolution. Everything from genuine African vibes to compliment Wakunda and ""the challenges"", to The Weeknd for when T'Challa travels to Bangkok. Kendrick Lamar takes the mic in Oakland and teams up with SZA for a more poppy song in the credits. Flawless.In conclusion, this movie has an obviously presented message that doesn't dilute the movie. It's a movie about power... but it isn't. It's a film about people of different backgrounds pulling their talents together for the betterment of our world (as evidenced in the final cut scene in the credits). It's worth the $16 to see in the theatre, and they can count on me spending $30 more for the Blu-Ray/Digital Deluxe Combo Pack.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), shortly after the events of Civil War. He takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced city that is hidden in Africa. He quickly faces challenges though, as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), comes for the throne.The best aspect of the film is Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler creates an authentic setting that is full of vibrant colors, beautiful scenery, fascinating culture, and advancements in technology. There are some beautiful shots in the film that are complimented by the excellent color choice. The culture is truly fascinating from its great costumes to its interesting traditions. There is also a nice contrast within the culture, of old and new. While Wakanda is constantly innovating, it stays grounded in it's old and unique traditions. Wakanda's advancements in technology are fun to watch, whether it's in action sequences or the daily lifestyles of a Wakandan. This is world-building at its finest. Coogler gives us an authentic world that feels lived in, compared to other settings in the MCU like Asgard from the Thor franchise.The action sequences can be best described as fluent. These sequences are fast-paced and well choreographed. The Wakandan technology makes these sequences exciting. These are simply some of the most entertaining sequences ever seen in the MCU.Chadwick Boseman gives you that slick and intelligent character that is expanded upon in the film.The chemistry is great, especially in the four main protagonists. T'Challa and each member of his crew have believable relationships and each character serve their own purpose within his crew. Letitia Wright's Shuri and T'Challa have a dynamic relationship, where they actually feel like siblings. She also accounts for most of the comic relief in the film. Danai Gurira's Okoye is an all business character that is loyal to her king. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia. While she is mostly there as T'Challa's love interest, she has her own set of goals that adds another layer to her character, as well as T'Challas.The character that really steals the show is Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. His character has powerful and clear motivations, that some might even find relatable. This makes his character conflicting for the viewer as they choose between him and T'Challa. While most villains in the MCU suffer from being poorly written, Killmonger has some great scenes that build up his character and give his character a legitimate purpose that most MCU villains lack. Killmonger even causes T'Challa to question himself, which is the mark of a great villain. Yet he still felt like he didn't get enough screen time and some of the scenes in this film could have easily been replaced with scenes that give more insight into his character.The film had few negatives, but they're worth talking about. This film lacks emotional moments. Without the emotional moments, this film lends itself as a very predictable one. The film does have social commentary and some political agendas. The political agendas take the form of two lines though. The lines still feel like they were throw in there and just felt unnecessary in a Marvel film.Overall, Black Panther is unlike any Marvel experience I have ever had. This film definitely feels like a Marvel film, but it separates itself from its predecessors. Coogler creates an authentic setting that has a lot going for it. The film boasts great effects, action sequences, and cinematography. The film has excellent main and supporting characters. Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date but still didn't get enough screen time. The film is predictable and has some unnecessary political agendas. Like I said, Black Panther is a unique experience. One that certainly should be experienced in the theaters. My score: 8.0/10","9 out of 25 found this helpful.

My major cons with the film included the overuse of CGI and jump-cut action, both expected staples for modern Marvel films, alongside the 2+ hour run time felt which grew tedious by the third act.

For the first time in a long time I'm so happy of how they portrayed the character story in the MCU. The black panther was Lmost everything I dreamed of in a movie. The cinematography and the story line almost made me cry tears of Joy. I watched this movie and it's so hard to explain myself without talking about some scenes. There was just something to hold on to for every scene and all you could do was bold your breath. But I'll hold it in. I liked the fact that Chadwick boseman did an extremely good Job, and most of the casts. But I really didn't want to see Michael B Jordan in the movie cast. *I don't know why, but I feel there was something about him that didn't add up. (The forced Black American thing).
I would have prefered someone else. E.g the doctore from spartacus, or someone of that nature but I guess its because of the story line and all. Anyways, it's a 9.8 for me.","12 out of 36 found this helpful.

I'm sad to say I don't anymore, because of how the character was treated left a lasting bad taste in my mouth, and all the changes made for this the adaptation to meet executive expectations, it just disgusts me. The 96% percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes tells me one thing, not one critics who reviewed it, had ever read a comic in his/her life's. This new MCU version started out strong with Chadwick Bozeman in Captain America: Civil War, and then quickly went down hill when this came out, I mean the sky was the limit and this was the best they could do.. come on now. It is just chock full of quiet political agendas, that are strewn through the picture, if you look hard enough it's there, all I can say is enough is enough. Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. The really crappy character development, poor CGI that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout. You'd a company that produces and sells comics, would have said something to someone, hey this isn't right we should change this. Ryan Coogler the director who also co-wrote the movie is an untalented filmmaker, and Kevin Feige saw no issue with his script basically giving him complete control, which was the down fall of this dreadful film. I' am just so ashamed that not even Chadwick Bozeman talents as an actor could save this awful mess, he deserved so much more. Plus Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential, they replaced him with a black villain, that is now his long lost cousin or whatever, he didn't know existed, a plot that was made up for this movie, just magically shows up, knows where and how to find them in Wakanda. Ryan Coogler again showing his incredibly lazy skills at writing. What could have been in the hands of someone talented and competent. Not a good film period!.","26 out of 50 found this helpful.

The 3D effects make it even more stunning!! Get ready to dive into the mystical world of Wakanda, with their picturesque landscapes, vibranium modified animals, unique rituals, and...... Wierd looking people.
What's not really good: The storyline would have been awesome, if you hadn't seen it, like a thousand times. No efforts to make to make it even a little bit less cliche. And the black panther seems like a distant cousin of the batman, you know with the technology and stuff.
I think you have better acting potential with some of the antagonists. Personally I feel Michael jordan leaves a better impact that anybody else.
What you have to do: Go to a facny theatre,take your girlfriend, grab some popcorn, take a cozy seat, , give your intellectual Nazi's some rest, and just watch. Yes.its okay if you dont have a girlfriend.","4 out of 26 found this helpful.

Maybe it wasn't so much the actor but the writing? I just don't know but no one in their right mind watching this can tell me lines like ""when I tell you to do something, I mean that sh**!"" or any other forced west side slang really fit in to this role. I get he's supposed to be from Oakland but everything he said seemed so out of context. Daniel Kaluuya (main actor in Get Out), also casted in this movie, would've been a much better villain and maybe the two should've switched characters...overall the movie is good but the more Michael b Jordan talks, the more disappointed I get. 6/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I like the concept, millions of years ago, before humans inhabited this particular part of Central Africa, a meteorite crashed into and energized the land. When humans arrived they created this insular nation, trading with no other, while developing technology far advanced ahead of the rest of the world. A concept for a story that I don't recall hearing before, but somewhat akin to the Wonder Woman story.The actors are all first-rate, but ultimately the story degrades into a war between factions, great battles involving indestructible warriors.

But I had a real problem even talking about this film with others since it seems like they completely reject any flaw the movie has. While it is true that you should enjoy the movie I do not think you should turn your eye away from weaker points.I had no problem with the cast in this movie and I think they worked great. The problem is that this film tries to be original while still following the marvel formula and that shows. Certain Characters does sometimes feel unique but at other times they just feel like the other supporting casts in the Marvel cinematic Universe.This also is shown in the plot. I really liked to experience wakanda and its culture but the movie jumped from that to generic action/superhero stuff and then back to the world of wakanda. And thus I felt like I had not seen enought. You barely see how the city of Wakanda looks except from above shots.The major flaw I had was the ending that did not look good at all. Since the Black panther suit is all cgi I understand that it can look fake but even the movements looked somewhat weird and unnatural. While Civil war also had Cgi, I think its effects were a lot more polished. And this exists in more parts of the film, not just the ending.I did not hate this movie. I quite liked liked it. But I am dissapointed that it did not focus on the elements that actually made the movie good and instead felt like it had to add elements to make it feel like another superhero movie.You can like this movie but do not be afraid to point out its flaw. More time polishing the effects could help and I had really hoped that they would try to make this movie feel a lot more unique.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Will he continue the way things have worked for centuries, or go down a different path? How does one best aid one's own people? And does that extend beyond your nation's borders? Can he stop Killmonger(B. Jordan, passionate, wrong only in how far he goes and not in what he seeks to solve), before he tears the country apart from within?This shares a lot of traits with The Wonder Woman solo movie. It's about time that they are made. but being filmed now, they can use recent events, and the franchise they belong to, to great effect. They celebrate, not excuse, not mock, not downplay, the traits typically thought of as natural, or even culturally, historically, geographically, important to the minority that they're about. They're telling a story important to that group. Exploring themes specific to them. Presenting a fictional, powerful country, where they are in charge, they are the rule rather than the exception, and govern by their strengths. And now to get into what separates this from the Gal Gadot-led picture, and I'm not saying that movie could have, or should have, done this, as it is, intentionally, a different story. That is about a woman on her own, in a world dominated by men. This is fully immersed in African culture. It is relevant to black people in the US, and all over the world. But it's not about immigrants, or their descendants. Which is not to say that it's snobby. Free of the pressures of the majority of the population who are distinct from them, never made to be ashamed of who they are, The Five Tribes do have all the power that their kin continue to fight for as they have for hundreds of years. In fact, far more than that. And so, it asks, how do you use that? What makes a great leader?All the visuals are dazzling. Costumes, sets, designs, cinematography, etc. The acting is great. Shuri(Wright, infectious smile, casual, a brilliant engineer) steals every scene she's in. Coogler, known for drama, of course handles that aspect with a deft hand. And unusually for a first-time Blockbuster director, also the action, scope and massive budget. A little of the coverage and editing is awkward, showing his inexperience. but that is barely noticeable. The James Bond meets The Godfather feel blends the classic with the ultra-modern perfectly. The ancestral plane seems made for going into father son relationships. The War rhinos(!) Are an inspired touch. This is full of black women. They aren't looked down on, or angry side-kicks. Several are serious bad-asses. They give the protagonist advice, from their different perspectives, and he considers all of it. My only real complaint is that this did not take the final step in making this completely accessible for those unfamiliar with the MCU. If you did not watch the film that introduces the Black Panther, you will not understand, as this does not retell, what happened after the explosion that hits the UN. And since going blind into that film is even more confusing(If you watch Age of Ultron before it, you can follow it no problems... but not everybody knows that), that means this can't be watched by everyone. So I urge you. If you didn't already, catch those two films first, then go see this . Obviously, not everyone has, or will, see all 17 leading up to this.There is some violence and strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone. I give this a perfect rating not to even out the overall score, a practice I do not believe in, but because it deserves it. I reserve that for only the best. I give it rarely. And I am thrilled to award it to this. 10/10","15 out of 49 found this helpful.

They are the Elvis, the Michael Jackson or The Beatles of cinema. Even when a movie receives much hype, such as this one, they still live up to the hype.I had Black Panther circled on my calendar for months (even before I knew the release date). I'm not a Black Panther aficionado, but likewise I was no Iron Man, Blade, Avengers et al aficionado yet I loved those movies.Black Panther was excellently done all around: the story, the acting, the action and the atmosphere it looked like time and effort was put into it. Everything looked authentic. I appreciated the atmosphere more than anything. Set in the fictitious land of Wakanda, hidden in the heart of Africa, it had such an authentic feel. They were able to portray this beautiful African nation in a way that showed it's difference from what we're but showing it in a dignified respectful manner. The scenery, the people, the atmosphere didn't look cheap, gimmicky or like a caricature. They came off like real people from a real culture.And the story was layered and complex. It wasn't simply revenge or lunacy and it definitely wasn't black and white. There were some real ideological issues and battles in there with no right answer. Of course the action sequences were on point but that's to be expected. I'm just thrilled that it lived up to the hype.","9 out of 26 found this helpful.

This is straight 10 for me, for a number of reasons. 1. There have been no movies that are cast with all African actors and directors, especially in the new marvel universe (I am excluding soul food movies here). There have also been hardly any blockbusters that have African leads, Denzel and Will Smith have tried with Hancock, American Gangster and I am Legend hence these two actors are legends. The acting from actors who don't get the practice of leading, is phenomenal, it was like watching 007, Matrix all in one. It was simply awesome that African actors could change perceptions without overdoing the us and them. 2. The story was authentically African, it embodies our view of the world, in some way often naive but good natutred that can be misconstrued as primitive or stupid. Most European directors often focus on the perceived negatives over these emotions. A mother makes naive choices, ends up a single mum, a son angry at an absent father but somehow lacks the capacity to forgive, the gangster who seems to have a childish view of living despite his obvious reality, the angry black man who takes a gun into a hospital to make his point of inequality. This movie was just the pure fun of living in an all African society. Where people fight, betray and make up without that anglo saxon need to finish what you started. One for the black folks to understand. 3. It highlights the gulf that has existed in the African population between, those who got sold into slavery and those who stayed and often this gulf has meant, affluent westernised Africans care little for those in Africa, hence the continent is poorer, it is a deep division caused by the most divisive point in history amazingly captured by Marvel of all people. The villain some how is not quite a villain a very DC touch in my opinion but very African in origin. 4. Every actor gave 100%, it was personal and in turn this singular film will inspire generations for millennia not because it features Africans but because it sends a positive message of hope to the whole world and embodies the African view of forgiveness, passion and self development, not many people could have emerged out of 400 years of systematic genocide to stand almost equal to any race today. Finally, it has a name ""Wakanda"". In my opinion, it is not a real place but lives in the heart of all Africans. I can understand if the typical expectations were, another Marvel flick and it is now hard to turn tail but this is a seperate franchise, probably the last but an amazing movie, passionate, funny, suspenseful and worth a second watch. Go see it... Please! Critics are just not qualified to critique. It is a movie for Africans and those who want to have fun with a bold Marvel approach to adding Africans to the super hero universe. It was about time, considering we already kick ass in real life.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Finally Marvel made a superhero movie with a unique score! And that's where my praise for Black Panther ends.This film is the same old Marvel scheme. With the added bonus of being ""political"" I cannot believe how highly this film has been praised. It's far from Marvel's best work and to be honest, the race aspect of it seems forced and frankly, leads no where. The film leads it up the whole movie, but falls short of breaking out of the Marvel formula. I don't understand why Marvel of all franchises attempted to make a political film. Yes, I think this film is political. Although if I were to describe this film in one word, it would be ""pretentious.""This film brings nothing new to the table, save a change of skin tone. I understand why it is successful and why people praise it. But many other films (films more artistic and/or serious than a Marvel film) have portrayed a similar, if not exact copy, of the story presented in Black Panther. I liked the soundtrack, but the film itself was a Marvel movie, and it showed. Overall, I like the film, but is not a masterpiece and in my opinion is the same caliber of film as Iron Man 2. It is thanks to this film I understand the super hero movie fatigue.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Black Panther: 6.9/10 (good movie)I was very excited to watch this movie, and because of the reviews I read and heard, I expected very much of this movie. While watching the movie, I kept waiting for it to get better and be more thrilling. I can tell you, judging from a technical and qualitative prospective, it wasn't so good, it was just good. It could have been much better, when you compare it to other superheroes movies, it lacks some important elements.But noticing the values and meanings, which you can't miss because they are focused on, you probably will change your mind about the movie in my opinion. It tells you about how dark and terrible the world we live in is, and that it's our responsibility to make this world a better place, to use what God gave us to help ourselves and others who can't help themselves against the evil they face, and not sit and live in peace where many others die and can't live properly throughout the world. And it talks about racism just by a black man being the hero, and how modern and developed they can be.And that's why it's different than other movies, its inspiration makes it outstanding, and we indeed need more movies to talk about such problems.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

From it being an amazing film to it being the first black led superhero movie, it was everywhere and therefore I expected something pretty special.For a start, it's not. In fact I'm not sure what I dislike more, this or Dr Strange. It's genuinely close. This is a mindless cgi-fest with a lackluster story and hardly feels like a Marvel movie at all.Secondly, can people pull their butts out of their heads for five minutes and get off this revolutionary ground breaking movie because of the leads ethnicity?Blade (1998) is Marvel, African American lead and 3 movies (Plus a tv show)Spawn (1997) (My favorite superhero) feature movie, African American leadCat Woman (2004) (Not even including the original Batman series) Halle Berry African American leadSteel (1997), African American leadAnd if we can touch upon comedy superhero movies we also have Blankman (1994) and Meteor Man (1993)Do I need to continue?

It's not awful, I never believed it was awful I just considered it bad. Since the initial review I can also say the number of mediocre Marvel movies as increased as well, such as Eternals (2021) yeesh that was terrible and dare I say the sequel to this which was vastly inferior and I simply couldn't stand it.After a rewatch I stand by everything I said, I think it's a weak link in the MCU but I do get what they were trying to do. I wish they'd tried that little bit harder, focused on a few things that actually matter over things that simply don't.","31 out of 62 found this helpful.

Assisted by his tribe's forces and a CIA agent, the new king is soon locked in a life-or-death struggle. This is a film with multiple running topics, including isolationism vs. The threat of openness and what wealthy nations owe to the poor and oppressed. As an aside, few Marvel films work better tonally than this one. The battle sequences that overcrowded some of the other Marvel films have more purpose here. By no means does Black Panther transcend the action genre, but it certainly embraces it in a skilled way. It has a plentiful array of dazzling costumes, inspiring set design, and different cultural elements that are well-observed. The use of CGI provides a beautiful backdrop for a near idyll. Alas, the characters do not stand out from the beauty and sweeping majesty of the stage backcloth. The film is also impeded by the studio's anodyne dialogue, which feels like design-by-committee. T'Challa, the King, is played well, but the character lacks dimension. Martin Freeman's character is smooth-talking, but with a turn of phrase more akin to a freshman than an airman. In contrast, Michael B. Jordan's villain gave the film a spring to its feet, while Andy Serkis gave us verve, albeit brief. All in all, it looks fabulous, but its thematic assertions were a little feint.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

with that out of the way, here is what i liked and didn't like
overall i mostly enjoyed the cast. they played the roles fine, although looking back it wasn't too above average. they acted fine, had alright chemistry, and overall i didn't mind.
the plot, i thought, was pretty good. i liked what they did with the villain, and although they could of done more with the panther, i thought the way they worked the plot was alright.
the action was also fine, could have been better, but it did its job of entertaining, and was really one of the better parts of the film.
finally, i really liked the visuals. wakanda looks pretty cool, the characters are well designed, and overall i don't really have many complaints. you COULD say it looks a bit generic, but it didn't phase me.
overall the main flaw of the movie is that it wasn't very memorable. if this film didn't have a mainly black cast, then there would be nothing that makes it stand out. there are parts that i like, like (and i hate to say this) some of the political takes were interesting. and i don't mean ""yadda yadda have black people in movies more"", thats kinda a given. what interested me was the take on bias and racism. because not only do the white characters have their bias beliefs (the fbi guy treats wakanda as pretty lesser until learns of its power), but so do the black characters. one of them calls the fbi guy a ""colonizer""(which is fair enough, but its still kinda racist), the villain hates all white people and wants to colonize THEM, the entire movie seems to have the message that hatred can come from anywhere and anyone, and instead of fighting each other over our differences and conflicts, we should band together and try to find a common ground, that will hopefully strengthen us both.
but other than that, i can't really say the movie left an impact on me. it was okay, maybe in the 75-77% range, definitely slightly above average, but nothing too special. overall its just yet another overhyped marvel movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

there is going to be humor and Black Panther truly did have some funny moments that were well executed and rather unexpected with made the movie more of a fun time to watch,BUT AGAIN since this is a Marvel movie there was some campy and unneeded humor which toke away some of the seriousness of
the movie sometimes and just uneven,and it can be disappointing that Marvel still don't know how to balance funny moments and serious moments sometimes.However the action was very good,Black Panther has some of the most enjoyable action sequences since Captain America: Civil War and i especially liked how some action scenes were gritty and grounded while other fight scenes had more of a comic book movie style which was very fun to see and also a bit different.Now for the story,i personally liked the story not just because it was different than any Marvel movie because of it's cast or location but because it related to the real whole in some aspects and we haven't seen that since Captain America: The Winter Soldier dealing with stuff like politics or social commentary so it was greatly appreciated and needed.The Villain Killmoger is easily in the Top 5 if not Top 3 of best Marvel villains or best villains in recent superhero movies,because who understood his motives for being the way he is and why he is doing the things he did.Micheal B Jordan was good in the role had felt like a genuine threat to Black Panther and Wakanda and his motives again weren't generic or cliche and his story is clear and fully explained in the movie.As for the bad things in the movie well,i didn't find anything that was a huge problem with the movie however this was not a perfect film.I already stated that some of the humor was forced and it doesn't seem like Marvel is learning from this also some character motivations for me shifted too quickly or easily for my liking,what i mean is during the course of the movie some events may lead a character to change during the course of the movie which seems weirdly easy and almost rushed for the sake of it this goes for Black Panther himself and Daniel Kaluuya's character but luckily it was too bad that it took your focus off the movie and another thing is certain things are not explained in the movie like the spiritual aspect is not explained and certain plot points come out of nowhere and the movie just expects you to be okay with this which is just super lazy.Also these maybe nitpicks but some of the special effects look weird and some of the African accents are exaggerated (don't know maybe because i'm African and i notice this stuff).Now as i said the movie is pure Marvel 101 but it is different in how it executes things like the villain and how the hero grows from his challenges and learns from his mistakes which is good story-telling and the world of Wakanda was well detailed and again the African culture aspect of the film as super on point and the world building was well done and sets up the future of Black Panther without being forced.Some may say this is a typical Marvel movie and some of that is true but with over 10 films from Marvel it is nice too see that there can be new concepts and ideas to explore while maintaining the humor,action and well done story-telling that most Marvel movie have and can't wait for the future.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was quite conflicted because of the overwhelmingly positive reactions that this movie managed to accumulate. I will preface this review with stating that it was a good movie but ... at the same time it felt like it was lacking certain storytelling aspects. But we'll get to that in a second.Based on the fact that it is one of the highest grossing movies of all time some people made the assumption that it is a ""monumental"" superhero movie that is akin to ""The Dark Knight"". I disagree with that statement. The movie was fun to watch but it wasn't as ""monumental"" as the Dark Knight movie. Furthermore I'd like to point out that a movie's box office performance isn't necessarily a good indicator for its storytelling aspects. I personally like to believe that the movie seemed a little bit boring at times (especially during the middle segment). It only got really interesting when the villain finally showed up, which took some time. But then again, this is an origin movie so you have to expect everything to take twice as long as usual due to the limitations of the genre. And once the user is fairly accustomed with the origin story things can progress at a much faster pace. All origin movies have to struggle with this odd pacing. Which is also the reason why I'm not very fond of origin movies in general (despite their importance to new viewers).The film score was amazing. Ludwig Göransson did a really good job composing it. It was super authentic due to its many ethnic elements and added a great deal of depth to the overall ambiance of the movie. The cinematography was also quite breathtaking. With those awesome aerial shots of the African landscape and the interesting camera angles. Like e.g. that one scene where the camera swivels horizontally as Killmonger walks into the throne room. That one was a pretty cool shot that you don't really see that often. Actually, now that I think about it the movie had a lot to offer but I simply feel like the story itself wasn't quite on the same level. Let me explain:
Out of all the protagonists it really seemed like T'Challa was the least interesting one, which is pretty weird considering that it's a movie about him, the Black Panther. Killmonger and Okoye e.g. were far more compelling characters, just to put it into perspective. My biggest criticism however concerns a pretty obvious storytelling flaw; the lack of character development.
Okoye was probably the only character that grew/""changed her ways"" when push came to shove. The UN speech that T'Challa gave at the end made for the perfect ending but it also felt very forced to me. At no point did he even ""consider"" to metaphorically break bread with other nations. Not even when Nakia, his ex-girlfriend who he still has feelings for, suggested it. It just seemed odd for him to do a total 180 on a subject matter that he used to be so stoic about. So yeah, I would say it wasn't very believable.A minor thing that I would also like to mention is M'Baku's demeanor. In the comics he's far more antagonizing. After all he's one of Black Panther's arch enemies. He definitely seemed a little too friendly in the movie (if you know the comics). And yeah, in the comics he goes by another moniker: ""Man-Ape"". The director however decided to simply go with M'Baku instead because it might be racist? I personally don't agree with that decision. Man-Ape isn't a racist name for a villain. Especially once you realize that M'Baku and his tribe are literally worshiping the gorilla gods in the comics. It makes perfect sense.On a side note:
The Black Panther suit received a well-deserved design-upgrade and looks much better than the one from the comics. It's very aesthetically pleasing with all those streamlined metal spike adornments. I dare to say that it's arguably the best looking suit in the Marvel CMU to date (the only contender would be the ""Iron Spider Man""-suit but we have yet to see it on Peter Parker). At the end of the day the movie was more like an appetizer. That's at least what I took away from it. I'm convinced that the Black Panther and Wakanda will probably play a bigger role in the upcoming Marvel movies. 
I'm also pretty certain that the sequels will be much better. Mostly because they won't be origin movies.Final verdict: recommended","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Bodeman), as he prepares to assume the throne of the country of Wakanda after the death of his father. He is destined to lead over a nation that to the outside world seems impoverished and rural, but is secretly a very technologically advanced society thanks to their Vibranium resources. The resources allow them to keep their capitol city hidden from the world.
As T'Challa attempts to assume the throne and rule over the various tribes of his country; a threat from his past both known and unknown arises. Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) surfaces, T'Challa mounts and effort to bring him to justice which in turn sets a chain of events into motion. A mysterious and deadly figure known as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), plans to obtain the Vibranium to exact a plan of revenge so severe it will lead to the nations of the world being subjugated and will divide even the most loyal citizens of Wakanda.
T'Challa must use his powers as The Black Panther and guardian of Wakanda to save his people and the very world from a threat that holds the fate of the world in the balance.The film takes a while to get going as Director/Co-Writer Ryan Coogler takes his time introducing audiences to the world of Black Panther and especially the various characters. The strong supporting cast features Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Martin Freeman, and so many others that it is great to see such well-rounded characters.The film does take a while to get up to the action but when it arrives; it delivers making the wait worth it. What I really liked was that the characters were well-defined as were their motivations. You did not have some cartoon mega-villain with some insane scheme, but rather a realistic and believable threat whose motivations were understandable though misguided.
Marvel has again delivered a very thrilling story that fits well into their extended universe and you will want to make sure to stay through all the credits for the two additional scenes which sets up future events for the Marvel Universe. ""Black Panther"" is a rousing success all around continues Marvel's Cinematic Universe in grand style.4.5 stars out of 5","18 out of 62 found this helpful.

We finally get to explore the hidden, yet very advanced African country of Wakanda, and as we wonder why they do nothing with the power and knowledge they have, the film explores that, too. It's too bad that basically Chadwick Boseman plays a CGI Jacob King and the plot is that of the Lion King. What would Disney say? Well, nothing, because this movie is made by Marvel in collaboration with Disney Studios. Yet we did have to introduce Black Panther before Infinity Wars, so that is why this movie was made.It's not all bad, though. The acting is good, the special effects - barring the fight at the end - are nice, the story makes some sort of sense. The basic outline of the plot, though, is that, in the spirit of unity between men, Wakanda should rise from under its cover and help black people everywhere. Or that, in the spirit of helping the oppressed, it should rise from under its cover and conquer the world. Yeah, neither of those sentences make a lot of sense.Bottom line: fun, better than average, but frankly I would have preferred a spin-off movie with Ulysses Klaue as the main character.

Unfortunately, IMO the attempt has failed. For me, the idea of high-tech city/country hidden in Africa was too non-convincing.The company I worked at paid for tickets.

Brave and brilliant, this superhero movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4062864/?ref_=tt_urv","shawneofthedead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48490287/?ref_=tt_urv","15 February 2018","Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself. It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them. Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music. Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date. Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challa's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored.","12 out of 38 found this helpful.

While I would say that the film very, very slightly does not quite live up to some of the hype, it is still well-made and thoroughly entertaining. The film's acting is stronger than one would come across in most superhero movies, highlighted by Chadwick Boseman's commanding and stylish performance as T'Challa (Black Panther.) Also noteworthy is Michael B. Jordan's role as the impressively complex villain, and the Dora Milaje--the all-female special forces unit of Wakanda (the fictional African country where much of the film takes place.)Speaking of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler has masterfully designed and executed difficult world-building tactics to create this kingdom. The visual effects on display depicting Wakanda's unique landscapes are stunning, and it is genuinely impressive the detail that went into analyzing the kingdom's mercantile economy and political structure. Through depiction of a spear-fighting ritual as well as music, dance and food, audiences are immersed into the nation's local culture as well. These elements often make ""Black Panther"" feel more fresh than the typical superhero film.While there's undoubtedly much to like about ""Black Panther,"" the film does unfortunately contain some notable lapses. Its biggest flaw is that the climax of the movie is incredibly rushed and sometimes feels like it has trouble taking its time to tie up loose ends and plot holes. Conversely, the first act seems a bit too long. While the movie is generally well-written, the film's attempted moments of comic relief and one-liners that are effective in other Marvel movies tend to fall a bit flat here. That said, this is still a good and unique superhero film that I do recommend. 7/10Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The film's frequent use (over an hour of footage worth) of special formatting for IMAX, as well as the screen size and sound system, made this premium experience worthwhile.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film should be normal but it isn't. Therefore, you cannot underestimate the symbolism of having a predominately black cast doing what action heroes do on the big screen.

The mixture of technology and traditon is simply stupid, all combat scenes are beyond ridiculous, and the acting, especially all the fake accents, is nauseating, especially after seeing the actors in other roles, in which they were great (the little sister, for instance, she is unwatchable in Black Panther but really good in Top Boy).

I found it boring, action was mediocre, acting was good, similar story to many other movies (Lion King), and terrible CGi. Seriously, I don't know how a movie this expensive has such bad CGI? There is no weight or realism to the characters. They float like paper and when we have two CGI characters fighting, it looks about as good as a Playstation 3 cutscene. This movie doesn't really have a plot until the final act of this movie when Kilmonger comes into frame. It is cool that it shows us African culture, that was nice. Some of the comedy was funny, and I like the actress who plays his sister, She was good. Once again, all the actresses and actors were good in this. It is just that this movie was boring, bland, and very long.It doesn't add much to the Marvel cinema, and the action is really a huge letdown in this movie. The final battle makes no sense,like how a character just suddenly turns evil out of the blue. Michael Jordan is good in this movie, he has does say some of the deepest stuff in this movie. He talks about the enslavement of Blacks and how other Blacks just seem to forget to help their own people and become greedy. That was deep man, and he ends the movie with another quote that hits you hard, something like ""Bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped off the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage."" He doesn't get much screen time so that kinda sucks, and his fight scene at the end with Black Panther was really bad. It reminded me of Spiderman when CGI characters fall while fighting. It looks really bad. His fight scene with the human Black Panther on the water fall was cool though.6/10 This isn't the best Marvel movie like some people claim it is. THe best Marvel movie is still The Winter Soldier. The worst Marvel movies so far are Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, & Dr.Strange.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But the story is very cliched, the climax extremely boring and unsatisfying.The character of T'Challa was so poorly written with almost no personality at all. He had no reasons to do any of the stuff that he did. He had no character development, and his motives for everything were fuzzy. While the Killmonger had actual reasons and motives for his deeds, an actual backstory and the well established unfaithful, non compromising personality, T'Challa lacked all of them. The only character worth watching was the likeable and relatable Shuri. They tried to sabotage Killmonger's genuine attempt at salvation of the oppressed by making him do stupid, evil things. Who will tell the writers that comically evil villains with no morals are a thing of the past, and that villains can simply think differently without being evil.Andy Serkis did an amazing job even with the limited role he had. Chadwick Boseman was left with nothing to work on by the writers. The story was predictable recycled crap. And what's up with them mentioning the refugee crisis in Wakanda? It's like they made the film and then thought how to make it politically relevant. There are numerous other writing inconsistencies and lazily written subplots.Overall nothing special, but definitely unique in terms of visuals of Wakanda. Watch and forget.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Every hero in these movies gets heightened if the ""BAD"" guy/anti-hero is great. From that perspective the movie is greater than initial expectations.But......
Black Panther's role in MCU is the equivalent of Batman in DC. Gadjet,ninja,scientist, and acts in shadows and is always prepared for everything.T'challa(Chadwick Bosman) is not fitting for the role. He is pretty much younger than the hero of the comic, he is not putting a serious-shadowy figure of the comic character. He is also very charming and sometimes his baby-face is not fitting the ""blackness"" of the character, at least from the comic perspective. I rated this with 8,but with a better T'challa it would be a pure 9.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Back then I didn't know why, but as time went by I looked back and realised that it had a lot to do with the fact that they look like me. 
As a kid, sometimes when I found myself in a sticky situation, I'd get confidence by thinking ""What would T'Challa do""? Well, it worked, and here I am nearly half a century later and seeing a different generation experiencing what I did then, through an updated format I couldn't even dream would have been possible. 
 
Now this movie may not have the best storyline, CGI or acting. However, that is irrelevant to a new generation of kids who are looking for imaginative inspiration. 
So while they will get the real world heroes role models from President Obama to Oprah, they need to see the ones in the world of the imagination as well...and Black Panther steps right into that gap.Wakanda forever!!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

They have not only created one of the most impressive shared universes ever established in cinema history but they consistently keep bringing quality movies to the masses year after year. Not all have been earth shattering masterpieces but almost all have been of above average quality and always entertaining. Without beating around the bush, Black Panther is yet another great addition to this shared Marvel universe and has just enough character and style of its own to make it stand out from the others. The element of Black Panther I absolutely loved was the overarching story and the motivations behind all the characters. Never have I been more closely connected with each and every character in a Marvel film as I did in this one. To fully understand why they were doing what they were doing and what was driving them. Refreshingly even the main villain had a genuine reason for his actions and at times even made me question why I was so against him and routing for the other guys. This mash-up of motives and emotions really set Black panther apart from the rest. Not only that but the acting is of some of the highest quality there is. Stand out performance was Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. This guy just demanded your attention and completely owned every scene he was in. He balanced the dislike you felt for him perfectly and I found myself flitting from hatred to understanding numerous times throughout, by far one of my favourite villains in a Marvel film in a long time. Chadwick Boseman returns as the main protagonist after we first met him in 2016's Captain America Civil War and I was excited to see him again, although his performance didn't blow me away and he seemed to lack that special something that I get from the other MCU players. Now I mentioned I loved the story and the message it brings with it however I did feel the plot itself was quite predictable and cliché, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect to happen, happens. As great as the special effects are and as fun as some of the character scenes are, nothing is very memorable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the entire film that made me sit forward in my seat or really get my pulse going. To put it in context, I got that tingly excitement within the run time of the latest infinity war trailer, but not once through the 2h 14min runtime of Black Panther. As mentioned in a few other Marvel origin stories, the lack of emotion from me as a viewer is possibly linked to the fact we already know T'Challa (Black Panther) will appear in the next movie and is likely to get a number of sequels of his own... No amount of death fake outs will have that emotional tug on me the creators are so desperately trying to make me feel. This is perhaps something impossible to avoid when you have a universe such as this but it undoubtedly takes away any kind of worry you may have for the main superhero. One element the movie excels in is in its special effects. The majority of the film takes place in the fiction city of Wakanda and its mighty impressive, with its own unique mash-up of a technically advanced civilisation that still holds onto its ancient culture. The costumes, makeup, and excellent original soundtrack is something to behold. So as the plot plays out rather passively with little in the shape of memorable moments, Black Panther does bring with it a wonderful message of a world coming together and touches on a number of things that are quite prominent in today's current political climate. Marvel should be applauded for bringing together such a rich and diverse cast and creating a wonderfully unique world within its ever expanding universe. It expertly manages to establish the soul of T'Challa, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, and sets him up perfectly going into Avengers Infinity War.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

T'Challa ascended to the throne after the assassination of his father during the events of Captain America: Civil War, but now he must face threats both from outside and within.Marvel, once again, does not fail us. This movie might very well be one of their best in terms of visual splendour and thematic depth. The nation of Wakanda opens in front of us bright with colour, resplendent in culture and history, representing the whole spectrum of African art and creativity. Add in some really cool action and chase scenes, some cool new tech gizmos, some quality acting - some really high-end quality acting, to be truthful - as well as some really poignant questions about the responsibility of the haves towards the have-nots, and you have the makings of a great movie.Unfortunately I do think that the latter half of the film drops the ball. Most of the events after they return back to Wakanda are... clichéd. There's really no other word for it. As soon as Michael B. Jordan's character sets foot on Wakandan soil, I could tell minute by minute, almost line by line, what would happen. And that's not a good thing. Sometimes you can make such an obvious, clichéd plot work, but this is not one of those cases. For example, there's this battle scene in the middle of the film. You know how these stories go. One of them is going to lose, because that's how the story works. So why should you care, at all, about this fight? What's at stake here? Nothing at all, that's what.Black Panther is a good film. The characters are some of the best we've seen from Marvel, as are the visuals. I just wish they had had the creativity to move beyond obvious formulas and story clichés in the latter part of the story. Still, very much a film worth watching.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But gradually it went down. The plot has been simplified: the king has fallen, long live the new king! Then a successful attempt to take the throne back.They dragged stupid revenge on all of humanity here, since each person became guilty of the fact that some black boy was oppressed and deprived of something ... Well, it's a rather banal move to pay attention to racial discrimination in the USA. And these social protrusions in films are already rather tired. Does anyone else care what color your skin is? What size are the ears and wallet? What house do you live in and what clothes do you wear? All people are equal, and everyone chooses what kind of life he lives.If we discard the social overtones, then the film is shot well. Filmed in a beautiful location, the views are amazing, Boseman is quite a colorful personality, carries himself with such dignity and at the same time with simplicity. If they promote it as an actor, they will go far. The film is not in the style of the Avengers, but since Panther and his army will also participate in the Infinity War, it is natural for the film to be. The interesting thing is that Marvel didn't want to do a Black Panther story at all, but Bob Iger, the head of the Disney company, insisted on filming, and as he said: ""I think that of all the products that we created, I can't be more proud than ""Black Panther"". That is, in fact, everything that has ever been created by the Disney studio is not worthy of pride? That is, several decades of Disney's work have been in vain? Even somehow it's a shame for the Little Mermaid and Bambi. After all, the Black Panther is not a masterpiece, not blockbuster, but an absolutely ordinary film.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

First and foremost this movie is a superhero backstory movie. I had to keep this in mind because I was distracted and put off by poorly written, undeveloped sub-themes. As much as it presented itself as African proud, a hidden culture built on science, technology and the idea of supercities, cloaked under rural Africa, there were constant failed attempts to connect these characters to the American Black experience, so much so they lost track of their own backstory. For example, toward the end of the movie there is a moment when a sympathetic villain thinks he is about to die and he defiantly says, something to the effect of, ""throw me into the ocean as so many of my ancestors chose to die rather than to live in bondage!"" This character's ancestors were never enslaved and shipped to America, his father went from a palace to America as a spy, and, he himself was an offspring of an aristocratic super society. So I hope you won't be distracted, as I was, from the driving force of the film which is the rise of a superhero, a celebration of heroism, strength and justice - the anthem of superheros. I believe there is inspiration in seeing people, who look like you, behaving nobly, and, so, I am glad to see a movie with a talented black cast telling super human stories. The acting was good, the CGI was spectacular as were the action scenes. The cast had many superstars, (British Martin Freeman, our token white person, playing a rough, tough CIA operative was remarkably convincing). I enjoyed the action adventure of the movie and the world it created. Beautiful people, beautiful production, adventure, action, inconsistent writing - but, on rewatching, despite the Oscar nod for best picture, I can only give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But the rest of the politics are shaky and the story and beats plain, and I still maintain that killing instead of uniting with Kilmonger feels like the wrong move.It's a shaky film in parts and rereads a lot of old ground.

The storyline focuses on an African civilization that has kept itself isolated from the world and contains unique disciplines, scientific and societal advancements within their establishment. When an entitled young man with a troubled past has a different way he feels those virtues should be applied to the civilization's way of life, he decides to disrupt their equilibrium and take charge. Can the chosen king of the African civilization emerge and stop him? This movie is directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed) and stars Chadwick Boseman (42), Michael B. Jordan (Just Mercy), Lupita Nyong'o (Us), Angela Bassett (Vampire in Brooklyn), Forest Whitaker (Last King of Scotland) and Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out). The storyline for this has a lot of depth on social and perception issues. I really enjoyed the depiction of the female's strength and their lack of backing down for what's right. They were probably the best part of the movie. The backdrops and special effects were out of this world. The supporting cast with the various subplots were very well done. This picture was executed in a very thorough fashion, whether it was the outstanding fight sequences, issues that need to be overcome, or how their fictitious perceptions of society is something our society badly needs. Overall this is an outstanding movie, especially for being a super hero film, and I can't wait for a sequel. My only complaint was how weak Black Panther was as a super hero, but that is nitpicking. I'd score this an easy 9/10.","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

To make things worse, Wakanda adopts isolationist tactics to hide a precious metal called Vibranium that makes this African country technologically superior. Can T'Challa continue to rule this country from outsiders (and insiders too) and keep Vibranium from the world?Chadwick Boseman triumphs as T'Challa; his portrayal isn't as transformative as his previous works (Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and Thurgood Marshall), but it's intelligent and competent. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and Angela Bassett provide great comic relief and a substantial amount of substance and power in this movie. Michael B. Jordan plays a strong villain with a valid reason. The director, Ryan Coogler, emphasizes his concerns and priorities ranging from isolationism, oppression, aiding strangers, and acceptance of African and African-American experiences. Also, there's some sick beats in this movie (da-dum da-dum DOOM WUBWUBWUB WOMP tshh).Pacing structure is odd (or does the film have a structural problem in Act One). By odd, I mean, the first act of the film (so the first thirty minutes) relies on a lot foreshadowing and world-building which is a hindrance. Mainly, a hindrance because these narrative elements complicate the plot. It's great to watch a Marvel movie with a complex plot, but it removes the fun and becomes serious (that may confuse the family friendly demographic, specifically children).Additionally, the film drags in the middle and the end. In the end, CGI consumes the fight scenes making the film less intense and becomes hard to cheer for a character in a CGI suit that fights less like a human and more akin to a cartoon. Finally, some moments feel similar to ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" (maybe I'm the only person who experienced that feeling). Although I have objections, their minor and finicky, shouldn't thwart a satisfying movie experience.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It wove these issues into the motivation for our antagonist, who joins the ranks of a new breed of villain in cinema; a villain who the audience can relate to.

Speaking of the MCU connection... THERE WAS NONE .
This sits as an island of CG phantasm to someone's ego and is NOT the Black Panther I knew well in Lee's fantasy realm of comic stories.
No background ever given to support the absurdist fantasyland, and no REAL story beyond...""We need help - Call this guy"" . THAT was the weakest part... No sustainable story line so it was hard for the characters to ever emotionally develop or connection.... just rubber suit flexing for 2 hours.
Expected so much more. That Guardians of the Galaxy is still rated King of all the MCU productions... not just in attendance and financial success.... but in pure Lee Production and being true to the Legendary MCU characters.

This is just the only Marvel movie (probably one of the few that exist, period) with a primarily black cast. Honestly, the creative and innovative combinations of tribal, traditional and modern costume/architecture rates high in my book. Great cast, great characters and a villain with an understandable motive. Is it over the top action, sci-fi technology? Yeah, but damn isn't that what we want from our superhero movies?Bottom line, if you like the superhero movie trend and aren't totally racist this movie will appeal to you.

Well, the story is pretty standard and cliche for superhero movies. I can say that the ending in accordance with most audiences. Introduction to some characters recognition has deficiencies in the introduction and thus affecting the presence and impact of this film plot, but not all of it.one of the things that impressed me so much about this movie was the musical score. Background music in some scenes uses music and instruments typically from African culture. Color patterns in costumes and places are very diverse and pamper the eyes. Wakanda's depiction is presented with great CGI and some very futuristic technology. The production design that is very different from previous Marvel films and carries African culture as its main theme. As well as the acting of some main characters are incredible. I was very impressed with Michael B. Jordan's acting as Erik Killmonger. In this film, Erik is described as very evil, cunning and intelligent but can steal the attention of the audience.Overall, this movie is my recommendation if you want to watch a different movie superhero, in terms of themes, production design and music score.","2 out of 15 found this helpful.

I found it extremely refreshing how the movie is based on the theme of colonialism. Yes it may be more politically charged than other marvel movies but surely it's just exploring what has happened/been happening. Superhero's can be black, Asian, minorities- this movies gives so many children around the world the freedom of imagination and I am so happy for it.

I did not understand the reason for the presence of some characters 
2. The fight scenes are not spectacular or anyway near that. One shot is broken several times. I expected somersaults and panther like moves but not much came. There is even some ufc style of combat which brings us back to the point above. If research was done The writers would have known of the folk wrestling done by the Serer people in Senegal
3. The Production design was not applicable to this movie. Yes the Wakandans were extremely technologically advanced but i failed to consistently notice the African feel as it was overshadowed by western designs

Ryan Coogler seems to be good at recycling the most typical structure of a marvel superhero movie because he really missed a huge opportunity to make a good fun action packed flick. What we got instead was a boring, typical, overly technological and overly political deus ex machina fest of an attempt to make a marvel movie.Boring characters plague this movie. The main character played by Boseman is really really boring and his ""son of a king"" arc can be found in any other similar character. Its really boring to see. Michael Jordan is the exaggerated villain who is bad cause being bad is bad and he is bad and revenge and badness. We really shouldn't judge a movie based on how much we agree with its politics. Any movie that should not be political that is lowers the quality of its own story by pandering to one particular mindset.The cgi was at times too much and too bad for its own good. Technology is used very cheaply to get characters we are supposed to love out of sticky, impossible to survive situations and its really pathetic.Typical, boring and overly political for a superhero movie

The movie is better than Age of Ultron, GOTG2, and probably the same way I view Civil War in terms of score.The problem is the music was terrible, the CGI was blatant, and the movie lacked beautiful women. Believe it or not, bald women are not beautiful. Where were the models and thick women and so on. This felt like a feminist, SJW wet dream.The message was whites are bad and Blacks are victims. Blacks have lost, not because of low IQ or lack of ability, but the man. What a terrible message.The movie is basically egging on Blacks to commit crimes in a false belief that Wakanda is a real place and if you cannot find it, it is because the man took it from you.The movie besides poor music and lacking beauty, it was missing a transition. One moment someone is fighting, the next sad. One moment a character has motivation then it magically disappears. Why was the Black Panther saved? Why was the King betrayed? Why, why why?Of course, all the men must be femsplained and talked down to. This is a terrible movie in terms of ideology, terrible for men as it makes men seems weak while empowering women to talk down to them.If a man slaps a lion, the lion kills. If a woman slaps a man...............This movie is not great, but not awful or bad. It's a 5 to a 6.

This was evident in several recent moments, especially in the awards season when some campaigns appeared as #OscarSoWhite and #PayMeToo.
In this scenario, the world of comics came to the forefront and Marvel released, in 2018, box office and critical success Black Panther.
With an outnumbered black cast, as well as in the technical categories, as costume designer and in the soundtrack, Black Panther, based on Marvel's superhero comic book universe, brings the fight of the new king of Wakanda, a fictional country tucked away on the African continent, T'Challa, played by actor Chadwick Boseman, to protect his people and, of course, Vibranium technology from villain Ulysses Klaue and Killmonger.
The film also stars the Oscar-winning actress Lupita N'yong as the warrior and romantic interest of the king, Nakia. Interpreting Okoye, captain of the Dora Milaje, army of Wakanda, we have the great Danai Gurira, famous for his participation in TV series, The Walking Dead.
In the film, Ulysses tries to invade Wakanda to steal Vibranium technology, for which he relies on the other villain, Killmonger, masterfully interpreted by Michael B. Jordan, actor of Creed.
The theft of Vibranium - which occurs in the past, outside the screens - is a central point of the plot. The consequences of this act modify the lives of T'Challa and Killmonger and shake out Wakanda.
While seeking to defend his kingdom, T'Challa discovers that he is a cousin of Killmonger and this one challenges him to a fight where the throne of Wakanda is at stake. In the face of this, a civil war can destroy Wakanda and there is still time for the family plot of Killmonger and T'Challa.
The film broke down barriers to being nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, the first film nomination for a superhero movie. And as if that were not enough, he gave the two black women the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction, technical categories never before won by black women. It also took the statuette of the best Original Soundtrack.
Fans of superhero T'Challa await a sequel already confirmed by Marvel. It's more an industry film, but it's a great one. It gave us diversity, equality and excellent action scenes.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And as a result, an unprecedented box office and even Oscar nominations, which, in my purely personal opinion, is absolutely undeserved.We were introduced to the Panther in the movie about Captain America. It turned out well. In the same film, the character is revealed, introduced to his country. The creators perfectly showed how wonderful the world of Wakanda is from a technological point of view, the main question is raised - the openness of achievements to the rest of the world. Everyone will draw their own parallel, but I saw the message that it is impossible to hide from the world what can help it become more modern and progressive. However, we must not forget that any technology can become a weapon for the destruction of the masses in the wrong hands.On the other hand, the whole film does not leave the feeling that it was created to order, it follows the fashion in terms of hype on racial tolerance. Here is a fashionable soundtrack of rap artists' compositions, showing that the black population is no worse than the white one. Yes, people already know that. It has long been proven that skin color does not matter. But now it's fashionable to discuss it and make films about African heroes has also become fashionable.The fundamentals of undeserved success are clearly visible: the laudatory odes of critics, fashionable tolerance. I am absolutely fine with all people. We are all equal, but when a film does not shine with a plot, and an ordinary villain is called the best in the film universe, then you involuntarily begin to dislike the presented material even more.The hero of Tchalla is different from himself in ""Citizen"". There he was shown to one, here to a completely different one. He is different and it catches your eye when you don't see the wild rage that was, perseverance and zeal. In the solo album, there is a certain attempt to show the drama, the formation of a hero. It is understandable. That's what the film was created for. But in the end, the overall picture is somewhat ragged, and the main character causes nothing but boredom. Just like the main villain.Visually, the film is good. Beautiful frames, the splendor of color saturation. Especially in the world where the main character got and saw his father. The sound is excellent, the operator's work is excellent. But all this fades anyway, since the plot is not memorable, which once again suggests to me that this film was created on the wave of fashion, in an attempt to catch up with its billion (which definitely succeeded), and the film is hacky. It was made quickly, thoughtlessly, not impressive.Well, his fabulous Oscar nominations ... is this really the film that became the FIRST nominee from superheroics for Best Film? What? Where is the Dark Knight who could really deserve a nomination? It's all frustrating. Like Marvel with a similar project.The result for me is a passing movie. The film that I put in the last place among all the films of the cinematic universe. It's for one time. The characters were not impressed, as was the story itself.6 out of 10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film turned out to be great. Stunning visually, sexy and with complex relevant themes. There were some beautiful cultural references in costumes, traditions etc. All characters are fascinating and versatile. While not all the characters are portrayed as comics intended all the characters apart from one - M'Baku were played exceptionally.
But my main praise goes to outstanding black female characters in the movie and actresses portraying them! Not only do they outshine male counterparts they outshine Wonder Woman movie character thousandfold. In my opinion that is. Many great characters but my favorite are Okoye and Killmonger. Well done Marvel!I am hoping that this film will help to invigorate and expand a little stagnant, narrow and outdated range of white-mostly movies and boring and narrow-minded characterizations through clichés and stereotyping to create more culturally varied characters and movies.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Decent enough deviation from Marvel formula.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4065677/?ref_=tt_urv","breheneyjames","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66043521/?ref_=tt_urv","17 February 2018","'Black Panther' is co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa aka Black Panther, the title character. Following 'Captain America: Civil War', T'Challa returns to his home of Wakanda, a secret technologically advanced nation. Given his Father's demise in 'Civil War' he is to take his rightful place as King of Wakanda until unexpected adversaries surface which threaten not only his place on the throne but the fate of Wakanda itself. For the most part 'Black Panther' is fun, exciting and sometimes even funny and features excellent performances from a terrific ensemble cast. However, it is not without its problems which for me prevent it from being a top tier MCU entry. First of all it seems in an attempt to side step the very well known villain problem in the MCU, director Coogler has actually shot himself in the foot and created one the most irritating and drab villains in this universe namely Eric Kilmonger. Michael B Jordan's performance as Kilmonger doesn't help either which is over done and at times a harbinger of cringe. The fault of this character is also due in part to the screenplay which leaves him out of it for almost an hour after his introduction. Honestly after his first scene had passed I completely forgot about him and was almost lead to believe that Klau (Andy Serkis) was the main antagonist of the film. Despite his motivations being more understandable than most mustache twirling villains in the MCU, the execution of the character is rather disappointing and a big misfire.Now that the glaring problem is out of the way there are also some minor issues worthy of mention. The CGI looks unfinished in some places particularly in the big action set pieces toward the end. At one point Black Panther and Kilmonger look like video game creations when they fighting in mid air. This probably sounds like I am trashing this film but I actually do like it quite a bit overall, I just felt it necessary to point out the wildly obvious missteps that a lot of people seem to be missing or blissfully ignoring. For example, Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's tech wizard sister, is a revelation not only as comic relief but as vital character to much of the film's plot. Lupita N'yongo also does good work here as T'Challa's love interest. Chadwick Boseman impresses again as T'challa, following on from his small but standout role in 'Civil War', proving a very charasmatic lead. Andy Serkis is also great here looking like he's having all the fun in the world and stealing every scene he's in reprising his character from 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. So all in all 'Black Panther' is a decent upper mid tier entry in the MCU with some issues that prevent it from being one of the best that this universe has to offer.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Virtually the only white people in ""Black Panther"" are the Hobbit/LOTR stars Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis.... they are the Tolkein white guys! It's actually getting to feel quite isolating as an 'average white guy' at the movies! After a plethora of #SheDo films about empowered women, now comes the first black-centred Marvel film... stuffed full of powerful women too!The setting is the hidden African kingdom of Wakanda, where due to an abundance of a an all-powerful mineral called McGuffinite... so, sorry, Vibranium... the leaders have made their city a technological marvel and developed all sorts of ad tech to help the people keep their goats well and weave their baskets better (there are a few odd scenes in this film!). T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) succeeds his father T'Chaka (John Kani) to become the king and adopt the role of The Black Panther, being bestowed superhero powers by drinking a glass of Ribena.But it emerges that T'Chaka has a dark secret in the form of Eric Killmonger (Michael B Jordan, ""Creed"") who is determined to muscle in on the king-stuff. 'It never rains but it pours', and the whole of Wakanda's secrets are in danger of being exposed by the antics of the vicious South African mercenary Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis, ""War For The Planet Of The Apes""), trying to get his hands on vibranium to sell on to CIA operative Everett Ross (Martin Freeman, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"", ""The World's End"").After ""Thor: Ragnarok"", this is back to the more seriously-played end of the superhero spectrum: there are a few jokes but it's not overtly played for comedy. Holding the film together are some sterling performances from the ensemble cast with Michael B Jordan very good as the villain of the piece. Adding to the significant black girl power in the film are Angela Bassett (""London Has Fallen"") as the queen mother; Danai Gurira (""Wonder Woman"") as the leader of the Dora Milaje: the all-female king's guard; and Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years a Slave"", ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") as the spy and love interest Nakia. But the star performance for me, and one I found absolutely spot-on as a role model for young people, was Letitia Wright (""The Commuter"") as Shuri, the king's chief scientist. She is absolutely radiant, adding beauty, rude gestures and energy to every scene she is in.On the white side of the shop Andy Serkis has enormous fun as Klaue and I really wanted to see more of his character than I did. Martin Freeman feels rather lightweight and under-used, and I couldn't quite get past his dodgy American accent.In terms of storyline, the film is a hotch-potch of plots from multiple other films, with ""The Lion King"" featuring strongly (but almost in reverse!). But that's no crime, when the Shakespearean-style narrative is good, and interpolating the strongly emotional story into the Marvel universe works well.Where I felt a little uncomfortable is the element of racism - that is, racism *against* white people - reflected in the story. If there was a movie plot centred (basically) on the topic of whites killing blacks and taking control of every black-controlled country in the world (yes, I know, I'm British and we have historically been there!) then there would be justified uproar, and the film would be shunned.In the technical department, I had real problems with some of the effects employed. Starting with a dodgy 'aircraft' shadow, things nose-dive with an astonishingly poor waterfall scene with Forest Whitaker (""Rogue One"", ""Arrival"") as Zuri, green-screened against some Disneyworld cascades and hundreds of cut and pasted tribesmen randomly inserted onto the cliffs. Almost matching that is a studio-set scene in a jungle clearing, where if feels they could hardly have bothered to take the plants out of their pots. Think ""Daktari"" quality (kids, ask your parents/grandparents).But overall, the film, directed by Ryan Coogler (""Creed""), is a high-energy and uniquely different take on Marvel that absolutely pays off. And it is without doubt an important movie in moving the black agenda forward into properly mainstream cinema.(For the full graphical review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks).","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was suspecting the same routine that the previous films that we have seen, not to say that it's bad as I love Marvel regardless but it's director Ryan Coogler (Creed) has managed to bring a fresh coat of paint to the storytelling of the movie whilst delivering a style that is unique and beautiful.Firstly, the choice of the film's direction is great and promises to set new paths and future stories, but it's the tone of the film that showcases the race of black people as a culture that is unique and often referencing the racial issues that occur in reality but while being a superhero movie.
The acting cast are all strong, both the male and female roles in this film are used well, in particular with its villain Marvel have finally given us a villain that not only has a backstory but serves great as a threat with a purpose and isn't wasted at all. Michael B. Jordan (who had shined in Creed) plays this part with perfection and not since Spider-Man Homecoming have I seen a great villain to actually care for.Overall, Black Panther is a great entry in the MCU and it's one of the best films in the top 10 of the franchise as a whole. A strong director, solid performances, well written script, visually stunning style, great music score and great character development make the film a worthwhile treat for the fans and even the African American culture.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Simply put, it's visually spectacular, but I had trouble connecting with the main characters. The dynamics were well intended, but it felt a little forced. The fight scenes great, the music/soundtrack AMAZING!! It took me about a good hour to get into the plot. Once the stakes are risen (near the end of the film/last act) then I was all in. But it took a vested interest. The music, action sequences, and stunning visuals forgive the parts where the plot falls short. But I can't help but think it may have been intentional direction to sort of restructure the typical Hollywood formula. I'm all for doing things different, but in this case, the plot fell a little flat, until the end (where it revs up 110%). Overall it's a solid film and worth the watch. Just don't give up on it, because it really does get good, and there is a big payoff in the end.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was hesitant to buy all the hype, because I thought that people liked this movie only because it was the first black main character in the MCU and one of few blockbusters to take place in Africa. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by a dynamic and compelling film with layered themes and intriguing characters that largely sets itself apart from most superhero films. Ryan Coogler, who directs this film brilliantly as expected, creates a fascinating world for the story that is both cultural and innovative. The script is also fantastic, with a concise plot structure and good dialogue. The script establishes complex characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and who all are simply fighting for what they feel is right. What this film accomplishes most impressively is the main conflict between T'Challa and the main villain Killmonger. I was very mad reading reviews that criticized the villain, saying that ""we need to hate the villain, or else we won't root for the hero."" But what this does is create two-dimensional characters and a boring, by the numbers conflict based off simplistic good vs evil. Instead, by providing a sympathetic character with motives we understand and a hero who's flawed, we're simply seeing two human beings in an ideological conflict, similar to the relationship between Joker and Batman in The Dark Knight. Personally, I think this was a great film that I consider one of the best MCU movies I've seen so far (comparible to Civil War, Thor:Ragnarok and the first Guardians of the Galaxy), with compelling characters, brilliant acting and well-executed action scenes. Definitely worth a watch.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"","","non spoiler review of black panther","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4063461/?ref_=tt_urv","Darksidecrew","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2865589/?ref_=tt_urv","15 February 2018","Black Panther (2018, Ryan Coogler)We first saw the African superhero 'Black Panther' in Captain America: Civil War and now we see him on his home turf and find out about the origins and history of the royal hero. The film itself is very afrocentric with a great and mostly black cast including Czhadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett as well as a a host of lesser known young talent. I was surprised to feel shades of a James Bond style adventure for the first act before it moved to something else but I did enjoy that while it lasted.One of the many things I like about this film is the tone as it deals with some pretty relevant and serious racial subject matter with respect and class. Also, where as many of the more recent Marvel films have gone for a more slapstick and one-liners approach, this film uses a more natural humour that does not take you out of the film but enhances it. It has a strong script that fleshes out a lot of the characters and makes their motivations believable and clear even when in unbelievable settings. At no stage are anyone's actions leaving you scratching your head and it is the strength of the script, characters and acting that helps one overlook the films few shortcomings.Where the film falters is in the action sequences and cgi. A lot of the special effects look unfinished or as if they might've been done ten or more years ago. The wardrobe design is excellent but some of the vehicle design could have been better. The worst offender for me though was the combat sequences which were often dark, overly edited and shaky. I was surprised at this because the director's boxing work on his film Creed (2015) was some of the best I have seen but here it was a mess. However the belief in the characters and what they are fighting for can still make you invested in these scenes despite their unpleasant presentation.All in all, I think this was a home-run for Marvel, yet again doing a great job with one of their lesser known comic book properties. I expect this film to do big business world wide and should please most as it feels like a real film, with real characters and stakes and not just disposable popcorn entertainment. It is a shame some of the special effects feel so rushed but I guess deadlines have to be met to keep the MCU juggernaut moving along and quality control will suffer here and there.7-7.5/10","2 out of 15 found this helpful.

""Black Panther"" also has an African-American director, African-American writers, African-American musicians and many other African-American creative decision-makers and artists behind the scenes. That level of representation for African-American artists working on a major film is still, to the frustration of many, notable.The movie industry is deeply racist, structurally racist. The film industry has often justified under-representing African-Americans by saying that movies featuring black casts don't perform as well at the box office, but Robinson doesn't buy that argument.It is not about the economics. It is about a system that has been largely impenetrable for creatives of color. But I think that that is changing. I think that 'Black Panther' represents a real - not just a wake-up call, but for an industry that has been really struggling economically - a pathway.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

 I didn't have anywhere to go, but generally it did.

"7","/10","A culturally important film, but a fairly paint-by-numbers MCU film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4063805/?ref_=tt_urv","regula1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37920803/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2018","We finally get a peek behind the curtain at the mythical Wakanda, a nation and its protector the Black Panther, that have been hinted at and built up since Age of Ultron (or even earlier, if you count the Easter egg in Iron Man 2), and while this film does not fail to provide us with great action scenes and vibrant culture scenes, as well as probably the most interesting Marvel villain since Loki in Killmonger, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed.Don't get me wrong: every scene with Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa is near perfect, both inside the Black Panther suit and out.His story in this film picks up a short time after the events of Captain America: Civil War, where his father King T'Chaka was killed in Vienna, and T'Challa must ascend to the throne of Wakanda. But, other forces are pushing him in a darker direction, and he must choose what kind of a king he must be.The film shines whenever we get to see T'Challa interact with his fellow cast members. Whether it be with Forrest Whittaker's character, Zuri, an elder statesman and friend of T'Chaka, or T'Challa's sister Shuri, played beautifully by Letitia Wright, Chadwick Boseman seems to have good chemistry with just about everyone.The film also boasts a great villain in Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. While his performance may feel only a hair more than one-note, his character development and motivations are some of the most compelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Much like Loki, the conflict derives from a family connection. Unlike Loki, his cause is something you can actually see yourself supporting to some degree.Where this film falters, at least in my view, is in the seeming lack of character development in almost anyone else in the film. Aside from T'Challa, his friend and ex-lover Nakia, played by Lupita Nyong'o, is the only one who has an easily identifiable character arc. Everyone else seems to stay in their own little bubbles, which is fine for some, but those who probably should have developed but didn't is a little frustrating.Also lacking is the seeming paint-by-numbers of the whole thing. The action scenes are impressive and there are the occasional jokes that land almost always, but it just feels a little too self-serious in its delivery, and when it tries to be light-hearted or semi-silly (mainly the scenes with Andy Serkis's Ulysses Klaue) it's jarring to say the least, mostly because it feels very forced.Nevertheless, this film is without a doubt a culturally important film, and true to form the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to produce a truly bad film. However, I still rank Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man ahead of this one.","1 out of 13 found this helpful.

At least it shall be one of my favorites. ""Black Panther"" transcends the superhero movie genera that thrills and touches our souls. ""Black Panther"" is beautiful to behold with the majestic African landscape and seamlessly generated images of the futuristic culture of Wakanda literally hidden from the rest of the world. The screen astounds in tragic physical battles or the shiny Lexus's racing through the night streets in Korea. Ryan along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole create inspired conversations of the sacrifices of becoming greater, forgiveness of betrayal, forsaking utopian isolationism for the greater good. ""Black Panther"" is the culture phenomenon. ""Black Panther"" tells the timeless tale of the Hero and the defining other. Chadwick Boseman is magnificent as T'Challa, who becomes the legendary Black Panther. T'Challa succeeds his murdered Father T'Chaka, played by John Kani, as King of Wakanda. Strikingly handsome Chadwick embodies grace and elegant swag. He distinguishes the hero in his action, his words, and in the power of his tears. Michael B. Jordan plays mercenary ex-CIA operative Eric Killmonger, who defines T'Challa, the Black Panther. Michael is powerful as the suffering villain Eric. In Ryan's narrative and Michael's soulful being, we can't dismiss Eric as mere villain. He's human, too. Like T'Challa, Eric is both lightness and darkness. We all are. Eric's tremendous rage sources from his unforgiving past. T'Challa realizes Eric horrific betrayal. In T'Challa's ""vision quest"", he confronts his Father. He cries, ""We were wrong!"" T'Challa perhaps is the greater man. His Father's words, ""And it's hard for a good man to be king.""- become his paradox. Eric's suffering robbed him of compassion. Though his noble purpose is equality for all. Even the villain is not all darkness. ""Black Panther"" is eloquent resolution of the ideologies of T'Challa and Eric, each valuing courage and dignity in their own ways. Chadwick and Michael's conflict profoundly move us. T'Challa's tears touched my soul. In the ""Black Panther"" mythology, Wakanda emerged when a meteor of made of Vibranium, the hardest metal known, crashes in Africa. Vibranium allowed the people of Wakanda to develop breakthrough technology, becoming the most advanced culture on Earth. Unbeknownst to everyone else. Wakanda is composed of five united tribes lead by the mythical Black Panther. The Black Panther is from the lineage of Kings, who with the serum of the indigenous plant possess great strength, speed, and agility. T'Challa is the next Black Panther. His mother is nurturing Ramonda, played by strong Angela Bassett, who believes he shall be the great King. His sister is genius scientist Shuri, whimsically brilliant Letita Wright. Letita is the scene stealing star. Shuri is like T'Challa's ""Q"" creating the kinetic energy suit he wears among other weaponry. His ex-lover Nakia, played by strong beautiful Lupita Nyongo, is the spy gathering intelligence on the outside world. Amazing Danai Guria plays General Okoye, the powerful warrior guarding the Royal Family. Arms dealer Ulysses Klaue, played by ruthless Andy Serkis, steals Vibranium threatening the revelation of Wakanda and its secrets. Eric is Klaue's mission leader. Klaue seemingly reveals the singluar narrative frailty. He is without nuance almost caricature. He serves as the plot device tying in charismatic Eric. ""Black Panther"" mesmerizes in stunning vibrant visual displays and the inspired battles of T'Challa and Eric. Ryan's words and story resonate. Nakia tells T'Challa, ""Only you can decide what kind of king you want to be."" What kind of person will you be? Who will you become? That inspired to make me to look within as well.That's what is so special about ""Black Panther"". ""Black Panther"" dares you to choose the greater than path, becoming greater than you know yourself to be. To create and live in that greater space. And the world will be greater for it.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

I rejected watching this movie since it was released in the theatre mainly because I didn't see the appeal.I really didn't know anything about the Black Panther character and eventually decided I would give it a chance. Mainly because I read countless positive reviews, it was a smash success at the box office and then got an Oscar nomination for best picture (well that and the fact that there was nothing on Netflix that appealed to me) . Ok...I figured I have to see what this movie is all about. I couldn't even get through an hour of this film. How could it possibly gross over 1.1 billion dollars!? I'm absolutely dumbfounded that this train wreck of a movie surpassed it's $200+ million dollar production budget in the first place. This is the first Marvel movie that I can truly say I hated.The movie itself is dull, the storyline is ridiculous, non-stop CGI.....I fast forwarded to the end of the movie to see what it was all building up to.....A whole lot of nothing. Marvel movies were almost always guaranteed to be a hit. I personally have found that since the original Avengers came out, the writers/production teams have been taking shortcuts. The Marvel machine already has a dedicated army of fans that support anything they make so they throw out the ""quality"" in lieu of ""quantity"", it's extremely disappointing when good things reverse their priorities like this. An empire should be built with masterpiece after masterpiece otherwise it will eventually fall....you can only churn out garbage like this movie for so long before fizzling out.Please, don't waste your time watching this.","52 out of 114 found this helpful.

It's got some terrific action; that trademark Marvel superhero comedy spice; and a surprisingly relatable and charismatic villain. 'Black Panther' fell short in other areas though - the acting in general was strange: rarely bad, but often stiff, forced, or very unconvincing, which became even more obvious when the dialogue was at its weakest. It would have served the movie better if the characters spoke in their native language, as it would have removed some of the stilted vibes from the dialogue. Beyond that, the CGI was generally hit-or-miss; Wakanda was disappointing from both a visual and logical standpoint, and many of the jokes were cringe-inducing. Michael B. Jordan deserves a special mention though for his amazingly magnetic performance as Killmonger.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Exceeded expectations with very few flaws. Definitely one of my favourite Marvel films.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4061865/?ref_=tt_urv","chestern-80136","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur83651465/?ref_=tt_urv","13 February 2018","I am a big comic fan. Both in the literal sense of my stature and weight, and in the extent in which I enjoy the medium. I rarely actually find time to read comics, despite having no real job or any other vacuum of time. Still, I can remember when I was younger and my attention span hadn't been eroded into nothingness. Back then, I had many favourite characters. There was the classics like Spider-Man, and the more niche choices such as Moon Knight. Somewhere in the middle was King T'Challa, or the Black Panther if you would prefer. I won't go the full route of claiming that, since I am of mixed race, a character of a racial minority helped guide me and give me confidence, acting as my sole role-model. Still, though, it was quite interesting as a child seeing the other half of what I came from. Granted, my great-grandfather was Jamaican, but the concept remains the same. I don't believe there is a mixed race superhero (though do please correct me if I'm wrong) but I also don't really need one. When I heard that Black Panther movie was announced, I quickly became nervous. Obviously, I was elated that one of my childhood favourites would finally be getting a big-screen adaptation. Still, I was worried that the film would push politics into my semi-developed brain. Recently, there's been quite the surge of people demanding representation. Obviously, this should happen. Black people exist, and they should be shown in film. The same goes for everyone else, regardless of race, gender etc. Personally, however, I feel this has come at the expense of quality. Finn, the first main black character in Star Wars, is an embarrassment in my mind. While many applauded Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, I feel both her acting, and the film as a whole, were lacking. She simply fits the character well, allowing her to pass semi-believably. I was horribly nervous that Black Panther would be yet another casualty to this. I thought he might abide by all black stereotypes by being loud, emotional and overly aggressive. Much to my relief, this film seemed to understand this, and avoid it.In the comics. T'Challa is a wise and level-headed king. Obviously, in the films, he is currently younger than he is often shown on the page, but these traits are still present. He is dignified and a strong leader, but isn't above enjoying himself every now and then. Unlike many other Marvel protagonists, T'Challa isn't cracking jokes mid-fight. He remains serious, grounded in the severity of the situations he finds himself in. He doesn't seem to find much pleasure in combat, he simply does it because, ultimately, it is often the right thing to do. The villain, on the other hand, is almost the polar opposite. In another film, Killmonger may well end up as the misunderstood Anti-hero protagonist. Here, however, he is treated as well intentioned but ultimately misguided. This is something I can respect. I was truly surprised by this film; I expected the protagonist and antagonist's personalities to be reversed, but I ended up with the film I didn't know I wanted.The characters are quite wonderful. Both T'Challa and his younger sister Shuri are handled wonderfully, and I could actually believe their sibling bond. In fact, Shuri (despite one horribly misplaced attempt at reviving a meme) ended up being one of my favourite characters in the film. She wasn't a stereotypical 'strong and independant woman' character. She was both of those things, but she also had her own flaws and imperfections, separating her from the ranks of Rey and Diana Prince. The writing in addition to Letitia Wright's wonderful performance made for a great character I'd love to see more from. Michael B. Jordan has an odd place in my superhero-oriented mind. I doubt I can forgive him for 'Fant4stic' but his performance in this film almost changed my mind. His character as shown in the trailers looked incredibly forgettable and one-note, but in the film, it's a very different story. I shan't give any spoilers for those who are yet to see it, but I doubt anybody will be left disappointed. It was definitely a direction I hadn't expected both Marvel and Disney to go in, and I'm incredibly pleased by the mature and politically neutral choices.I wasn't really a fan of Martin Freeman's character in Civil War (he was only really there to be in this, despite what his character's name may suggest) and he's perfectly serviceable in this. Honestly, rather ironically, he just seems to be here for diversity, in an attempt to show that not all white people are evil. Himself and Andy Serkis even took to calling themselves the marvellously titled 'Tolkien white boys'. Speaking of Mister Serkis, he seemed to be having an absolute blast. Each scene he was in was packed with energy. Unfortunately, he was horribly underused. I'd love to see him in some future films, as unlikely as it would seem.Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa, as I mentioned previously, was wonderful. I'm now nervous for Infinity War; I fear they may do the character an injustice by showing him too little, or writing him poorly. I do feel I can safely rule out the actor as a problem if anything goes wrong; this performance shows he can carry a film.It's rare that I'd give a whole section of a review to this, but the action was brilliant. The climax of the film was overly busy for my tastes (there was basically three fights going on at once) but each aspect was given a great deal of detail. While I am a novice in the subject, I believe I saw various different forms of martial arts at play during various duels etc. It was pleasant seeing real technique used rather than the classic Marvel method of 'hit him really hard' or 'shoot a laser'. It was also incredibly brutal; there was blood used frequently, and each punch actually looked like it hurt. Towards the end, there was a moment where there really should have been blood, but I feel censorship may have intervened; they probably want as many people to see this film as possible, children included. Personally, I would have rather seen the climax come down to a simple duel to really show off the choreography and talent at play. Nevertheless, the film was thoroughly enjoyable.The music was used incredibly intelligently. From the trailer, I feared it would all simply be rap music. I've nothing against the genre, but it wouldn't fit the comicbook character. To my relief, however, music was used incredibly intelligently. If you know of the musical 'Hamilton' you may understand. Within it, rap mostly follows the titular character, while the character of Aaron Burr is closer to RnB, featuring more vocal talent and soul rather than blisteringly quick verses. A similar technique is used here. T'Challa is accompanied by what I assume is classic African music, while Killmonger is followed by hiphop, fitting their characters brilliantly. Rather ironically, when the more traditional superhero music reared it's head, it was a disappointment. This film probably has the best music of any Marvel film. I'm actually considering buying the album by Kendrick Lamar in order to support the film further.Even from a regular film perspective, I think this film succeeded. The cinematography was gorgeous at times. It occasionally fell into the more standard, dull, static shots, but for the most part, it was great. The visual effects were also, as to be expected, impressive. Much like Iron Man, I found myself longing for a suit of my own. (Any scientists reading, add this to the list. Along with real Pokemon and so on.)There was a few minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, but compared to how I feel about many Disney films nowadays, I feel this film was, to put it simply, a marvel. It might simply be because I am writing this right after seeing it, but this is probably one of my favourite Marvel films period. I daren't give a 10, lest I regret it later, so instead I'll give it a 9.5/10. It was the most fun I've had in a cinema watching a film like this since Logan. I wish to thank Ryan Coogler, the cast and crew for smashing my expectations and restoring some hope in the Marvel franchise. Black Panther is now in cinemas, and I implore you all to watch it. For anyone wondering, there is two end credits scenes. One in the middle, and one at the end.(Completely unrelated, please be quite during a film viewing in the cinema? I appreciate this doesn't apply to 99.99% of you, so thanks, but while I watched this, there was a group of teenage girls behind me. They spoke through the entire film, so I now know which of the cast they'd most like to have sex with. Congratulations, I suppose, Mr. Jordan.)","19 out of 69 found this helpful.

Then again that would not rhyme with Panther anyway. And not you as in you but Chadwick who ... well you'll know what I mean once you've seen the movie. But back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I am really still surprised that people who loathe what Marvel has done, go and watch the movies and just see what they already made up their mind they will get served in the first place.I'd say this has an original take to it. I do understand if you say they feel the same to you. If that is the case, don't bother watching them. Also I'm still surprised there are people out there who still haven't figured out there are stingers at the end of the movie. During and after the credits - stay tuned folks. Now another small incident that I witnessed that occured was when a couple came out of the movie an hour into it and upon me asking them if they were alright, they said they didn't like the movie. Fair enough, we all like different things. Someone else asked them why though ... and their answer was that it was racist and cliche. Two white people claiming to know what black people think? Yep that surely must be the wrong side of ""woke"".Enjoy a movie that is more than just a movie. It was made and became a phenomenon. Now besides the ""Tolkien white guys"" (a joke that was made on set apparently, according to one of the two white guys in the movie, Martin Freeman), this gives us a movie made under the helm of Marvel but creatively they put a lot of trust into their director. And this was something that touched a nerve in the public - rightfully so. Because apart from having a predominantly black cast (and director), this also is a very entertaining and good movie.The movie itself gives us a closer look behind the mythology of the Panther.

It's focused on the titular comic book character who was introduced briefly in 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War"". Building on that set-up, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over for his deceased father as King of the fictional Wakanda and, with the title, inherits the abilities and responsibilities of the Black Panther.It appears that the most technologically advanced country on earth is not the U.S. or any country in Asia, but is that nation in central Africa which has been able to develop incredible technology from a rare metal which is found nowhere else on the planet (which also helps the country to remain hidden from the rest of the world, which assumes Wakanda to be just another Third World nation in Africa). In the midst of their high degree of development, the people maintain their ancient culture and traditions which, in this film, represent a rich array of real-world influences from peoples across the continent. Now that he is the king, T'Challa is responsible for safe-guarding Wakanda's unique capabilities from falling into the hands of evil doers from the outside world. (You know what they say, with great technology comes great responsibility... or something like that.) To do his job, T'Challa sometimes must become the Black Panther and use an impressive array of gadgets developed by his sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), who is best described as MCU's Tony Stark meets James Bond's ""M"". Backing up T'Challa is a formidable army led by female warriors like Okoye (Dania Gurira) and loyal officials like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), a spiritual leader called Zuri (Forest Whitaker) and T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett). T'Challa is going to need help from all of them (as well as from neighboring tribes and even a CIA officer, played by Martin Freeman) if he's going to stand against the likes of the evil Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and the lethal and power-hungry Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).""Black Panther"" is unique and terrifically entertaining. It fits nicely into the MCU canon, but still charts a course all its own. Its hero is every bit as able and impressive as any other MCU character. As in the plot of most superhero movies, lives are in danger and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, but in a new and creative way. The stakes may be the same, but the tone is different - because of the film's Africa-centric setting - but also in the issues raised and the questions asked. Enhancing it all, we get exciting action, terrific visuals and awe-inspiring cinematography, not to mention a fantastic cast which includes several Oscar winners and Oscar nominees. This a Marvel movie through-and-through (complete with Stan Lee cameo and cross-pollinating end-credits scene), but it's one of the most fully-realized and enjoyable MCU cinematic achievements to date.

The film, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of T'Challa, played by Chadwick Boseman, who becomes the king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced and isolated African nation. The film also explores the conflict between T'Challa and his antagonist, Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, who has a different vision for Wakanda's future.One of my personal favorite aspects of the film was the way it depicted the culture and traditions of Wakanda, it was really fascinating to see the blend of technology and tradition in the film's setting. The performances by the cast were also fantastic, Boseman, Jordan, and Lupita Nyong'o as T'Challa's love interest, Nakia, all gave strong performances. The film also had an amazing soundtrack that added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.However, I found the pacing to be a bit uneven at times, and some of the subplots felt a bit unnecessary and detracted from the main story. Additionally, while the film's representation of a primarily black cast and crew was groundbreaking and important, it felt at times that it was at the expense of a fully fleshed out plot and characters.Overall, Black Panther is a film that is both thought-provoking and entertaining. It offers a fresh and exciting take on the superhero genre, and it's a film that is not only a must-watch for fans of the genre but for everyone. The film's representation of a primarily black cast and crew, the stunning visuals and the powerful performances make it a cinematic experience worth watching.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie is no more political or controversial than any other movie shown in a theater over the last half century. The dialog is often thought provoking and may generate some discussion because it acknowledges some of the world's social issues. It is action-packed and mostly family friendly. The fight scenes are typical for super hero films and the CGI is pretty good. Women and many other minorities have significant screen time and major roles in the development of the plot. The lead actors stars give the supporting cast room to share the spotlight. I highly recommend all DC and Marvel fans to see this movie and incorporate it into the debates and discussions about super heroes and villains. I expect many of these stars to show up again on the silver screen soon.","10 out of 32 found this helpful.

In the isolated, technologically-advanced African country of Wakanda, T'Challa is preparing to follow in his late father's footsteps as king. When the precious metal called vibranium, Wakanda's life-force, is stolen by a shady man who goes by the name Killmonger, working in conjunction with smuggler Ulysses Klaue, T'Challa jumps into action as the Black Panther, aided by his sister Shuri, ex-lover/spy Nakia, and Okoye of the all-female Dora Milaje. With the help of American agent Everett Ross, the Black Panther and his team set out to fight Killmonger and prove their worth in leading the Wakandan kingdom.Director Ryan Coogler brings to the forefront a standalone story more mature than any other in the Marvel canon. The screenplay, co-written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, touches on such themes as responsibility, betrayal, tribalism, and ultimately, manhood, with self-discovery as the most significant in T'Challa's quest to become king of Wakanda. This being the first Marvel movie to feature a predominantly African-American cast, the filmmakers maintain a clear focus on and respect for African identity, right down to the use of the Igbo and Xhosa languages. Wakanda itself is established as a vibrant blend of the modern and the traditional, thanks in part to its use of vibranium, with the urban areas resembling a bustling town square while the more mountainous sections are where the ancient tribes reside. Great emphasis is also placed on the all-female Dora Milaje soldiers as a major component to the film's success, with T'Challa's sister Shuri providing the necessary tools, and Nakia and Okoye of Wakanda's Dora Milaje putting their combative skills to good use. This is also exemplified in Ruth Carter's costumes, with the city civilians wearing chic clothes, whereas the tribe members are all draped in traditional fabrics and the soldiers wear armor, all of which are brimming with color. The ritual duels in Wakanda are choreographed to resemble a cross between wrestling and gladiatorial fights.Chadwick Boseman makes for an ideal heroic lead as T'Challa/Black Panther, while Michael B. Jordan, the primary player in Coogler's filmography, provides a blend of charisma, intensity, and sympathy in his antagonistic role of Killmonger. It is Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Guirra, however, who also provide the film's backbone, as the lead female players, while also exemplifying three-dimensional sensitivity and depth. Martin Freeman provides light touches of humor as Everett, while Andy Serkis sinks his teeth into the cold, calculated, and aptly-named Klaue. This cast is further strengthened by supporting players Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker. The musical accompaniment includes Ludwig Goransson's score blending orchestral prowess with African tribal chants and hip-hop beats, along with original songs provided by acclaimed artist Kendrick Lamar.""Black Panther"" proves to be a Marvel movie of significant impact while also being a unique standalone entry in their hugely successful cinematic universe. Wakanda forever!","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I will be honest here, is not one of my favorite Marvel movie of all time, in fact, I think that has more problems than the majority of them. First the great things about it, everyone is talking about, but I have to say: Michael B. Jordan is fantastic on the movie, is definitely one of the best MCU villains by far (he doesn't have that much of a competition, but is ok). You understand his character, you buy his motivation, sometimes you even think that he has a better point than the real hero (even though he is a murderer and etc). I love the character, and the way that the movie builds him.The soundtrack is really good to. I love the ""world-building"" of Wakanda, you also buy what they say, that is almost an alien country that was here the whole time. Almost all the Wakanda character are good, you like them (T'Challa's sister, the Doramilages, even T'Challa himself). Buut, some aspects does not work, like T'Challa, I don't know man, I just can't like that much about him, I don't know if is the performance (Chadwick Boseman is not the most charismatic person in the world), I just really don't give that much s**t about him (in fact, Michael B. Jordan character is much more likeable). The fight scenes are also a big issue that I have with the movie, most of them are with really really short lights, and you almost doesn't see anything, the cuts also are very brusque, just the Cassino scene doesn't have that issue. The CGI is also something that bother me a lot, there so much in it! (And when I say that, I know that the majority of the superhero movies have that, but the thing is, that when they are good, you just don't notice - like the first Avengers) But here, my god, the final fight is almost like a big budget video game cutscene (and is also very dark again).Well, in short, even though Black Panther isn't the greatest superhero movie of all time, it's without a doubt one of the most important of all time, it's a time changer, an I really hope that a generation will be inspire by its message, that is highly important, and needs to be listen. It has some flaws, it's far from Marvel's best, but, also like WW, it's overall a good movie, and this is enough to not damage its importance.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

My question is where was this advanced civilization when Loki was taking over and when Ultron was set to destroy the earth? No logic! 
The special effects where good, but I feel that's all it had going for it and I would have liked to see Michael B. Jordan beat Black Panther, I would prefer him King over T'Challa.The only good Marvel movies are Thor, Iron Man, Dr Strange and Avengers, the rest...Meh!

Sorry I would give Black Panther a 9 for special effects but with a plot that's been done over and over again, just didn't set well with me.

While it is not new that superhero movies like the X-men films, The Dark Knight and more recently with Winter Soldier and Civil War have used the genre to comment on politics, Coogler goes straight into the subject matter of an issue that is more relevant then ever. From the imaginary of Africans being forced onto slave ships in the opening cinematic, Coogler is not sugar-coating the fact that Black Panther is addressing the sour history of white colonialism to the struggle of black communities in third-world nations and America today.On a visual and technical level it stands out from how many previous MCU films look and feel thanks to Coogler bringing his own cinematographer and composers he has collaborated with. Recently Oscar-nominated cinematography Rachel Morrison of Mudbound shoots very awe-moments that make Wakanda feel alive as a character. The music by Ludwig Gorisssons is also an improvement from the bland, predictable operatic score in past MCU films. The use of African chorus and instruments give Black Panther a lively feel with Gorissons using elements from Coogler's last movie Creed to give a sense of epic triumph. The action ranges from having the raw intensity in the Creed boxing matches to being kinetic and stylish, particular in the Korea scenes, like the Matrix. With the Vibranium technology Coogler finds a visual aesthetic to show Wakanda not looking too fantastical nor alien but more advanced then Tony Stark's tech while still retaining its African roots. Through that he brings of a vision of afrofuturism (a term I recently learned before this movie came out) to life where we see a culture of Africa that thrives as an advanced utopia without the influence of western whitewashing. But because some of Wakanda's ideals and beliefs may be questionable, it introduces fully fleshed-out characters that each bring a layer to Wakanda's culture. With old-fashioned traditionalist like T'Challa, Okoye, Zuri and M'Baku we see where there dedication to an ancient tradition of isolation and monarchy comes from but there views are clashed with those who think Wakanda could improve itself and the rest of the world from the country's own millennial generation in Shuri, the spy who has seen the outside world's problems in Nakia to the destructive revolutionist in Erik Kilmonger. 
Chadwick Boseman brings back his calm, cool charisma from Civil War but with a emotional conflict brewing inside him of how to approach his reign as king when new information is revealed about his heritage. Rather then sidelined as supporting roles, we see actresses like Lupita N'yongo, Danai Guirra and breakout Leticia Wright become co-leads of there own. Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri brings so much levity to what can be considered a serious political story but never feels like she is just a comic relief as she also acts as a younger but even smarter version of Tony Stark. And Danai Guirra also becomes a standout in showing some intense dramatic moments when her duty as the King's royal bodyguard is questioned. Winston Dukes as M'Baku, the tribal leader and rival of T'Challa is another surprise standout that shows a lot more depth and humour then I was expecting.And at long last Marvel brings a villain that surpasses Loki on a psychologically layered and threatening level in Erik Kilmonger. Rather then just Kilmonger acting as plot device to force T'Challa on the hero's path like past MCU villains have done, he is presented with an arc that echoes the hero's own journey. The difference however is his own actions become very destructive that are fuelled by a personal tragedy. From the injustice people of African descent have suffered to Wakanda turning its back on those that need it like so many first-world nations have done, Kilmonger makes T'Challa truly ask as both a hero and king what kind of responsibility does someone with great power truly have. Michael B. Jordan's charming personality makes his villain very likeable but also channels a rebellious attitude and rage that puts past villains to shame. Andy Serkis also get some really fun and compelling moments as returning villain Klaw who is shown as an example of why Wakanda fear outsiders they call ""colonizers"".The movie does have some problems though. While Martin Freeman gets more to do as Everett Ross then he did in Civil War, it does feel his role felt obligatory yet didn't feel like his character fit into the Wakanda storyline. The third act does fall into some of Marvel's usual final battle tropes with over-reliance on cg and the hero fighting an evil doppelgänger. But once the typical big battle ends, you see the hero and villain have a compelling conversation with who each other about their quest to accomplish the same goal.The best parts of this movie shine when Ryan Coogler as a director and co-writer takes control of the Marvel formula and uses it create an amazing and compelling standalone story that can leave with you with so much to talk about.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Black Panther himself is a great addition to the roster and things like the black panther ceremony among other things were great shout outs to the comic fans. Michael B Jordan as Killmonger would've been the best (he still argueabley is) villain they've had yet. I only wish they'd built him up a little more on screen, but his acting was great and the story behind him was a refreshing take on a villain.

Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler, this is a bold and mostly fresh take on the superhero genre. With all the hype being built around the movie, you may be asking, does it live up to it? The answer is, mostly. The events of Black Panther take place shortly after ""Captain America: Civil War"", where T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to Wakanda to become the new king after the unfortunate death of his father. But the problem is that T'Challa doesn't believe that he is ready to follow in his father's footsteps and be as great of a leader as him, which creates some conflict within himself. This conflict and self-doubt however, must be put aside when a mercenary named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) threatens to sell Wakanda's secret resource, vibranium, on the black market. T'Challa also has to deal with someone by the name of Erik Stevens aka Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who has a surprising backstory that gives some depth to the character, which actually makes him a decent villain overall. Unlike most comic-book movies with multiple villains, this one handles them really well and never lets them make the story too convoluted, which can be credited to the writing by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole. This is by far one of the most mature Marvel movies ever made and part of that is because of the performances by a talented cast that has a mix of veterans and newcomers. Boseman holds his own as T'Challa, Michael B. Jordan is solid as the main villain, and even Forest Whitaker brings something to the table as Zuri, one of the elders of Wakanda. The scene stealer here however is Letitia Wright, who plays T'Challa's sister, Shuri, who is basically the brains behind all of the advanced medical and warfare equipment that Wakanda has. It helps that she and Boseman have good chemistry with one another, making the brother and sister relationship that they have in the movie believable. What also makes this movie more mature than other Marvel films is the themes that it touches on. Some of the themes include racial, moral, and political issues that really make this movie seem a bit less like a typical action-packed superhero movie. The action scenes that are present in the movie are fine and exactly what you would expect, but the emphasis here is on the characters and themes.Even though it is a more mature piece of work when compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it still has that same formulaic and predictable plot that plagues almost every superhero movie these days, especially the Marvel ones. It even got to the point where towards the final act of the movie, I predicted exactly how everything was going to play out and sure enough, I was right. It's just your typical rise, fall, and rise again storyline that features a hero of some sort. But perhaps this is the problem with solo superhero movies that are set in cinematic universes, you already know which characters can and can't die, and this leads to the movies having the same predictable plot line that we've seen over and over again, and Black Panther is no exception. It's the only real major weakness of the film, but it's a big one.All in all, Black Panther delivers an origin story that is more grounded in its characters and themes compared to most other comic-book movies, which was definitely something refreshing to experience. It's not this masterpiece that many claim it to be, but if you can get past its formulaic and predictable plot, you may find yourself smiling throughout this journey all the way up until Infinity War in May.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

As many reviews have said, the movie lacked a true villain, and had somewhat weak storyline. This felt similar to spiderman 3, and there were too many characters brought in at once. The Black Panther in Civil War was what i was expecting here, that is NOT what I got. He seemed to lack everything we loved about him in Civil war. At times the movie was too preachy on civil rights. Nothing wrong with that, but I am trying to escape current politics, and nowadays it seems to be everywhere. Some issues with this movie. At time i felt like the music did not match what was going on in the film. Do you really expect Kendrick Lamar to be playing in a South Korean gangster bar? (its possible, BUT likely...probably not) Not once did i ever feel that the villains in this were badass, had a true motive or even evil. Maybe because I compare them to the Winter Soldier, who was an AWESOME villain. Michael B Jordan was bland and one tone throughout. He does provide great stare downs before a fight, not much after that. Not to mention i couldnt stop thinking about the Human Torch during the movie.There are things i did like; the women were badass, T'Challas sister stole the show for me, and the visuals were incredible. When the black panther showed up he was awesome. Wish his fight choreography was better though. I believe all the hype on this movie is due to it being released at the perfect time with all of the social movements occurring over the past two years (#OscarsSoWhite), and had strong female representation (#MeToo). It is also a Marvel Movie, that alone carries its weight in gold. It was a recipe for a Big Box Office Hit.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

My love for superhero movies has become increasingly diminished over time. Not irresponsible of course is Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, which (especially ""The Dark Knight"") makes most MCU movies look like a kindergarten. Even in spite of the good feedback from the critics (88 Metacritic), I mainly went to the cinema with two friends to have an entertaining, not necessarily memorable Saturday evening in 3D. What makes Black Panther good? Obviously it's the visuals, which is something that seems to be really bombastic in many MCU movies. From the sound effects, to the well used CGI and the colorful camera shots, the visuals are really sensational. 
The film has a strong pacing and a good sense of urgency. It never drags. The action scenes are all strongly staged and also very exciting. Especially the Car Chase towards the beginning with the many camera angles, the great speed and entertaining gadgets. The black Panther Attire looked really great too. Surprisingly, the humor was actually solid. Of course, there were not the biggest laughs in here, but sometimes I could not resist the one or other grin. Black Panther also thrives on the really good acting performances. Surprisingly, I knew quite a few actors from the main cast. To be honest, none other than Martin Freeman & Daniel Kaluuya. For me, Andy Serkis was surprisingly cool as ""Ulysses Klaue"", who was really good at his job despite very little screen time. Chadwick Boseman as hero & protagonist plays well, but the real show stealer was his antagonist. Michael B. Jordan plays the villain in a very convincing but also authentic manner. Maybe the characters aren't all as memorable as in other Superhero movies, but the ensemble is bigger for that. So there is one or two (very superficial) Punch-In-The-Gut moments. 
""Black Panther"" also has a good dramaturgy. The scenery is fluidly designed and continues to build up systematically.
The great ""Epic"" film doesn't really emerge, but the final battle is staged together with the music score in a very exciting way. A lot of criticism (mainly from conventional audiences) that the film has had to deal with refers to the tribalism. Some see some kind of ""propaganda"" in here. Frankly, there may have been 1/2 minor implications or provocations regarding this problem, but nothing that put me personally out of the movie
What you have to notice is that the plot is, as with so many MCU movies, very predictable and partly repetitive.
The strands of action are put together quite unpretentiously. A lot of ""aha"" is not behind it, but in return, not much is done wrong. The storyline isn't that interesting and more or less very predictable.
The other points of criticism I would like to raise are closely related. The Character Delevopment did not exist in the end, because it was traded according to clichés and monotonous characteristics and therefore had a lot to do with continuous storytelling. The dialog was also quite constructed. Not bad in any way, just don't memorable or special.Does Black Panther have a high recognition value in the genre?
Yes, but also no.
The Parallel Society or even ""World"" of Wakanda is original and the visual and the atmosphere differs from other action flicks. Superficially seen ""Black Panther"" is therefore really unique. Nevertheless, many things like character development, dialogue, hero/villain relationship are quite repetitive and offer little to nothing special.
---
CONCLUSION: Black Panther is a visually sensational film with good pacing and strongly staged action scenes, but not really outstanding in its genre. It is really good at what he is supposed to be and fills the classic superhero formula with 1/2 squiggles. Is it as good as Christopher Nolan's Batman movies? No, for God's sake, of course not. Is it a movie you should watch at the cinema or maybe buy on Blu-Ray? Yeah.

I hope they don't get bright and get a new director for subsequent BP films that turns it into everything i disliked in Thor as well as GOTG. I cannot fault Black Panther - it even inspired me to want to shave my head for a moment (then sense took over). It was a beautiful film. Women rock. I loved the rituals. I loved the fact it incorporated fashions from all over Africa - but Tchaka wore Ntoma from Ghana worthy of a King. At my viewing there was a round of applause.But the best bit was seeing the look of delight on my friend's daughter who was allowed to stay up post bed time to watch BP. She was captivated. To all the naysayers, if they could see the looks of amazement that girls and boys alike will have as they watch, then they may take several seats.","19 out of 74 found this helpful.

First off i'll start with the films flaws. The film is incredibly predictable, and at times, I honestly couldn't take parts of it seriously. Its fight scenes in the first half of the film are very well executed, but the second half ends up feeling a bit tedious, and truly offering nothing but trying to find its way out of the hole it dug itself. It's disappointing to say the least, not that its bad, but it could have been something so much moe, and instead it just feels too by-the-numbers to truly stand out. As for the positives for the film, it is very visually pleasing to look at. The special effects are incredibly well done, and the costumes are fantastic- as well as the look of the film throughout. All the actors do an excellent job, most obviously Chadwick Boseman in his brilliant performance as King T'Challa and Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. We also get great performances from Lupita Nyong'O, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and of course Andy Serkis. In the end, Black Panther is hardly the action spectacle it could have been. I am so glad to see greater representation in the MCU, but in terms of writing, the film is just a bit too bland to spare.My Rating: 7.5/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action looked nice, better than the action in Thor: The Dark World and in Ant-Man. The acting was pretty good, it really seemed like the actors cared. 
But the main problem is that this is meant to be an origin story but it really doesn't feel like it, we still don't know a lot about Black Panther and HOW he got his suit. 
I still don't feel like all of the hype is justified, but it's not as bad as Thor: The Dark World. 
The villain is not as good as people say he is, he is not that intimidating which most of the GOOD Marvel villains are. Loki was threatening and funny, he was not. 
It feels like your average Marvel movie, and that's ok! 
If you like Marvel, watch it. You'll like it. 
But don't be close minded enough to think that this is good just because it has black people in a non-racist way. If you want black people in that sort of scenario watch: The Incredibles (Frozone is a side character but super funny!), Pulp Fiction (SLJ was amazing!), Moonlight (wonderful LGBTQ movie!), The Dark Knight Trilogy (Morgan Freeman is wonderful), and so many more! Don't let this average movie blind your criticism of black people, positive or negative.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), it sets the bar to an all time high for Marvel films and provides a brilliant lead-in to Avengers: Infinity War.Shortly after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) returns to his country of Wakanda in Africa to be crowned as its new King. However, upon arriving home, T'Challa finds his position as King challenged by a old enemy whose intentions are far more sinister than merely seizing leadership over Wakanda and its citizens.Featuring some of the best written supporting characters and action scenes in a Marvel film, Black Panther is a benchmark in the series and is easily one of its best standalone films. The film's world building element showcases the vibrant and futuristic look of Wakanda, a fictional African country proudly entrenched its heritage and tradition. We also gain a somewhat James Bond/Jason Bourne vibe from the film at times, with its spy thriller elements and exciting car chases. Director Ryan Coogler does a suburb job fleshing out the main villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), whose motives go beyond merely world domination and lust for power. Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as the title character, the serious but kindhearted King who only wants what is best for his people, as was briefly touched on in Captain America: Civil War. Like with every other film in the series, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8.5/10","10 out of 34 found this helpful.

Far from bad, just not up there. 6/10 is about right: worth watching, but don't pick it over anything interesting.I do like one decision, which is to make the black characters, ""good"" and ""bad"", super racist.They make the evil South African look racially tolerant and benevolent, and the CAA operative look positively angelic (although being Martin Freeman with an American accent, a bit odd). This is an essential idea for the mythos and plot. The Wakandans are racist against tribes from other nations in the region, who they refuse to help, and a little bit racist towards the fifth Wakandan tribe; the opponents are racist in thinking Wakanda should help black Americans just because they, too are black.No side is very sympathetic therefore, which makes for an interesting plot and a film in which you invest in individual characters, not in ""sides"" because the sides (of which there are three) are all based on different bigotries","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I finally got the chance to watch it this week, and I was honestly a bit disappointed. While the movie was entertaining, it was not extraordinary. First, the plot was quite predictable and cliche - an unsurprising story of revenge and political strife. Second, I felt that the character development overall was weak, particularly that of the villain. While the movie addressed the villain's motive for revenge against T'Challa, it barely explained why he thought Wakanda should change their political system. I honestly just couldn't connect to his character because it wasn't believable enough. Third, the movie relied much too heavily on cuts, and it had many poorly lit scenes that were basically impossible to see.On the plus side, Black Panther had a fairly strong cast. I was impressed with their performances, particularly that of Danai Gurira. In addition, the costumes and setting were beautifully executed - more so than the average Marvel movie.

Everything from the color schemes of the outfits to the contrast between the real Wakanda and what the outside world sees, was so well thought out. Hairstyles were so intricate on some characters but the women who didn't have hair wore their baldness so beautifully. Seeing the deep strength of the female characters sent a surge of energy through me. It was nice for once to see women on an equal plain to the men and not to be silenced when speaking boldly. The mixture of high tech/ modern gadgets and tribal outfits/rituals seemed to send a message that holding on to traditions while moving forward is important for strength and survival of a nation. I've been very careful to avoid spoilers but it's been pretty hard considering the many details that stood out to me.

Our main character is unfun and he doesn't create any meaningful emotional bonds throughout the film. Not only is the main character not funny, but none of the jokes are; zero of the jokes hit. The movie has a really good pace and works well as a movie, but NOT as a superhero movie. As a hero, the Black Panther is one of the least epic heroes of the whole MCU. Because of his distinct lack of crazy abilities the ending cannot put him in any insane situations. Killmonger is a well-acted villain but has a master plan with very little threat. The distribution of weapons, while dangerous, does not hold the same weight as other superhero movies. Most hero movies have a villain who either threatens the lives of millions/billions immediately, or threatens the hero's family/friends. T'challa has no relationships to exploit and no big powers to stop the end of the world leaving the ending lackluster.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This was a GREAT Marvel film and wonderful step forward for inclusion. It touched on a lot of important issues, while giving me the action I needed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! The beginning, middle and ending all tire together perfectly for a comprehensive story to feast on. Family secrets and revenge is the core of the story that makes a compelling story. The humor comes effortless that will make you laugh out loud and the action scenes are the icing on the cake. I went into it less hyped than many other marvel movies, but came out preaching it was one of my new favorites! The cast is amazing and the acting/drama a perfect mix with the humor. I love love love the strong women characters!!! A MUST SEE!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

In it T'Challa was the prince of Wakanda, a mysterious African nation whose technological supremacy has been carefully hidden for centuries. Unfortunately the events of Civil War rob T'Challa of his father and now he's to be crowned king. But there are those that dispute his worthiness.We'll talk about the story in a bit, but if there's one thing Black Panther absolutely nails it's production design. How the film looks, how the costumes are made, what kind of backgrounds are used. That stuff. Because by the heavens if this film isn't one of the most gorgeous pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And from what I've read, they went to great lengths to represent different regions of Africa, giving them voice and visibility. Which has been well-received, I'm glad to hear.Although, speaking of how the film looks, there is one aspect that could have been better. And that's the CGI elements. Those often look rather rubbery and fake, unfortunately, which is a shame because Marvel usually has had really good CGI.I also really like all the main characters. From Boseman's T'Challa to Letitia Wright's Shuri to Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger to so many others. All great characters with interesting motivations and clearly established personalities. Killmonger especially is one of the all-time great Marvel villains. His struggle against Wakanda is born from something personal and identifiable rather than just from a lust to conquer and destroy. You don't agree with him, but you can see where he's coming from.That being said, I found the story itself to be formulaic. It telegraphs rather egregiously where it's going at any given moment and that lessens the tension. Sure, you have fun along the way, but you still watch the film and wish it could have had the courage to do something different. For example, the battle scene near the middle of the film. Could have gone differently, which would have allowed some other characters to step in and make bad choices anyway. Which would have been more dramatic. But no, the winner wins, because of course he does. That's how these stories go.Still, Black Panther is a good movie. A veritable feast for the eyes, with great characters and a story which while by the numbers still delivers what you expect from it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The opening scene of Trinity's escape was everything! I've probably seen 350+ movies since then, including the latest Star Wars, just about everything the Wachowskis have done and some brilliant martial arts movies out of Hong Kong. Many of those movies have been great and I'd rate a few of them a 10 (Inception and Get Out come to mind), but, Black Panther was a real surprise. With a mostly black cast, and with all the historical significance of that, and with it being a Marvel outing, I was excited and hoped it would be good; but I wasn't expecting great. Black Panther is stylish and witty. The action scenes aren't gratuitous, pointless and just testosterone-fueled. Women kick ass and help to drive the story/action. It wasn't just T'Challa's story. The villain, women of Wakanda and others got their moments to shine. Probably the brightest star of the movie though is Ryan Coogler. He's now in the league of directors like Christopher Nolan who I'll always pay money to see their work. Coogler clearly has a unique voice and vision and he's impressed the heck out of me.There were one or two things I didn't love (Andy Serkis didn't have enough scenes, for example) but those things don't distract too much from the movie. I've seen it twice and already and I'm sure, like The Matrix, I'm going to see it a few more times before it even comes out on blu-ray/dvd.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Director Ryan Coogler has crafted a superhero movie that is unapologetically rooted in African culture, presenting a narrative that is both refreshing and necessary in today's cinematic landscape.The fictional nation of Wakanda is depicted with such rich detail and imagination that it often feels like a place one could find on a map. Its portrayal as a technologically advanced society, untouched by colonialism, allows the film to explore themes of identity, responsibility, and the consequences of isolationism.Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa/Black Panther is both regal and relatable, embodying the internal struggle of a new king who must reconcile his country's traditions with its place in the modern world. The supporting cast, including Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright, bring depth and humor to the film, creating a family dynamic that is both believable and endearing.Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is a villain with a cause, providing a nuanced perspective that challenges T'Challa's ideals. His motivations are rooted in a very real history of oppression, making him one of the most compelling antagonists in the Marvel universe.The action sequences are exhilarating, blending traditional African fighting styles with futuristic technology. Coogler's direction during these scenes is confident and clear, avoiding the common pitfall of chaotic, hard-to-follow action.At times, the pacing stumbles, particularly in the second act where the narrative seems to lose its way. Certain plot points feel predictable, adhering too closely to the Marvel formula, which can detract from the film's otherwise unique voice.The CGI, while impressive in places, is inconsistent. Some sequences, particularly those involving the fully digital Black Panther suit, lack the weight and realism that would make the action truly captivating.""Black Panther"" is a significant step forward for superhero films. It provides a vision of Africa that is seldom seen in Hollywood, wrapped in a package that is entertaining and thought-provoking. While it may not be perfect, its achievements far outweigh its shortcomings, making it a film that will be remembered and discussed for years to come.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And if I could, I would give it an exponentially higher rating than just 10 stars. Black panther is a beautiful and well executed movie. I loves it because the characters are so well developed (and Shuri is awesome- she's so funny!). Every character seems to have glaws and strengths and their interactions with other characters are genuine. I loved the viduals and the effects, they made Wakanda technology look incredible and I really wish I could live in that world. All the scenes were beautifully scripted and I particularly liked how there were elements of humor in among some of the fight scenes. However, this is a more serious movie than recent marvel movies have been like Thor Ragnarok and Spiderman Homecoming, but that just means that it is even more meaningful and important. In my opinion, the movie had a really interesting message (that I won't say because I don't want to spoil it).I would and have previously recommended this movie to every one I know, and I think it deserved all the success that it has.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I think that the problem is the hype that was around this movie and how among some this title has become untouchable and if you show anything other than enthusiasm you are called some really nasty stuff.
However this film is not bad, or good, it is just decent.
I personally expected much more out of Chadwick Boseman in this film considering his prior films however it is unfortunate to see him almost devoid of all charisma and charm, the main villain Michael B Jordan is just really good in this film and made Chadwick look pretty weak in comparison as an actor, but in reality Michael was not the only one that was considerably more entertaining to watch than Chadwick in Black Panther.
The sound design is pretty good but the script needed more ironing out as it had a fair amount of lazy writing issues.
Another problem in my eyes is the special effects specially the CGI in the movie were pretty low quality in several places.
All in all I would give this movie a 7 mainly because of how good Miachael B Jordan was as Killmonger.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Up to this weekend it had taken 1.2 Billion dollars and I'm not surprised. My kids have been pestering me for weeks to take them to see this . thanks to some brilliant social media marketing ( especially on YouTube) and today we finally got to see it .It's the story of T'Challa who is crowned the king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced country in Africa that has hidden itself away from the rest of the world. T'Challa is charged with defending the nation in his guise as the costumed superhero known as Black Panther, but his reign is challenged by a Wakanda dissident named Erik Killmonger , who wants to sell the country's natural resources to fund an uprising.I have to admit I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing this. I thought , because of the director and cast being predominantly black , that it might be more political than anything but it wasn't and to be fair it was just another enjoyable marvel movie.
The action is nothing new and it's too long . as all Marvel films are , but I liked it and more importantly my sons did too.
There are some good performances from Chadwick Boseman , Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis and I look forward to Black Panther linking up with a few of the more familiar Marvel super heroes.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are some baffling choices left in. At one point they camera goes upside down trying to copy something similar they did in the last Thor movie. A very, very, very, VERY crappy blue screen effect when they go into the dream state. Those however stuck out because everything else was beautiful and stylized. I liked learning more about such a beautiful city where the old mixes with the new. I don't know how they even sustained it considering they don't trade with the outside so that mcguffin metal they have is just sitting there. Still it was nice to have this be about an entire civilization. They're way of life, politics and views. Not just one guy's journey to the throne.For that I think it's a good movie. It's not a great one however as the plot is flimsy at best and a lot of the scenes and actions make no sense what so ever. Killmonger specifically made zero sense and every scene with him was baffling. The conclusion is also a bit of the let down, it's what would have happened had nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, happened after the first 15 minutes of the movie. You could skip all that and ended up in the exact same place.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is certainly a welcome addition to the MCU and a decent film in it's own right. But it won't be remembered as one of the highlights of the series. The acting was great and I liked how they incorporated looks from different African cultures for the different tribes of Wakanda. Is it a must see film if you're watching the MCU films? No, I don't think it's essential. But it's a fun spin-off. The story wasn't incredible or anything and the villain Killmonger was perhaps a bit underwhelming (although I liked Jordan's performance, Killmonger simply isn't a Venom, Green Goblin or Magneto).

I'm just not feeling the alleged ""disappointment."" It almost sounds like the people who gave this movie low ratings, but love other MARVEL classics were expecting something that would give them a #10 rating high. I'm sorry but I have to ask myself if all of these ""Hated Its"" were people who thought they were going to see some badass MFs punch out some other BadAsses--preferably in a rundown hood, using some MF-ing lame Black slang so they could use it next time they were with one of their homies. In other words, are you all White? Angry? Hating life in general? Having deep feelings of inadequacy? Hoping to see at least an hour of the movie devoted to some Black folks kill some other Black folks using some vile, horrendous MO? I can see why you think you were ripped off.Seriously, what exactly were you looking for? Did you want to really experience the RIDE on Wakanda transit? Most theaters have those motion chairs in the lobby. Maybe you should have stayed there. Were you expecting more rap music in the BG over-riding dialogue? 'Cause who needs characters talking, right?Were you offended by the handful of realistic statements referring to ""colonizers"" for example? Jealous of Shuri, the girl genius? Couldn't remember which one was Shuri or and which one was Zuri? Liked Angela Bassett better as Tina Turner? Disappointed?Oh, oh, ooh, I got it! You can't ""pronounce"" them damned African names. That's it, right? And the whole story line caused you to think too much. You are ""disappointed"" because the three Black people you know in real life are daft and would never speak in complete sentences.That was what made it so unrealistic, eh? Did you not understand the Xhosa language spoken for all of three minutes out of two hours and 14 minutes? Maybe the subtitles threw you off because you are an illiterate ignint? No, no, don't tell me! You are pissed off because you actually believe there is truth in the plot line and Africans are hoarding the most precious metal on earth. God save the Queen! And if there is, WTF. No that can't be it.I truly believe you went with parallel universe expectations and instead you actually had to pay attention to a movie with a message as well as real character and plot development, extremely clever lines, A+ acting talent, expert directing, panoramic beauty, and style. What a concept. Just not enough clashing and banging of shields and buzzy weapons fer ya.If you're a pothead, you either enjoyed it immensely (but probably should see it again ) or you just couldn't follow it because you did the Cherry Pie instead of the Purple Kush or worse, you mixed them. Dummy.And Lordy, you didn't recognize the music. Oh God forbid, y'all had to actually LEARN something from a MARVEL movie.ICYMI, there was a message here.

Chadwick Boseman reprises the title role (who first appeared in 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and the movie costars Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker. It was directed by Ryan Coogler, who also helmed the critically acclaimed hits 'FRUITVALE STATION' and 'CREED' (which also both starred Jordan), and it was written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (based on characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby). The story revolves around the African superhero returning home to the nation of Wakanda, where he is now king, but his leadership is challenged by a new enemy. The film has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's being called (by some) a revolutionary cultural movement (in much the same way that 'WONDER WOMAN' was last year). It's also projected to break records at the Box Office, and become Marvel Cinema's biggest hit to date. I really enjoyed it as well. The story begins right after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', with T'Challa (Boseman) returning home to the African nation of Wakanda. Since his father was killed, T'Challa is named the new king of Wakanda. At the same time a Wakandan exile, going by the name of Killmonger (Jordan), has aligned himself with a South African black-market arms dealer, named Ulysses Klaue (Serkis), and is plotting to overthrow T'Challa. T'Challa, as the superhero Black Panther, attempts to stop Klaue from stealing more vibranium (while unaware of Killmonger's involvement). Two female special forces agents (Nyong'o and Gurira), CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Freeman), and T'Challa's teenage sister Shuri (Wright), all end up aiding him on this mission.I have to agree that this is one of Marvel Cinema's best movies, and I think it's cultural significance (and popularity) is really inspiring too. While I don't think it's quite as good a film as 'WONDER WOMAN' is, it's still a masterpiece in it's own right. It's great that superhero movies (in general) are becoming such a respected, and revolutionary art form too. Haters will of course still hate the film (as they did 'WONDER WOMAN' as well, and anything that creates such powerful progress like this), but everyone else should definitely enjoy it (unless you just really hate superhero movies). The action scenes are spectacular, the performances are all good, the humor is clever and witty, and the dramatic scenes are moving (and briefly touching too). Coogler once again proves what a talented director he is, and he appears to be the perfect filmmaker for this important movie.","11 out of 40 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A Great Balance: It Had Identity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4064776/?ref_=tt_urv","NicoleMae12203","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27245487/?ref_=tt_urv","17 February 2018","Not only was Black Panther a film technically well-made - from the research, storytelling, visual effects, and, especially, the soundtrack - but Black Panther also made an impact. Despite some reviews calling it quite too ambitious (a fact that I did not see at all), it understood its role within the MCU and, quite obviously, society, which left moviegoers exiting the theaters with an agreeable praise. Personally, the best opinion that I have of Black Panther is that it had a plethora of great balance. It invited us into a world filled with African tradition while adding sci-fi nuances; I felt like I learned about classic African culture while simultaneously discovering advanced technology unlike anything I've seen before. The story was well-paced and did not, for one second, waste the potential of any of the characters. There were many players introduced into this complex story, but they all had a voice to play - just as we do - in a world crumbling due to political tensions (something quite prominent in this film haha) and a kingdom divided by a tradition and progress. In fact, I think the abundance of characters each holding onto what's important to them in such contentious times is what simplified the story. Each person eventually came to an internal understanding of their roles within Wakanda, which helped center the story back to King T'Challa. In turn, this leaves more gravitas on his controversial decisions as a new king.Killmonger (especially) is a character that lingers in my brain because he really embodies the victimized portrayal of ""the villain is the hero in his own story"". Despite being extremely belligerent and confrontational, he was a villain who is more centered than the average politician and has more purpose than many current world leaders. His arguments held truth, and I am 99% sure that the only reason that his ideals weren't executed was because he was too aggressive and not diplomatic enough. Killmonger makes a GREAT antihero to the untried King T'Challa because he made the newly crowned, untried, and demure T'Challa open his eyes to lives of the other 2 billion black people in the world. Consequently, this resolved T'Challa's inner strength and made him more politically adept; ironically, I'll even argue that Killmonger MADE his own foil by bringing out a diplomatic and resolute King T'Challa to Killmonger's brute and hostile nature. Killmonger left us with many thought-provoking statements about oppression, the role of blacks all over the world, and our duty as people (or kings) to help each other without being an overbearing character or compromising T'Challa's already burdened storyline on being a new king.In its own right, the film fits perfectly into our current societal climate and the Marvel Cinematic Universe - into this already complex sci-fi/magical world on the screen and the even more complicated world of reality.I could go on with the many, many well-executed aspects of this film. But just by watching the film, you don't need an overly long list or review to get the idea that because of the story, technical details, and a justified but respectful message, Black Panther definitely opens the identity of - and thus gives more voice to - modern black society.","11 out of 40 found this helpful.

It wasn't a wholly unique plot: Boy loses country, boy finds country/ a journey of self discovery in which the hero uncovers not all is what he thought it was.But... the story was given a hero with conscience and a villain who didn't just want to take over the world because he wanted a gold toilet. My only concerns here were that I feel Whittaker was under- used/developed and Kaluuya's character arc unresolved (although perhaps that is a future focus). Boseman was magnificent. At turns both tortured and elated. Nyongo; Bassett and Freeman were all on their A Game. Standouts for me personally though were Guirai; Jordan; Serkis and Wright. Both they and their characters worked excellently. In particular, I could watch these guys all day. I believe Wright could carry her own Black Panther sequel one day. Serkis was his powerhouse best and Jordan... well... his characterisation lifted it again for me. I could feel his anger and his 'cause'. The Director wisely left us to our own reflections on whether one of the two 'masked' the other or if they 'walked in parallel'. The 'cause' part was interesting as there was a real philosophical weight to that as in the best of Marvel. The Winter Soldier asks if we have the balance right between freedom and protection and the Panther asks if are right to isolate ourselves - should we act or wait? Wakanda's isolationism may be illusory: is non-intervention really just a sin of omission? Heavy stuff, but Coogler proves up to the lifting for me.Black Panther was everything I hoped it would be and I want to return to Wakanda now every bit as much as to the stories of my favourites, Captain America and Doctor Strange.","9 out of 31 found this helpful.

However with Black Panther if you go into it looking for a fun, energetic action romp you likely will not leave disappointed.If you follow the logic of ""a movie is only as good as it's villain"" as many do, I think you'll be quite pleased with Michael B. Jordan and his portrayal of Killmonger. He truly seems as though he invested himself into the character and it might be one of the best performances he's given throughout his career so far. He had believable motives, intriguing development and the story took turns with his character that caught me by surprise.While Chadwick Boseman pails in comparison to Michael B. Jordan, his performance is certainly nothing to shake a stick at. He gives about the best performance he can since his character dialogue has a lot of monotone, stern delivery as you would expect from a superhero we are supposed to expect a leadership figure from. Talking about the story, some may find it predictable as it is definitely possible to draw a lot of similarities to past stories like The Lion King, but I think that there is still turns that plenty of the audience won't see coming.Going to the visuals, I would consider them absolutely stunning. Wakanda is a beautiful place and the production team brought it to life with ease. We are taken through a few different set pieces that kept the film flowing and has no trouble maintaining your attention.A couple of my biggest gripes would be that some characters that we are lead to believe carry an important weight to the story are inexplicably absent for a large portion of the movie, which did leave me wondering for a couple portions of the film. Another is the way some scenes are lit or just too dark to see anything, unfortunately. Something I noticed but it didn't impede my viewing experience too much to make a bigger complaint of. All in all, I recommend checking this one out if you're a superhero movie fan, but if you despise superhero movies and are sick of seeing them come out, this one probably won't change your mind.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The depth and acknowledgement of native African and African-American social and cultural history will be viewed by some with fear and skepticism. As a 'conscious' middle-aged African-American male, the theme, the scope and the subject matter (father/son relationships, disconnected from lineage, home(land) and history, etc.) will immediately resonate with those of us in the 'community' who can relate to these issues. For many, these images, in this film, may seem wasteful and monotonous. But for those of us in the African-American community (especially here in the U.S.), these representations are displays of our totality as humane human beings whose emotional turmoil is finally being addressed. Having such a majestic, intellectually and visually stunning big-budget, big-screen major Hollywood movie production with an overwhelmingly dominant African-American cast - who exist in positions of power, control and authority, and not in servile or secondary roles - has the potential to skewer the perception of the uninitiated or the uninformed because Black Panther is a type of production that has never-before been seen in this way and on this scale. While there may be some who miss nuanced references common within the African-American diaspora (expressions, relationships, tone, presence) that are reflective in our interactions with each other - outside of mainstream engagement, the political pronouncements will probably engender the most backlash and confusion. From the Dora Milaje, to the descriptions of black and brown people as kings, queens, scientists, thinkers, world leaders and leaders of men and women, such representations of regal strength and character present a stark departure from that which is ubiquitous in the landscape of film, television, print, radio and mass/social media proliferation.","8 out of 27 found this helpful.

I liked it, the cgi effects,that ship of his looked insanely cool..Micheal b jordan was nailing it as the villian! great choice in picking him..The whole movie right from the opening had an air of quality abt is production, at least thats how it struck me..It Did feel much longer than it needed to be and started to get a bit tedious twords the end..The fight scenes were Not good and not even remotely close to being as good as the fight scenes in winter soldier,which is a benchmark for action movies..the fight scenes were slow,ponderous,and showed little in the way of speed and good technique..I loved seeing michone from walking dead and she brought more ferocity than the panther did to her fight scenes,plus she looked smokin hot in the red dress at the nightclub! I hear people complaing abt the accents but for Gods sake if u were native to that continent, thats how people speak! grow up....go to britian or austrailia and you will hear heavy accents as well...The ""other"" villian i thought he looked familiar but couldnt place him and then learned that was andy serkis, AKA gollum and planet of the apes actor ect..I am not a comics reader so i never knew the backstory,nor how panther got his powers nor how his suit saved kinetic energy that he could release later...thats seriously cool! anyway overall i liked it! could have been shorter and the fight scenes need to be of a much more adept skill level for a super hero..cgi looked freakin awesome to me...worth a view","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I just don't understand people hailing as one of the best films in the MCU. I'm not saying there's necessarily anything wrong with it, it's just not as great as some claim. With that out of the way, here are some positives! The score is amazing and it even won an Academy Award for this very reason. Also, Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan shine in this and it's one of their best performances, ever! Letitia Wright as Shuri is also very entertaining and she's one of my favorite MCU characters. Overall, this was a very good and rewatchable movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film is always entertaining, bolstered by an amazing score by Ludwig Göransson that really captures the essence of the flick, and the self-contained story feels refreshing as it's never concerned with setting up further films, only being good in its own right. While the plot is quite predictable, the writing ensures that the audience always care about the characters and are invested in the narrative, leading to one of the more engaging stories of the MCU. The film is also definitely an ensemble piece, and, as good as Chadwick Boseman is in the role of T'Challa, it sometimes feels like the eponymous 'Black Panther' is outshined by the outstanding characters that surround him. That's certainly not a bad thing though, as it means that every major character has their own moment to shine - including T'Challa himself, who gets several of the film's best moments. Although the CGI looks unfinished in some of the action scenes, risking a disconnect between the characters and the audience, the action is always enthralling - a stand out being the entire South Korea sequence - and this is in part due to how invested we are in the story and how much we care about the characters. Overall, 'Black Panther' is an always entertaining superhero flick, with fantastic characters and action, that ranks as one of the MCU's best to date. 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

CGI is very obvious, but usually well executed and of high studio-quality.Cross-movie character interactions are well done and interesting as usual. I had strong hopes throughout the movie, waiting for it to depict how Wakanda fits into the rest of the world, only for it (after half-finished attempts) to ultimately give up on trying to chase this potentially interesting idea, and instead fall back to a very generic, overused, and predictable ending. For me, this part would've been the most interesting, and coupled with the environment design, these half-finished attempts basically account for all the good in this movie.The movie, in general, is enjoyable but also vastly overrated by critics, most likely due to completely unneeded political motivations. It's a good watch, but nothing remarkable or memorable. It's nothing more than one of the already seen, weaker fillers in the MCU.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

All this hype surrounding the movie and what I came to see was utterly cheesy and cringe-worthy dialogues, build-up of the villain in an amazing way only to be let down afterwards by stupid script and silly dialogues. Failed attempt of making puns, and even moments of seriousness and the emotional scenes involved such stupid dialogues that the audience in the theater laughed at it instead.
You can either make Superhero movies which really touch you emotionally and focus on making a good film, that'll last with the viewers for years, be it The Dark Knight, Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Logan. Or you can make movies that involve great action and on point puns, that'll be forgotten soon, but those movies are good nonetheless, like Deadpool, Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies will be forgotten fast, but definitely run in the cinemas longer than any other ones. Combining the two is a difficult task, making a movie that satisfies the needs of an audience that critically watches movies and actually considers the actors real, for those two hours, and don't just go to the cinema to stuff their faces with popcorn while watching a fight between the cliched protagonist and the antagonist, be it as unreal as it may.They've tried to combine those two categories of film making and have failed miserably. I don't care whether it grossed out at 1.3billion or whatever. The point is remains that it's a bad movie. An unfinished movie. Immature acting, Cringe worthy dialogues and bad directing.

"9","/10","Marvel's Bravest Film to Date","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4106447/?ref_=tt_urv","MJL_Uncensored","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16949152/?ref_=tt_urv","27 March 2018","After my sixth, or maybe it is my seventh viewing of Black Panther, I am finally ready to review it (Don't judge me-I tend to demonstrate compulsive behavior towards the movies I love). So if you have not seen it, I will not spoil it for you, but I also won't hold back my enthusiasm for the first big-budget film with actors predominately of African descent and Marvel's first Black black superhero.
When Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of Black Panther debuted in Captain America: Civil War, I knew something special was on the horizon from Marvel, but I did not know just how special it would be as a film. The fandemonium had reached epic levels: people were dressing up for the movie, there were social media campaigns to bring kids to the theaters in groups, and my community was creating all kinds of badass dance challenges on YouTube to celebrate the film's release. So part of the reason I needed to see it so many times was to ensure that the hype and enthusiasm I was experiencing in my community had not robbed me of the experience of appreciating all the craftsmanship that went into this movie. Marvel intended for it to be big-thus the $200 million dollar investment-but they could have never anticipated a reaction like this. I also needed to be sure this film stood up under scrutiny after multiple viewings because I knew I was already on a cultural high that would bias my review. So by my fourth viewing, the hype had waned for me, and now I was evaluating Black Panther for what it was-one of Marvel's most poignant and influential films in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Yes, some people still don't know what that is.The film opens with a bedtime storytelling of the history of Wakanda that catches the audience up to speed on everything in less than two minutes. Can someone please share this storytelling method with every studio exec who feels the urge to bore us to death with more origin stories? Please, and thank-you. The film picks up right after the events of Civil War with T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) seeking out his ex who's on an undercover operation saving hostages, only to use the opportunity to invite her to his coronation as king. How smooth is that? Using your inauguration to get the girl. Well, the funny part is, as fierce as T'Challa is on the battlefield, he is softer than a marshmallow soaking in hot chocolate around the woman he loves, i.e., Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o). It is little weaknesses like this that help establish T'Challa's humanity and his impending burdens as king. As said in the multitude of trailers, he is ""a good man, with a good heart, and it is hard for a good man to be king."" Moreover, T'Challa will learn that lesson the hard way. When an old Wakandan adversary-Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up with an unknown black-ops soldier named Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), everything accelerates into a battle for the throne and the fate of society at large. As a Michael B. Jordan fan, seeing him decked out in tribal scaring and challenging everything T'Challa stood for, much in the way Malcolm X challenged Martin Luther King-was a cinematic feast like no other. Jordan's portrayal of the controversial Killmonger character manages to not only seduce you intellectually and but enthrall you emotionally. And Jordan's performance places Killmonger-a terrible character in comics-among the best on-screen villians in the MCU.Black Panther is that rare superhero movie that manages to take on challenging social themes of race, the diaspora of black Americans, immigration, isolationism, and retribution for oppression, all without isolating any particular group. It manages to be both provocative and smart about its messaging without becoming condescending and heavy-handed. As an action film, Black Panther plays more like a spy film than a comic-book movie, much in the same manner as Captain America: Winter Soldier worked more on the level with a Jason Bourne-like thriller. What Black Panther lacks in bombastic action, it more than makes up for it with strong story-telling, establishing a beautiful new cinematic world, savvy action sequences, and phenomenal performances. Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead), Winston Duke as the compelling and hilarious M'Baku, and Letitia Wright as Shuri (the scene-stealing tech-guru of Wakanda that'll give Tony Stark a run for his money) all manage to provide depth and heart to this fictional world in a way that takes most films multiple sequels to achieve. Black Panther's attributes far outweigh its occasionally choppy CGI and accelerated third act which is my only complaints. Ryan Coogler manages to create such a compelling world that this 2-hr and 20-minute film (which is long by any action film standard) never quite feels long enough. Wakanda is such a marvel to look at that you will want to explore it beyond the capital city, rural areas, and marketplace settings we are limited too. Maybe Avengers: Infinity War will give us a bigger bite of the Wakanda pie before Thanos arrives.Black Panther works as a standalone film-connected to the larger MCU by Agent Ross, Klaue and a surprise character in the post-credit scene. A compelling script is what happens when the MCU grows up and recognizes that there is a bigger world out there. It is diverse. It is beautiful. Moreover, it is full of engaging human stories waiting to be wrapped in the blanket of fantasy to tell the type of universal stories that only good science fiction can tell. Black Panther takes the MCU into new territory: a world where heroes can emerge from parts of the world that are often ignored in America. It also takes the MCU in a much smarter direction without ever losing what made the MCU so special in the first place-fun and fantasy. If anything, Ryan Coogler's fantastic direction of Black Panther has just expanded the world, much in the way King T'Challa hopes to-eliminating the day where a black superhero is a rare event.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

See, when I first dabbled in magic, I hated the mantra that ""it's not what you show, but how you show"".But as I matured, I understood. Same thing applies to this movie. See, anything and everything that can be done under the sun has been done to death. 99% of the crappy movies Hollywood produce are rehashes. What idiots bashing this film doesn't get is that it is NOT about the plot. It's about artistic showcase.The first five seconds is alone worth the entrance fee. It's creative, edge, sci-fy and draws on from different flavors of movies. Deadpool-esque action? Check. James Bond meets Iron Man? Check. A bit of Oakland, California street flavor? Check. This movie's originality lies in the nuances. Every frame had something to offer. And it moved at rapid pace. No repeats. Every frame tells a story and ushers in next scene triggering Chekov's gun.For instance, the majestic and stellar costume is alone worth hours and hours of scrutiny and dissection. Then the custom font. The locket designs. Etcetera etcetera.It's like a fractal. The more you analyze the more it unfolds.My favorite of course was Queen's stunning and majestic white dress. The train scenes. The challenge... Heck the entire movie!In a slightly jovial note, a testament to a film's strength is how long you can stave off peeing. Haha!! I really needed to go bad at the first ten minutes but I had such a morbid FOMO that I managed to stave it off for 1 whole hour and couldn't take it any longer. It even made me wonder if I should give it 9 stars since it ruined my experience by being TOO GOOD!!!It's like a gift that kept on giving. Layers and layers of never ending down the rabbit hole to an Oz land. It highlighted pride and power of Africa. No scenes were duplicates. Even the ""challenges"" that were duplicated were different in same context.It's pure artistic genius. Little things like an African saying flawless Chinese, the spear scenes, the Amazon Alexa type of futurstic hologram, the smattering of history lessons on African masks, the ""Baby don't hurt me.."", turning the table of Africa on America, ""knives are so primitive"" line, ""colonizer"" swanky diss, the unbelievable intro without making any splash, brouhaha or stupid Mission Impossiblesque mindless explosion, but rather a nonchalant, subdued and subtle African theme of sounds instead of score and splicing shots in supernatural fashion....jusqua right dosage really hit the spot for me.I never read a single page of comic book for this character but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting is solid. The jokes are funny. The originality lies in showing the same things that were done to death by Hollywood in a new light with all the colors, aura and halation of African culture, pride and majestic beauty.This movie is not about the plot. It's about artistic showcase. Can't believe so many spate of negative reviewers putting salty comments. Makes you wonder about credibility and leitmotif.I went to Downtown Disney with primarily white audience who took their kids and they gave a scattered applause at the end.Then again white people are hard to please anyways. Especially the college read academic ones.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Nothing offensive or inventive. The production value is great, albeit some very poor CGI in the final battle scene. The protagonist once again suffers from what I call ""Marvel Syndrome"", where the character is rigid and doesn't have a personality. He is just there on the screen, reacting to things happening to him. He has no real agency or persona.On the other hand, the cultural significance of this film with nearly all black cast and black talents behind the camera is immeasurable to many modern day movie viewers. Not to take credits from the cast and crew of this film, I would not consider this as a cultural milestone for black community or people of color in general. For me personally, it has always been Will Smith in the first ""Men In Black"" movie, which came out twenty years earlier in 1997.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A futuristic country where its rare mineral Vibranium has been mined for thousands of years and holds immense power, both for building armor, weapons, healing and for other technologies as well. This metal has the ability to solve alot of problems on Earth... The rulers of Wakanda, a powerful monarchy, where the king is granted super powers and technology such as the Black Panther suit, are set out to help other nations recover from problems they are facing.. However, there is a threat to their country, as evil people want to get their hands on the rare metal known as Vibranium, as well as take over control of the monarchy. The story is set between Wakanda and America, but also ventures into Korea as well. The main character T'challa holds Kingship in Wakanda, and thus is granted powers as the Black Panther. His father and uncle both died for the cause (to keep Wakanda's legacy and help solve the worlds problems). T'challa's morality and mission is threatened by the antagonist who has a different plan for Wakanda, after living through the hardships faced by African Americans in the United States. The antagonist envies yet also craves what the Wakandans have, power, technology, and sovereignty.Overall, the action and spectacle is an 8/10. The plot doesn't go to deep into T'Challa's past, and leaves some unanswered questions about him and the nation that is Wakanda, but besides that the story is a solid 6/10. The characters are what really shine in this movie, as well as the message that you are left with at the end.A great watch for 2018!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I finished watching it with a feeling of ""wow this was awesome"".The CGI was pretty, the world crafted with it compelling and nice, the characters all had depth and somewhat of an arc. It took care to be generally enjoyable for everyone no matter which characters you found most interesting and nice.This would easily have been a 9/10 despite the somewhat corporate overpolished aspect of things.However there were some glaring problems:
-Without spoiling anything the climactic fight scene is .... very lackluster, as others have pointed out. Fields and a cheaply rendered underground place? Did the CGI budget run out?-Connected to this and all major fight scenes, while some african style music was included in other places, the fight scenes sorely lacked them. Some unique music in those places could have enhanced this whole thing massively, but instead we just got the same old orchestral stuff, instead of some enhanced wakandan music.-On the other side of things the whole white man as ""colonizers"" thing has been pushed a bit too much and it's incredibly cringe-y.-Furthermore like with all avengers movies the good guys kill too many people. Additionally in this one they are defending a government style which - while admittedly it has worked for them - is really really nonsensical.So all in all a nigh perfect movie hampered by blunders that are too big to ignore.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have literally never written a review, but here it goes. Sometimes critics are wrong, but they do have some education that we (the average movie-goer) do not. So for those of you saying the critics suck and the system is rigged- say it with your degree and some actual umph (cuz if you loved Ragnorock and then say the black panther story sucked- you are obviously paying attention to something other than the story). The theme of this movie is very clear and some issues that are really important to our culture were addressed. One reviewer commented the movie does not pull you in emotionally, and maybe that's true. However, I felt really connected to killmonger. I grew up in poverty and I'd be pretty pissed if my family had the option to help and didn't. I probably wouldn't go and try and take over the world, but hey I got the anger (which I can't say for most marvel bad guys). The question of how should a people of privilege help those without will forever be part of humanity. And if you find yourself being particularly hateful toward this movie, you should probably check yourself. Someone said, ""when all you've known is privilege, equality feels like oppression."" If you think this only got ratings and made money because of the racial issues of today- you are most likely wrong. The movie is solid and much more significant to the time we live in than most marvel movies.On the downside the CGI pulled me out of the movie a couple times and it is a marvel movie so it was fairly predictable. Overall this is my favorite marvel movie thus far and probably will stay that way if they keep on the path they are currently on (this is written post-infinity war).","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Phenomenal movie, best in the MCU so far!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4067108/?ref_=tt_urv","ashenafterglow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur85630281/?ref_=tt_urv","19 February 2018","Hands down, this was head and shoulders above anything I expected from a superhero flick, and I say that as a long-time fan of both the MCU and X-Men franchises.The cast is incredibly talented--all of them do a fantastic job, and it's amazing to see such a diverse group of actors and actresses from all around the world. The conflict at the heart of the movie addresses a nuanced problem of respectability politics, radicalization, and the responsibility that governments and/or those with power, resources, and authority have toward those without. The solution isn't treated as 'easy' or simple, either. There are no robots to punch, no alien overlords to blame and triumph over in the third act. It's human against human, both sides of the conflict have real and valid reasons for their perspectives, and that human connection makes it so much stronger and more resonant and more poignant. I felt for Killmonger as much as I felt for T'Challa, Shuri, and the others.Furthermore, the many women of the film aren't there for window-dressing and eye candy and impossible T&A-displaying back-bends. They're intelligent players, they're part of the story, they contribute with agency of their own and obviously have the respect of their male compatriots. They're neither made into aggressive, 'angry' caricatures, nor helpless fainting flowers. This is the kind of intersectionality we should be expecting in media.The setting and design and production of the film is superb on its own merits. The views of the capitol of Wakanda are brilliant--everything from the architectural designs of the structures, the materials used, all the way down to the written script and the gorgeous costuming and the way rooms are decorated and laid out is clearly and keenly not just following by rote repetition the same sort of skylines and designs you would expect to see in New York or London. There's a feeling of cultural weight, of history and time and the development of distinct values.I've watched it twice so far, may go back for a third, and will definitely be purchasing the DVD when it comes out. Please support this movie. Show the studios that we want more like this--diverse casts, excellent and thoughtful scripts, and conflicts that aren't afraid to touch on real-world issues that affect many of the people who will go to see these movies, in one way or another.","7 out of 23 found this helpful.

It has plenty of flaws, but none that really should discourage you from seeing it. The only thing that really bugs me is the terrible, obnoxious hype for just an average film for Marvel. It doesn't have an underlying message or stands for empowerment. It has none of that. What it does have is black leads who do a good job and a fanbase larger than Michael Bay's ego. Chadwick Boseman's character, T'Challa, becomes the Black Panther after his father dies, and must fight to protect his kingdom, all while trying to live up to the previous Black Panther's legacy.The graphics, acting, and general scale of this movie is astonishing. Not much else can be said. This movie takes you on a trip you can only really remember for a short while. What you will remember is the media circus about how 'This movie changes the course of cinema' or 'The black community has changed in so many different ways'. There are better movies that get empowerment and representation across better than Black Panther. Ryan Coogler made a wonderful experience that, when watching, has nothing but action to offer on a dark-skinned platter.Chadwick Boseman made Black Panther interesting. As the star of the show, he makes his way pretty good. Michael B. Jordan, however, was the real master of acting in the film. Him as Killmonger was a match made in heaven. Lupita Nyong'o was very entertaining and well-written, and Danai Gurira was badass and awesome. Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke did just fine, and they made the film better, but not like MBJ did. Letita Wright was funny, except for the awful, awful dead memes that she referenced (you know which ones). Angela Bassett was entertaining, and Forest Whitaker did amazing (two performances that no one seems to mention). But the two that were easily my favorites were Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. They may the only two white actors, but they were still entertaining. Seeing Freeman act in such an exotic and strange culture was great, and Serkis did phenomenal in being intimidating and yet still crazy. Overall, an A- in the acting department.Black Panther is just another Marvel movie. If you want to see it, good. I recommend it. For me, I just find it very average and okay. The acting is great, the visuals are great, things seem fluent and balanced, and the real film isn't very political. 7 out of 10!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We were introduced to the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. This film depicts the story of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the Black Panther tribe. 
 
When T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, beautiful and technologically impressive nation of Wakanda, a fictional country in Africa, he is named the new leader following the death of his father. True to custom, he is challenged by the tribesman and becomes the new King. Elsewhere, a cousin unknown to him returns from the United States to challenge T'Challa's reign, and chaos ensues. Warmonger (Michael B Jordan) and his political beliefs are diabolical and the opposite of T'Challa's. As foes set forth to destroy Wakanda, Black Panther teams up with a C.I.A. agent and a neighboring tribe to prevent the country from a world war. The path from light to dark, and back to doing good in the world beyond Wakanda is refreshing.The film is pure Marvel action-adventure with a broad political and socially aware feeling. It is awake and unique. It may be a superhero film, yet it is also steeped in real political and social issues similar to those we face today, especially diversity and inclusion. The strong female characters - Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are phenomenal. 
 
I love this film! From the casting, cinematography and directing, to the special effects and female empowerment, it is fulfilling. The action is believable, many of the fight scenes are based on African martial arts, although the CGI at times is a little whack. Overall, I was displaced, forgetting I was sitting in a theater. The costumes are fantastic with attention to detail befitting royalty. Wakanda forever!I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for the cast, social and political awareness, technology focus and female empowerment. This film will appeal to ages 10 to 18, as well as adults. I caution younger viewing due to fight scenes which may be disturbing.Reviewed by Kimbirly O., KIDS FIRST! Juror.","10 out of 37 found this helpful.

It started slow, then rushed through the movie robing us of some great character insight. Michael B Jordan was a great villain, unfortunately Marvel ruined it by turning this tough contract killer into a clown. The jokes were few and far between and as out of place as a DC film. The action was bathe in bad CGI reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded. A great story was ruined with an unnecessary love story. I don't know why critics are turning their back on Blade and Spawn. these movies were the first black Superhero films. Spawn was also flawed, but even with it's shortcomings, it's a far better movie than this. Blade on the other-hand was extremely well done and Black Panther doesn't come close to capturing the action, energy or excitement of Blade. I really hated this film and Coogler had been on a streak. Who knows, Black Panther didn't impress me in Civil War either. He's strong in the comic books, but I honestly don't care for Chadwick Boseman. 42, Get on Up, Draft Day, all really bad films. This guy appear to be the black Shia Lebeouf. I guess Hollywood is planning to shove him down our throat like they are doing with Josh Gad. We are limited with strong black talent in Hollywood, that doesn't mean we should be using just anyone for pivotal role. My 5 stars for this film are generous.","57 out of 129 found this helpful.

And to a certain extent it is, in terms of setting and characters. But ultimately the action set pieces and story structure is basically exactly what we would expect. Black Panther sadly has many issues in my opinion. Firstly the pacing is slow and ultimately boring. The endless expository dialogue cannot be justified as something that is necessary for character development. In fact the characters were my second major issue. Killmonger's revenge story doesn't even pick up until halfway through the film. Yes they gave him a back story, but it's so basic I could describe it all in a sentence. His lack of development made it really hard to care in crucial moments, such as the climatic battle which didn't feel climatic due to the lack of emotional attachment I had to the characters. I never felt an authentic connection to the story because all we are given for our villain were forced emotional flashbacks. Furthermore, for a film with a $200 million budget the level of CGI was pretty unacceptable. It wasn't unbearable, but for the most part every CGI aspect was noticeably CGI. The animated scenery of Wakanda didn't blow me away in the slightest. The comedy in the film was so weak. Every joke was completely out of place. The film seemed scared to let scenes build in intensity. We didn't need a dumb joke about vegetarians to mess up the tone. Another issue was the lack of suspense and anticipation I felt throughout the entire runtime. Any life threatening scene for T'Challa became incredibly dull with zero emotional impact simply because I had just seen him in the Avenger's trailer literally right before the movie started. All in all, Black Panther is a perfectly enjoyable action film and I'm glad so many people felt satisfied by it. The movie presents such important ideas surrounding social justice and racial equality, although putting that aside and looking at the film I was very disappointed. By the end it was so predictable that the adrenaline never kicked in. So therefore I give Black Panther a","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now my favorite character , killmonger of course , it's no surprise Michael b jordan is in every Ryan coogler movie . This movie felt very isolated from the rest of the mcu movies , sure movies like Thor Ragnarok have introduced us to new worlds. But wakanda is just so magnificent and isolated from the rest of the mcu . This movie has a soundtrack that is so good you can buy the vinyl stereo CD for it . The score is a rush of adrenaline and has a lot of goosebumps along. This movie gave off the vibe of lion King in a lot of places and had a lot of cliches like the ""fallen King shall rise"" sort of ones. But unlike any other hyped movie , It has phasing issues , but the last act makes up for all the slow scenes. In the end , black panther was awesome ! It had great characters , nail biting action , and in a very long time in superhero movies , the bad guy has a great motive.

If we could go back in time I would just recommend trying to take a real acting from the main villain Michael B. Jordan, because he's acting is quite poor, he moves like a ""moving head dog for car"", and he forces acting instead of feeling his role, lines and reacting to what's around (just watch the trailer of ""Creed"" and he's acting didn't changed much, he's the same in both, just with different lines. His last scene becomes so lame, embarrassing and unbearable to watch, he just forces a crying scene, feeling pity for himself. Sorry to point this out but if it wasn't for this I would rate it with 9 or 10 stars.Chadwick Boseman performance is perfect, he is the ideal king, humble, full of determination, focused, relaxed, eyes wide open, protective, caring for those around, trustworthy, concern, decisive, straight to the point, a truly hero, a fighter and a shield of the true values. All this qualification is what I see without lines, just expression, just acting quality, he shows all that by simply being, by his presence.
All characters were simply fantastic doing their perfect job delivering their best performance.
Personally I love the accent, it brings a lot of quality to the entire movie, gives also more moments of comedy and laughter. 
All rituals mixed with a more modern dynamic gives a cool lifting atmosphere. The cool greet it's perfect for the film, the kingdom sort of rigid and full of rules becomes soft, happy and lighter.
The idea of giving Winston Duke as M'baku and his boys the sound of dogs it's just brilliant, very original, funny at the same time. His character gives some good nice laughter also, because he's very relaxed and very into his role.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

T'challa's (Chadwick Boseman) character has so much depth to him and is challenged in so many ways as he tries to become the best king possible for Wakanda. It is amazing to see how much he matures from the beginning of the film to the end. This film's antagonist, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is everything you need a villain to be. His backstory is portrayed perfectly and it gives him understandable motives. Driven by those motives, he pushes T'challa to his limits. Whenever there is such a good antagonist like this, you get the most out of your protagonist.As a result, T'challa is easily one of the most thought out/designed heroes currently in the MCU and has so much depth after this one movie! On the other hand, Killmonger, is quite possibly the best villain in the MCU.Also have to mention: great supporting cast! The rest of the characters are so good that you are still entertained even when the previously mentioned characters are not on the screen.10/10","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, pretty much everything fell short of expectation. Maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was my own desire for it to be the next Ragnarok, but BP was far from it. I completely realize the cultural significance of the film, but I'm going to just focus on the movie itself, as I think the critics should have.As far origin stories go, Black Panther has one of the more unique and interesting pasts. No radioactive spiders or aliens from a different dimension, just a fresh story with a ton of potential that was, unfortunately, wasted. I really wish the movie would have taken more time to focus on T'Challa BECOMING Black Panther and the personal struggles that surrounded it instead of focusing so much on Killmonger. While I enjoyed Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger, I felt the character itself was written a bit too one-dimensional, with no real development over the film.Next the CGI....ugh. Given the GAGILLIONS of dollars that Marvel puts into it's movies, there were some real issues with a few of the CGI scenes. Wakanda itself was beautiful, but a few of the action scenes really jumped the shark for me, especially with the war rhinos. That scene in-and-of-itself was enough to really stain the movie, but it was not the only one.Lastly, the writing and acting felt a little stale. I realize that Wakanda is a monarchy that has been shut off from the outside world, so their social interactions would be different than the rest of society, but I still felt that they could have added a little flair to the dialogue and personality to the acting. Outside of Letitia Wright's portrayal of T'challa's sister, who's dialogue and performance really saved a lot of scenes, there was a lot of missed potential to create characters with a little more personality.Overall, Black Panther was a miss, but there is still opportunity for redemption! As we saw with the first two Thor films, which were far more terrible, it is possible to come back to the same characters from a new perspective and really make something special. Unfortunatley, with the box office success of Black Panther, I fear that the studio will approach the subsequent films using the exact same formula, and we'll get more of the same.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

And again. Black Panther was the first Marvel movie I've seen that kept me entranced from beginning to end. The story is strong, the characters believable in a hero-packed storyline. And yes, it was well-told and it had a lot of heart. So much so, I talked of nothing else for weeks.Chadwick Boseman, T'Challa / the Black Panther, played an incredible role, and I know there are many who would challenge me on this, but Letitia Wright, who plays T'Challa's science geek sister, Shuri, stole every scene she was in. Her character was the antithesis of your average science geeky sister. She was brilliant, witty, and knew how to give a compliment or a friendly jab. Fantastic dialogue and acting.Chadwick will be sorely missed in the film world.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Probably yes, but what makes Black Panther stand out is that the audience is transported to a new land of Wakanda. Where we see diversity and culture. Where the message at the end is we don't just stand for ourselves anymore, but the world. We aren't seeing a superhero who is just discovering their powers in a neighborhood or city but instead a man who is to become king and making more of a bigger decision to not just helping his own people. This movie has fun action and great music that is influenced by this fictional country based in Africa. People have high expectactions for a formula that Marvel has been using for years now and that is why they come out disspaointed. Expect a fun movie with action and comedy elements with a few cameos or easter eggs, that is the way of Marvel. Black Panther stands on its own and is diversive enough as a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy to keep the Marvel momentum going.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

This is an action packed movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (and you shouldn't either). The CG is far from perfect and downright bad in certain scenes. This movie is also like most comic book movies where the story is pretty predictable with only a few twists. So is it perfect? No. Is it the worst movie ever that deserves only 1-3 stars?

While this is not exactly the central question for T'Challa, there is a part of this question for him. He has to not only be a king but know how to do it. Does he stay an isolationist, clinging to the world he was raised in and all of the vibranium included, or share the knowledge and tech with the world? Information and resources, wealth, science, that leads to people becoming empowered because they have what they didnt.This is in direct contrast with another kind of empowerment, through dominance and wiping out oppressors, and that is what Killmonger represents. But does he come from some place that is inhuman? Not really; Eric is from a world of pain, of heartache and loss, and by how he decided what made the most sense - getting jacked and becoming a super-soldier (no, not that one, sans what Captain America's got) - it charted how he saw becoming a ruler. Can one become empowered through revolution? It's arguable, and that's the key thing. ""Kill white""? He wouldn't be the first, or the last.But Killmonger (what a name) is the villain when all is said and done because he doesn't see change being possible in others, whether white or black or whomever. All he sees is the chaos and anger of the world, and sees it as a personal struggle. I didn't see it right off on the first viewing until Double Toasted in their review pointed to it, but there is a stark Trump parallel one could make with Jordan's character.... Though with a bit more of the Malcolm X and less of the, you know, white supremacist side. But then again, supremacy is supremacy and so is demagoguery.These sound like some heavy concepts for a Marvel movie and they are, but the brilliance or Coogler's movie is that he smuggles (or it may just be out in the open and direct) in an action-filled spy epic with Shakespearean overtones (and all the soap-opera that comes with Mr Shakespeare and his royalty epics). This doesn't mean it's without some flaws, both technical (there's some poor CGI in the third act, and in other parts too, though not all bad), and in the plot (mostly in some familiarity with Winston Duke's character, though he fills him with personality to burn). I'm not even sure it hit me emotionally as Civil War or Iron Man as far as Marvel movies go.But as far as movies I've rated a 4.5 out of 5, this is one of the better ones. It has a lot on it's mind, and it has a great way of bringing these ideas to the largest possible audience - not to mention, with both race and gender representation - it's the most woke movie ever made.","9 out of 33 found this helpful.

This complexity is something most superhero movies lack, and some excellent acting all round really makes this a fun and thought provoking movie.The visuals are excellent. Marvel seems to have listened to complaints about other movies looking a little flat and dull and really fixed those problems here.Black Panther is the stand out movie in the Marvel cinematic universe.

Original score means the background music of the film. Few scenes had tremendous background score but wasn't consistent, so there's no point in it. Well ok costumes were good. The lastly, production design which means the sets and overall look of the film. The sets were amazing and really creative but I guess infinity war got better production design.
Now the action, well it was mediocre nothing groundbreaking and the screenplay which is the plot, well also mediocre. The film won BAFTA award for best visual effect, infinity war had great VFX but it wasn't even nominated, so again mediocre. A mediocre film winning 3 Oscars.

 thank god the movie was fixed at some point when it was revealed that the main villain was not the one the movie presented at first but another dude who had connections with the king...etc........(will not spoil it). then the movie became interesting and had strong scenes following the way DC make it's superhero films. the movie had twists and in the end it will leave you wanting more. if it was not for first 40-50 minutes it would be great but now it only gets a grade between B- and B cause of the first half which was a low C-. remember there is an extra scene after first movie credits roll and then there is a second scene after all credits roll. in the likes of the wonder woman if u like DC movies u will like this especially if u are in to African culture and stuff.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

From a simple detail like a milk cart for a net on a street basketball court to the way the spectators were placed for the ritual over the waterfall to the pastures and futuristic urban landscape of Wakanda. Then came the questions. Like, if your country is in possession of something valuable that allowed you to make extraordinary progress and give your citizens good lives, do you keep it to yourself or do you help others at a risk of losing it all? The movie answers this in a rather naive, simplistic manner. Well, it kind of had to, being a superhero movie. Just as it had to have all those silly fights and rhino robots. But it also had a villain whose goal is actually quite noble, making things beautifully complicated. And that, along with the actual beauty of which there was so much, made it well worth watching.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Their accompanied by the world of Wakanda which is a vast technological Nation that also represents African traditions. With its impressive grand scale and lavish sets and costumes it opens up a new world and culture never seen before in the MCU till now. The movie's biggest strong point is how it shows what it really means to be African and African-American to the people & tribes its representing. We watch as newly crowned King T'Challa puts his Royal skills to the test protecting his country while also updating the old standards his father left behind. While he may not have the most thrilling journey compared to other heroes we've seen T'Challa makes for a likable good-hearted Warrior thanks to Chadwick Boseman's affectionate charm. Michael B Jordan is no doubt the standout as the rageful Eric Killmonger. An intimidating antagonist each time he walks in a room, you despise his doings but also sympathize with where he's coming from as a lost mercenary looking to gain power for not him but for the people he knows that need it. All combined with an excellent Supporting Cast & exciting fun action that always keeps your attention the whole way through.The only downside to it for me at least is the final confrontation between t'challa and killmonger. There was a missed opportunity to have them fight maybe above a temple with a beautiful sunset in the background. Instead it takes place on a pretty lame looking train track with less than stellar CGI. For as impressive as most the visuals are in the film it's a shame it had to tank on this particular part.It's sad that since Boseman's passing we won't get to see T'Challa grow as a character anymore cause there was definitely much more to tell. But let's be grateful we got at least one fantastic solo film with him. A big highlight not just for the MCU but for its representation of Africans globally.

Jordan","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4349288/?ref_=tt_urv","Eclectic-Boogaloo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6863085/?ref_=tt_urv","20 September 2018","And despite Michael B. Jordan's fantastic performance, which brought to mind Yul Brenner's turn as Ramses II in 'The Ten Commandments,' in terms of on-screen presence and charisma, I'm going to go against the tide and say that Eric Killmonger was not a great villain... and moreover, what was lacking in the characterization of Killmonger is what kept Black Panther from being a great film. But I'll start with the positive:There was a lot to like about Black Panther. It's a splendid sci-fi/fantasy vision of Africa. The world and its people (their costumes, makeup) where wonderfully realized. I also enjoyed the performances, basically across the board. Everyone was great in it. The film was pretty well shot and directed too, with the exception of a few key sequences (that I'll point out further down). Overall, Black Panther is a great looking movie, with terrific sound and atmosphere.Now the bad. I was really intrigued by the philosophical divide separating Killmonger and Black Panther hinted at by the movie. The idea that the nation of Wakanda should be an active participant in improving the lot of Africa and the African Diaspora is, in and of itself, a noble cause that has been debated amongst black leaders throughout history... as has whether doing it by working with the 'western world,' white men, or by bringing them down. It's been bone of contention between the likes of MLK and Malcolm X and many others.But where black 'radical' leaders looked to organize a resistance by rallying their people behind ideas, and empowerment first, violence afterwards, Killmonger by comparison had no philosophy, moral, or guiding principal. The moment he took power he revealed himself to be nothing but a common thug with a personal vendetta which, in my opinion, did a disservice to the supposed conflict at the heart of the film.The moral of the story could've been so much more than, 'don't leave the son of someone you kill alive, because they're going to come back to get you.' It could've been something much deeper and thought provoking.Asides from my issues with the writing as it pertained to Killmonger, my only other issue with the movie was the third act final fight sequence between Black Panther and Killmonger. It was darkly shot and frenetic. It wasn't just that it was hard to follow, it was also a downright unattractive final fight unworthy of such an otherwise good looking movie.But on the whole, I liked Black Panther. It was pretty well crafted and the novelty of the world, its cast, made for a fresh cinematic experience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Under the very capable hands of writer/director Ryan Coogler (who breathed life back into the Rocky franchise with ""Creed""), along with an all-star African-American cast, ""Black Panther"" brings a fresh approach to the comic book/superhero genre. 
Chadwick Boseman returns as newly-appointed King T'Challa after his breakout role in ""Captain America: Civil War"". He is joined by Danai Gurira (""The Waking Dead"") as his army general, Okoye; Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years A Slave"") his ex-girlfriend and wanted spy; Daniel Kaluuya (""Get Out"") his close friend and Okoye's lover; as well as scene-steeling newcomer Letitia Wright as his tech-savvy sister, Shuri. Add in Forrest Whittaker (""Rogue One"") Angela Bassett (""9-1-1""), Michael B. Jordan (""Creed""), Sterling K. Brown (""This Is Us""), Andy Serkis (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit"" trilogy) and you have enough star power to energize a major city. But star power alone is not what carries this movie. It is the well-balanced story and grounded tone that makes it feel more like a Bond movie with hints of ""The Lion King"" and ""Game of Thrones"". 
What impressed me the most is the cultural relevance throughout the movie. The action scenes are good (although I prefer the action sequences in the Russo Brothers' ""Captain America"" films), the tech/gadgets are cool, and the humor is nicely placed to keep it light. But best moments are in Wakanda, where the African scenery, fashion, and culture are on full display. 
Kudos to Marvel for placing ""Black Panther"" into the right hands and kudos to the actors who felt the weight of each role and delivered on all counts. 
The only things that could have been improved were the action scenes (primarily hand to hand combat scenes), some sketchy CGI moments, and a rather sluggish first act.

And yes, I am white. Although that should not be a problem in this day and age, and if it is for you then please slink back into the stone age hole you crawled out of.Before watching this movie I was really excited. Everyone was singing this movie's praises to high heaven and back on all critic sites. So of course I watched it, not just because of the glowing reviews, but because I follow the MCU as well.Unfortunately this movie is not the paragon of all super hero movies that most positive reviews say it is. There are seriously way more better Marvel movies out there that has released in the last few years. The action was boring, the acting was okay, and the fact that the side characters and main villain was more interesting than the main character doesn't bother me at all, heck, that's what Batman is famous for as well after all. I did like the futuristic African warrior style tech in the movie though.But I am not going to slam this movie like every man/woman child on the web by giving it a 1-3/10 either. Ratings like that should be reserved for crap like the 50 shades and Twilight films in all honesty, as this movie is not as terrible as the nay-sayers are claiming it to be and voting it low due to a knee-jerk reaction for buying into the hype train. It doesn't deserve that as all.Now as for the bloody critic reviews: critics must have been afraid to score this movie low or was paid or scared to justify their scores to vote what most people are claiming to be the first ""black super hero movie"". First of, you're an idiot for thinking that. Did everyone just forget Steel was a thing? You know, with Shaq? In 1997? Guess what? It sucked. And it was panned. And nothing happened. How about that? No wonder people forgot it then hey? But then again a poor Irish reviewer did pan it and was barraged by an onslaught of angry SJWs about it, thus weeding out constructive criticism for smart people who want to see both sides to a coin, and hence people fall for the hype. And secondly, people saying it's pushing an anti-white agenda: you are the reason we as a human race cannot move forward and everything wrong with humanity.TL:DR I enjoyed the movie, but the experience was slightly marred by these people giving it 10/10 and making it out to be better than all Marvel movies, so my expectations were astronomical, and unfortunately, those expectations weren't met.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the car chase scene (of course there had to be one) were a couple of sequences that were kind of cool. Also good to see a bit of African culture w/neck rings, lip plates & scarification. 
On the down side I was hoping to see great scenes from Africa, but instead got Georgia, USA; Korea; Argentina. 
Dialogue was typical teen level oversimplification so as not to scare the audience away or invoke brain freeze. 
Acting, unfortunately, was too rote memorization school technique. 
Action, fight sequences - same old, same old unimaginative kicks/swings w/wire tosses through the air. Car chases. Yes, boring. 
For tech we have a futuristic aircraft that made the so overused & unreal swooshing sound accompanied by the usual looks cool design, but aerodynamically would fail a middle school science class. Don't get me started on super metal, as every element we know of in the Universe has already been seen and would have already been on dear old Earth. Invisible domed city? Hasn't that already been used in several movies. Then there's the typical basement/behind a nondescript door research lab for super weapons. 
Costumes! The trend in Hollywood has always been for some fashion person holed up for life in their cubby hole making showy non-functional synthetic costumes for sy-fy/fantasy movie look always the same. 
Plot - evil family members (or corporate or government) to take over the world. Magic curing potions; hallucinatory dream sequences. Ugghhhh!","15 out of 28 found this helpful.

Wakanda is a technologically advanced country but have kept there resources from the rest of the world. When Killmonger challenges the methods of Wakanda T'Challa must question whether or not things need to change.I am going to walk you through this story how I saw it. The opening scene to this movie was great and very important to the rest of the film but the next hour to me was a very dull hour. This hour consisted of essentially pure action and comedy, I am not saying the action and comedy was bad but it wasn't anything special.It is not until Killmonger first arrives in Wakanda when the movie completely flips. When Killmonger begins to question whether Wakanda is doing the right thing by staying hidden all of our characters especially T'Challa begin to really think about whether or not he is right. T'Challa understands that Killmongers methods are bad but he also understands that Killmonger is right. This part of the film is phenomenal.When you take those two halves a put them together you get what is overall a good film but when look at the two halves separately you can see how one is dull and not very intriguing and the other is fleshed out and very well written.Michael B. Jordan is amazing as Killmonger and is one of the best villains in the MCU. The fact that his character was good is saying something because is barely in the first half. They needed to focus far more on him from the beginning instead of the whole Klaue thing.Chadwick Boseman although great suffers from the same writing.

Black Panther was Marvel's 18th movie, but its release in 2018 made film history. Not only is it ranked the best Marvel movie according to Rotten Tomatoes, beating out Avengers: Endgame (2019), Iron Man (2008) and Thor: Ragnarok (2018) but Black Panther is one of the most successful movies ever with an African- American director and also a predominantly black cast. Other movies with a predominantly black cast include Moonlight (2016), Get Out (2017), and Love & Basketball (2000) but none have received the attention like Black Panther.The film opens with a narration about how the nation of Wakanda came to be and why they have isolated themselves from the rest of the world. Wakanda is a fictional African nation known for its connection and source of vibranium and advanced technology. Many nations are trying to steal these resources from Wakanda so they live under an invisible shield.T'Challa, the main character in Black Panther, lost his father in the movie Captain America: Civil War which means that he is next in line to become king of Wakanda and the new Black Panther. T'Challa now has to protect his people. He battles powerful enemies around the world with help from his people and their allies. The film is packed with fighting, love, honor, and family.The plot deals with very strong and compelling themes including the role of women in the world, self-determination, and being African vs. being an ""outsider"". These themes are woven throughout the film and provoke the audience to think about these issues on a broader scale as they apply to our current society.Black Panther also had an outstanding original soundtrack. All of the music in the film was composed by Ludwig Gogansson. Before the movie, he traveled to Africa to learn and research traditional Tribal music. The pieces that he put together created a very powerful soundtrack that went on to win Best Original Score at the 2018 Academy Awards and a GrammyAwards. Kendrick Lamar also created an album for this movie. His song ""King's Dead"" also won a Grammy. All of the original music written for this movie enhances the audience's experience, and it transports them to feeling like they are surrounded in the culture and at the battle scenes.Another phenomenal part of this movie was the elaborate costume design by Ruth E. Carter and the beautiful make-up designs by Joel Harlow. There was a strict color palette of black, red, and green between the three main characters which often represent African nations. All of the dresses, crowns, and robes she designed were directly inspired by traditional African clothing. Joel Harlow spent hours researching traditional looks from African tribes. After that he had to create five different styles for the five different tribes of Wakanda. Harlow had intense detail on the characters including attaching individual scars all over Michael B. Jordan. Both the makeup and costumes were so important to the movie's impact because it transports the audience to feel as if it truly could have been filmed in a real nation in Africa.The one critique that I have about the film is the actor's accents. I fully understand the purpose was to create a more authentic feel for the setting. However, I believe at times during the story it was distracting and made me lose track of the dialog between characters.Overall, I would 100% recommend this film to anyone who loves a fast paced storyline with relatable characters. Despite Black Panther being a favorite Marvel movie among Superhero fans, I think it's biggest impact besides being highly entertaining is that it forces the viewer to think about gender and race in a new way.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can't lie, Killmonger made this movie for me from beginning to end. I loved everything about his character, his ambitions, everything he did to achieve what he wanted, it makes you question if he was truly the villain, no? Truly one can feel empathy with such a great antagonist. The CGI wasn't that great honestly, it was either averagely passable or poor. As well as I noticed that for every confirmed kill there wasn't a single drop of blood spilled from the character, and if there was there wasn't as much as it's supposed to, noticeably one kill that Killmonger does where he slices the neck of a character and nothing comes out of her neck, it kept disturbing me. But apart from these two things, Black Panther is a must-watch this year and totally recommendable!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I simply assumed it was being given high ratings by the black audience just out of loyalty, but I was wrong. It was refreshingly good, and very unusual. For a change it had some story and characters you could feel some sympathy with and, for a wonder, fight sequences that weren't just there to make fodder for the spin off video games. Ironically, I found it a bit racist, with its overly 'happy peasants in their wonderful country' vibe. Why should an African culture evolve to still keep peasant farmers and straw huts when every other culture that gets technological advances leaves that behind? Also, just taking spears and other primitive weapons and making them advanced also smacked of racism (they'd be far more likely to just adopt and advance guns) but these little quibbles aside I enjoyed it. I even teared up when the villain died - that NEVER happens in super-hero movies simply because the villain never really has complexity or anything to sympathise with. Great turn from Andy Serkis too and all the leads did their job well. Overall, it held my interest and I enjoyed it, and I don't often say that about a Marvel movie.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I don't understand how this is so highly praised by both critics and audiences.I cringed throughout most of the movie. Let's leave aside all the plot holes and other nonsense. I found the portrayal of black people in this movie downright insulting.The movie is desperately trying to be PC. But the superior black Wakandan race in the movie is insanely stereotypical. I mean, skip all the weird nonsense about this superior, warrior, genius race of black people hiding all their superior tech from the ""colonizers"" and others.From the accents to the dancing it's revoltingly insultinging towards black people. It's like some white dude thought of the most stereotypical stuff he could imagine about black people. Then watched a few documentaries about remote African tribes and mixed them all together. I was waiting for them to start yelling ""UGA BUGA"" it was insane. The only reason why this movie isn't slammed into the ground for being incredibly tackles, is because the black people in this imaginary country are basically a superior race. But for some reason they still fight with spears, have stereotypical accents, bones trough their noses and plates trough their lips, as if they are some backward tribe. Why don't they have guns? Why the accents? No other group of people in these super hero movies have such accents. Thor doesn't speak with a stereotypical Norse accent and his people aren't all white. Why do they base their king on who is the strongest? Why do they constantly do weird stereotypical dances with literally everything. Every time they all meet everyone starts to shake their body while making weird noises, barking etc.
OK.. Humor me for a second. Imagine if they make a movie about an Asian hero and call it ""yellow tiger"". The hero comes from a superior Asian race and their culture is a mix of the most stereotyped parts of all kinds of different Asian peoples and they all speak ""Engrish"" with a heavy ""Asian"" accent, walk around in straw hats, bow after every sentence etc etc. Can you imagine how insulting that would be for Asians?
Also movie takes this weird American idea of ""black people"" like all black people are the same ethnicity / group. Eventhough, like Europeans, Asians, MENA people's they are all different people with different cultures, traditions, languages and values.
I cringed trough every second of this movie. They could have made the Wakandans distinctly African without having to resort to dumb stereotypes.HO and this one part was INSANE. The Wakandans don't want to help other black Africans or humans in general (but they emphasize black people). Because they don't want refugees and don't want their country to become ""like anywhere else in the world"" (paraphrasing). So much for multi culturalism, humanism and helping those less fortunate.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Cgi was bad at various points,killmonger is very far from the standards of the JOKER and, despite a quite promising start , the movie falls into cliche marvel movies and gives us a sense of deja-vu culminating in a traditional marvel ending where the audience already know how it is going to end.On the overall, BLACK PANTHER is entertaining and quite fun especially with its catchy soundtrack but its highly overrated and offers nothing new to the superhero genre.Like many others i was intrigued by the passion and high anticipation surrounding this movie but in the end, i was left indifferent to it and would even say dissapointed.

For a source film I want to highlight the various action scenes and the characters behind this great movie.
Spectacular action scenes, surrounded by a fantastic soundtrack, made by Kendrick Lamar.
The mood is well placed and only used in the most appropriate parts.
Unlike the other Marvel movies, the characters demonstrate a certain charisma, in the case of Martin Freeman, who does a good job. The main character is still learning about everything and this is notorious throughout the film, something that is transmitted to the viewer. The villain is represented with a particular motivation, which causes the spectator to divide in certain parts, doubting if he should support the hero or the villain. But, the best of the film, are the women, the protectors of Wakanda and the king's family.
In short, Marvel was right in another movie that will belong to my top 3.I was not surprised that this movie could be nominated for one or more Oscars, one of better characterization and the other of better photography.WAKANDAFOREVER!!","7 out of 24 found this helpful.

Overall there was a back end to the main characters and the roles were true to who the characters were written to be. I thought the movie was very well done, it was a little slow at some points but the high points were super high. Even the slow parts had a lot of story to them so it wasn't boring. I feel it is important to build up the story line so I loved every minute of it.I liked that it stayed true to character. My husband had read most of the big comic series and I am a Marvel fan no doubt. Unlike the latest Thor Ragnarok which turned Thor into a comedian and was out of character... ... Black Panther stuck with the original story. And I LOVE THOR but was disappointed.... Anyway... About Black Panther...I think this movie is definitely a must see. I know true Super hero fans will love it and it is good for the whole family, which in my opinion a super hero film should be. Great action scenes, creative story, excellent acting, fantastic costumes and the technology was outrageous. I think that was a breathe of fresh air.

So, when critics were calling Black Panther the best MCU film, thankfully, I didn't put much stock into it because I don't think it's Marvel's ""best""; that title still belongs to Winter Soldier...BUT I freaking loved the movie; it's definitely in my top 5 MCU films (maybe top 3 but I have to see it again before I can make that decision). The good: it showcased an African nation with different tribes, that were technologically advanced, and had their own natural resources that the world has never seen before. That's significant to me because a lot of African nations were stripped of their natural resources centuries ago, so to see this on screen was a breath of fresh air as was seeing African royalty as opposed to the usual impoverished Africans, gangsters, slaves, thugs, drug dealers etc... The performances were amazing...Boseman was great as usual but the stand outs for me were Letitia Wright (Shuri) and Danai Gurira (Okoye); I'm glad my daughter gets to see 2 strong, intelligent black females on screen. Jordan was a cool villain (a lot better than most of those crappy Marvel villains); I can always appreciate when you can hate a villain's actions but empathize with their motives. The bad: the CGI was rough in a lot of places and some of the action pieces were very muddled. There were a few slow areas, but I often find that happening with origin stories, so I can overlook that. Overall, I really dug this film; for now, I'll give it an 8/10 but that could change upon 2nd viewing. Bravo to Ryan Coogler and his team!!!","7 out of 24 found this helpful.

Only saw him at Civil war and that it is all. So Prince and King T ' Challa of Wakanda what an amazing back ground history they have give us. This movies is not for those that are expecting a lot of actions with no explanation, This movie was direct to give us the vide that was creating another phase in Marvel. The color , the special effect where amazing but over all the history was the most that I took from this movie. I love how the represent their traditions, their culture and that important of family unity. Prince or King T'Challa was amazing , now is understandable why they didn't cast any one else for this role he is Black Panther. As the lead role he make me felt all types of emotions watching the movie. He was just great I haven't other words to describe his excellent role.As his love interested , I was amazing how they play with the character, she was an important support character, but you can also see that she was special for him. Making her an spy that care for people well been outside of the city of Wakanda, was a magic touch. She represent what other cannot see the reality of 3 world countries. The Slavery and trade of woman and children's for sexual favor.There was two part that brought me back to my childhood favor movie Lion King and that only make even felt in love more with the movie. It was so much rich in almost everything.
The important that it to show to others the traditions and morals rights . This movie nail and that what make one of my top 5 marvel movies.
I am hoping the sequel touch even more reality that people live and suffer in the African continent.","8 out of 29 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Black Panther is one of the most Stylistically Unique movies in the MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4062207/?ref_=tt_urv","PyroSikTh","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5261700/?ref_=tt_urv","14 February 2018","Black Panther kicks off really promisingly with an animated/CGI prologue that establishes the history of Wakanda and why they're as secretive as they are, before jumping to 1992 in California and a conflict between King T'Chaka and his younger brother who's been placed as a spy in Oakland. This second prologue sets the stage for the ultimate T'Challa/Killmonger conflict that plays out later in the movie, but I'll admit it takes a while to get there. Instead Black Panther decides to build slowly, spending it's time on developing characters and world-building to establish the cultures and technologies of Wakanda, a previously unseen fictional country of the MCU.But honestly, I didn't mind the slower pace, because the world-building is so good. Wakanda is a nation built from five tribes, and each of them are drastically different from one another, with their own technologies, their own role in Wakandan society, and their own fashions and associated colours. T'Challa's tribe is the royal blood, the keepers of the Vibranium and the spiritual realm, including the spirit of the Black Panther that gives him his powers. There's a border tribe that lives on the outskirts of the country and keeps outsiders out. They appear more impoverished than the rest of the country, but of course it's only a front to save face. They live in huts, breed battle rhinos (you read that right), and have technology that revolves around shielding and defence. There's also the river tribe adorned in shells and turquoise colours, the sun tribe emblazoned in gold, and the outcast mountain tribe who cause a minor nuisance every chance they get.Honestly Black Panther's biggest strength is it's costuming/makeup and production design. There is no other movie that looks like Black Panther. It's aesthetic that marries traditional African designs and colours with wealthy/futuristic tech and architecture is unique. One of the River Tribe is a dapper-looking guy in a turquoise suit with traditional African lip plate, which is an equally bizarre and awesome aesthetic. General clothing is emblazoned in African patterns and colours with a modern stylising, and many characters show off tribal tattooing like facial scarification. Many walk around barefoot despite the obvious advancements in technology to be able to craft shoes and sandals (both of which T'Challa wears himself). The cityscape is full of futuristic skyscrapers topped off with African huts and buildings.But the traditional African aesthetic just stop there, it also leaks into the music, combining effortlessly with both modern Hip-Hop and your typical flavour of orchestral film score, sometimes all at the same time. I'm listening to the Kendrick Lamar-curated accompaniment album now and I'll admit I'm not digging it (although Pray For Me with The Weekend is pretty good), but the film's score is a different entity entirely. It makes a lot of use of African percussion, with the talking drum being instrumental in the film's audible identity, being used as both a main theme for the film, as well as providing some really good tension. As well as this there's often a typical hip-hop beat that comes in and out and instantly makes any and every scene it's used in feel inherently cooler and more badass. The orchestral element is, in typical Marvel fashion, still a little by-the-numbers at best, and just plain misused at worst. Even so Ludwig Goransson has crafted probably the most unique score Marvel have ever enjoyed (better even than Ragnarok, and Guardians doesn't count because that was all licensed).But I feel I've been focussing too much on the stylistic merits of Black Panther. They're undoubtedly the film's strongest suites, but that doesn't mean the rest of the film falls to the wayside. The story takes a while to pick up, it's true, but once it does it becomes full of political intrigue, and drives home it's message of worldwide responsibility. Killmonger is a fairly typical African-American who feels entitled by virtue of his skin colour, while ultimately not really understanding what his heritage means. He wants to use Wakandan tech to destabilise the world's governments and put Africans on the top of the world ladder for once. Meanwhile both Nakia and Shuri see the potential in Wakanda reaching out and providing aid to the countries that need it. While both viewpoints are stark opposites, they both revolve around Wakanda ditching its secretive nature and taking a more diplomatic standpoint on the world stage.Killmonger as a villain isn't too bad. While I wouldn't say he's a great villain in his own right, when compared to the rest of the Marvel villain roster, he's certainly one of the more developed ones. Wronged at a young age, he seeks to return to what he sees as his birthright. He has motivations and an intertwined history with T'Challa and the Wakandan royal family. I mean, compared to the likes of Malekith or Kaecilius, Killmonger is a breath of fresh air. Similar could be said of Andy Serkis' return as Ulysses Klaue, who is also not a particularly engaging villain in his own right, but Serkis just chews up the scenery (not only that, but beefed up with a tightly grown beard, and a waistcoat barely big enough to contain him, he's looks pretty badass).Chadwick Boseman gets almost the entire movie to flex his muscles as T'Challa, and manages really well to keep him the wise-beyond-his-years king. I'm not entirely convinced he can hold a whole movie himself though, as Black Panther was definitely kept afloat more by its supporting cast than by its lead. Luipta Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Winston Duke, and even Sterling K. Brown's small appearance all join together to give the movie an acting backbone to be proud of.Is Black Panther one of the best Marvel movies to date? I don't think so. It doesn't always hit the mark, and it's action sequences just become a blur of boring choreography, and its story is an interesting one, but feels a little diluted and probably too on-the-nose. From a stylistic viewpoint though, Black Panther not only stands out from the crowd of Marvel movies, but from blockbusters in general. I can't wait to see more of Wakanda in a few months come Infinity War. I give Black Panther a solid 8/10.","10 out of 39 found this helpful.

It's not because I don't like something but when compared to garbage something that isn't garbage seems good. Having said that I am not sure where all the hate comes from for this movie, so many 1's and 2's in the reviews. It's no masterpiece but it was more fun to watch than Ant Man and I would give Ant Man a solid 6, hell I hated Iron Fist and I would give that a 5. Compared to those this movie is a 7 for me. Compared to some of the greatest movies of all time, maybe a high 5 low 6, but not close to a 1 or 2.Awesome graphics for the most part - humans jumping around are hard and I watch it on an older LCD 55"" so some of the shots/transitions are messed up/blurry for me, this seems to happen with a lot of the bigger CGI scenes (not just this movie for me). The acting was ok, I liked the 2 main characters they seemed real and flushed out enough. I thought Jordan's acting was a little under whelming but still ok. No one stood out as a stinker.The story was very mediocre - you could have bet money on the outcome after hearing they were going to make this movie... or any Marvel movie that is. Good guy vs bad guy - guess what happens. But the backdrop and the way they present the movie saves the day in my books. The fight scenes could have used less CGI but other than that it was an entertaining flick.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was a boilerplate Marvel movie that did not disappoint. The story was exciting, albeit predictable, and the visual experience cannot help but to give one pleasure. The artistic value of the film fell flat, and I was left wanting for any profound depth, but during an adrenaline filled journey to distant lands I didn't miss it. The theme had some modern relevance, though I will have to admit it was difficult not to recognize the homage to the black equivalent of the KKK in both the movie name and the hero's identity. Once you establish that to an audience prior to entering the theater, I think you are allowed some unchallenged aggressions that could have been written by Colin Kaepernick (calling the only white guy in the movie ""colonizer"" was ridiculous).Another thing this did was to create a certain fear on the part of movie critics in bringing all of their intellectual clarity to bear. I noticed some movie services have this movie ranked higher than ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Amadeus"" or ""American Beauty"". That rating is absolutely delusional. I give IMDb a lot of credit for keeping things in perspective. This movie, while quite entertaining, will be long forgotten while those true pieces of artistry are still being enjoyed.All in all, if you like Marvel movies, you are going to like this one as I did. If super hero movies are not your thing, then this movie is too blunt an instrument (mind wandering to Amadeus) to change your mind.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most are too corny and childish for this engineer. Therefore I had my reservations about Black Panther. But, I love Africa and wanted to see how well a film set their would be executed. On that aspect alone, I saw the film February 16.I was blown away. It, like most things on the continent, exceeded my expectations. The directing, writing, cinematography, music, art, photography, sets and wardrobe were on a level that few science fiction movies achieve these days. Simply stunning! Jaw dropping!I travel extensively around the world and am quite fascinated by the beautiful culture and nature found on the African continent. The movie was true to it's root, too African cultures and I felt like I was back on the continent. The producers pulled it off -- a legitimate portrayal of the behavior in different cultural groups in Africa. If you are a person who appreciates the beauty of the birthplace of man, of African culture and life itself, you will be on cloud nine at the end. If you don't, you will likely be confused by it and many other things that make life great.Black Panther is Phenomenal! It was even better when I returned for a second watch. I'll likely make a third watch this weekend. All of this is amazing because I rarely watch movies and TV (far too much junk). This is long overdue breath of fresh air and creativity in film production! Long live Black Panther!

Black Panther was always going to be a comic book film that held significance. Like Wonder Woman last year, Black Panther has a cultural significance to it that is going to have a positive effect for the communities it is representing.Like all MCU films in recent years, Black Panther has it's own unique feel. This film has the perfect blend of the space and futuristic setting that Guardians presents with the ancientness and mystical shown in Doctor Strange. Ryan Coogler's directing really leans into that with many shots and scenes embracing the style and reaping the benefits.Also adding to the overall unique feel of the film is the use of music and score. I have always been a big fan of Ludwig Goransson's work with Childish Gambino and I though he did an amazing job with the music. The way it blended African instruments into the score and background music helped set the tone that this film presents. Much credit can also be given to Kenrick Lamar and the decision to bring him on in the first place for the soundtrack. Throughout the film you can hear his touches all throughout and it was a perfect foil to the tradition African instruments.While I have given much credit to the technical aspects of the film, it does not discount the work done by Ryan Coogler and his cast. As mentioned before, Coogler set a tone with this film that feels really unique and did a terrific job in pulling as these pieces together. The work done by Coogler puts him up there along side the work done by Taika Watiti last year as some of the best directing done by a director in the MCU.Getting into the cast, every one amazing in what they had to do. This film had quite a large cast and majority of them got a least one big moment that they got to step up and take a lead role in a scene. To highlight a few performances, Chadwick Boseman took what he did in Civil War and pushed it to a new limit, Michael B. Jordan nailed the role and cemented himself as one of the best villains in the MCU and Lupita Nyong'o brought life into a new character that I am looking forward to seeing in the years to come. Mentioning these roles of course takes nothing away from all the other great performances such as Letita Wright, Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya and Danai Gurira.Like all MCU films, Black Panther is packed full of action. Again like most MCU films, the action style from Black Panther is a lot different to what we have previously see. The closest comparison for the style of action is something like from the TV show Vikings. We get to see some great tribe battles while getting some really well executed one on one battles. What most of the MCU films get right is the overall writing of the film, and Black Panther is no different. The story was extremely well written and fleshed out. The overall dialog with the characters was great with some terrific beats of humour. From a writing standpoint, there isn't anything in this film that could be seen as at least solid writing.Black Panther is a film that I believe doesn't have any glaring negatives. While each person will come out with little things here and there they didn't enjoy about the film, it is hard to pin point anything that felt out of place or poorly executed. For me, the only slight negative I had is that I feel that the film did not overall cover that much story. While I never felt like the pacing was off or that anything was rushed through, when I looked back at the film and recap it in my head, the list of everything that happened felt quite short. I would have been perfectly happy if they extended the film by 10 minutes or so and added an extra sequence, however the film works perfectly fine without it.Overall, I loved this film. While I am not the community that this film is going to effect significantly, I could still feel the significance of it like I did with Wonder Woman. On top of that, this film is a technical masterclass that all by helps the terrific performances and work done by Ryan Coogler and everyone else involved.9/10","11 out of 45 found this helpful.

Hmm... after watching it, I realize my expectation was too way high.Overall here are my reviews:1. New Marvel character is a black. This good enough. We have 'diversity' hollywood always praise about. Though I dream Denzel Washington will be the man. That would be awesome. Why not choose Denzel Washington instead?2. The plot is boring and get into political too much. Inspiring people to get a world wide war revolution against other people is too much racist to me. This movie, will inspire all people from all over the world, whether black or not, if feel 'oppressed' to raise arms and against other peaceful people. I am not worrying people from China, Russia, or other Communist/Buddhist/Christianity majority countries. I am worrying countries like Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, Lebanon, where the muslims population is quiet high while they always dream supremacy but in fact they socially and economically mostly lower than non muslims. Those kind of people, with the hate teaching core, will have this movie as a must movie to watch in their recruitment program. In this case, hollywood is trash, you make chaos in every part of the world.3. The message of the movie is weak. If you think arming people to go into war is not good, then make it clear and give a strong message.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Definitely not the best marvel movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4081329/?ref_=tt_urv","ethanburnsqe","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur86091059/?ref_=tt_urv","5 March 2018","When I came into this movie I had really low expectations, which is probably why I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. Everyone else had high expectations and were disappointed, so it makes sense that they are rating it so low. But honestly if the hype hadn't been there it probably would have gotten reviews similar to mine. Instead, the reviews seem to be a mix of 1 star ratings from disappointed viewers and 10 star ratings from people who like it just cause there's a mostly African cast in it.
This movie is nothing special plot wise really. It doesn't really feel believable, and the conflict was highly unnecessary. The main baddie was arrogant and angry to a point of being also not really believable or sympathetic, though the movie obviously wants you to sympathize for him. His lines at some point were so generic they were funny. Also his logic behind things are extremely flawed. He is supposed to be a villain who people sympathize for because of his cause, but he honestly just seems like a radical BLM terrorist. If they were trying to raise awareness for African Americas, they are doing a reverse effect if anything.
Overall the acting was bland. Even Martin Freeman was a bore. I kind of liked the Claw guy or whatever his name was as he was the closest thing to humour in the movie besides the lame attempt to be trendy with the ""what are those"" joke..
The combat isn't as occurrent as in other movies, and honestly I didn't really mind that. One thing I do think though is sometimes they overpowered the characters to a point of the little conflict there was being boring.
Visually I liked the movie a lot. The costumes were pretty cool and everything was colourful and it didn't even feel like a marvel movie. In fact it didn't even feel like a cliche movie as the aesethetic managed to distract me from the blandness of the plot till after seeing it.
The soundtrack was alright, some of the songs were good but it wasn't any LotR or Batman.
I feel like the main selling point was the fact that there was a black dominated cast. Honestly it's not that big of a deal and I don't see why people hyped this movie so much. This is 2018. It's not such a shocker to have black protagonists. And for the record, Black Panther was not the first black superhero to make it to the big screen.
As much as I don't think this should be a 97% rated movie or anything, I also disagree with the 1 star reviews on here. It's not a terrible movie. Story wise it's basically cookie cutter. But it's a marvel movie. And it has good atmosphere to it. So I give it a 7","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Maybe, maybe not.It has good actors, a decent story and very impressive visual stylings but the CGI is really clunky in some places and the pacing really does tend to fall off in places, plus some of the jokes fall flat in this.The main thing that really saves this movie is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan, he was once the Human Torch in Fan4stic but that movie failed miserably in 2015, now he has redeemed himself as one of the best Marvel movie villains, so compelling and so wonderfully performed. This guy deserves an Oscar for certain!But I want to keep this brief as I don't want to be too controversial as I know that this film is really beloved by millions of people around the world and has a real cultural significance on the entire world.It's not a movie that I want to rewatch over and over again but I do like the character of Black Panther and Chadwick Boseman plays him really well.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A lot of imdb reviewers have given this film a much lower score than it deserves, citing they don't like the ""politics"" of the movie. Interesting the same isn't being said of X-men or other Marvel films given their superheroes have always been political, but I digress. I suppose that once immersed in a world filled with black excellence and gender equality, it is easy for some to forget that race is ""political"" for all people of color. This film's box office success is reflective of how deeply it resonates with people all over the world. Those who allow themselves to accept the viewpoints of others who aren't white will likely find some of the film's universal themes of grief, family, pain, and identity resonating with them as well.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Most of them negative. Blame it on DC Fanboys or blame it on internet cowards who like to stir the pot of racism. Box office numbers prove that it was well received. It is disheartening to read some of the negative comments because you can tell they were racially motivated. Some people complained about dialog that wasn't even present in the movie. When the reviewers can't probably write a coherent 500 word essay. Others stated that Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman had the best performances. (Both of whom are favorites of mine) This movie was about both the Africans and African Americans and how that relationship was strain due to the middle passage and diaspora of African Americans. It is a story about a Prince who is transitioning into King yet has to struggle with the truth of the sins of his father. That struggle manifests itself with Killmonger. Killmonger obviously represents African Americans, while obviously T'Challa does the same for Africans. Killmonger has a hatred of ""colonizers"" because of the oppression A.A. around the world outside of Wakanda. While T'Challa had a mistrust of colonizers from what was done to the people on the continent of Africa.It is okay to not like the movie if it is for true and authentic reasons, but when you don't like it because of your biased towards people of color and you unfairly rate a movie is just ridiculous 1920's way of thinking. There was also a person comparing the Jabari tribe to the Fraternity Omega Psy Phi, inncorrect and please read the comic. They were the Ape tribe and Ryan Coogler decided to not call M'Baku Man Ape (for obvious reasons that A.A's have been called monkeys for years) after the character he was portraying. All I ask is that people give an honest review, not biased by race or misogyny or hate. We support movies that cast mostly white people, we just ask you to learn understand and respect one of ours.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

The movie grossed over 200 million dollars on it's opening weekend, becoming only the fifth movie in history to do so. But is the movie really worth all the high praise? A 97% on Rotten Tomatoes and an 88 on Metacritic? Well the movie is not perfect at all but it is absolutely worth the price of admission. First of all the acting is not 100% solid, Chadwick Boseman is good but a bit bland and uninspired in the leading role. The rest of the supporting cast is serviceable but the standouts by far are Letitia Wright (Shuri), Andy Serkis (Klaue) and Michael B. Jordan (Killmonger). These performances are dynamic, electric and charismatic and are truly the best parts of the film. Michael B. Jordan gives us the most charismatic performance any MCU has ever had while delivering the most memorable and complex Marvel villain to date. I'ts a shame that he's only in about 20 minutes of the actual movie since he is one if not the best part of the film. The visual color palette in this film is amazing and yes I am talking about a Marvel film (lol). The film's cinematography and color is very pleasing to the eyes as Marvel has taken the complaints of their previous films to heart. Ryan Coogler, the director, did a great job with this film and continues to impress me at such a young age. By 31 he's already wowed me with his meticulous direction in Fruitvale Station, he's inspired me to actually get off my couch for once with Creed and now has delivered a really fun MCU film. However not all is sunshine in Wakanda as the visual effects leave much to be desired. For a Marvel flick with a budget of 200 million dollars some of the effects are plainly put, unacceptable. The uncanny valley is way too noticeable on several times during the run-time this unfortunately breaks the level of immersion and enjoyment. No spoilers, but there is a scene during the third act of the film in which I just lost it. The effects were so laughably bad, during the scene, that I just couldn't maintain my composure. I was put under the scrutiny of the whole theater as they turned towards me to try and comprehend why somebody would laugh at the climax of a film. This reaction makes me think that most people won't have a problem with the CGI this time around. Although in reality the scene looks as if it was a video game cut-scene taken right out of the Playstation 2. Regardless I think this film is worth a watch just don't expect to walk into the 12 Angry Men or the Citizen Kane of Marvel films. Curb your expectations and be ready for a flawed yet awesome good time at the cinema.

Despite all that was put into the production of this film, all audiences get is yet another Typical, Very Generic, and Over the top Cliched Superhero/Comic movie that has been shown and told hundreds of times before.Despite the movie's extreme lack of originality, there is some entertainment to enjoy here. The World of the movie is not only good looking and interesting but very Sophisticated, the most ever seen in the Superhero film genre. There is a lot of ""Eye-Candy"" to see throughout the movie but it cannot cover up the lack of storytelling and ""Amateurish"" acting from a good cast of acting talent. From Costume design, to certain set pieces, make-up, etc. are well done, but are often ruined and spoiled due to Poor and Weak Visual effects work. If your expecting a Great Visual Effect Superhero Movie Spectacle prepare to be disappointed here. The CGI is very noticeable and often times characters and objects look like Cartoons. In addition, the choreography in the action and fight scenes are slow and obvious, looking like actors in Theater Rehearsals waiting for their cues. Furthermore, The performances are good, Chadwick Boseman and Letitia Wright stand out the most overall, including the acting chemistry between the two of them. The weakest and worst of the bunch are Micheal B. Jordan and Martin Freeman as both their characters were not only generic, but extremely Dull. Martin Freeman's ""Everett K. Ross"" was meaningless, had no real purpose to be involved in the narrative at all, and add Michael B. Jordan's ""Killmonger"" to the List of Forgettable Villains, which has become a consistent trend in Marvel Studio movies over the recent years. Others such as Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis's characters perform well with what they were working with, but both have limited screen time to help really benefit the film's narrative at all. Finally, ""Black Panther"" is a Comic/Superhero movie that stays true to it's guns from beginning to end. It doesn't deviate from it's tone and story arc unlock most Marvel Studios movies always do. On a personal note, it's good to finally get another Marvel Studios movie that focuses on it's Title Character instead of a Superhero movie that follows multiple characters and story arcs at the same time that are pointless with no meaning to the Main Title's Protagonist. Overall, ""Black Panther"" may be another forgettable Superhero Movie, but it is a decent addition to the Comic Book Superhero Genre, including to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","130 out of 319 found this helpful.

Other than this movie, it's only know previous property has been it's toughness and it's ability to rebound energy (part of it's toughness) , not somehow store it for use at a later time. When Thor's Hammer hit the Cap's shield in t he original Avengers, it bounced all that energy back to Thor, it didn't supercharge his shield for use at a later time of his choosing. Maybe that's the technology that ""came with"" Vibranium. Don't know. Still trying to figure that one out. They kept bringing it up again and again and again. Otherwise a pretty good movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But its a really good movie makes you think about a lot of problems in today's world. the soundtrack is a blast, The whole cast did a great job though I wished Jordan got a bit more screen time. The ending just blew me away. So simple yet so satisfying. The movies greatness lies in the fact that it challenges you to think and choose who to support the hero or the villain, both whose causes are justified, and . You kind of end up feeling sad for the bad guy, just fighting for what he thinks is right. No other marvel movie delivers this sort of experience.Sure its not as action packed or funny as other marvel movies but it doesn't rely on these elements, instead it drags you into the story and makes you feel the pain and conflict inside each character, expressed so elegantly you can almost feel them come to life.Many people probably went to the theaters expecting a high action flick with a guy running in a bullet proof cat suit and some comedy thrown in to the mix. This could've been like that but no, they decided to make something different , a different class of movie, more focused on internal struggles than fist fights, that is the strongest point of the movie. If you don't like it I understand, it just wasn't a general superhero movie. Maybe try watching the movie again without thinking of it as a superhero film, but just a normal movie with a social message, you might like it.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I have to say that I am completely in the middle about the movie.For a Marvel movie, I was a bit let down - there were far too many incongruities to make me love it, but some of the acting was outstanding, specifically Michael B. Jackson and Martin Freeman (Andy Serkis was damn convincing as well.) The rest of the actors were pretty flat and predictable. They did a GREAT job with the CGI, though.One of my biggest complaints with BP was the idea that an independent nation that had its own language spoke both in english and wakandan and slipped back and forth in their own country. If the characters are going to speak english, speak english. If they're going to speak wakandan complete with subtitles, make us read. Really annoyed the hell out of me.Its worth a watch, and I'm glad I did - once. Won't be watching again unless there's nothing on but soccer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although not in Hong Kong particularly, the buzz of this movie on Twitter was one that was overwhelming to be honest. I think what I liked about the film in the beginning, is the way they connected T'Challa and T'Chaka in a deeper sense, when compared to the brief moment in Civil War. I think they truly gave Black Panther a good and proper origin, however it didn't feel like the one Dr Strange got in his own movie. This origin story, was more like experiencing T'Challa in depth after a brief and fast introduction in CA: Civil War.Why I felt this movie was the most relatable MCU Movie, is because of the customs and the attire. As an Indian, born and brought up in India, some dressing sense and ornaments felt very known to me. For example, T'Challa in one of his scenes wears a clothing item, very similar to the Kurta (Search Google, basically an Indian long garment). Also, some rituals were something that I could easily make sense of.After Loki, Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger felt like a really great villain in the MCU. I won't be spoiling his story, but one has to experience him on their own to know what I mean. His scenes are to watch out for, you would be greatly influenced by his character.The women in this movie are a talking point on themselves,but two that caught my eyes were: Danai Gurira's Okoye and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Shuri, in particular, was one of favourite characters in the movie. Interestingly, Okoye and Shuri are two women in charge of defense and technological innovation respectively. I just felt, so happy that they portrayed both the physical and mental capabilities of the women. Saying any further will spoil the movie, so that's it.However, the only reason I will give it a 9, is because the approach towards the climax, for me, felt a bit over-stretched. Otherwise, an all and all amazing movie, with a lot of socio-political facts surrounding it, that will be talked by generations to come by.Hope this review was helpful.Dharya P.","7 out of 26 found this helpful.

The first film to follow the story of a black superhero struck a chord with audiences not only because it of its historical qualities, but because it was an entertaining, fresh action-adventure ride that breathed new life into the aging franchise.At its core, 'Panther' follows a traditional hero narrative, following a somewhat unassuming leader from his rise to power to his fall from from grace and a nearly unsurmountable pathway to return to his position. We've seen this time after time in stories like 'The Lion King,' what makes it also work here is the fact that it has the ""Marvel touch"" - a great cast, good special effects, enough humor to keep audiences laughing and tons of formulaic yet expected stylized fight scenes.While audiences first got to know T'Challa and Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) in 'Captain America: Civil War,' it's clear he was ready to step into the spotlight. T'Challa is likable thanks to his serious yet cool outlook and commitment to the people of his homeland, Wakanda, and the people he surrounds himself with are a great foil. From his feisty younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) to his love interest Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), he is in great company. Even those who are no fans of his, like outsider Eric Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) or frenemy W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) are effective in their roles. But the cast is nearly an endless sea of familiar, successful actors, from Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett to Sterling K. Brown and Martin Freeman.But acting is just a portion of why 'Panther' succeeds. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is the fact that it does not take itself too seriously. Don't get me wrong - this is no 'Deadpool' in the comedy department - but it strikes a near-perfect balance of sweet and salty. Also, the juxtaposition between poverty-stricken Oakland, CA, USA with the prosperous, hi-tech Wakanda, Africa does not go unnoticed. The natural beauty of the African setting is another element that helps set 'Panther' apart from other similar films.Sure, it's understandable why some may say this film is a bit overrated, given the somewhat unoriginal plot. But the plot is not usually the reason you go to see movies like this. It's all about the entertainment value, and 'Black Panther' delivers on this front.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Money talks, and right now the film's box office dominance is sending a powerful and culturally important message to Hollywood and beyond. Stories of all colors and stripes are waiting to be told, and cinema fans are pining for fresh takes and innovative ways to convey those tales.However--one way or the other--box office results should never be mistaken for a barometer of a film's quality. 'Black Panther' brings the fictional nation of Wakanda to life while shining a bright light on a handful of social justice issues that desperately need to be addressed. 
 I particularly like their bad-ass female version of the Praetorian guard. 
 But in end, those highlights aren't enough to overcome the handful of illogical moments scattered throughout the plot, the hewing of action scenes towards a more juvenile audience, and the frequently lame dialogue in which Michael B. Jordan's character is easily the worst offender.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has a unique story to tell and does the best it can to tell that story instead of wasting its time serving as a trailer for future Avengers movies. It uses humor wisely and does not kill several dramatic or intense scenes by throwing in a cheap joke. It lets the emotional moments sink in, and does not try to undercut them.The villain is a fully realized character with an understandable motivation, and he has personal ties to our hero. Great. We need more believable antagonists like this! In fact, pretty much all of the characters - even the supporting ones - were fleshed out and given time to shine. The worldbuilding was also well done and most people will leave the movie wishing they could go to the country of Wakanda. 8/10.Black Panther does not reach the heights of comic book masterpieces like The Dark Knight or Logan, but I'd say it's a cut above most of the superhero movies that came out last year, including Thor Ragnarok, Spider-man Homecoming, Wonder Woman, Gaurdians of Galaxy 2 and the horrid Justice League (hatethatmovie).","7 out of 26 found this helpful.

Every actor did a great job especially Michael B. Jordan who played one of the best villain in superhero movies ever; his motivations are so compelling that make you sympathy with him. The dramatic moments were touching and they are clearly inspired by The Lion King. Unfortunately, the action scenes are very very bad especially with the use of such poor CGI; the characters seemed as they were fully animated in some kind of a computer game. The major issue I have with this movie is the ending; it's so rushed and clichéd. I think the movie should have been separated into two parts because it ends weirdly, I feel that the ending came out of nowhere; it's very displaced. I hoped to see King T'Challa more stronger as he was in Civil War but they made all the women in the movie stupidly strong that their fight scenes overshadowed Black Panther's. Overall, I had so much fun watching this movie but I think it's so overrated.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

That's why I remembered to check the reviews over here, and the same bashing is happening here also. That's why I think I should explain and warn you first before you make the same mistake.

With all that said, let's move on to the review.Edit: So someone still marked my review unhelpful even after all this. Here, I have done it. I can imagine his mother must be moaning right now.So before the release of Avengers: Infinity War, I had never watched any of the MCU movies before. It was only after the release of that movie that I saw everyone talking about it all the time, and that I had to watch all the movies before I could start watching IW. I had to watch all the movies so that I could catch up in time before Endgame. I had heard a little bit about some random guy named Black Panther getting snapped out by Thanos, but I really didn't care because I had never even heard about this guy my whole life. So after all the movies I had watched, Black Panther was next. I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie because it seemed so much culturally different, but I thought that if I had watched Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man without having known anything about them before, so I can do the same here also.The first thing that strikes differently about this movie is that this is not exactly a character origin story. Black Panther was already previously introduced in Captain America: Civil War where his father had died, but he was never explained as to why or how he's the superhero. This is the movie which finally explains that part. The world thinks Wakanda is a poor country while in reality it is a powerhouse of vibranium. T'Challa is a leader and the saviour of the people. The king of Wakanda gets to be the Black Panther, for which they have to take the heart shaped herb that helps them acquire knowledge from all the previous Black Panthers.Other than the superhero himself, N'Jadaka ie Killmonger believes he is the rightful ruler of the kingdom, because of which he challenges T'Challa. From Killmonger's point of view he should be the king because he wants to take revenge fromT'Challa's father T'Chaka for killing his father. The movie spends a good deal over it, such that it allows the viewer to sympathise with him, even though his actions are clearly wrong. Finally N'Jadaka beats T'Challa in the ceremonial fight which allows him to be the Black Panther instead. There are multiple moral dilemmas faced by the protagonists, as to whether let their kingdom be governed by someone who lets his emotions get the better of him or dare to overthrow their own king.The moral dilemma is actually a very important point in the story, since in the scene where T'Challa, Shuri and Okoye are talking about this, Okoye says it's her duty to serve whoever sits on the throne no matter how the person is. That is a stark contrast from both T'Challa and N'Jadaka, since both of them see beyond their rules to see whom and what to fight for. The Wolf Tribe led by M'Baku is ready to help Black Panther, in spite of having previously faced a humiliating defeat by T'Challa in the Black Panther ceremony. While T'Challa makes allies along the way, N'Jadaka eliminates his allies.Although the CGI was a bit off in some places, overall it was good. Since I had no idea what I was heading for, I didn't expect to see a Wakanda having such a high technology (I didn't watch any trailer before watching the movie or read any comics). The fight scenes were also pretty fun to watch, except for the Busan one. I didn't like it for some reason which I myself don't know. The acting was also very good. This movie absolutely deserved the Oscar for the costume design. I think it has the best interpretation of the suit as depticted in the comics (only Iron Man comes a close second since it's not as comicbook accurate).Although this movie is not one of my favourites, it did leave some huge impacts on me. First of all, I have purchased almost all Black Panther comics. Secondly I have become a lot more open to watching movies from Africa, since now I won't be afraid of not understanding anything. And thirdly, it's something I will always remember Chadwick Boseman for. Rest in peace hero, you did a pretty great job.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Black Panther makes it the MCU's 18th movie and 8th solo film; given the metric, it would have been natural to be experiencing diminishing returns or even fatigue from the studio but it is the total opposite. Black Panther had so many strong points which makes it hard to elaborate on one. I understand that they focused more on the politics as opposed to action but it remains endearing. The best characters were Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, T'Challa and N'Baku. Erik Kilmonger is a villain we've never experienced in the MCU before in which Marvel has been doing great in the villain department lately. Special mention to Ryan Coogler for his amazing work on this film, I could see the combination of his style and Marvel's formula during the film which resulted in a masterpiece. Since we've been introduced to the fictional world of Wakanda and its vibranium, high expectations are set for the sequel. Now the hype is geared towards AIW, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's 10 years culmination.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

While this can often be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' a longer explanation is typically necessary. Not so here. Black Panther, for all its positive buzz and fresh casting, is a Marvel movie: if you've enjoyed their past films, you'll probably enjoy this one; if not, you'll be just like me.Which, if you've read my past reviews, may come as no surprise. But this time was supposed to be different. Beyond achieving Marvel Studios' highest Rotten Tomatoes score ever (97%), Black Panther garnered one of the highest-grossing opening weekends, and now second weekends, of all time. Surely such unprecedented success was the result of a fresh, inspired product.On paper the story, though perhaps overstuffed, holds plenty of promise: the kingdom of Wakanda, in the heart of Africa, is seen by most of the world as just another impoverished nation. But in reality, thanks to a rare, all-powerful compound known as vibranium, it is the planet's most advanced civilization. Wakanda's clean streets and futuristic technology are hidden within its earthly dust like an alternate universe.
The king, by right of birth and physical combat, wears not a crown but the suit and special abilities of a warrior-a Black Panther. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has just inherited this duty. He has strong support and a good heart, but must contend with a newfound challenge rising from the past actions of his father.There is much more, but the tragedy is that it hardly matters. Why should an audience parse the depths of narrative details-how can it-when the film itself seems incapable of breaking the surface?This, mind you, is not the fault of the stellar cast or offscreen talent. It is the result of a homogenization of creativity, as if, before beginning a new Marvel project, each participant must sign a Disney contract sacrificing their individual vision and style for the good of the prevailing formula.An example: most of the Mission: Impossible films are surface deep as well, but at least we can readily identify their directors through the look and feel of each entry. From Iron Man through Black Panther, eighteen Marvel movies have employed the diverse talents of Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Shane Black and Kenneth Branagh (among others) behind the camera; good luck guessing which director belongs to which film. Now, this could all just be me. It's clear the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was meant, before anything else, to simply be fun. But how long can fun last when every outing feels the same? When there are no stakes because there's no chance the hero will die before the next sequel is made?I say all this because I've always loved blockbusters-Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Lord of the Rings. The best ones all have their own unique magic. But whenever I watch a Marvel movie I feel that magic slipping away. Depth, subtlety and intelligence have never been hallmarks of the blockbuster, but when did we stop even reaching for them?If it feels that I've neglected Black Panther specifically in this review, know that each word applies to it. And that's the problem. Despite a wealth of rich characters and conflict, the film has little identity outside of the Marvel brand.It's similar to the time producer Kevin Feige, chief architect of the MCU, discussed genres within the franchise. He labeled Captain America: The Winter Soldier a political thriller, and he was right. But compared to every other political thriller, it was just another Marvel movie.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The costume was over the top awesome and my favorite part of ""Civil War"" was Black Panther fighting Capt and Winter Soldier. I've always thought T'Challa was a great character with an interesting background and an interesting plot line. The land of Wakanda and the King and it's people all had struggles of their own and it seemed like a great starting for a full-length feature about the Black Panther's world.Unfortunately the magic that I had hoped for was lost along the way. The story line was acceptable but the character of Killmonger was flat and not interesting at all. The acting overall was decent but some of the support cast wasn't up to par. As this is a superhero movie I would have rather it stayed away from being preachy even in the slightest. This isn't a sweeping historical drama, this is an action movie. Or so it should have been. The CGI was good in some parts but not in others. The fight at the end between T'Challa and Killmonger when they both had on their suits looked like they were made of rubber. I do not care for political correctness being in superhero movies and wish they could have just let it be a fun and entertaining movie solely. Ultimately disappointing.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are a lot of great actors, who've performed a lot of great rolls, who have happened to be black. This movie breaks no ground there. Heck, this isn't even the first black superhero in film, so that's not even new. In my opinion hyping a movie because it has a lot of black actors is just as bad as not liking a movie because it has a lot of black actors. I'm just saying. With that said, the actors in this one did a good job, I liked them all, even the villain. The CGI wasn't the best, but then again maybe I'm just getting burned out on movies that rely on CGI, and let's face it Marvel relies a lot on CGI. It just seems like the CGI is not getting better.

The story of the legendary Black Panther, with mythos and ceremonies in Wakanda, the worlds most technological and advances country gives a spin on tech vs the old ways. And new King T'Challa, aka Black Panther, is a fresh, new breath into MCU. It's too bad then that they goes into the tested and safe route with the origin story in place with tm BAD GUY trying to steal Black Panthers title, and a giant fightoff with tons of CGI. For me, the most interesting stuff was the very cool, female warriors. But it's still incredible overrated.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When comparing Black Panther to other Marvel Films it is an amazing movie and easily in my top 5 for Marvel, but when judging it as a stand alone film I'd say it's a good, but not great movie. The plot was engaging, the visuals were pleasing and it was well acted (over all). I would say it was about 20 min too long and felt like some scenes dragged on forever. My final take away would be that it is a well made, entertaining film that was slightly too long... it was one of the 1st if not 1st Major Blockbuster with a majority Black cast and crew which will make it a historic film. Whether or not it will be a classic film only time will tell, but like most Marvel films I'm guessing it will not.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I am not usually one to defend the critics (for me, their recent cynical critique of The Greatest Showman completely missed the point of the movie), but they generally have Black Panther spot on, at a time when Hollywood is finally starting to face some of it's demons.Let's deal with the big black elephant in the room first...
I felt very uncomfortable recently when I heard a local radio DJ recommend the movie ""...that stars Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis"".
Basically the only two white actors in a movie which is quite deliberately (and justifiably) NOT white.
It's a black superhero movie - big deal right?
Most of the cast and crew are black - that actually IS a big deal, and has some pretty major relevance too if you've followed the news even slightly over the past few years.
That fact alone though is probably a good reason to sign a petition or turn up to a rally but not necessarily a reason to go to the cinema. So let's move on.The action is great fun without being too excessive. The vast majority of characters are well fleshed out compared to the usual 'making up the numbers or two many cooks' in these films. And it has just the right amount of heart and mind without diluting the genre. I thought it also just managed to be different enough from the other MCU flicks to have it's own identity. Which is an achievement in itself at a time when they're churning out three of these babies a year.For what it's worth, I really enjoyed it and so did my kids.Sure, there's some overlong sequences, poorly delivered lines and the odd dodgy special effect, but that criticism can be levelled at ninety percent of the multiplex movies nowadays.Personally I was very happy to see a big budget, mainstream film that gave significance to more than just one or two non-white characters. BUT MORE THAN THAT, I was proud to take my young (white) daughter to a family film that featured a range of strong women who did much more than just spend the duration pouting, bitching or trying to make love to the camera.So if you don't like minor elements of social, political or topical discussion in your blockbuster I suggest you stick to Michael Bay films. If you don't like the way different movie directors are putting their own stamp on your beloved comics, stick to the comics.I've only seen it once, but I'm still trying to decide if Black Panther might topple Civil War as my favourite Marvel movie so far.Like it? Great. Don't like it? No problem.
But the 1 and 2 star reviewers can go suck balls, watch the Emoji Movie, and stop insulting most people's intelligence.I give it a solid 8/10.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The supporting cast was superb and convincing with T'Challa's female bodyguard genuinely looking like they could do some serious damage to an opponent.

In fact, it took a few sittings to watch to completion. The hook does come, but too late in my view.I thought some direction was overdone, in the sense that the director wants the audience to feel something, and is perhaps not sure it's been accomplished, so does a closeup on a character demonstrating that feeling. (Eg., I don't need a long close-up of someone saying ""weeee"" to know I should feel exhilarated, and it's off-putting.)Generally, the acting was good, but I must admit that I did not care for Andy Serkis in the villain role, which I thought was overacted, although I usually like him (particularly in the little gem, Einstein and Eddington). Again, a direction issue, not an actor issue.Overall, I just don't think the story itself was sufficiently well-told and directed to merit a higher rating. In my view, it was a real gift and way-off to be nominated for best movie. In my view, this movie is not even in the same story-telling ballpark as, eg, the wonderfully told story, Green Book.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong it's a well made movie but just like some Marvel movies in the past it doesn't do anything new. Sure it shows off African culture but other than that it is still the same film we've seen over and over again. What I do like about this movie is how character driven it is as opposed to just being filled with action scene after action scene. The characters are pretty good for the most part however I did feel that Black Panther himself was probably the most boring which is a shame because he was so great in Civil War. All the actors do a good job and I never felt like anyone stood out in terms of bad performances except for Michael B. Jordan who seemed to phone it in some times. A lot of the problems in this movie are due to inconsistencies. For the sake of not spoiling anything an example I would use are the special effects which range from good to downright terrible. In the end Black Panther is a character driven film with beautiful scenery, good characters, and great acting but the story isn't anything new and there are some major inconsistencies.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Black Panther by contrast was an fun movie, not a masterful piece or arts, but a mostly fun movie. Killmonger is one of the superior villains in the MCU because of the well fleshed out nature of his characters, properly established motivations, and a kick ass and sympathetic performance from Michael B Jordan. The protagonist however is simply a dull character who you simply aren't invested in, simply because of the high benchmark set forth by the MCU pertaining to protagonists.
The movie does NOT have a deep message, infact like Captain America: Civil War It masquerades itself as a deep movie by creating a moral dilemma, and then executing it in the most generic and unintriguing way possible. If you come to find enjoyment in Black panther through substance you will be disappointed. If you come for fun action sequences, some nicely done drama, and an enjoyable cinematic experience, Black Panther certainly delivers. The movie uses the facade of culture to pretend like it's not part of Kevin Feiges manufacturing line of same old variations of cinema, but ultimately the shoot em up third act pretty much exposes the fact that black panther is another fun, somewhat funny, display of popcorn entertainment from marvel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","'Black Panther' Review: Another solid Marvel film, but not a Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4170808/?ref_=tt_urv","AustinSober","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88347676/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2018","""Black Panther"" serves as yet another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, showcasing a wildly different world feel and a deeper story than previous entries, while still providing the staples that the devoted fan base enjoys. Many critics and audiences are proclaiming this as the best of the series and even saying that the film is a masterpiece. I feel that is stretch as there are some apparent issues with film's execution of action, effects, and actual focus of the story, regardless of depth. ""Black Panther"" is indeed a good film, but not a ""masterpiece"".The story follows T'Challa aka the Black Panther, sometime after ""Captain America: Civil War"", finally taking the throne of his late father in the advanced hidden capital of Wakanda, an African country pretending to be a typical third world nation. When an old enemy pops up again, the new king finds himself face to face with a mysterious American mercenary with stirring obsession with Wakanda.The story to ""Blank Panther"" is actually really good and goes a step above the usual in the MCU with plenty of emotional depth to its characters and not relying too much on previous films in the series. I will refrain from speaking on it to hold back spoilers. I will say that the story basically becomes the ""Lion King"". Nuff said.Our hero is very likable and never does anything to break his status as a good role model. Chadwick Boseman created a fan favorite with Civil War and those qualities carry over here.The villains are also above par, which for me has always been an issue with Marvel movies: a lot effort for the hero and the villain is just a one note baddy played by a high profile actor. Andy Serkis returns to replay his role of Klaue from ""Age of Ultron"", providing yet another over the top and energetic performance. His character isn't deep, but he knows how to chew the scenery. Yet again, this man proves he should have more roles, even outside motion capture. Then there is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. I won't spoil his character, but needless to say Jordan continues to show why he is one the new greats by providing an entertainingly defiant and yet emotionally involving villain. It's nice to actually have one that was an understandable reason for his behavior.From the beauty of the advanced world of Wakanda to the superb soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson, the film provides a great blend of native African culture mixed with a futuristic cyberpunk style. The film is downright beautiful at times, especially during the spiritual ancestorial plain scenes. There is even a hint of James Bond through a scene where T'Challa is given a new suit and gadgets ala every Q scene ever. Boseman's charm helps with that vibe too.As I said, the film is not a masterpiece. First off, while I do like the story over all, I do feel like there is was one story going on and the then another one just sorta starts halfway through. The film is pretty focused on Klaue until the halfway point where in which Killmonger suddenly just takes center stage. I found that little jarring. I guess Klaue was just a means to an end. I also found the fight scenes to be rather meh. The action itself is good with some great set-pieces such as cool chase scene in South Korea. I mainly mean the coverage of the one on one fights. They were just shot too close and cut too quick at times, making it hard to really appreciate the conflict. You just get the idea that people are beating down on each other. This is why I praise movies like ""John Wick"" or ""The Foreigner"" for actually covering visible fight scenes. I also found the final conflict at the end to be disappointing as it was ruined by some pretty meh CGI. It honestly looked like a 3D animated cartoon by the end. The CGI was actually iffy in some other areas too, and this late into the MCU that shouldn't be the case. It sorta looks like ""Gods of Egypt"" at times. (A guilty pleasure by the way) Also, some of the camera work as just headache inducing. One shot in particular where it starts upside down and spins around really just hurt my eyes. I get the idea: ""the situation has been turned upside down so let's literally shoot this in an unnerving way"". Ultimately, it just gave me a headache.Despite these issues, I still think ""Black Panther"" is a solid entry in the Marvel cannon and I am excited to see more of Wakanda in the upcoming ""Infinity War"". I just feel some are making this sound better than it really is. It is really good movie, but not a great one. I feel perhaps it might be some the politics of the film that is raising it up to ""masterpiece"" level. I just don't care about that. I just care about whether it was a good movie or not. ""Black Panther"" was good. Recommended.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, when its metecritc score dropped below 100, everyone lost their minds. I actually found a post citing that white crtics gave it a bad review because of racism.

The rest of my family was done after the 30 minute mark. In addition to its technical faults, the film had no message, was rife with identity politics, and was generally bland. When I say identity politics, let me break it down. Nearly all warriors with the exception of the Black Panther are female, it portrays a charicature of African culture despite it being a hyper advanced society, American culture and ideals are made fun of at every opportunity and oh yeah, they had segregated screenings of it.

Black Panther is the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - the eighteenth movie in this grand experiment in an expanded universe. Directed by Hollywood up-and-comer Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), the story follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the titular Black Panther, as he ascends to the throne of Wakanda following the death of his father in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. But things become more complicated when enemies appear, revealing dark family secrets and throwing the nation into turmoil.
Much of the early part of the film is devoted largely to world-building; Wakanda is a place quite unlike any of the rest of the Marvel universe (or the real world, for that matter). Ostensibly a poor, backward African nation (of the sort often described by Western stereotypes), Wakanda is in reality a wealthy technologically-advanced nation thriving in secret due to a rich supply of vibranium fallen centuries past from a meteor. As it has developed in isolation, its technology is fairly dissimilar from even the comics-style depictions of Western technology, and its rich culture, drawn from many real-world African sources, necessitates an exposition-heavy first act. 
The conflict begins when Ulysses Klaue, played by a scenery-chewing Andy Serkis, steals, then attempts to sell a chunk of Wakandan vibranium, and escalates when Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), an associate of Klaue, attempts to seize the throne for himself. This plunges T'Challa and his entourage, including a charmingly out-of-his depth Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross, into a violent power struggle marked by betrayal, sacrifice, and difficult questions concerning power, race, and global geopolitical dynamics.
What works?
While Chadwick Boseman makes an excellent lead, capturing simultaneously the dignity of a king and the ferocity of the Black Panther, the character has since its comics debut in 1966 been best defined by his supporting cast and the world-building around him. Clearly the creative forces behind Black Panther-writer Joe Robert Cole and writer-director Ryan Coogler-understood this point because the supporting cast is excellent and the world-building is as rich and compelling as any put to film. Among the supporting characters it is difficult to choose a single standout, but Black Panther's irreverant tech-genius sister Shuri, played by breakout star Letitia Wright, is hilarious and memorable. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira too is incredibly compelling as the fierce Okoye, leader of the Dora Milaje, the elite squad of Wakandan women who serve as personal bodyguards to the king. Lupita Nyong'o is also quite good as T'Challa's friend and sometime love interest Nakia, while Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Angela Basset, Forest Whitaker, John Kani, and several others do excellent work in smaller roles. One climactic scene in particular showcases several of the supporting actors at their best in a complex and engrossing emotional tableau, making the scene all the more powerful.
Michael B. Jordan's performance is also excellent as Killmonger. Deliberately written to be incongruous as compared to the reserved, dignified Wakandan characters, he embraces the challenge while not ever going overboard (something that unfortunately cannot be said for co-villain actor Andy Serkis). The character himself is good, combing powerful motivations with a compelling and threatening on-screen presence. 
The world-building too is extremely compelling. Wakanda's culture is fleshed out enough that the viewer gets a sense of the rich, deep history defining the nation, and much of the technology is unique and interesting, though occasionally straying too far into comic-book unreality, testing the limits of suspension of disbelief. But the visual landscape of the Wakandan world is intricately designed and incredibly beautiful, and this reviewer for one expects it to garner some well-deserved Oscar attention in the Costume Design, Production Design, and Makeup and Hairstyling categories come next winter. 
Ludwig Göransson's (Get Out, Creed) score is also rich and detailed, largely combining elements of both typical (though beautiful) Hollywood orchestral writing with the vibrant soundscape of traditional African song and drums, though it also incorporates hip-hop elements to great effect, as well as the occasional out-and-out pop or rap song. Between this and last year's Thor: Ragnarok, it seems that Marvel has recognized an oft-leveled criticism that its films' music is typically mediocre orchestral or electronic fare, and allowed its composers to express more individuality and build much more interesting scores (this is the first time I can recall coming out of a Marvel movie humming one of the themes). 
It would be horribly remiss to praise this film without acknowledging Ryan Coogler's superb direction. He showed with Creed that he could stage and orchestrate a fight scene as well as anyone in Hollywood, and with Black Panther he only proved that Creed was no fluke. One beautiful early fight is done mostly in long, smooth takes reminiscent of the one-shot fight from Creed, while a later one is broken and choppy (though always entirely comprehensible) in a way that helps simulate the emotional tone of the scene. The lone car chase in the film too is strong, though occasionally almost tentative, not milking its most exciting ideas for all they could be worth.
But Coogler's action directing is not the only technical aspect worthy of praise. He and cinematographer Rachel Morrison use a camera like Joshua Bell uses a violin-with a deep understanding of the content at play and a laser-like focus on communicating it to the viewer in the most powerful, visually exciting way. Marvel has had good success in the past with lesser-known directors like the Russo brothers, but with Coogler's success here and Taika Waititi's excellent work on Thor: Ragnarok, it seems like Marvel may be changing its modus operandi somewhat and allowing more-established directors to make films with more of their personal style, and it seems like an effective formula.
What doesn't?
Unfortunately, one of the greatest strengths of Black Panther-its rich supporting cast and deep world-building-is ultimately the consequence of one of its greatest downfalls; too many ideas are present for one two-hour film, and some have to suffer for it. The attention to detail devoted to the world of Wakanda and to the characters who populate it comes at the cost of a promising but ultimately flawed villain in Killmonger. Without giving away too much, Killmonger's motivations need a fair amount of exposition and development, plus a well-established, unified, ideologically-developed Wakanda. The latter is largely done, but the former is somewhat lacking. Perhaps the filmmakers would have been better served by saving the Killmonger story for a sequel-Klaue is the original main villain from the Black Panther comics, and would have served perfectly well as a villain for the standalone movie, especially with his role as a directly-opposed outsider reinforcing Wakanda's unity and isolationism, common themes from the comics. Then, with an already-built Wakanda, it would have been much easier to create a deeper thematic challenge with Killmonger. Combining all of the world-building plus two villains leads to an overstuffed plot which ultimately hinders the power of Killmonger as his own villain, though it does also result in a few excellent moments.
Some of the other characters and threads also suffer from this plot density. Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi in particular stands out as a wasted opportunity. Kaluuya has been proving the past few years that he deserves more attention as an actor, and his limited screen time and underdeveloped character are disappointing. Nakia and T'Challa's relationship too is perhaps somewhat underdeveloped when it deserved more.
The humor too is lacking. While the serious tone is a refreshing change after a year of humorous MCU entries, the attempts to interject jokes and humorous moments fall flat far too often; Klaue is much less funny than the writers seemed to think he would be, and there are a couple of jokes which fall depressingly flat-a ""What are thoooose?!"" joke feels dated already and the awkward way in which it's included in the scene feels uncomfortably forced. There are some good humorous moments-Winston Duke's M'Baku stands out in a few funny moments-but overall the humor does little to help the film as a whole.
But is it any good?
Yes! Marvel has a great track record, especially over the past couple years, and Black Panther is an entirely worthy addition to the MCU canon. As a film, it is probably not among the highest echelon of superhero movies, but its flaws do not prevent it from being a well-made, entertaining, and thematically-serious movie. It stands on its own too, and there's certainly no need for a potential viewer to have been caught up on the MCU, so if you like a good superhero movie, good action movie, or good movie in general, this will be right up your alley.
But the merits of Black Panther do not lie only in its successes as a film. Its cultural impact too deserves mention. Between Creed, Moonlight, and Get Out Hollywood has had a strong run of success the past few years from black writers, directors, and actors, and Black Panther represents a breaking-out of this trend into the mainstream. As of this writing, Black Panther has had one of the best Thursday previews of all time, and word-of-mouth certainly seems likely to help rather than hurt it, so it should go on to make a lot of money and good attention for Marvel. It seems that black filmmaking talent is finally coming into its own in Hollywood, and Black Panther should only serve to further this trend.
So all-in-all, Black Panther is a strong addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a successful, if imperfect, standalone movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is also the first entry to have a non-white lead. In fact, almost the entire cast is made up of black actors, making for a welcome change. Here, the story takes place in the fictional African country of Wakanda, following the King of that country, T'Challa, played brilliantly by Chadwick Boseman.Although Wakanda is fictional, director Ryan Coogler and his collaborators do a great job of bringing the place to life. Where it shines most is in its costume and production design, feeling, unlike anything we've seen in a superhero or blockbuster movie before. The culture and royal customs also feel rich and authentic. Where it doesn't work as well as in the landscapes themselves, most of it was shot in Atlanta, Georgia. The Wakandan city of Birnin Zana also feels slightly artificial, like a reused set from Thor Ragnorok that was used for Saakar. The film is also in English, with all of the Wakandan characters speaking with a foreign accent. This does feel a little silly, yet the cast is of the highest calibre here, and they just about get away with it.That being said, the story has an emotional narrative that grabbed me. While it felt fresh and bold, it also felt classic, almost Shakesperean. Not only does Boseman bring complexity to the role of T'Challa, but Michael B. Jordan also shines as the film's primary villain, Killmonger. While it is clear that he is going about things in the wrong way, his character motivations are genuine, and his story is ultimately tragic.Ludwig Göransson delivers an incredible, Oscar-winning score, unlike anything I've heard from a Hollywood film before. It is instantly recognisable as the sound of Wakanda. Along with the music, the visuals are also pretty great, with DP Rachel Morrison doing a stellar job. The particular highlights of the film for me are the scenes in the ancestral plane. They were jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Not only were the visuals beautiful in these scenes, but so were the writing and direction from Coogler.Where the film falls down, however, is in its last act. Up until this point, it has avoided the pitfalls and cliches of most superhero films. Unfortunately, the final act isn't nearly as interesting as we get a reasonably predictable hero versus villain fight. While I would typically be okay with this, given that the rest of the film is so strong, the third-act fight was also poorly choreographed. It felt almost exclusively digital, lacking the physicality needed to really invest in the conflict. At times it even felt like a video game, with some really poor CGI.While it is a shame that the film falters at its final hurdle, there's no denying that this is one of Marvel's stronger outputs. Coogler manages to make a massive blockbuster while also staying true to his roots, crafting a new iconic superhero that would immediately become ingrained in pop culture.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The writing and the acting, on the other hand, are a different matter. Chadwick Boseman as ""T'Challa"" is about as wooden as they come as he returns to rule his outwardly agrarian African nation (""Wakanda"") that secretly has some state-of-the art kit based around a rare, but enormously powerful mineral from outer space. In this particular outing he isn't much helped by Martin Freeman (""Agent Ross"") or Forest Whitaker as the sagely ""Zuri"". Letitia Wright injects some charm as his tech-savvy little sister ""Shuri"" and for a bit at the beginning, Andy Serkis hams up nicely as South African arch villain ""Ulysses Klaue"" (pronounced claw) but once it settles down, it becomes a beautifully shot but rather bland, simplistic right vs wrong, do the right thing type of story. I do like Michael B. Jordan (""Erik"") - here he has a screen presence that is charming, cheeky and he knows how to work an audience - and I have to say I was on his side pretty much from the outset, but sadly though, the ending is never in doubt and with neither suspense nor jeopardy to sustain it's initial promise, ""Black Panther"" just ends up being a great looking, but pretty shallow festival of colour and CGI.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After a brief appearance in Civil War, I was very happy to hear this character getting a solo film. The trailers looked awesome and increased my expectations for it. Finally, after watching the film I can say that it was a great film.Plot: T'Challa returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a long-time adversary, in a conflict with global consequences.Story and direction: Ryan Coogler was the perfect director for this film as he breathed new life in the MCU as he very nicely did it in the Rocky Series. The story very nicely intertwines the African culture along with the issues that every African American faces. This film is not the regular sueprhero film, which makes it stand apart from the rest. The characters of this film also make you glued to the screen. We have T'Challa who has a lot of responsibility not only as king but to the world also as a citizen. Then Killmonger, who also has a point in his statements but goes about it maybe in the wrong way. Which makes his villain mean something and stand-apart. Dora Milaje aspect was also great. The production values are enormous and it feels justified. Also the designs for Wakanda were awesome. It looked like a country that I would like to visit in the future. The background score was awesome. It further infused in the African Culture. Hats off to Ryan and team for the hard work put into this venture. The action scenes although minimal, were awesome and great. Where the film failed were the VFX. Considering that MCU have given great spectacles for almost 10 years now, VFX not being upto the mark is almost equal to a sin. Performance: Chadwick Boseman was great as T'Challa. The various shades of his character were perfectly acted by him. But the icing on the cake was Michael B Jordan. He pulled of the conflicted character with ease. People may not be wrong in saying of him being the best villain since Loki. Lupita N'yongo and Danai Gurira were earnest in their roles. Letitia Wright was quite the Q in this venture. Her comic timing was spot on. Daniel Kaluuya delivered a good performance.Winston Duke was great too. So was Angela Bassett and Martin Freeman. Andy Serkis proves that not is he only great at motion capture but also in real acting too. It was good to see Forest Whittaker and Sterling K Brown utilized nicely. And finally, Stan Le. No Marvel movie is complete without this genius.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where T'Challa comes to know about something in the past and shares his thought with Nakai. Then Nakai says that its upto T'Challa as to what kind of king he wants to be. This scene stuck with me as this showed even though Wakanda was the most advanced technologically but the people using it are humans.Verdict: Although it may not be the best of MCU, but it still is an enjoyabke and entertaining film for me. I had a great time with this film and yes, if you are wondering, I had to wait till the credits as there are post credit scenes in this film. Can't wait for Infinity War. I am going with a 9/10.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The crux of most of this movie is the black experience told from various angles. If all you're interested in is fight sequences and cars blowing up, then this is not the movie for you. If you're interested in watching a story about abandonment, colonialism, nationalism, and other complex topics then this is the movie for you. If you are unfamiliar with the black experience and black culture then yes this movie may go over your head and you may view it as boring. I'm NOT saying this is only for black people, but to understand the essence of a complex movie like this you need to understand black culture and history. I won't even get started on talking about how impactful this movie is for young black people to see themselves as heroes and as the majority and not the minority on the big screen, I'll be typing a whole dissertation lol.The acting is pretty solid. Cinematography & wardrobe were fantastic. I really think the unsung hero is Winston Duke. He's got some great acting chops and a firm grasp on African mannerisms. I hope to see more of him soon. Other than that, it's a pretty solid movie and I'll probably see it again.","10 out of 42 found this helpful.

The costumes, sets, and music are great, the action is good, but the script itself is a little wanting. Frankly, I could scrap the whole first 45 minutes of the film. Other than the action scenes the first 45 minutes are a bit flat, meandering, boring, and the story doesn't really begin until 45 minutes in. That's just bad scripting. I'm willing to forgive it's the same plot as the Lion King, 'cause it manages to be entertaining, but, it would have been nice if they'd stretched their imagination a bit further. There aren't many movies set in Africa, let alone commercial films, so, come on, give it a little more thought. The side characters, like his sister, girlfriend, main guard, and ally/adversary were the highlights for me. The Black Panther character was a bit...bland. Kind of like a boring Batman. Likable, but not much to him. The sister is the most likable. Honestly, I would have rather seen a movie about her. The women really steal the show in this film, along with the big dude from the neighboring tribe who challenges BP in the beginning.Maybe now that the world of BP has been set up the next one will be better? The writers don't seem to be particularly seasoned, so, I'm willing to cut them a little room, they just seem like they need to brush up on their plotting skills a bit. The whole, two bad guys thing just didn't work. It was like the first 45 minutes was practically a different film and totally unnecessary, other than the 3 minute scene to give the bad guy a reason for why he was bad. Other than that, the entire 45 minutes were utterly useless. The object they're trying to get ahold of isn't even relevant or necessary to the plot. All it does is lead the BP to the villains. In Raiders of the Lost Ark the Ark is relevant even until the last shot of the film which is why there is so much tension and it keeps you following along the whole way. The Wakanda axe was sort of like a weak Indiana Jones plot thrown in there that soon became irrelevant. If they cut out the first 45 minutes and tidied it up I probably would have given it an 8. That was the movie, the rest was just a loooong, drawn out filler. The female guards were awesome. The main one, and the whole battalion. I preferred them to the Amazons in Wonder Woman. Actually, throw the Wakanda women in a movie with Wonder Woman and the Amazons and I will totally watch that. I know, they don't do DC and Marvel crossovers, but that would really make the best of those two worlds. Okay, how about the Wakanda women and the Valkyries from Thor? There should be a good Marvel team-up of the ladies. Really, all the straight, white dude, superhero stuff is pretty stale. I only went to see BP 'cause the costumes and sets looked great and I had hopes, but wasn't exactly holding my breath given the way Marvel and DC just churn them out with only a few good ones that stand out from the mass of mediocre and bad.Anyway, worth a viewing in the theatre since this movie won't really hold up on the small screen.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The problem is that the writers/director don't trust that you are bright enough to get the underlying political message, so they blast it at you. Hmmmmm...from out of nowhere comes the evil , vicious contender to lead the nation by using military force and and adherence to a nationalistic philosophy? Hmmmm...a nation that does not want to let outsiders contaminate the fabric of their society? Then, just as a story, the whole thing is preposterous - they have a gazillion tons of what must be a radioactive rock, but no one has found them because they are covered by trees.The only saving grace of this movie is that they did not find a way to get Mark Wahlberg, Samuel L Jackson or The Rock in it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was everything I wanted it to be and more.The Pros are endless. The acting alone is worth notifying. Daniel Kaluuya, Andy Serkis, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker and Michael B. Jordan all do fantastic.But it all really does come down to the performance of Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther himself, doesn't it? I'l tell you what, he is stellar. His performance as T'challa is so subtle and so on point with the comics, which I'm a huge fan of.Next up, the action scenes/directing. I could not be happier for Ryan Coogler right now, with this, Creed, and Fruitvale Station. I do have to say I was a bit dissapointed with the final fight, but that's mostly on the lighting team.The story is great, the cast is great, the overall movie as a whole is great. I have but one flaw with it and this flaw could be considered a nitpick by many.My flaw is that it does become the stereotypical marvel movie once in a while. There are certain character actions that wouldn't make sense in the actual tone that the movie presents us with, times where a character makes an unnecessary pun, and even an SUV chase towards the middle of the film.I overall loved Black Panther. It has a very essential meaning to it that I personally think everyone will grasp hold of and also fun sequences that everyone will enjoy.Black Panther gets an A or on an Imdb scale, a 9","7 out of 27 found this helpful.

Our characters are incredible: Lettita Wright as Shuri gives us that comic-sarcastic touch totally of the MCU, Lupita Nyong'o gives us a warrior totally loyal to her nation, Michel B. Jordan as Killmonger us one of the best villains of the MCU, with good motivations, which make the viewer doubt if in reality he is on a good path. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther to whom we see him defending his nation, and upholding his beliefs and decisions.
In particular, the film is excellent breaking the mold of the latest films of the MCU, has a serious tone, action at the most, and a good subject to reflect.

I didn't have an issue with either, the story was fine to me and the effects were great, I'm not sure what movie or what version a lot of these one star votes were watching, but it seems that the hatred is just clutching at straws. As is the other bugbear some have with the soundtrack, I mean really?I do feel that Black Panther was overrated and unnecessarily hyped but given the cast, the environment it's set in and the current political climate, particularly in the U.S, it was always going to be a vehicle for various agendas, so it was never going to be received as just another Marvel movie. Much in the same way that the O.J Simpson trial was never just another trial. However I easily looked past all that and just enjoyed the movie. I expected mostly black actors, it is set primarily in Africa as he is an African superhero, but according to some, they liked him better in Civil War rather than this. I guess that it's easier on the eye seeing a black actor surrounded by white people than the alternative in Black Panther. As for the humour, I wasn't aware that every Marvel movie had to be a laugh riot. They attempted that with Thor Ragnarok and people hated it, there was less humour in this and yet, people still hated it, so you're damned if you do and equally damned if you don't. There was enough humour in this to generate a few laughs in the cinema, so again, what version were a lot of these people watching? The car chase scene through the streets of Korea was great as well as entertaining and funny in parts, so I can't help but feel that people are voting this down for nitpicking reasons as opposed to their real reason, which ultimately wouldn't be allowed on IMDB.The one thing I do agree with is the lack of any real villain but it doesn't automatically make the movie boring, it fits in nicely with the rest of the MCU. Lets stop listening to overhyped and politically charged reviews, lower our expectations back to normal levels and enjoy these movies for what they are.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well it's safe to say whilst this movie isn't perfect it's easily the best MCU movie ever. Its groundbreaking and very entertaining, Coogler hit this one out of the ballpark.Characters both good and evil have depth, the story which picks up where Civil War left is both a continuation and stand alone story. New comers will feel at home. Michael B Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger has elevated MCU villains to new heights. He will have a long lasting impact and has raised the standard for villains in cinema. The movie is for everyone of all races, political leanings or ages. This is first and foremost a fun movies. Veteran actors Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker, give stunning performances complimented by their younger counterparts Lupita, Danai and co.Black Panther is not perfect , its a 9/10, but I rated it 10 to counter the mass 1 star ratings.

It isn't the best Marvel movie ever made, but it is definitely up there. DO NOT listen to everyone who is saying this movie was overhyped, and overrated, this was a great movie that deserves recognition. I liked just like Spider-Man: Homecoming, they were able to tie this in with Captain America: Civil War. This one wasn't as direct as Homecoming was, but it still had the reminiscence of what happened during Civil War. I still find it hard to believe that this movie was the only Marvel movie to win at the Oscars, and what it won for definitely deserved it. It won best achievement in music, best achievement in production design, and best achievement in costume design. The score for this movie was absolutely phenomenal, Ludwig Göranson is amazing. Whatever music he does for tv or movies is always great. His work on the Mandalorian was some of the best I have ever seen. The Black Panther score in my opinion was the best in the MCU so far. I don't know why Marvel Studios doesn't invite him to do more for them. This movie also won best achievement in production design. I 100% agree. They way they made Wakanda look was phenomenal, and the sets they used for scenes like the Ancestral Plane, the Garden of the Heart Shaped Herb, the ritual combat arena, and M'Baku's throne were breathtaking. Shuri's lab was also pretty cool. Lastly this movie won an Oscar for best achievement in costume design. The wardrobe for this movie was great, the way everyone was dressed in what they definitely made look like a traditional African wardrobe was great. Also, the Black Panther and Killmonger suits were so cool. No only was this movie good for all that, it also had a great plot, an even better story, and amazing acting. I was blown away once again at how well the people Marvel casts can act in their roles.I 100% recommend watching this movie, it is great all around, and it never gets old.R. I. P Chadwick Boseman

There is an awful lot of hate in some of these reviews...and we all know exactly why. It was beautifully shot and superbly acted with a wonderful plot and well written storyline. Ranking among the best movies I've ever seen, definitely the best Marvel movie, and without question the best superhero movie. This sets a standard, like Deadpool, Winter Soldier, and the Dark Knight series, but easily surpasses them. Definitely a contender for next award season.You can't call yourself a fan of Black Panther, Marvel, comic book movies, fantasy, or movies in general, and hate on this one. What Coogler and company did here is truly special. And to only be his third film? Well deserving of the budget. So, let me try to do this with no spoilers...T'Challa/Black Panther is the king of Wakanda, a landlocked country, hidden from the world, located in Southeast Africa. It boasts the most technologically advanced society on the planet, yet still maintains its traditionalist culture. For those surprised, even angered (triggered) by the fact that a movie based in Africa, about a country that has never been colonized, boasts a virtually all Black cast....duh! Really? What did you expect? Applying various aspects borrowed from many very real cultures and societies from across the continent helped to bring this masterpiece to life and connect to not only those who felt they've been largely ignored, those of African decent, but it also seemed to resonate well with people across the globe. This is a worldwide cultural phenomenon. The rapid success at the box office testifies to this fact. Truth be told, even the amount of hate it continue receive just goes to show how powerful and positive this movie is. There are actual campaigns designed to bring it down...futilely, but these efforts do exist.Each character played his or her part very well in this play. Each represents a portion of they global African diasporal mindset. From T'Challa, to Killmonger, to Nakia, M'Baku, Okoye, Shuri, and beyond...each showing that Black people abroad are not a monolith. That although we may have differing ideas, philosophies, languages, cultures, etc., we can still form a fully functional society, contrary to what's been shown in the past -or even what continues to be shown today. It also asks the question ""what would Africa, and the world, be without colonialism, European imperialism, and interference?""If you view each character as a representation of a philosophy, it takes on a totally new and exciting perspective. Traditionalism vs modernism, globalism vs isolationism, loyalty vs ambition, sins of the father vs self atonement and forgiveness...I could go on, and on, but what it does not trod out are the tired old tropes; men vs women, all evil vs all good (there's really no such thing anymore), etc. There's no deranged bad guy trying to take over the world just because he's bored, or destroy it because he didn't get pancakes. These characters are 100% human and relatable. They're flawed, opinionated, funny, brilliant, brave, and true to themselves. They love, they fear, the get angry, they hurt, they laugh...what more can you ask for? And for those who have a problem because they're Black despite the very obvious fact that they're African), just pretend they're white...like Hollywood has been doing since it's inception. Or you can just get over it.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

T'Challa (Boseman) - first introduced in 'Captain America: Civil War' - becomes King of Wakanda (a fictional African country) and has to deal with the dual responsibilities of following traditions, keeping his family and country safe and being the Black Panther (basically Batman - rich guy who can fight good and has a good suit and gadgets). There's a really great support cast - Killmonger (Jordon) as the long-lost cousin, Nakia (Nyong'o) as the ex-girlfriend/conscience, Okoye (Gurira) as his General, Ross (Freeman) as the CIA agent, Klaue (Serkis) as the mercenary, Zuri (Whitaker) as the shaman, Shuri (Wright) as his sister, Ramonda (Bassett) as his mum and W'Kabi (Kaluuya) as his best friend. However, Boseman really carries the film, with a lot of poise and calmness, but then extreme passion when needed. The plot's not too complicated and has an obvious ending, but the 2 & a quarter hours are well worth it.There's plenty of stunning CGI (probably too much, since none of the film was actually shot in Africa, a big shame - feels like if they filmed in South Korea, they could go to Kenya or Zimbabwe for a few real-life shots), a good tribal-drum score, some great action scenes and plenty of hand-to-hand combat scenes too. However, at it's heart is a good story of responsibility and doing what's right over what's easy or the usual way.","7 out of 28 found this helpful.

Black Panther follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, an advanced and highly powerful territory that is disguised as a third-world country. He also protects his nation and its people as a masked vigilante called the Black Panther. After the death of his father, T'Challa is chosen to take the throne and receive the powers of the panther god. Just after his extravagant coronation, a threat finds its way into Wakanda's borders by Erik Killmonger. Killmonger is a fierce and skilled soldier who wishes to replace T'Challa and usher in a new age for the country. T'Challa will be tested and must protect the throne from Killmonger.My favorite character is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's whizkid sister who helps him maintain the mantle of Black Panther and stay one step ahead of the villains he faces. Letitia Wright delivers hilarious one-liners with near perfect timing. She nails the rapport between Shuri and her brother, interacting in a way that is both believable and develops both their characters.An outstanding performance in this film comes from Michael B. Jordan who is brilliant as Killmonger. He abandons the genre's usual vague ""destroy-the-world"" motivation and creates a genuinely complicated character. Jordan has cutthroat moments that make you dread his presence, but his sinister manner is evened out by moments where you come to sympathize with his character.The deep, emotional part of the film's story is unexpected and caught me by surprise. It is an important moment for the main character and what drives his actions for the rest of the film. Sometimes, these comic-book heroes make poor decisions and have to fight against their own demons as well as the bad guys. This has been done before in both comics and film, but here we really see T'Challa change through his experiences. I recommend this film to ages 12 to 18. There is some action and violence with spears and swords that feels more violent than what I'm used to from comic book films. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Black Panther is easily one of the greatest comic-book films I've seen. Period.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

There are certain films that spark phenomenons for certain cultures in unexplainable ways while still maintaining the intent for enjoyment for others. Black Panther emerged from the Captain America: Civil War film and gave the audience only a feeling of what to expect from the land of Wakanda, but also brought the audience even more than one would expect from a Marvel movie.The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) as he takes the throne as king of Wakanda after the death of his father. As he returns home and settling within his position, he also comes across people who challenge his abilities as a king and the sins of his fathers past.Ryan Coogler as a director really delivers a gorgeous movie (his third film so far, Creed & Fruitvale Station) and stage Wakanda beautifully from the world building to the eclectic costume design. The characters motivations feel sharper than ever, and never fears making references that make the audiences laugh and snap their fingers. Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is one of the few MCU villains that has a believable motivation but a shockingly raw reason to his plan that many might find themselves asking the same thing.While the cinematography can be really good at times, it can be shaky at moments as well. The very first fight scene takes place in the dark, and with the gunfire and fast cutting, it can be a little shaky on the eyes at times deciphering whats happening. Also the CGI in some points, particularly in a ""Coming to America"" style christening, I felt a little deja vu from old cutout characters from old video games. And while there's more than enough action to spare in this film, I could have used a little bit of space in between each action scene.Black Panther nonetheless is still a very rousing kind of superhero movie that takes on a couple interesting themes. There's excitement, and really challenges the power dynamic when the shoe is on the other foot. Find the biggest screen you can and be ready to take a trip that you may not want to come back from.","6 out of 23 found this helpful.

The women are AMAZING. The score and sound design are incredible - it's the best score I've ever heard in any film. It's visually beautiful beyond description. I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel film, and I like Marvel films. It has IDEAS, political thought and a worldview in a way that no other Marvel film has attempted, and is meaningful and resonant in a way blockbusters almost never are. It's deeply non-western. The villain's motivation is understandable and relatable, overcoming the MCU villain problem for probably the first time ever. The cast are tremendous. It's an afrofuturist dream and is, throughout, deeply moving. It's transformative not feelgood, deep not glib, unifying and courageous not divisive. It's better than Harry Potter, better than LOTR, better than The Hunger Games, better than the entire MCU. It takes everything tired about the superhero/epic fantasy/""hero's journey"" genre and transcends/ reconceptualizes it in a way that's never expected and consistently thrilling and gripping. It's impeccably paced and structured and flows completely naturally (in a world where blockbusters are so often a series of setpieces bridged by interstitial dialogue) - it's logical and coherent with plot and character in perfect harmony, nothing feels contrived, committee-written, focus-grouped or market-tested. I'm in absolute raptures over it. It kicks its entire genre out of the park.This is a film that says you don't have to give up your traditions to be modern and developed. That non-westerners shouldn't be ashamed of their culture and give up their customs, their dress, their music, their dances, everything that gives their culture an identity and that's grown up over hundreds of years, in the rush to westernize. That allows its characters to debate the merits and drawbacks of isolationism versus outreach. This is a revolutionary film that should and will have a huge cultural footprint lasting decades and mean a lot to so many young people. It not only articulates debates between constructive activism and destructive activism, hard and soft power, but has the conviction of its principles to come down on one side of them. It deserves to have a cultural impact as big as the original Star Wars.","10 out of 46 found this helpful.

"9","/10","The hype is very real for this both typical and different Marvel movie; go watch it!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4066318/?ref_=tt_urv","Tkbn3812","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67900317/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2018","Black Panther has been one of the most anticipated movies of 2018, hype building up globally as the world waited for its release. Its near perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes has done nothing but exacerbate this hype, and I can confirm that the hype is definitely justified. Black Panther probably won't start the conversations about race that some critics might have you thinking, but it's just such a tasteful, entertaining, unique movie that does so much more than your typical Marvel flick.The film is set about a week after the events of Civil War, where T'Challa's father was killed at a bombing at a UN Convention in Vienna. T'Challa is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his father and the king of Wakanda, the setting of the entire film. It's this struggle that the movie focuses on at first.The movie unfolds rather neatly, especially for a Marvel film, with the majority of the film centring in Wakanda. (Seems like Marvel's doing a lot more location centralisation; GOTG2 is mainly on Ego's planet, Thor: Ragnarok has a lot on Sakaar...it's better this way). I think some of the key highlights of Black Panther have to be the characters. Chadwick Boseman shines as T'Challa; seriously, his silent bad-assery is stunning. Shuri, T'Challa's sister, is probably my favourite character in the film, she's just really funny and sweet. Nakia and Okoye are both very powerful female characters in the film, both taking their turns in guiding T'Challa in his times of need.It's definitely the villain that many have really loved about this movie. Personally, while I loved Killmonger, I think maybe it would've been cooler if we got to delve a little more into his backstory and really understand his motives. Also, Claw is...just there...but when he is, he's fine. Martin Freeman returns as Agent Ross from Civil War, and while I'll readily admit I didn't need to see him back, it's nice to see him take on a bigger role in this movie as we delve more into his character.I feel like Marvel movies are slowly becoming more and more grounded as Marvel mature, and that definitely shows in Black Panther. The film is easily their most mature film yet; Thor: Ragnarok is plain fun, Spiderman Homecoming is just another packed Spiderman film, but Black Panther feels very deep and important. It explores very important themes, that of race, of T'Challa's moral battles, the theme of leadership and monarchy...Marvel have proved time and again that a superhero movie can be a comedy, and now they've just proven they can also be something so much more meaningful.You see, Black Panther is a very neat film. You can lose yourself in the stunning action of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but Black Panther will keep you engaged in its meaningful story, embroiled in its chief themes. All the characters shine as they deliver the movie's message about the challenges of being a leader, and the consequences of every action, big and small. I don't want to give the plot away, but its themes are what set it apart from any other Marvel film.Now, I can't say it's a perfect movie. I did like Killmonger, but let's be honest; at the end of the day, he's just another Marvel villain. Basically that means he just feels like he's there...never much of a huge threat. (I mean we already KNOW that Black Panther survives already, we saw him in the Infinity War trailer!) It's basically the same feeling for Claw. There's also Killmonger's girlfriend who we never really get to see that much of, which is sorta a shame, I guess I can forgive that though.Also, I think the soundtrack of this movie was a real highlight. I don't like trap music at all but I think it actually blended with this movie reasonably well. The soundtrack also sounded very traditional-African, especially given that Wakanda is a fake-country. That's actually one of the things you have to remember about this movie; it's as though it's trying hard to respect Wakandan culture, even though this culture is completely fictional. But hey, that's fine, right?In the end, there's isn't all that much to fault about Black Panther. I think its themes are its real strong point. Okay, so while it's got powerful themes at the end of the day it's still a superhero movie, so don't expect to be blown out of your socks. But still, it's just got such great, well-rounded characters that you find yourself really believing in, and a very nice, neat story. If you watch any movie before summer ends (it's summer here in Australia), make sure it's Black Panther. Many critics have called it the best movie in the MCU; I might not go quite as far to make that claim, but it's definitely close. Go and watch it, and make the choice for yourselves.","7 out of 29 found this helpful.

I wouldn't call it a ""black movie"" and just label it like that. It was a genuinely good superhero movie. Michael B. Jordan was SO good as Kilmonger and by the end of the movie you really do sympathize with him (just as you did with Loki) Really loved Leticia's Shrui and Duke's Baku, both brought the classic Marvel humor. As an asian, I really think its important to see all types of people in pop culture. Again there is no such thing as race, we are all human. Growing up watching Disney princess movies, I would always play Jasmine since she looked the most like me (I'm still growing up) but its so important for kids to see heroes who look like them. Wonder Woman was also really great because I saw a badass female superhero and it really did feel good. I would definitely recommend this movie!! Negatives: I wish the movie paced properly, the start was kind of slow and then the end was way too fast. I wish more songs from the soundtrack were included","7 out of 29 found this helpful.

I felt compelled to counter all the surprisingly negative reviews to what I felt was an amazingly portrayed piece of cinema.
First of all Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa (& IRL) was everything. His charm & charisma set the tone for the world that is Wakanda (forever X). The colorful cinematography & wardrobe was top notch. While not a devout Marvel fan I think the film stood on its own with enough backstory for hardcore comic fans.
The action scenes were thrilling especially anytime the Dora Milaje & their fearless leader occupied the screen.. Of course Black Panther & Killmonger were good also (too much green screen for my taste).
I enjoyed the supporting characters, imagery & storyline.
Defiantly more relatable to me than any other comic book movie, it felt real, empowering & refreshingly new. A must see in my opinion and according to box office sales a whole lot of others too.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

And when it was finally over I thought ''Well, it has his moments and it's generally good''. Then I looked on IMDB and I noticed many reviews with 1s and 2s from probably people who hated seeing a superhero movie with an all black cast or about an obscure African culture (though a bit fictionalized) or perhaps people who wanted to lower its score down. but also lots of positive reviews. And this will be one of them.The movie is about the protector of the Wakanda, prince T'Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman) who is also the most important black superhero, the Black Panther (named this way because of the suit he wears). In the beginning there is the reunion scene with lots of great shots of the African canyons and the scene when he is confirmed Prince of the Wakanda after a fight with a pretendent. Soon his life is in jeopardy as there is an object full of vibranium stolen in a museum and the robber is then killed. The body is taken to the Wakanda by Killmonger, a young mercenary that wants to defeat T'Challa and initially succedds. After T'Challa is found comatose is woken up by his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and manages a rebellion to defeat his enemies.As I said in the summary this is a very revolutionary superhero movie as it's about the first important black superhero (as STEEL and SPAWN were bombs at the box office back in the 1990s despite there was the BLADE trilogy with Wesley Snipes) and it also deals with the thieft of precious substances such as vibranium.The cast is top-notch. Chadwick Boseman (who passed away tragically last August at the age of only 43) gives a great performance as the title hero, and the fact that during filming he was battling cancer just shows us how much a great actor he was. Michael B. Jordan gives a great and solid performance as Killmonger, as he actually plays a likeable villain. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis have lots of chemistry in their few scenes together. Winston Duke, Lupita Nyongo, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker are the most known names of all the other black actors in the cast.I re-watched this movie the day after Chadwick Boseman tragically died and I think I appreciated it even more. However this is one of those superhero movies that fans of the genre will no doubtly love and in hindsight it's just like most of the first chapters of the Marvel movies (the first IRON MAN, the first THOR and the others).","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

As for hype, what superhero movie doesn't get the hype machine treatment. If you're saying people were overly eager for the movie due to the black director, 95% black cast and unpresidented theme of female empowerment, without nary a slave in the story, then hell yeah, sign me up for that hype! Those factors aren't the only reasons I loved it, but they play a big role, so sue me for being excited by and appreciative of how it all came together. I think the money it has made worldwide and repeat views speak louder than any keyboard warrior army bent on trying to curb your enthusiasm (shout out to you Larry D!).

This movie portrays and expresses some things that are very rarely seen or heard of in any movies that we presently see on tv or in theaters. Black men in power successfully leading others, respected intelligent and creative Black women, Black people working together to achieve things, sharing technology, key phrases that are prophetic to those who understand the changes that are occurring right now in our world. This movie itself is a multi-layered anomaly that terrifies some who understand the power of movies and music to influence real world societies. YES, it is exceptionally entertaining and definitely stirs the pots of racial biases, cracking and reforming the molds of what we are used to seeing and hearing on our screens. This movie is blazing a whole new path to the future and opening minds of the money makers to new ideas being possible and profitable. This is why ""the haters"" are doing everything they can including falsely rating the movie poorly, to stop people from seeing this movie. THIS MOVIE IS JUST THAT GOOD.

I really like the world building of Wakanda, as well as the cinematography and costume design. The cast are, as expected, excellent as well.Chadwick Boseman is terrific as T'Challa, as I knew he would be based on the glimpse we see of him in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. He is the best actor here, but Danai Gurira runs him close. I'm a huge fan of Gurira's due to her performances in 'The Walking Dead' so knew I'd rate her here too, she's fun to watch - it's cool to see her weapon-wielding once again.Elsewhere, Lupita Nyong'o is good and so is Letitia Wright; she's great in 2015's 'Urban Hymn', which I had seen her in previously. It's a fairly stacked cast, with the likes of Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis, Daniel Kaluuya and Michael B. Jordan also appearing; Jordan's character isn't the best, but he himself is more than solid.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o where especially bland. Found myself hoping they would be killed off by the end.Plot was the same as every other heroes quest plot. Except with less (zero) hero development. I've seen Roger Ramjet and Banana Man episodes with more hero development than the entire movie. Not even close to Marvel's lowest standards.Same for the villain. He was more vanilla than villain. Although he just barely had more character than the Hero.Fight scenes where dull, poorly motivated, poorly filmed and had little reason or logic. for the 40% where I could see what was going on I was mostly wondering why it was going on and why they weren't trying harder. I've seen better action filmed with a vibrating phone and posted to youtube with the wrong aspect ratio.CGI was horrible and glaringly obvious so much so they actually had special sound effects to warn you that the cgi was happening. Sound effects also had bad computer generated sound. Like 80's video games had a love child with 80's synth. The Black Panther suit was especially bad, Looked some kind of bulletproof hologram. Which could have been cool if thats what they where going for.Picture quality was really bad. I watched on a V-Max screen. It was very blurry. Not sure if this was just the cinema or if its the source material. Seemed to be worse in some places than others so likely the cinematography.
 Fight scenes where shaky and poorly framed, Futuristic city was out of scene, blurry and not very futuristic or believable. Looked like someone over polished a generic USA city and badly photo-shopped into India, not Africa. Except they still had bad (American) graffiti tags in the background. Was all shiny metal from a distance then grafiti concrete when up close... Overall was very confusing, not sure if futuristic slum was the angle or if was simply edited by a blind person who was so drunk they forgot half the cgi backgrounds.From a sci-fi point of view the futuristic tech was also really bland, clunky and left me wondering why.Politically The theme of hating everyone thats not descendant from Africa was simmering away the whole time. Found that pretty off-putting. Its not 1970 anymore. Re-visiting the politics of the Black Panther political party was pretty crass.Overall it left me with the impression that the marvel no longer wants to produce the content that made them famous but still want to cash in with out putting the effort in. Don't pay to see this. Might be worth watching on free to air tv if you're really bored and only get one station.","109 out of 269 found this helpful.

The Movie Takes place 1 Week After the Events of Civil War,Where T'Challa is mourning his father's death as he takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a fictional African nation ""hiding in plain sight"". But Things Shake Up When Movie's Main Erik Killmonger Played By Michael B. Jordan Comes into the Narrative Which Slowly Becomes one of the Best things about the Movie. Erik Killmonger's Motivation And intentions is Much More Deep And Complex Than showed in the trailer. One Of The Best Things About This Movie is how Every character from T'Challa , Killmonger to Other Supporting Characters is Really Well Written.
Coogler Doesn't Shy Away away from Breaking the Normal Superhero Theme Mould And Takes the writing into an Interesting Direction And Wins Another Gold For Marvel, Also the Movie Has Stunning Visuals And Badass Action Sequences.
Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa Or Black Panther is amazing in his Role And His Chemistry With Letitia Wright Who plays his Sister Shuri is a Delight to Watch. Other Actors Like Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue), Angela Bassett,Lupita Nyong'o,Danai Gurira,Daniel Kaluuya,Martin Freeman,Florence Kasumba Does Jobs but it's Michael B. Jordan Who Steals The Show With his Portrayal Of Erik Killmonger.
A Special Mention to Kendrick Lamar For His Great Soundtrack Which Lights up Every Single Scene Whenever it plays on the Screen.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

In a way it's a movie that makes the case for a superhero ethic.Black Panther is a king of Wakanda, an advanced technological nation that tells the world it's a third-world African country in order to stay under the radar. Because of the charade, Wakanda does little for earth, hoarding its technology and resources and leaving the rest of the world to manage without it. Much of the film isn't about being a hero; it's about the hunt for a criminal.For a good chunk of the time, the movie focuses more on interpersonal drama and world-building than action. This world-building is impressive; Wakanda seems like a very real place, offering an African nation that combines, like other high tech countries like Japan, ancient traditions with modernity. It's a country that shows little influence from the west.This is also a movie that, like Mad Max: Fury Road, has a ton of strong women. Outside of the star, the heroes are women, and with a minor exception, all the bad guys are men (including a terrific Andy Serkis).Outside of a wonderful chase scene, all the really great action comes in the end, with a massive, lengthy battle on multiple fronts that is electrifying throughout.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's intricate, filled with such a world, and remains entertaining all the same.Writing/Direction: Ryan Coogler, man. Yes. The dude really knows how to make a movie. From his directional touch that really pulls us into the world of Wakanda to the writing that creates such vivid characters that really go to their full potential, Ryan Coogler has created a masterpiece not only as a superhero movie, but as a general film.Performances: Chadwick Boseman IS T'challa and is practically perfect in his casting. He's great, no denying it. The thing that intrigued me, however, is how he seemed a bit outplayed by his supporting ensemble. No offense to Chadwick, but there's a lot more at play than the lead in this film and I really appreciate that. The women of Wakanda are especially badass. Lupita, Danai, and Letita shine as Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively. They're fantastic female characters who have fantastic performers behind them. I could say some stuff about Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis, who both give off appealing enough performances, Angela Basset, who practically plays herself (very well I might add), the formidable and capable Winston Duke, and Daniel Kalluya, who continues to hold his own. However, I firmly believe none of them hold a candle to Michael B. Jordan's performance as the central villain, Erik Killmonger. He gains our sympathy throughout the film while still being a fairly intimidating villain with complex motives and reasoning that makes the viewer (and T'challa) think. He gives a performance that puts him at the top of the Marvel villain list (not quite at the top of all CBM villains, I mean, Heath Ledger amiright?).I still insist on praising just about every aspect of this film. Tell me you haven't listened to Ludwig Goranssen's killer soundtrack and it hasn't gotten stuck in your head. Tell me you weren't mesmerized by the production design that made Wakanda so palatable. Tell me you weren't impressed by the beautiful costumes, well-choreographed fights, and awesome cinematography that was shown throughout. (The only thing that holds merit is some CGI issues, but even then, consider their challenge and look at the beautiful establishing shots of Wakanda and tell me that's not some beautifully rendered CGI.)Black Panther is a fully realized world with vibrant characters and an engrossing tale and serves as a new standard for filmmaking.

In fact, it became suspiciously clear that the movie may be compensating for something.And also in fact, I admit being turned off because every web page I visited, every trailer I wanted to see, everywhere I turned, Black Panther's ads were in my face worse than a mobile service provider or insurance ad. At least those didn't take over what I am trying to read.So, seriously, I knew there was going to be political and social messages, I can't think of any Marvel or DC superhero movie that doesn't have one. I accept that the atrocities that have happened and happen today in Africa can be powerfully addressed in a mainstream movie, indeed I was looking forward to it.What I think is a shame is how that chance was buried beneath magical technology. I know, I know. The comic book version made it work. On big screen, the costume-change was more absurd than when Wonder Woman spun around in a blast of light. And I know so many of the others in the Marvel universe have blingie wardrobe swapping also, so why should this movie's bother me?Because it distracts from the already stressed-out plot. I wouldn't begrudge an ethnic or gender group the privilege to share the same insta-powers and unbelievable technology or give airtime to diversity (I'm still waiting for Colossus to come out!) but in this case, Marvel did the genre a disservice. Why oh why wasn't I consulted on these nuances?Just as Marvel Studio spent too much money on marketing, they spent too much money on focus groups. They are trying to appeal to a specific audience and yet maintain balance and it doesn't work. What could have been a beautiful and strong story ends up being overhyped, muddied, and ultimately ungraceful in the face of a diverse culture's own depth of flavor and strength.I agree with Roger Moore's Metacritic score of 63, and I still look forward to future additions to the Black Panther series, with hopefully more elegant approaches and culturally worthy scripting.Oh, and while the 'white boy' comment maybe culturally authentic, it was just as unwelcome as the 'n'-word.Edit: And btw while Blade was the first black Marvel hero on screen, nobody bothers to mention Storm being the first AFRICAN hero on screen, but gosh all the street-racer thug wannabes can't relate to her much, not enough 'tude.","52 out of 121 found this helpful.

Wakanda is considered a third world country isolated from the rest of the world, but due to a meteorite that landed in Wakanda that contained Vibranium, the hardest metal in the Universe, the people were able to advance in technology and do not want to share their technology with the rest of the world for fear the Vibranium would be weaponized and constant wars would result. When T'Challa drinks a special herb affected by the Vibranium he gains superhuman powers and is known as the Black Panther. Okay, that's only half of the story that you need. The next half is that M'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges King T'Challa and beats him in a King's Challenge and throws him over the waterfall and all believe T'Challa is dead; M'Baku wants to sell Vibranium to all countries to help the downtrodden peoples of the world have a chance at a better life and not caring about the consequences of wars among the countries.
 
So these are the 2-issues you need to focus on. There are some other issues, but you only need these two main ones. Oh, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) T'Challa's love interest wants Wakanda to share its technology with the rest of the world. T'Challa isn't too keen on this. The Hype this movie received is well worth all the publicity. The sets are outstanding, the fight scenes and plane battles are expertly choreographed as much CGI is incorporated. The acting all around is spot on. No doubt about it, this movie delivers. The only thing I had trouble with were the darkened scenes in the beginning. Then later at the end we see the fight between the NOW Two Kings and Black Panthers: T'Challa and M'Baku at the end as those scenes were very dark taking place in an underground railroad of sorts. Normally, in a movie like this there is some humor and here there is only one instance. When T'Challa's mother asks for help from another regional King to help defeat new King M'Baku, he gets annoyed and says he will feed these people to his children. Then he laughs and says, ""No that is not true as we are Vegans"" and he continues to laugh at his own joke. Notables: Forest Whitaker as Zuri; Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue; Martin freeman as Everett K. Ross, a CIA agent.Stan Lee makes an appearance at a casino craps table. He is now probably busy writing a sequel.There is very good heart stomping music throughout. The hype was good and the movie delivered and now we wait for the sequels. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Brief. Language: Brief soft stuff.
Rating: A","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

So I decided to forget all that, when i went to see the movie.I believe the critics were right. This is a wonderful movie. It's totally deserving of every bit of praise it gets. It looks terrific. Top marks to costume and production design. It has good acting. Although let's be honest, Andy Serkis steals the movie. But i suppose, anyone who gives as loud a performance, as he does was going to be noticed. But as brought up when introducing the main villains, it's not the first time, whites have stolen from blacks. I also liked that the movie wasn't afraid to have some quiet moments of people just talking. Yes, there some cheesy moments eg challenge number one, and a scene after some of the end credits. But overall, I thought it was wonderful.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

With the creation of Black Panther, the black cat became a huge phenomenon in comic history that it made a feature film in 2018, with an unknown person playing the title roll by the name of Chadwick Boseman. 
 In the furriest of details, this movie has gained such momentum in the box office that it literally broke the box office within the first weekend. But let's get back to Wakanda. The birth place of the black prowler. We first met T'Challa, Black Panther, in Captain America: Civil War, when the Cap and Iron Man were on opposite sides of the government spectrum dueling for the survival of the Avengers. 
 Now we come to Wakanda and history of the way T'Challa became the prowler known as Black Panther. Now, I'm not going to sit here and spill out any details, but I will have to say that this movie has out beat all the other Marvel movies by far and to date. 
 I know that, without a shadow of a doubt, literally the shadows, that this movie will continue to go down in comic book history as the greatest superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, all thanks to the director Ryan Coogler. As Kendrick Lamar swiftly puts it in the title track for the movie, ""This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you. This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer.""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

In recent years, social media has raised huge question marks over an industry that had been, and still is, failing to honour both women and ethnic minorities in movies, with last year's Wonder Woman being the first superhero movie of note to tackle the issue head-on, delivering astonishing results in the process. Black Panther is not the first black superhero lead - see the likes of Spawn, Blade and Catwoman - but it is the first to truly celebrate African culture and specifically focus on the 'Black Experience'. The results are, again, truly astonishing.Marvel has unleashed a game-changer, and one that is well on its way to becoming one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. But this was never really in doubt when they announced that Ryan Coogler, the enormously talented director behind Fruitvale Station and Creed, would be behind the camera, and expectations then soared as soon as the jaw-dropping trailer hit, which was our first real look at the vibrant and fantastical fictional African country of Wakanda. With Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa aka the Black Panther introduced two years ago in Captain American: Civil War, Coogler has been spared the need for origin story mechanics and has free reign to explore this previously unseen world. The big joke is that the rest of the world think of Wakanda as a third-world country full of goats and farmers, when in fact their technological advancements put everyone else to shame. Yet they choose to keep their major discovery - a crashed meteor carrying mystical substance vibranium - a secret for generations. After a brief read of African history, you can understand why.So their country is a dazzling, futuristic sight, yet the Wakandans still honour the traditions of their ancestors. With their former king T'Chaka (John Kani) dead at the hands of Daniel Bruhl's Zemo, his son T'Challa has returned to Wakanda to receive his crown. He wants his old flame and active spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) there for his big day, and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a science boffin who trumps the likes of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner in terms of intelligence and innovation, teases her older brother. Despite an initial reluctance, T'Challa is a willing and capable leader, both politically and physically, able to defend any challengers without the aid of the enhance powers of the Black Panther. While the lack of having to watch the protagonist wrestle with their feelings as they step up to a bigger responsibility is certainly refreshing, the lack of any real arc for T'Challa is one of the very problems with Black Panther. With a supporting cast so vast and impressive, T'Challa often gets drowned out of his own story.Still, the supporting cast, which includes the likes of Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, Andy Serkis and Winston Duke, certainly deliver. Wright near steals the film, and Duke, as rival tribe leader M'Baku, makes a big impression in a relatively short amount of time. But a Marvel film wouldn't be complete without a big bad, and Michael B. Jordan's Eric Killmonger is easily their most complex, imposing and sympathetic since Loki. To say more about his character would be giving away spoilers, but Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole lay out his motivation and execution with real precision, and Jordan proves to be a thoroughly menacing presence. The cast, which is one of the best assembled in recent memory, help Cooger sculpt this fascinating world of progression and tradition, and even when the film can't help but indulge in a climax of CGI fisticuffs, you'll remain immersed because you'll care about the characters. Black Panther does something no other superhero has done before it - for me at least - and resonates long after the credits roll, proving timely in exploring the question of whether to build bridges or walls.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a combination of a few things - that's why it's so amazing. It has a decent story that is properly developed (unlike a lot of action movies that focus on effects only), the effects are mind-blowing, the outfits are beautiful, the sets are stunning, and I loved the acting. Why are people saying the acting was terrible? I actually LOVED how authentic the actors played, better than many white actors. And the accents are a great addition to it. Oh, and let's not forget the humor. There were a lot of effortless funny lines.
I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie if I tried. Brilliantly executed, fun, magical and at the same time real. Great filmmaking that everyone can enjoy, not just black people.

With its latest release, 'Black Panther', it reaches unimaginable heights. I felt extremely proud watching this movie. It changes the conversation and gives us a new hero, a relatable hero. Heroes aren't defined by a certain race or culture and Black Panther embraces its roots while telling a captivating story. Exhilarating, emotional, and impactful- this one is a game changer.We were introduced to T'Challa, Black Panther, in 'Captain America: Civil War' a couple of years ago. His strength and conviction stood out then and I looked forward to seeing his story. After his father's untimely demise T'Challa takes the throne of Wakanda, a mysterious and isolated country in Africa that is years ahead of the rest of the world. Black Panther works as an origin story, a thriller, a social narrative, and a family saga all rolled into one. There's immense depth and a strong voice leading the film. The action is sharp and eye popping. There's grit and wit in equal measure and it doesn't shy away from hurtful truths. It's exactly what you want from a superhero movie and so much more.Director Ryan Coogler has shown Wakanda and its people with tremendous admiration. The characters are fully fleshed out and unapologetically black. Their pride is envy worthy. It's deeply gratifying to be able to identify with a character on screen. But an entire nation? It was unheard of before this film. The backbone of the movie, a compelling screenplay, plays out wonderfully on screen and is both moving and amusing. There's never a dull moment with these characters. And what beautiful characters!Chadwick Boseman leads the pack with his terrific portrayal of T'Challa- a man overcoming obstacles, a king trying to find his way, and a hero who has barely scratched the surface. The supporting cast is equally brilliant. Michael B. Jordan brings the right amount of menace and angst to his character creating a villain you want to root for. Another highlight of the movie, or I should say its strongest attribute, is the powerful women. Warriors, intellectuals, leaders, and spies. Each one stronger than the king, each one deserving of her own movie. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright are perfect. I am in awe.Representation matters. We hear it, we say it, and now we see it in action. Never again will a person of color have to wonder what it would be like to look like their heroes. As an avid movie watcher I'm filled with joy. Black Panther is an experience to be treasured. This panther comes at you claws out and rearing to go. Wakanda forever!

By: Jonathan Martellini Black Panther was a major step forward for Marvel and their superhero dynasty. It was a movie that was not only extremely entertaining, it also was able to connect to modern-day issues in a way that we haven't seen before from Marvel. The movie was able to hit several hot topics in today's society, without having to completely alienate those who may disagree with such views. The cast also assisted in making this message prevalent and pronounced. 
The cast, which included Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o and Martin Freeman, and predominantly black cast, showed Marvel's embracement for diversity. It also gave African-American kids a superhero to see on the big screen that looks just like them. Marvels diverse cast has led to a new superhero that looks like many of the people who need a superhero to emulate and act like. 
 The movie itself was a fantastic showing of Marvel's creativity, digital and special effects skills. It is filled with adventure and danger. Wakanda, the homeland, was constructed as beautifully as any other Marvel world before it. It also is different in the sense that Wakanda, is its own place while many other Marvel movie settings are depicted in the real world. Wakanda instead is both. Located in Africa, Wakada is it's own made-up country that is much more technologically advanced than it is presented to the world. Wakanda is it's own world, with its own cities, far more advanced than anything here in America or anywhere else in the world. 
Marvel has never made this kind of a movie. They've never developed such a realistic world and haven't addressed so many social issues in the way they did in Black Panther. The real-ness of the setting combined with the acting and the overall message of the movie make for a blockbuster that Marvel has never seen before.

Among the Marvel movies, Black Panther is one of the least successful productions. It's not so much that it lacks any of the major elements of other Marvel films. It has a superhero who kind of has special powers, it has special effects, and it has somewhat innovative fight scenes. No, the problem is in the acting and I'll put the blame for this on the supporting female characters. Their acting is of B-movie quality. It is wooden and stilted causing a lack of any believable emotional connection to other characters in the film. In an effort to make the female characters into powerful male-like warriors, they have sacrificed their humanity,Most of the male acting is only slightly better. Chadwick Boseman is okay. Michael B. Jordan is a pretty good villain, and Daniel Kaluuya is believable and sincere. But when Sterling K. Brown appears in a cameo, we realize what real good acting consists of and we are suddenly forced to realize what the film is missing. The plot is predictable, like most Marvel films. It seems to lack some underlying ideal, although it makes an attempt to do this in the conversation we see with Mr. Panther and his father, played very well by John Kani. In the conversation, his father advises him to surround himself with good people, which may serve as an indirect criticism of the corruption that so often appears in African governments. We also have the issue raised by Erik Killmonger (Jordan) who asserts that Wakanda should give its precious super- mineral, vibranium (give me a break), to oppressed black people so that they can fight their oppressors. Much is made in the pre-release hype about the technologically-advanced, mythical African nation, Wakanda. To me, it looked like Oz's Emerald City without the emerald. There is also a lot of talk on how this film unites black people around the world. Maybe it does. It just seems to me there are so many other films that could do a better job at this and keep us entertained at the same time. In short, there is not much in this film that will keep the average viewer involved. There are some mildly interesting fight scenes and the obligatory car chase has some novel elements, but I would not recommend the film as a whole. Nonetheless, the momentum the film has received from the pre-release media storm will no doubt end up with it making some good box office returns: A triumph of marketing over quality.","84 out of 206 found this helpful.

The great feeling you get when they first arrive to the Wakanda is unmatched. It's a complicated and compelling family that comes together nicely. The overall theme of the togetherness and how the decisions of few affect many is never lost and constant throughout. All of the characters contain likeability, including the villains, which is very rare for a movie. This movie is a lot to take in within one watch, I myself have seen it three times already. Even though it feels like there's too much in this movie overall, it is truly excellent. If you're not a fan of political and racial truths, this movie is not for you at all.

It doesn't have to be about saving the world, just introduce some characters we can enjoy following and provide some motivation we can relate to. Black Panther centres around the rivalry/conflict between T'Challa and Killmonger and I think that's an interesting choice. Killmonger is a shadowy version of what T'Challa could have been and the movie brings you along with their new king's struggle to understand his father's and his uncle's actions. But the important thing about this is you understand the differing perspectives of the characters and while you're cheering for T'Challa, you can at least understand where Killmonger is coming from. Their situation doesn't come with an easy answer and this problem compounds T'Challa's other issues (dealing with the death of his father, the responsibilities of running Wakanda, Nakia not reciprocating his affection for her etc.). The character development in this movie was pretty good and I appreciated the effort put in that way.The strength of this movie is that its effective in bringing you into this new and exciting environment. The kingdom of Wakanda is beautiful and is a pleasant change of pace for a Marvel movie. They play up the more traditional aspects of life in Africa while providing a new spin on it. It makes it easier to digest some bits of exposition and I would credit Coogler and his team for doing something off-beat. The cinematography was excellent, and the special effects were first rate. Couple that with some interesting technology and gadgets for our heroes and villains to interact with, there are few scenes where they don't utilize something fun to punch up the action or even the drama.This movie is populated by accomplished actors and actresses, but I was legitimately surprised on who impressed me the most. Chadwick Boseman is a star on the rise. He's got a lot of ability and charisma and while I enjoy his more dramatic performances (Marshall and 42) he slips into Black Panther with ease. Michael B. Jordan had a lot of energy in his performance and he was obviously giving it his all. He's a lot better in this compared to the Fantastic 4 but he was still bordering on overacting for me. I would give him credit for being one of the more impactful Marvel villains of recent memory. Andy Serkis is having a blast in the other villainous role as Ulysses Klaue. He's an awesome actor who doesn't get his due. Daniel Kaluuya was good after his breakout in Get Out, he's very measured here and strong. It was fun to see Lupita Nyong'o, she owned her scenes completely. Letita Wright gave one of the funnier performances in the film as T'Challa's sister Shuri. My favourite performance came from Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She sold all her scenes; her character has a strict code of honour that came across well in her acting. She is passable as a military leader (which is no mean feat) and yet there were some moments in the movie where she managed to be funny as well. She was very well rounded and deserves credit in her supporting role.One of the reasons that this movie will be so popular is that it is promoting diversity. We don't get many African-American superheroes (let alone a superhero from Africa) so it is important to get them right when they get the chance. Black Panther tackles this challenge as well as they could have. Not only is the story interesting and the actors/actresses are clearly on their game, but they incorporate how difficult it can be to come from the background that these fictional characters come from. It is not only addressed but it is at the forefront and they don't falter. I guess that shouldn't be a surprise considering who is involved with this project, but it is worth mentioning nonetheless.The biggest problem that this movie suffered from isn't even the fault of the people who made it. The hype surrounding Black Panther got a little out of control. Is this a good movie? Absolutely. Is it one of the better standalone Marvel films? You can absolutely make that argument. Best Marvel movie ever? For me, not even close. It absolutely deserves praise for the things that it gets right but people need to calm down a little. I would put this firmly in the middle somewhere, Marvel is the victim of continued success that way so simply making a good film doesn't qualify as doing something amazing for the studio (a comparison I would use is A Bug's Life or Brave, both are good movies but compared to the rest of Pixar's output, neither are exceptional). I had a couple of smaller issues, the action was very middle of the road, I didn't find a show-stopping moment in any of the fight scenes. Some of the characters arcs weren't satisfying, I feel like the only reason Martin Freeman's Everett Ross was included was to connect to the rest of the MCU, he had little to do on his own.Another few months go by and another exciting/action-packed movie put out by Marvel Studios. This has become the norm and while some people are growing sick of it, if they keep putting out quality material, I'm open to it. Black Panther isn't the second coming for comic book movies but that shouldn't detract from the fact this is a great movie. I would give this an 8.5/10 but I can't quite give it a 9/10.

Before, I was assured myself that this movie would be the best superhero movie in 2018 if Infinity War wouldn't released in the same year. Now, the outcome is great.Firstly, I do like the opening scene. It can be said that it's different from other MCU's films. New formula for the next phase, I think. Secondly, please someone give the person whose responsible for the choreography in this movie a lot of cookie. Black Panther isn't a martial art themed superhero but it nailed it. So much better than the choreography in the series of protector of K'un-Lun. Third, the humor. Back in the Ragnarok last year, Marvel served us an action-humor movie. Thus, my expectation is Black Panther will be not so different from Ragnarok. I can't said that this movie will not have any humour. It has precise portion of humour and I totally laughing out loud from its jokes. Last, the cast. Hands down for all the cast. Totally great job, especially you Andy Serkins.Closing statement. Black Panther is a beautiful superhero movie. The plot, the bgm, and of course the scenery. 9 of 10.P.S : There are two post-end credit scenes. Just wait. It's worth your time in the second scenes. Ciao.","9 out of 43 found this helpful.

The only things I knew was that his real name was T'Challa and he came from the fictional country of Wakanda, a technologically advanced place with a policy of isolation. That's really all you have to know to enjoy this movie! This movie really downplays the superhero aspect. It's a lot more about this country deciding whether or not it should release its technology to the rest of the world.The end credits assure us that the Black Panther will be in the next Avengers movie. This movie is simply beautiful to look at. Every time we get a good look at Wakanda's world, it's a visual delight. It really downplays the aspect of it being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . I really thought that was something new and different for these creators. We get great action scenes and enough interesting things to keep any newcomer intrigued. ***1/2","5 out of 20 found this helpful.

Jordan's nefarious Killmonger from gaining anymore traction in his quest to make Wakanda his own.There's really nothing overly special about this story, one that plays out as you would expect it to, but Coogler who showed such talent with his debut Fruitvale Station and his bigger budgeted follow-up Creed instils his film with a true sense of heart and purpose and full-credit to him and Marvel for allowing Black Panther's roots in the African culture to take full effect here.Thanks to Coogler's guidance, the country of Wakanda and the beautifully realised settings and production design of Black Panther make it Marvel's most visually captivating film yet (sorry Ragnarok) and combined with a selection of Kendrick Lamar's tailored songs, this is Marvel at its most technically and aesthetically proficient.All this technical prowess and impressive direction would be for naught if Coogler and his ensemble failed to meet but as his proved with his previous films, Coogler once again shows himself a filmmaker well in-tuned to his actors.Led by the impressive Boseman, Black Panther's much-publicised predominately African-American cast all work together to create Marvel's best team-up outside of the Avengers and Guardians and the Galaxy, with a highlight coming in the form of Michael B. Jordan's key-bad Killmonger.Killmonger (real name Erik Stevens) is Marvel's most impressive villain outside of Loki, with Jordan doing a fantastic job at bringing this tormented and in some ways justified character to life and whenever his on screen, Black Panther elevates itself to greater heights.Killmonger's anger and resentment to what has happened to him and his people is more powerful than your average superhero alien looking to take over Earth for no real-reason and with this, Coogler's film has some powerful things to say about the world in which we live, not often the case with a comic-book adaptation.It's actually the films biggest downfall in many ways that it doesn't utilise Jordan more in its 2 hour plus runtime and had it managed to squeeze more of Jordan's escapades into its sometimes more slowly paced and methodical opening half, Black Panther could've become something undeniable and memorably special.Final Say - Re-writing the rulebook with its casting and socially relevant themes, Black Panther may not reinvent the superhero staple but it's a fresh and often exciting new addition to the Marvel universe that's deserving of its likely box-office dominance, making Black Panther a king well-deserving of its spot on the throne.4 armoured rhino's out of 5","6 out of 26 found this helpful.

Knowing that I still say that the overall image quality was bland, impressive only when presenting some great visions such as Wakanda city.Not being overwhelmed by the visual bombardment, it was easier to focus on what was actually said and what was actually happening. And I was disappointed. Interesting social commentary went largely undeveloped. Content-WISE, ""Black Panther"" is a kid's movie, and not particalularly refined at that. Dialogue was stock and characters largely cardboard.I was very disappointed, to my surprise, of the cast. Chadwick Boseman, in particular. He is a tremendously gifted actor, but took T'Challa so seriously, that it became stilted. His slow reading of the lines alone made any resonance on the comical register impossible. Michael B. Jordan fared much better, but the character motivations for him were a bit confusing. Andy Serkis did a very good job with his ridiculous character. In the end, Martin Freeman was for the umpteenth time the best actor in a movie he appears in, without really getting his due share of the raves.Coogler directs fluently, but, for example, the inauguration challenge fight was noticeably clunky. Also, this being a Marvel movie, most of what you see on the screen is actually CGI, or CGI enhanced (those rhinos really don't work). So you're watching an animation, basically. And it doesn't look that good. And, this being a Disney production, the lack of blood is incredible. There is a scene, where a person's throat is slit with a sword, and not a drop of blood is seen. If you can't show blood, don't shoot such scenes.I honestly don't quite know what to say about ""Black Panther"", I was so much anticipating a better and more different movie. ""BlacKKKlansman"" is a far, far better movie about similar themes. ""Black Panther"" needed a more experienced filmmaker to pull it through.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The superhero theme of the weekend strays from the normal leads you've seen in the last few years, one who has more ferocity than the usual crew, maybe outside of the Hulk. Yes, I'm talking about Black Panther, and after much anticipation it is here and ready to unleash the cat within. Does this highly awaited film meet expectations? Robbie K is here to help out, with yet another movie review. Sit back, relax, and read on as I help out with your movie going pleasures. LIKES:The Cinematography: A good hero movie requires good visuals to bring it to life, and Black Panther reigns supreme on this level. After some unique storytelling art at the beginning, the movie resorts to beautiful blends of real-life, breathtaking shots and impressive visuals. The movie drops you into what feels like a technologically advanced city, complete with James Bond like gadgets that feel super in themselves. Black Panther's camerawork is also very dynamic, energetic enough to increase the action, but contained enough to not leaving you nauseous or confused. The Acting: Marvel movies sometimes tank in this section, but again Black Panther raises the bar on this level. Chadwick Boseman retains the regality of T'Challa from Civil War but adds more conflict and growth to the character as he struggles with the mantle of king. Michael B. Jordan comes back with a fire, once again showing that he earns his spot in Hollywood with an emotionally charged performance that seethes with that raw edge. Lupita Nyong'o brings the balance to the movie, portraying a character that acts as a solid bridge between all parties, keeping her dynamic performance balanced at the same time, while Danai Gurira grounds the characters down with her strong will and fantastic stage combat skills. Letitia Wright is the comedy of the film who has a fantastic delivery of the well-written lines this movie has. Almost all parties involved nailed their roles, with the chemistry between everyone favorably mixing to create what felt like a tribe. Fantastic job casting director. The Comedy: Marvel is all about making you laugh, sometimes making that the focus of the film and other times as a nice add-on. Black Panther took the latter for me and was tastefully done to perhaps be one of the best executions of the Marvel Universe. In this darker movie, there is a lot of tension and raw nerves exposed in the Savannah drama, with many negative emotions running rampant like the predators of the plains. Yet, intermixed in this intensity is comedic gold, or vibranium in this case, well-placed to maximize laughs and clever to avoid the usual slapstick staleness that plagues most movies. This style of comedy didn't detract from the movie but added another layer to help reset the tension and keep you engaged in the movie from start to finish. Plus, you've got a nice combination of styles in store as well, so two thumbs up for that. The Emotion in the Story: The movie does not have the most unique story, something hard to accomplish in this age of saturation. Yet this Marvel version of the Lion King is packed with so many moments to send one into an emotional fervor, sending you on a roller coaster ride of feelings. Black Panther will be inspiring to many, bringing approving claps and motivation to change the world. It's a moral filled tale that brings out the dynamic use of technology, the importance of family, and the dilemmas of a new king having to face. While I'm not the biggest supporter of dramas, Black Panther manages to make the drama feel less soap opera like that many movies fail to avoid. The Ending: Many f Marvel's movies often fail to find that satisfying ending to conclude the awesome tale. Black Panther, manages to keep everything going from start to finish and brings all the building tension to full boil with an exciting climax. All the characters are brought into the mix, having some involvement in the conflict at hand, as they fight in impressive choreographed battles. And while our combatants dance in the virtual field, the story continues to progress and the characters develop with each swing of the weapon. It utilizes all the elements that they had developed during the movie, which goes to show story telling is still alive. DISLIKES:Impressionable Hate: More of a warning, the main villain is not only skilled and deadly, but has a surprising amount of hate contained in his chiseled body. Killmonger is a character that has a lot of issues, and his plot to change the world is something that can motivate impressionable minds down the wrong avenue. Be careful when taking friends and younger audience members to the film who have difficulty understanding character flaws. Martin Freeman: The movie did an okay job with the former hobbit, but I expected a lot more from Freeman's character. Though there is some comic relief, and a little action with his character, Freeman really didn't feel that pertinent to the story until near the very end. Such a legendary actor deserved some more relevance to the plot, some extra comedy, or at least some better development to justify the price tag that comes with him. Not the weakest character mind you, but not what I expected. More Action: No surprise, Robbie want's more action in his Marvel movie. With Black Panther, I had worried that most of the excitement was ruined in the trailers, especially with a huge gap between those action-packed sequences. Had it not been for the ending, I would have been disappointed in this quality, but still I wanted more to be unleashed in this movie to put T'Challa's skills to the test. The VERDICT:  Black Panther is by far one of the better Marvel films to grace the theaters and shows promise for the future of the series. The tale has fantastic visuals to bring the world to life, alongside amazing writing and acting to further bring Wakanda to the playing field. It keeps its characters engaged and fills the 2-hour 15-minute run time with an emotional fervor to keep you integrated into every aspect until that incredible ending sequence. However, the movie still has a few limitations including needing a little more action, a dab more of Martin Freeman's relevance, and a slight decrease in predictability to make this a perfect film in the Marvel universe. Still, the film gets massive props for reviving the Marvel movement this year. So definitely get out there and see Black Panther and unleash the beast that dwells within all us comic book fans. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0","6 out of 26 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman was amazing, but I kind of liked Michael B Jordan as Killmonger too. The idea of Wakanda as a black ethno-state was a bit confronting initially for me as a black man - there's been too much of this in the news recently - but it was wonderful to see Afrika portrayed as it should be.

A Marvel fan is writing this review.Now the review (or rather a request to Marvel): You don't make such movies Marvel. Movies that has cheesy moments of Glory among tragedies, which btw never felt like tragedies. It felt like I am watching a typical Bollywood family drama, where characters shed more tears than sweat while kicking bad guys bums.
I mean a son just lost his father and is going to be The King. He is also in desperate search of his father's assassin. Oh dear ! just imagine what kind of potential this movie had and Oh Marvel ! how could you make such a disaster out of it? Dad killed and responsibility ahead and the son is all cool and happy, making googly eyes for her beloved, flaunting like a dumb Tollywood movie protagonist, asking mother if she is happy that he is going to be a king now. SERIOUSLY!!!Dear Marvel, if you are making such movies to target highly populated melodrama watching geographies and earn a lots of money, then here are few words of wisdom ""You made your mark in such geographies by making movies like Ironman, CapAm, Avengers et all. Consolidate that mark. Don't just ride on their success to sell crap to us. You are The Marvel.

The movie is already a big hit across the globe. Team OI reviews the movie & tells you whether the movie is worth the hype.
we wish to inform our readers that, we are not die hard Marvel fans. We went to the movie with no expectations as such. But we were curious to learn as to why the world is going gaga about this movie.The movie starts off with the story of how the Black Panther came into existence several centuries back. We are told that vibranium is the source of all the power of Wakanda. Wakanda is the Black Panther's kingdom in Africa. While Wakanda is advanced in terms of technology, they prefer to be isolated from the world. They decide to pose as a third world nation. King T'Chaka accuses his brother N'Jobu of assisting Ulysses Klaue & kills him. Post the death of King T'Chaka, his son - T'Challa returns to Wakanda to lay claim to the throne. Post becoming King & being bestowed with the powers of the Black Panther, King T'Challa unsuccessfully tries to nab Ulysses Klaue.
We are later informed that N'Jobu fell in love with an American woman. They had a kid together, Erik A.K.A The killmonger, comes to Wakanda to challenge T'Challa & lay claim to the throne. Does he succeed? Does Wakanda attack the world & end up ruling it as per Killmonger's plans? Watch the movie to find out.
Director Ryan Coogler must be credited for portraying Africans like never before. African culture has been brilliantly showcased in the movie. Africans across the globe are sure to be proud of this movie. The two duels involving T'Challa are excellently shot. This story moves at a brisk pace. One need not be an ardent Marvel or Black panther comics fan to enjoy the movie. Chadwick Boseman is excellent in his role as the Black Panther. He has set the benchmark in terms of portraying the superhero. He has perfected the African accent to suit the character. Michael B. Jordan as The Kilmonger is bad ass. His menacing looks & superb acting makes you hate him. There are several known African Americans in the movie. Martin Freeman who plays CIA agent Everett K Ross is good in his role. ever Forrest Whittaker(Zuri) adds weight to the supporting cast. The soundtrack is one of the best we have heard for the longest time. The music will haunt you for days or probably weeks.
There are no flaws in the movie whatsoever.
Go watch the movie without contemplating any further. This movie is a treat for people of all ages.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

As Tony learned there was a lot more to Captain than that. Now if Stark would have told BP ""everything special about you came from a glowing turnip"", I think that is an insult he could have gotten away with. The BP character was likeable, but there was nothing in the plot that made me really care about him. The obvious goal was to make BP into a character of Tony Stark level importance. Instead the film only hit Hawkeye level of importance. Aside from lacking character development, the plot just seemed slow and predictable. BP is easily my least favorite Marvel movie.
A reason to see this movie? Just to better understand how BP and Wakanda fit into the Marvel movie universe. Ultimately, BP was a missed opportunity.
Another thing I learned - Michael B Jordan is a jinx to superhero movies.","17 out of 34 found this helpful.

The critics agree. It's a tense, intense action thriller epic story. It was really cool, to have just two ""token"" white guys, a bad one, and a good one. I guess most of you have not noticed that it's normally swapped color schemes. I grew up with Marvel comics, they taught me to read. I had dyslexia, and the graphic novel was by far the best teaching for me... DC was boring. Maybe norms don't notice the color pallet in most movies either. I'm an old white guy. I noticed. I hate oppression, so it's a joy to see a movie whites don't dominate, whites don't replace other nationalities for our ""comfort"". I read the original black panther comic books. and they were a big deal at the time. All the good people in this movies defend human life without regard to race... not so the bad folks. Many of you roman empire folks want to see a roman win. I see a lot of folks who did not enjoy the comic books as kids, don't understand the ethic of superhero movies.

Don't get me wrong the central plot is engaging it just goes where you expect it to go at all times. The work done in both the writing and technical aspects to develop Wakanda as multilayered society rife with factions and internal conflicts is really cool and if nothing else the film makes you want to spend more time with this group of characters. I simply loved the art direction and costumes in this. It was like pan-African version of Lost Horizon.The real standout was Killmonger. Easily Marvel's best and most compelling antagonist he is at once a righteous zealot, a fallen idealist and a twisted version of the hero. The writing coupled with Jordan's charismatic and forceful performance renders a perfect anti-villain to love. I hope they bring him back somehow.Much has been made of the film featuring a nearly exclusively black cast. I think that is a rather shallow reading of the text. The film absolutely does contain parallels and commentary on the African diaspora and the African American experience but it goes beyond simply casting black people. It is really hard to not hear the implicit rebuke of Trumpianism in the final speech and character arch of Wakanda and her King. Like Winter Solider and Iron Man 2 the film contain pretty overt political material.

Overly generic plot and terrible acting. This is a landmark failure for MCU. Michael B Jordan doesn't have what it takes to be a villain at all. The movie makes use of what is basically BLM propaganda as the villain's agenda and I feel this has been done to try and evade harsh critical reviews, what a shame! Andy Serkis was just too brilliant, sadly the movie doesn't revolve around him. Countless cringe worthy moments as a result of poor dialogue writing. The romantic sub plot just doesn't work. Winston Duke (M'Baku) has a few memorable moments but the movie on the whole is entirely a forgettable experience. 4 stars only for visual effects and a select few actors who performed well.","32 out of 71 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Welcome to the shared universe, Your Highness","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4062993/?ref_=tt_urv","bowmanblue","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1406466/?ref_=tt_urv","15 February 2018","'Black Panther' has received a lot of hype surround it being the first superhero film with a black leading man (even though that mantel probably should have gone to 1997's 'Spawn,' but it is correct at least in terms of the current Marvel Shared Universe). However, I really don't believe its success will have much to do with anything so shallow. In short: it's a modern day Marvel film and, if you're a regular at the multiplexes, you'll probably already know what to expect: a hero with superpowers taking on - basically - an evil version of themselves. So, if that's what you're into (and current Box Office trends says that many of us are!) then you're going to enjoy this just as much as 'Iron Man, Thor' and all the others. The reason: it's just a cool, colourful, charismatic film which is great to eat popcorn to.It's set just after 'Captain America: Civil War,' but perhaps one of the first things I should mention is that you don't really need to have seen any other films in the MCU to fully understand everything that happens here. We meet up with King T'Challa of (fictional African nation) Wakanda who, along with ruling his nation since the recent death of his father, also moonlights as the super-powered 'Black Panther,' who, as yet, has kept his and his country's 'special' abilities a secret from the rest of the world. Now, faced with exposure of just what Wakanda is capable of, he is faced with whether to continue its current way of existing, or enter the fray (which will no doubt take him further into the path of the Avengers and their exploits).So, there's nothing new in terms of plot, but it's definitely a distant cousin of the recent Marvel movie 'Thor: Ragnarok' in terms of its look and feel. It's very colouring to look at (nothing DC-like by being all 'dark and gritty' here!) - you may even say its looks like a 'living comic book!). It's a great-looking film visually, but, if you're being overly-critical, you could say that there's a little too much CGI, especially in the backdrops. I know this is a criticism levelled at all 'fantastical' films where whole new planets/civilisations have to be created, but sometimes you can tell the King is talking to someone up against a greenscreen.Also, it's worth noting that there isn't - quite - as much humour in this film as other recent Marvel entries. I guess this is down to - sort of - handicapping its leading man by making him a King. Before, we've had leading men who are gods/thieves/playboy billionaires - all of whom are allowed the freedom to let a witty quip roll of their tongues at a moment's notice. However, here, if the Black Panther did that, it would probably feel a little out of character. Luckily, the film makes up for this by surrounding him with a stellar supporting cast who are well-schooled in letting off steam with a one-liner or two.Overall, 'Black Panther' is just another excellent and enjoyable thrill ride in the Marvel universe. Don't expect anything too deep or revolutionary - just expect a good time and be prepared to bow at not just His Majesty - the King of Wakanda - but also yet another amazingly-successful in a film franchise that never seems to be able to run out of steam.","7 out of 33 found this helpful.

Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, and Letitia Wright, the visual setting also feels so immersive you'd think you're actually there. Notably, Freeman's character Everett Ross began to slowly remind me of Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson, but toned down in a different approach for humor. Not to mention the blend of traditional tribal music and an appealing soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar compliments both dramatic and intense scenes respectively.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'challa (Boseman) is chosen to succeed his late father by naming himself as King of Wakanda. Things drastically change when old wounds open from his father's past.After seeing Marvel's previous outing Thor: Ragnarok months back (which relied so much on a comedic approach), Black Panther is definitely a solo film that can hold its own with less humor and its blend of intricate action and drama. I mean based on the flashbacks and despite the intentions T'challa and Killmonger (Jordan) each had for the good of Wakanda, I couldn't help but pity their own respective causes. The former has his ideals and is about being virtuous by working hand-in-hand with their outside allies. Whereas the latter's intentions are morally unjust due to his own troubled past. It's completely understandable but for the wrong reasons.I will say that it's not entirely perfect, but it was more than enough to keep me enthralled at what Black Panther can do.","5 out of 21 found this helpful.

I thought it was a fantastic look at some very much needed character development, in which Marvel movies tend to not do very well. PROS: GREAT Story. The narrative was easy to follow along, and kept you in the thicke of things. I never got lost. It was also very engaging.PROS: THE WORLD BUILDING. You get to see Wakanda and the city. Way better world building than Thor. You actually felt like your there in Wakanda.PROS: The visuals. Oh man, the visuals were breathtaking.PROS: The Direction. Ryan Cooglar put together a super hero film that felt like a indie drama that happens to have a super hero in it.PROS: The acting. Everyone gets to shine. And all the performances were great. Leticia Wright stole every scene. A few scenes will make you cry. There was so much emotion in this film.PROS: The Villain. Michael B Jordan is great in this, and Marvel finally gave us a great villain. You start understanding where he is coming from, and you actually start feeling for him.PROS: Not a comedy. Hated that Thor Ragnarock was basically a comedy. Marvel films always have tons of jokes in it. Not this one. The jokes here come natural, and not forced.PROS: NOT political. I was told this movie was political. It was from a standpoint of people trying to take the throne, but not political, in a us political. It did feel like Game of Thrones in some areas.CONS: CGI. The final fight was too cgi heavy. It didn't ta me me out of the movie, but it was too cartoonie. CONS: Not enough fighting without the suit from T'Challa. And they downplayed his genius.All in all, I give it a 10/10 and in my opinion, BEST standalone film by Marvel.","5 out of 21 found this helpful.

When is it okay to question authority? your mentor? your parent? All smoothly admixed with stunning visuals, awesome action scenes, and a touch of humor. The costumes are unique and beautiful on all genders. And the prominent and integral role of the women is impressive, especially for an action movie. The 4DX platform is icing on the cake.

A key part of the plot is the question of will the Wakandans keep their advanced technology for themselves, or will they share it will their fellow Africans, while still retaining their national sovereignty and identity.

"8","/10","The Bridge Between A Ryan Coogler Drama and a Fantasy Superhero Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4064356/?ref_=tt_urv","leegato","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65150904/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2018","I came into the theater with high expectations for Black Panther, given it was directed by one of my favorite young and rising directors, Ryan Coogler. Coogler, who previously directed Fruitvale Station and Creed, has proven to be an excellent director for portraying drama and character studies in contemporary settings. With Black Panther, though I had high expectations, I also didn't know what to expect; was Coogler going to do a drama or was he going to stray from his style to fit Marvel Studios' aesthetic?The answer is both, and the result is a unique film that at times feels like a Coogler film and, at other times, feels like a Marvel Studios fantasy.I overall enjoyed Black Panther; it fell short on some aspects in terms of being both a superhero film and a sociopolitical drama, but still manages to hit all the marks.The characters are well-written and lovable, simple as that. A superhero film is only as good as its villain, and Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger is sure to be in the books as one of the stronger Marvel villains in the MCU. The film invests its story into fleshing out the emotional drama and perspective that Killmonger uses to justify his antagonistic actions; for the first time in a long time in the MCU, we sympathize with the ""villain,"" and his viewpoints touches on the social commentary in which the film finds its strengths. Letitia Wright as Shuri also stole the show, both serving as tasteful comedy relief and as a strong supporting character to Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa.The social commentary of this film, which is what I was most looking forward to, is excellent. It's not very explicit and takes some thinking to dissect, and frankly I could spend hours analyzing the metaphors this film produces that connect the fantastic themes present in Wakanda to our real-world issues of marginalization and how the world perceives Third World Countries. Instead, I will say that the social commentary is used as a means to advance the film's plot and retain the central themes; it's like any good Marvel movie that poses a moral question (Winter Soldier, Civil War), only this time it feels more contemporary and more relevant than ever. The themes touch on the power of countries and what responsibility they bear to the world, and particularly focuses on the marginalization and historical oppression of African Americans and poses the question on what can be done to resolve this continuous issue in our society. It's very compelling and is a story that must be told, making Black Panther an excellent addition to Ryan Coogler's dramatic filmography.That said, this film does try to balance between being a dramatic social discussion and a fantastic superhero film, and ultimately that becomes the reason why this film fell flat on certain moments. The action is derivative, CGI-laden, and boring, and this was disappointing given that Creed had simply phenomenal fight sequences and choreography. I will say that the action in Black Panther has the same emotional background and payoff that the fighting in Creed had, but Coogler is still trying to find his footing on how to direct a superhero action sequence, and I think he tried a bit too hard on appealing to comic book fans on this one when it came to the action (too many cutaways, not enough careful focus or emphasis on skilled combat, etc.). There were definitely some action moments I loved (at one point we had a one-shot moment again a la Creed), but there wasn't enough. The film is also grounded in fantasy; few scenes take place in contemporary cities, which I was hoping for more of, but, ultimately, that's personal preference. Wakanda's scenes feel somewhat like the scenes of Asgard in the Thor franchise, so the fantasy aspects can be a bit tiring. To each their own.Overall, Black Panther is definitely the best Marvel film in a while (since, arguably, Captain America: The Winter Soldier) but is certainly not the best. Although riddled with superhero cliches and dialogue, Black Panther's compelling social commentary, strong characters, and an all-around excellent cast make it an excellent addition to both Coogler's filmography as well as the MCU.","8 out of 41 found this helpful.

Michael B Jordan's character was a far more relate-able villain than other Marvel villain's to the point you feel sorry for him and almost want him to succeed. A villain with good reasons that have fallen to corruption and anger where he becomes the very thing he's trying to fight against. You are both interested in Killmonger as well as disgusted with him. He makes you hate him, but feel sorry for him and kind of want him to succeed.The story is intriguing and the lines of good and bad have become blurred.

The movie starts in slow pace, but once the Killmonger gets introduced the story shifted into a fast pace momentum. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa scores just like he did in Civil war. But the real performer - Michael B Jordan plays the brutal Killmonger steals the show especially in the climax area.The movie is well balanced with right amount action and humor. No one liners or jokes in between battles. Cinematography is another one which eligible for a round of applause.The way they showed Wakanda.So much detailing in every aspect. With a perfect color tone, well managed CGI and some kick ass stunts the entire movie delivers a different experience for me.","6 out of 28 found this helpful.

Not much I can add to all the other reviews other than: Wait for it to come out on premium channels-or at least PPV. $12 x two was definitely too much for nebulous plot with no real direction and a complete dichotomy of technology vs. tribal ritual.If this is a glimpse of the future, Black Panther will never be more than an Avenger sidekick.

Logan, just a sad film with a way more interesting characters. everybody's getting old and dying. overall, a slighly above average superhero film. Wonder Woman, same case. interesting background story, but i was wishing more, more complexity that could have been showcased because the character was interesting enough. Thor: Ragnarok, i felt like i was watching different film. the whole film seems like a parody of the previous installments, which means a parody of bad films. And now, Black Panther. I'm not saying that this film is far from cheese and cheap thrill, and i'm not saying that the plot has improved from any other hollywood or superhero films. The film is a perfect marriage between great concept and great value.the background story of the film is more interesting than most of MCU films or story. one of the villain said that Wakanda is the real El Dorado. it is, but the place were kept by people with higher moral value and great understanding of virtue. They were not only deserve to keep the treasure and knowledge from the land, but also protect it from bad people. they were not drowned in it but maintaining it. their leader is the main character, the Black Panther.the film has two villain. the first one is a colonial type that seek power and fortune for himself. and the second one is more complex than the first one. he's a very angry person, and for reasons, has the right to be. his actions was very logic and has a great purpose. but what is a great purpose if you have a better one. that's the Wakanda people's code of ethic. peace. the value of philosopher. no wonder that they got to rule that El Dorado.there are several MCU films that i liked, the others i disliked, and Three that i loved. they are:
and i'm hoping there will be others to follow","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

Even for fans who don't watch Marvel's movies consistently, this movie delivers. There are some events that conclude in this movie that took place in Captain America: Civil War (2016), but the film summarizes everything so no audience member is confused. Michael B Jordan is phenomenal as Erik Kilmonger, he is (in my opinion), one of the best Marvel villains in a while. The girls around him (Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright), all do an amazing job not only to elevate T'Challa, but themselves as well. The movie just delivers in all cylinders, great film.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

The film has the best villain in an MCU movie since Loki, he has one of the best backstories I've seen in a long time! The story is simple, but it works! Seriously, people always expect a deep and complex story, it's always hard to satisfy people. The action scenes, while can be a bit dark sometimes, are still fantastic and tons of fun to watch!

But the king first has to take care of obstacles, mainly his fathers nemesis, and a challenger for the throne.This film is co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed), the other writer is Joe Robert Cole (American Crime Story). It stars Chadwick Boseman (Captain America: Civil War) as the titular Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan (Creed) as the villainess Erik Killmonger and Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) as Black Panthers love interest Nakia.This film is outstanding to look at, the visual effects for the film are great expecially the backgrounds of Wakanda. the direction is fantastic aswell, with director Ryan Coogler using long takes and gorgeous landscape shots. The score by Ludwig Goransson (Creed) is fantastic as well. What I love most about Black Panther though is that it is unlike any other marvel movie, focusing on the characters more than action and comedy makes it stand out from other marvel movies. Which makes it more memorable. The cast is great, the stand outs are Martin Freeman (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey) as Everett K. Ross and Letitia Wright (The Commuter) as Black Panthers sister Shuri.I loved this film, in my opinion this is the best Marvel movie yet.10/10","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

It actually feels rather unique, despite some of its more 'superhero' genre elements, and is typically a smaller, more character-focused affair than its counterparts. The special-effects can be slightly overbearing at times, though; there are some digital body doubles that both look dodgy and do some dodgy things. Still, thanks to the brilliantly written screenplay, this doesn't really take away from the believability of proceedings because we're always invested in our hero, who's as incredibly tangible and entertainingly combat-capable here as he was in his debut appearance. The feature is thematically rich and, occasionally, emotionally moving, too. It's accomplished, enjoyable stuff that represents some of Marvel's (and the genre's) best work to date. 8/10","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Clearly, the screenplay by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole was truly a great story and the most unique and intriguing pieces of cinema. Even Ryan Coogler's sensible, intense, stylistic and realistic direction and storytelling which draws its similarities to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins as well Ryan Coogler's aesthetics to his previous films such as Fruitvale Station and Creed truly makes this film unique and compelling.What makes Black Panther one of the best films of 2018 was the great, compelling and memorable performances from the ensemble cast which singles out Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Guirira, and Letitia Wright as one of the major stand-outs. This is also a major milestone for cinema to featured black actors and actresses as the main cast which signals a good step in a right direction for representation and diversity as well creating a cultural phenomenon just like what Wonder Woman has achieved for in its major representation for women. Even the breathtaking cinematography, production and costume designs also makes it a great experience and a feast to the eyes.Just like every film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther also had its flaws, mostly the CGI effects which was noticeable and has its issues on pacing but nevertheless Black Panther will be no doubt serve in its place as one of the greatest superhero films in cinema history alongside The Dark Knight, Superman (1978 film), and Wonder Woman and has also further transcended the superhero genre in a whole new level as well cemented its cultural and iconic legacy.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Maybe each showing for Black Panther could be pre-empted by a showing of I am Not Your Negro, although that documentary is miserably lacking in the explosions and stabbings which fill Black Panther.There are a lot of fights in Black Panther, a lot of them where light is lacking, making the whirlwind attacks difficult to parse, confusing to discern, and baffling to ingest. There are calls to action coupled with critiques of isolationism, a couple of astral projections, and several Black Panthers. With the Q-like Shuri helping improve tech gadgetry, a better title might have been Vibraniumfinger.Black Panther lacks the fun of other Marvel fare like Deadpool or Spider-Man: Homecoming, maybe intentionally so, with awkward jokes peppered in a just the wrong moments, trying to bring light-heartedness into dire situations and uncomfortable realities. If the world outside is one of unjustly oppressed people, the world inside is only as just as the strongest, most enlightened, and physically fittest autocrat.We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact, and there are definitely things They do not want Us to know.","52 out of 124 found this helpful.

Black panther follows T'Challa's struggles as both king of Wakanda and the Black panther. Ryan coogler has expertly crafted a film with relevant social and political commentary that never comes off as preachy while retaining all the elements of a blockbuster MCU film.Black panther was a badass in civil war and Chadwick boseman brings the same gravitas and the stoic presence in Black panther. Although this time we get to see his emotional side as well and boseman brings a lot of depth to the character.Marvel has nailed it with the casting almost every time and Black panther is no exception. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis reprise their roles as Everett Ross and Ulysses Klaue respectively and without a doubt they are excellent as always. Everett Ross wasn't a big part of Civil war but here we get to see and learn a lot more about him and the same goes for Klaue whom we saw in Age of Ultron. Serkis' maniacal performance as Klaue was very entertaining and I wish he had more to do in this film.In this film we get to see the Dora Milaje, that is the royal guard of Wakanda in action and learn a lot about them through their general Akoye played by Danai gurira who is loyal to Wakanda and respects her traditions. She has some of the coolest action scenes and is very intimidating. Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o is a badass spy who travels around the world helping out people in need. The women in the film sort of play the voice of reason for T'Challa and contribute a lot to the plot. Shuri played by Letita Wright who is T'Challa's sister is the more modern character who things traditional rituals are boring. She is the head of technology so she's kind of a nerd but when its necessary she doesn't shy away from a fight.Other notable performances would be by Angela Basset who plays T'Challa's mother and Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi. Also Forest Whitaker is in the movie who is superb and Winston Duke who plays M'Baku had some of the funniest moments.Michael B. Jordan steals every scene he is in as probably the best marvel villain Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens. He has a lot of charisma and a clear motivation for why he does the things he does. His motivations are to do good but the things that he does to achieve his goal are wrong. Jordan nails every aspect of his character especially the emotional moments that helps the audience relate to him and care about him even though he is a bad person who has done despicable things.Ryan coogler gives us a Wakanda that feels real and lived in and not a fictional country. Wakandan culture is rich and beautiful. Their traditions and rituals are interesting and there is a great contrast between their primitive culture and their advancements in technology which make Wakanda very different from the rest of the world. The visuals paired with an exceptional soundtrack with both traditional and modern music make for an immersive and surreal experience.For all its merits Black panther is not without its flaws. The action scenes are sometimes really cool but other times not so good. There were moments when you couldn't understand what was happening because the scene was too dark. The green screen was noticeable in some scenes especially towards the CGI heavy climax of the film. The visual effects in Marvel films have always been very impressive in the past and its disappointing to see such bad effects in one of the best films the MCU has put out . The film also suffers from some pacing issues and Killmonger's screen time could've been extended.A few gripes aside Black panther has some splendid performances, a compelling villain and relevant social commentary that makes it more than just a MCU film. Black panther is an exceptional film and I highly recommend it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The spectacle of this film is absolutely breathtaking, the whole world of Wakanda is established well by director Ryan Coogler. We are utterly convinced that this a real society, with a clear sense of community conveyed, as well as concise character's. I will admit that I was a little let down as a result of all the hype surrounding it, it did not manage to live up to my expectations. While it does nail the action and intensity, the humour, something that Marvel usually masters, was very mediocre for me. There is several cringey moments that were trying too hard to be funny when these characters simply are not humourus, I would have been fine with the film taking itself completely seriously. The cast are all around terrific, the standouts being Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, who nails it and lives up to his terrific set up in Civil War, and Michael B. Jordan, who play's one of Marvel's greatest villains yet as Killmonger. The sibling rivalry-type relationship between these two characters created a relationship that was thrilling to watch. Other cast members, such as Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis, among many others, all shine in their parts, all having individually brilliant moments. The film also deserves credit as being the first big budget blockbuster to feature a largely African-American cast, it is a huge steppingstone for film and I hope others follow what Marvel has set. Action packed and original. Intense, well acted and featuring a slew of great characters, I would recommend Black Panther to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.
A forner victim of Black Panther's father puts his nation under threat. 
Best Performance: Michael B. Jordan","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Everyone was interesting, everyone had a story or something they could do and they often saved the hero when he didn't plan things through properly. This humanized the characters in some way for me. There's also the very relatable villain, a jealous, unfairly-treated character with a burning temper. He's not a good person and he's not wholly bad. Andy Serkis too makes a great, nasty villain who i not in the film nearly enough.The section of the film that worked best for me was when it felt like a James Bond film, a sequence near that start that is thrilling and well-choreographed and brings us action and technology in a wholly exciting way.Costume design is fantastic throughout and some set-design really stands out, with the look of the Wakandan city as a whole slightly uninteresting and seemingly full of tower blocks you imagine might contain business, yet no one knows this place exists. Likewise the futuristic planes they fly around in are similarly uninspired. But the costumes and street-level views more than make up for this.I recommend this film to anyone who like their action tempered with interesting characters, pretty design and high stakes.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was not disappointed; I was impressed beyond belief: This is by far the most mature and relevant movie Marvel has ever made.Acting:
Chadwick Boseman returns as T'Challa in a subtle yet very impressive performance, delivering a wide range and intensity and realism all at once. Not oscar-worthy, but if he were nominated, I wouldn't have protested.Michael B Jordan gives us the best MCU villain yet, with an emotional and relatable background, in a strong performance(not without it occasionally being too over the top)It is clear that he worked hard on this character, and his character is in a way the soul of this movie.Lupita Nyong'O as Nakiya is a role you wouldn't expect to like as much as you should. Her character is mainly the love interest, but her morals and wisdom and skillset, supported by Lupita's subtle performance make her a very likable character.Letitia Wright as Shuri is absolute gold(or vibranium?). She and Chadwick have a hilarious and believable chemistry as brother and sisters, and her big ammunition cache of sass and big brains make her a great asset to an already great cast.Winston Duke as M'Baku is another big surprise: his powerful performance as the tribal leader of the Jabari is one of the best supporting roles I have seen in a long time, and Winston provides both humor and sheer intimidation with excellence.Sterling K Brown as N'Jobu is excellent, giving a very realistic and raw performance as a broken and conflicted prince, and might be one of the best actors in this movie.Andy Serkis seems to have a blast in his role as Klaue, but to me he is having a bit too much fun. It very soon becomes over the top, and although he is ruthless and occasionally funny, he can feel like a bit of a sore thumb.Daniel Kaluuya and Danai Gurira are both great supporting characters as W'Kabi and Okoye, and although their character arc is a great watch, it could have been explored better than we get to see in the theatrical cut. Both deliver subtleness and intensity at a great balance.Martin Freeman and Forest Whitaker play their part and do that well most of the time, but you can't help but notice that Martin could be written much more layered and interesting than what he is given to work with here. I like him more as a Hobbit.Direction:
Ryan Coogler deeply impressed me with Creed, and it is great to see that something vastly different like a big comicbook-movie fits him just as well. He directs great action sequences and emotional moments, and truly transcends all the directors that have come before him.Cinematography:
While Marvel is known for their pretty bland use of camera, this is clearly the best shot movie thus far. Tracking shots, creative spins and wide establishing shots are put to great use here, though the use of color could still be perfected.Plot:
After a great introduction, the pacing suffers a bit in a section through Korea, but improves again vastly back in Wakanda. This is a really smart movie, partially presented through it's relevant themes like colonialism and slavery, and political isolationism. The cast translates these themes perfectly through grounded yet effective dialogue, and good use of flashbacks and creative exposition early on.Editing:
Nothing much to note here, standard MCU cutting of story. A lot of good deleted scenes were left out, which is a bit of a shame.Music:
Ludwig Göransson won the Oscar for this score, and he absolutely deserves it. I rarely come across a soundtrack that is as rousing and involving in every track it has as this one. Ludwig involved traditional African instruments, combined with standard orchestral sounds and modern electronics to create a unique and wonderful blend of superhero music, which is the best from Marvel yet.Costume Design and Make-up:
Oscars were also won for these, again well deserved. The traditional African garbs and face/body-paint are wonderful to look at and give a deep sense of culture and history to Wakanda.CGI:
A point that many people complained about. While I agree that this is far from the best CGI that Marvel has to offer, I think it is a lot of way too harsh judgment. A lot is still very impressive, particulary the vibranium mine and the Korea chase.Tone:
The standard humoristic tone of the MCU is everpresent, but slightly better thanks to Coogler's writing, with Shuri and M'Baku delivering a lot of well-working levity in surprisingly somber scenes. The dramatic scenes themselves are some of the most powerful in all of MCU history, and there is a high chance of tear-shedding in some of them.Overall Concensus:
Thank's to Ryan Coogler's creative hand, the faith of Marvel Studios and a fantastic cast, Black Panther succeeds in its goals and beyond, delivering the best superhero movie I have ever seen. 8.8/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman is excellent as both man about to become king and super hero Black Panther. The supporting cast are incredible and the special effects are awe inspiring.

The movie is also loaded with lots of fun action. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the amazing choreography, especially among the gorgeous warrior women. The movie has a rich cast, filled with gifted actors both familiar and new. Anyone would enjoy this movie, but in particular, any black person, of any age could easilly find inspiration and role models in this movie, not only because it has a black hero with a cool suit and neat technology, but also because of his struggles and responsibilities before and after becoming an African King, which I thought were well projected throughout the movie.

I don't like this movie, it has absolutely nothing to do with the race and culture. I love the superhero Black Panther, and I enjoy the African people and learning about their culture. This movie does establish the sets/Locations, and special effects well, but nothing else. Any way, back to Black Panther. When I first found out he was joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe I got excited. Black Panther was great in ""Captain America: Civil War"", and Chadwick Boseman is a perfect actor to play this role. Then came the solo movie ""Black Panther"", and..... Well, just read my review below.""Black Panther"" (2018), there has been a lot of hype surrounding this ""movie"", even before the first trailer was released! Many Marvel fans had a lot of hope and expectations, was it worth the hype to me? To be quite honest, no. I was very disappointed with this ""movie"". Why? The ""movie"" is an overall dull and boring experience from beginning to end. I kept checking my watch to see how much time was left, and I also fell asleep numerous times! I almost walked out of the theater. But, this is not the first Marvel movie that I've absolutely hated. There are other Marvel movies, along with some other different films not related to Marvel where I almost walked out of the theater. However there are positives for this ""movie"", but very few. (I ALWAYS TRY TO SALVAGE ANY POSITIVES OUT OF ANY MOVIE I SEE.) First off, the special effects are first-rate of course, Chadwick Boseman is a good actor, and a perfect choice for the Black Panther character. But, I think Black Panther works better as side character, or a team player in other movies. Also, the sets and locations in the ""film"" gave it an interesting atmosphere. But sadly, those variables did not help the ""movie"". I'm struggling to give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 star rating on my personal scale. On IMDB, every two stars count as 1 star on my scale. So, that means it gets a 4 out of 10 on the IMDB scale. Unless you're a fan of the Marvel films, I suggest skipping this ""movie"" and saving your money. I am kind of happy I saw it though, I just don't think I'll be seeing it again.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

The acting and casting are done well in this movie. Kill Monger is a good villain who's motives make sense. Some of the fight sequences are great such as the waterfall tribal fights. But the final fight with Kill Monger and Black Panther is horrible. It looks worse than a lot of the video games that are out nowadays. This movie would have benefited from more practical effects.

The plot was further enhanced by some of the best acting to date in a Marvel movie. Michael and Chadwick play strong lead characters but the supporting cast stole the show! Danai G, Daniel K, Letitia W, and Winston D were all equally amazing. Each one of these characters could easily have spin offs on Netflix.This movie similar to Guardians in that a decade ago if you would have told me there would be a Black Panther movie I would have not known much about it other than a comic exists and that the movie would likely fail due to obscurity. Not the case. Honestly, this movie stands solid on its own even outside the MCU. This ranks near the top of the MCU movies thus far, better than Ant Man, the Thor series, the IronMan sequels, and Ultron (7's and 8's). It's only slightly lower than Avengers, Civil War and Guardians (9's and 10's) but not by much. I'd say it's on par with Winter Soldier which is equally amazing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Black Panther was one of my favorite parts of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" and this film shows why. This is ""Batman"" meets ""James Bond."" One review I read complained that the film didn't have enough action. I disagree. It had just the right amount. A film doesn't need action every scene to be good, it just needs a good story, and this film delivers. This film gives us the best MCU villain since Loki. He's one of the few villains that I can sympathize with. I'm not justifying his actions, but I get where he's coming from. The technology in this film is really cool. There's one scene in particular that I won't spoil but I thought it would make a great ride at EPCOT. The last 30 minutes alone were worth the price of admission. The final battle is so good and really drew me in! The dialogue is also very well written. This is one of the best films of the MCU. And it's not just a great superhero movie, it's just a great movie. Period.

The biggest eye candy of the film is the magnificent colours and the cool technology.The plot is fairly simple. And average. But the stunning visuals. Amazing cast, extra cool technology makes up for the lack of plot. I really enjoyed how they brought out African culture in the film. It was something new in the sense of the setting and surroundings.There could have been a lot more black Panther scenes and there is a heavy political aspect of it. Like pushing the fact, if we have all this technology why don't we help our people in Africa? Help all African American's? It's a sensitive subject to push on. And slightly exhausting to have in a marvel movie. On top of it there was no real villain to fight, It was more about keeping the throne. Keeping things running the way they have been forever. Avoiding change. More political instead of good old fashion hero faces villain, and saves the people.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is after all, so much more the wealthy can do for the less fortunate. Even if it does mean revealing your secret mountain of vibranium.The newly appointed modern king also has to confront a secret that his father and a good friend kept from him. This leads to a rather unsavoury assault and challenge to his throne.And along the way, we don't just get the odd touch of dealing with a few race issues, feminism gets a good look-in as well given the extremely bad-ass female Wakandan army headed up by General Okoye. Proper not-to-be-messed-with she is, I can tell you.Throw in princess Shuri, sister to T'Challa, who is a funny James Bond 'M'-esque character who invents, builds and supplies weapons and super suits for her brother and we are well on the way to a quite relevant Marvel movie, that is full of action and fun.And we must not forget Andy Serkis who is as amusing as he is menacing as the illegal and ironically-named arms dealer baddie, Ulysses Klaue.Black Panther quite up there with the best of the Marvel Studios movies to date, but one that remains solid throughout and pushes the franchise not just forward but in a slightly different direction.Roll on Infinity War and Captain Marvel that's what I say!Make mine Marvel!

And it's powerful. It brought what was missing in the MCU which was more representation. The universe still lacks of it but this movie brought a good deal of it.
King T'Challa isn't even the best character in the movie, even the villain is better; Killmonger is one of the best, if not the best, villain of all the MCU.
My personal favorite is Shuri, T'Challa's little sister. She represents so much: intellect, cunning, humor and woman power. She is a young lady who commands all the technological side of Wakanda, she brings innovation and modernism into all she does. She is fearless and doesn't mind standing up for her opinions. Her style and personality is fun and young, she is all a young girl should aspire to be. She's a model.
Aside from her, all the others female and male characters bring their own thing to make this movie a masterpiece.
The artistic side of the movie deserves an applause, the costumes, the dances, the architecture of Wakanda, all was so beautiful and reminding of African style with just a touch of futurism. All pure Wakanda style. I wouldn't mind having a dressing like T'Challa's. Especially those old school sandals (WHAT ARE THOSE???).
The soundtrack of this movie is also one of wonder, the beats were just so enjoyable.
I loved this movie, I can't find it a flaw or something I didn't like. I have seen it twice and both were just as fun.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is far, FAR from the worst Marvel movie even if it's not the best as well, but it's definitely alongside the better ones because of how great the villain is and how effective and well realized Wakanda is as a scenario, and how rare is to see a fantasy version of Africa which makes the overall story stand out among other superhero flicks.Those that complain about the politics are stupid since it's an integral element of the characters. That said, only if you have some prejudice this aspect would trigger you since in it's heart this is still an action blockbuster focused in entertainment and it delivers, cast has a ton a charm and the film is fluid and fun, the emotional bits are poignant without dragging and the comedy is used with precision.The worse about the movie is that it is a bit predictable and some visual fx look honestly below the standards of the MCU, but hardly something that would completely ruin my enjoyment.

"9","/10","If you buy the hype, Don't freeze, watch it with the hyped!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4072350/?ref_=tt_urv","keeflim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26077315/?ref_=tt_urv","24 February 2018","After reading so many reviews on this board and realising how critically blinded some people can really be, (all the haters with no real reason other than 'it's predictable': Like duh, it's a super hero movie not Shakespeare) it made me reflect on the real reason why we watch the hero flicks in the first place - it makes us feel good.If you want a description of the story you can visit wikipedia. This review is meant for the larger audience and why you should watch the film BUT not alone!I got a very rare opportunity to be invited to a private screening of Black Panther with the BlackNet community in Singapore by a very close friend of mine. This is the first time I've been to a screening where the excitement rolled out like Thunder on a bright sunny day: Loud, obvious and utterly fun! You can just feel the buzz of life and anticipation as you approach the theatre. People made an effort to dress up and turned up way before the show time to mingle and talk about theories and expectations about the film. So the film starts and this is my take on watching with the hyped crowd: absolutely brilliant.Yes, it is a classic story about good vs bad.
Yes, both good and bad has similar powers.
Yes, he's a black version of Iron man.
The comedy was on point and the one-liners were delivered by a brilliantly talented cast. Chadwick Boseman delivers an 'uncomfortably perfect' type of the Black Panther where even in his spiritual conflicts, he seems calm and clear headed on what he must do as King. Sure he may be a King but he hides being a man with emotional struggles very well; a little too well. (I find it strange that there didn't seem to be any flaw in his character but sure he's a King right?)
My favourite has to be Michael B Jordan's acting. KillMonger alone may have been a B-rated villain in the comics but it was Michael's portrayal of the Yellow Leopard that really bumped up his presence. More so, his backstory in the MCU is that of a trouble soul and it does reflect on today's current affairs where we see misguided individuals take matters into their own hands.Apart from the story and the casting, major props go to the beautifully designed sets. Wakanda looks amazingly believable and realistic: almost like our lives could be in the next 25-50 years. Costumes were very well designed and the CGI was original - I literally 'wow' seeing Black Panther's suit form around his body the first time.The rest of the cast members were equally fantastic and watching with the community, every punch-line was met with loud applause and unified appreciation. I believed the hype and I enjoyed it with them.As this is the last film before the big cumulation of the Avengers Infinity War, I urge all Marvel fans to watch this! Why you ask? Answer's simple: Vibranium","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't let us catch you slippin' up! I previously did a review for this movie but it somehow didn't show, so this will be a simplistic yet simple review. This movie was a very well done project. The cinematography and colors are what captured my attention. The acting is good of course, how could it not be with an All-star cast of great actors. Chadwick Boseman, Angela Bassett, Michael B. Jordan, and Forest Whitaker are in this movie! The lesser known actors are amazing as well. The music is good, the villain is one of the best, and the story is a nee take on Black Panther's origin. Ryan Coogler is turning into a true visionary, and Chadwick Boseman has played so many iconic Black characters! Good job to all of the cast and crew for a stellar performance!

Yes, it's true it wasn't marvel's finest hour but it was far from bad. Personally, I can relate to the criticism, some of the complaints were true but their severity is greatly exaggerated. Yes it was a little dry at times, yes the characters could have been better defined but these are hardly fatal flaws. I heard someone say it was far fetched....if we're gonna go that route stay away from Marvel all together these are stores about characters with unbelievable abilities that's what they've always been. So anyone who believes it far fetched I ask do you believe in super soldier serum? You really think people get pissed and turn green?? You think Dr Strange really travels the multiverse with magic??? Cmon guys, far fetched is unfair. Also for those who think it far fetched and criticize the believability keep in mind ALL of these story plots had been formulated LONG before these movies. The characters and abilities and origin stories are all taken DIRECTLY from the Marvel books of the past, it's not like someone made this story up last week. Every character and origin story is only telling you what the book said, the specific mission or adventure is fabricated but all characters abilities and origins come from Stan Lee so I don't wanna hear that this story was fantastical nonsense unlike other marvel movies. It's a good movie, not perfect, but I had to stick up for the movie after reading all these terrible reviews. Movie goers will enjoy this movie don't listen to the complaints","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, I used to LOVE superhero films, but ever since the formula worked so well (money wise) for the studios, the scripts have unfortunately lost all meaning. Thank God, this is not the case for Black Panther.
Although the film does start somewhat as a low-paced, vfx plastered (specially in the fictitious world of Wakanda), cliché adventure film, if you can power through the first 10 to 15 minutes or so, you're gonna be in for a treat.
What I loved most about Black Panther is the fact that each and every important character in the story has a well shaped backstory, they all have clear motivations for their actions, and the melodrama of the family relationships works perfectly, because it gives all of the main characters a conflict that is much needed in these types of films, and as we move forward, the plot thickens, and the stakes rise. All in all, a well written film with marvelous performances (even in small roles, as Sterling K. Brown shows us).
The script finishes off with a much needed message that envelops the whole point of the film: ""...in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers."" The relevance of this film shoots up to the sky, when the theme is so intertwined with what's going on in the world right now. And the fact that the screenwriters managed to write in a message like this, in the context and with the studio pressures that come with a blockbuster type of film like this one, is something to stand up and clap about, if you ask me.
I can only hope that the sequel to this film does the first one justice, and I can almost be sure it won't, but oh well... that's Hollywood.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Although Black Panther isn't the best Marvel film of all time after the initial viewing of the this feature it surely is in the top 5 of best Marvel films.
All performances are entertaining and urban. I was vexed walking into the theater knowing how racially charged the buzz was over the release of the film. I came to see the Black Panther and Wakanda portrayed on the big screen, not a statement of race. Wakanda just so happens to be centered in Africa so naturally the people of this continent are of different color and man is it Badass.
Probably the best Visual effects of a Marvel movie besides Doctor Strange.
Ryan Coogler knocks it out of the park with superb direction and an even more exciting soundtrack by LA Rap Group TDE.
The film in its entirety of 2 hours and 14 min is adrenaline and smooth graphic novel style story telling.
Michael B. Jordan who had previously worked with Coogler on Creed and Fruitvale Station shines the most out if the cast delivering the coolest villian since Doctor Octopus in Spiderman 2 (2004).

Coogler does what other MCU filmmakers would never do and dives head first into real world political issue, ending his film with a poignant note about free trade and open borders. Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger adds a nuance that is missing in most comic book movies. Overall Black Panther is a breath of fresh air in an over-saturated genre.P.S that soundtrack is awesome!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

For me, the film was a great addition to the Marvel film universe. One can only take more of the same scenery, same villains, same ""high stakes"". I think this was fresh and successful in it's goal. I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the laughs, and I enjoyed that the laughs and the film were for a broader audience. The villain was much more compelling than your run of the mill Marvel villains and he delivered a line towards the end that made me cry with empathy. The film wasn't black and white, which is where I think it won me over. There's nothing I despise more than an average, black and white, superhero film. There was a lot of grey and nuance here. While some characters could have had more opportunity to shine (the queen, for example), I think this was ultimately a successful and worth watching film. The scenery was beautiful, costuming was executed fantastically, the score was great, the female characters were fleshed out and I really enjoyed the main ""romance"" where I do not usually. Certainly near the top of the Marvel pile.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

One of the scenes that stuck with me is the sunset scene with T'Challa and N'Jadaka near the end its so beautiful and powerful. Unlike all the other MCU movies this one feels more like an adventure movie than just a plain old superhero film like I said the lighting, colour, score and costumes are just amazing. The usual thing to do in comic book movies is to just totally ignore the character development of the villain and just concentrate on the hero, well Black Panther doesn't go that route, opting to concentrate on the hero and the villain equally. Achieving something truly rare in Hollywood movies a perfectly complete character arc for a villain. I saw this movie 3 times at the theater and about 20 times now on BluRay. I get why some MCU fans wouldn't like it because it needs a little bit of investing but for me as a big fan of movies in general, this is a masterpiece.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The action was solid, exciting. The plot was fairly standard, but had some moments I did not expect, though nothing revolutionary. The villain was strong, compelling and most importantly threatening. The costumes were a wonderful mix of traditional and tribal African clothes blended seamlessly with modern western clothes. They were bright and colorful, and just generally visually appealing. The same goes for Wakanda itself. Michael B. Jordan and Sterling K. Brown both delivered fantastic performances and I can see why Brown has been winning so many awards.There were some parts that sort of dragged, but really that was my biggest complaint. Overall it was exciting and fun, with some wonderful comedic moments.I think the message of the film, that we are stronger and better together than we are apart, is timeless. But perhaps applicable now more than ever.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It certainly resonates with the isolationist politics currently in vogue and offers a critcism against them (with subtle refrences to Trumps ""wall"") but for me it was that the characters themselves (with a notable exception) were well rounded and motivated. The weak link was the character of Klaw. A one dimensional nutter who's only purpose was to be the stock racist South African and to kill people needlessly. In truth a lot of the usual tropes are here love interest, good guy gets defeated good guy comes back, bad guy kills nice people etc. but on the whole it is well done and the visuals especially of Wakanda city are beautiful. I espcially liked the references to African culture which added a nice flavour to the look of the film.

Its a must watch, even if your not a marvel fan go see it. I rewatched yesterday and I must say Ryan coogler (director) and Chadwick boseman (protagonist) are geniuses (as well as the whole cast). People say Chadwick was overshadowed by such strong supporting actors and actresses and that's hard to argue with. Danai Gurira absolutely stole the show in my opinion, Letitia Wright was hilarious and a great addition to the marvel roster, Andy Serkis absolutely nailed it, Winston Duke had an amazing Hollywood debut and Michael b Jordan was probably the most developed, sadistic yet relatable villain in the marvel cinematic universe so far. but since rewatching I'm starting to think this choice was intentional. I feel like with it being marvel it was bound for success from the start. come on, a marvel movie in 2018 is going to bring in the crowd regardless. I believe Ryan and Chadwick were well aware of this so Chadwick purposely took a backseat role in his own movie to really let the others shine I believe as a kind of nod to the audience and studio executives kind of like 'hey look what a predominantly black cast of relatively unknown actors can achieve with a big budget and some creative freedom'. Not to take anything away from him though his performance was great. I'm a big fan of black panther and I think his portrayal was spot on. Noble, Deep thinking and calculated. even his arc in the movie is really deep and well thought out dealing with death, grief, lies and betrayal. he just plays it quite low key and reserved so as not to overshadow anyone but in a way that totally works and matches the black panthers character. Overall the film was a complete success commercially and financially, and I think now the world (and Hollywood) has been shown what is possible and what black people in the movie industry can achieve it should open up a world of opportunity for more film's like this to be made. And shout out to the marvel higher ups for letting coogler and others make the film they wanted. Don't really know how to end this and I feel like I'm rambling now soooo... Rating out of ten - the film itself for me is a 8.9/10 would be a nine but I felt some of the CG was slightly underwhelming. For pure spirit, fun and an amazing cast it's 10/10 question.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am so dissapointed with the movie that i watched 9 months ago. I feel rage that this movie is considered for awards.
The story doesn't stand out, acting is bad (Chadwick was ok) , the characters are one dimensional, the special effects are on the level from year 1998. People must have watched the movie with closed eyes thats the only possible reason why this has good ratings. I mean how would you else explain so many bad reviews and ratings for this movie if there wasn't something fishy about the movie. The movie is just going with the flow of Black Lives Matter movement.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

The topic of religion is also almost always avoided, but Black Panther does not shy away from these themes. The African culture was beautifully portrayed in this film, and instead of it being included as an afterthought, the longstanding African traditions and ceremonies are what specifically help to propel the plot forward. Yes, the ceremonies were obviously exaggerated for the plots sake, but it is still refreshing to see them drawing this much inspiration from a country we have not been seeing enough of.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Marvel's latest release packs a lot of exhilarating action with imaginative and vibrant visuals and a detailed plot. It is the story of an African prince from the fictitious nation of Wakanda, thrown in the face of kingship after the sudden death of his father, having to deal with his new found responsibilities, rivals and an unexpected enemy with a connection to his own past. This movie may not be exactly an origin story as it is not the first time we see this character but it checks all the boxes for qualifying as one and from the string of all of the recent ones we've seen, this may as well be the best. Breaking away from formulaic Marvel (which I love too) Black Panther immerses itself in the climate of a foreign land and stays true to the heart and culture of Africa. Every part of the film is very well thought out in terms of visual detail and since the story is of the mythological kind, there is almost a fairytale-like charm we feel, when watching the film walk down very similar lanes. Black Panther's character also gives us throwback vibes of James Bond as he is mostly decked with high tech gadgets and suits with even a car that need not be directly driven by him (Tomorrow Never Dies, anyone?). Applaudable character development has become second nature to a Marvel production and we see that tradition being continued very diligently here too. Chadwick Boseman obviously dazzles in the titular role and manages to balance the intricacies of his character's delicate nature and strong determination and power skillfully. But everyone around him is equally valuable to the story too and it never feels like the film was being borne on the shoulders of the lead only. In fact, without the rest of his team which includes a lot of fiery women, he would probably have died. There aren't many jaw dropping twists in this film although a significant one occurs at the interval where the story changes course. The movie deals with some very relatable and often contentious political issues too, that the lead deals with as a result of him becoming the king of his country but with the truth of his very own existence being shrouded in secrecy, it gets a lot harder for him to do the right thing. Thus, watching him mature into the leader that his people need is an enjoyable experience. The villain is challenging and tests the limits of the hero's abilities which is what shows us how human the latter really is and how sometimes, that and loyalty is enough to overcome any obstacle.On the whole Black Panther is a layered film with diverse aspects just like the soul and culture of the place it is set in. It will leave you with the excitement of Infinity War, too, as the mid-credits and post-credits scenes set up, to some extent, the prologue of the upcoming climactic extravaganza.","6 out of 31 found this helpful.

When I saw the commercials and learned of the premise I really wanted to like it too. I mean the whole idea of a African-esque mythology/mysticism based super hero movie was almost too good to be true for me, because I am actually very into African Shamanism & Folklore. I was so enthused for this movie that I tried watching it three separate times. But every time I tried watching it the results were the same. Every scene was excruciating to watch, and I couldn't suffer through more than 20 minutes or so, it was just so bad.As I said, there is nothing good about this movie. And that includes every aspect of the film making. The writing, the acting, the directing, the production, they are all complete crap. They are literally so bad that it is surreal.What this movie is is one of the biggest works of over-dramatization of all time. This film is more over-dramatized than I have ever seen anything ever be, including Aquaman, and that is saying a lot. It is the same style of unrealistically overdone writing and acting you would see in a B movie, but when a super overdone production as well. The movie looks like it costs more than any movie ever made, but it sounds and plays like it was written and directed by high schoolers. It is so bad that every scene and every bit of dialogue was just so over the top and forced that it was painful to watch and listen to. It's just not natural. People don't talk and act like that. And story's don't happen that way. Its utterly ridiculous.The only reason this movie was made in the first place, and was so ""acclaimed"" by whatever idiots thought it was good, is because of affirmative action ""black power"" aspect. This movies aforementioned african folklore style of storytelling and theme, and its all black ensemble made it a SJW statement that anyone who considers themselves a democrat, liberal, activist, etc would have to declare is the best movie of the year...for the purpose of promoting affirmative action for black people. But this is a movie, and we need to judge it as a movie. And as a movie, it is not at all good in any way. Objectively speaking, if you were to replace the all black cast with a cast that was all white, and all of the SJW's didn't look through the black power promotion lens at it, it would have never gotten good ratings. Because it may very well be one of the worst movies of all time. And that is coming from someone who has seen thousands of them and studied them. So I am not making that statement lightly. Like I said, I tried watching this one 3 times. So I certainly have enough perspective here and am not being small minded.It would be much better to promote black artists/art by promoting the best of it. You cannot simply applaud a movie that is absolutely terrible just because it has only black people in it. These are adults, not toddlers. They should have the same standards to live up to as the rest of the film industry.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Black Panther is a really great movie. It has a great story with some unexpected twists. It is a great script that was brought to life by a phenomenal cast. Chadwick Boseman is a perfect T'Challa and Black Panther. Micheal B Jordan provides a great performance as Erik Killmonger and the character has really good depth and a back story that makes him a convincing Bad Guy, possibly the greatest MCU villain we've seen yet. T'Challa's little sister Shuri steals many of the scenes she is in. Wakanda is beautiful and the movie was beautiful. Black Panther is made up of a predominately African American cast as it should be and provides and rich culture and shows us what an African nation would look like if it wasn't conquered. This is very much a political movie as it is a superhero movie. The fight scenes were mostly great and well choreographed. Some little weaknesses were the CGI wasn't perfect and it was a bit slow at the beginning. There are 2 after credit scenes that are both important.

It was clear that Marvel had a new hit character on their hands, but with the release of Black Panther, I don't think even Marvel had any idea the social impact the film would create. Black Panther (BP) is more than a studiously entertaining superhero film, more than another superb entry into the MCU; Black Panther symbolizes a prominent political statement, a celebration of culture, an enormous racial representation in superhero films and does it all while delivering one of Marvel's most enjoyable films to date.Marvel could not have chosen a better director/writer than Ryan Coogler, who pieced together a story like none we've seen before in the MCU, a story which is as firmly grounded and thought provoking as it is entertaining. The revelation of the fabled fictional city of Wakanda kick starts the entire story and the film uses its main setting as a vessel into the overall narrative and the characters which inhabit it. Wakanda is truly like a character of its own. The believed-to-be third world county holds a nearly endless supply of the world's most treasured resource, vibranium, which is literally the centerfold around the entire plot and Coogler uses the fictional country to his advantage. Wakanda is easily one of the most enthralling settings I've ever seen in a superhero film and the story feeds off it greatly.The main narrative oozes with profound themes, exploring real-world issues like isolationism, the costs of colonialism and more, while delivering the exceptional spectacle of a fantastical adventure/fantasy film. There's the insanely advanced technology and superpowers, but it's running through a still somewhat primal, strongly traditional country, and Coogler mixes these elements to near perfection. The movie progresses at a stellar pace, providing well-executed plot twists along the way and eventually bringing its story full circle in a satisfying fashion. There's still sprinkles of that classic Marvel humor, but with a grounded plot, there's more commitment to serious storytelling which is a huge welcome after 2017 was full of comedy-heavy Marvel films. Black Panther is sincerely a tremendous three acts of engaging storytelling and Coogler deserves a great deal of praise for executing such a captivating story.Black Panther boasts a set of characters more interesting and engaging than arguably any MCU film before it, a strength which propels BP's story to the next level. We see T'Challa's story arc that was launched in Civil War continue here, the struggle of becoming the next king of Wakanda while wrestling with potential division in his own country. T'Challa is a complex, expertly-written lead character whose portrayal by superstar Chadwick Boseman is full of dedication and swagger. Following this dazzling outing, Black Panther is one of the MCU's best characters without question. Opposite T'Challa is a villain who arguably climbs into Marvel's top three villains thus far. Erik Killmonger presents one of Marvel's most emotionally engaging villains yet. Killmonger's story is equally as interesting as any other character; he presents understandable motives and is a grounded, realistically written villain for our current real world. Michael B. Jordan delivers a spectacular performance as T'Challa's nemesis, the stand out character of the whole film. Black Panther separates from other recent superhero films by giving its main character a true loyal alliance to feed off, which is where the aforementioned set of characters come into play. Wakanda's all-female special force leader, Okoye (Danai Gurira), T'Challa's tech-genius sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and his ex, now Wakandan spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) not only lead the way of a rock solid supporting cast but help give even more proper representation of powerful women in the MCU. Each character is formidable and simply entertaining, and all played wonderfully by their respective actresses. What's such a true victory for BP in the character department is that the auxiliary characters run even deeper. The star power is overwhelming; Sterling K. Brown, Winston Duke, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker all are simply eccentric. As secondary characters, they may not get loads of screen time, but these characters all fill Wakanda to make it, and the movie, feel alive and full of an actual culture. Even further, Andy Serkis is vexingly gripping as Ulysses Klaue as his narrative thread continues from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Martin Freeman is a delightfully heartwarming surprise, reprising his role of Everett Ross. This stunning company of rounded, enticing characters is a vitally underrated aspect of Black Panther, and the acting cast is one for the ages.It's easy to stay brief while discussing action and visuals in Marvel films, since their track record is one of the best in those departments. Black Panther is a visual treat. The astounding mix of traditional African culture and futuristic technology found in Wakanda make way for a show stopping atmosphere, filled with eye-popping colors and superb costume design. The CGI is gorgeous and even better with the mix of Marvel's amazing practical effects. More impressive to me, however, was the audible side of the film. MCU movies always have a solid, if safe score to work behind the acting but BP takes a great stride towards more recognizable scores. Like the visuals, the mix of traditional African drumming through djembes among others with the modern hip-hop of Kendrick Lamar, is emotionally riveting, giving intensity to the action scenes. Said action sequences are nothing short of fun; anchored by uniquely written situations and high-level choreography, the action is simply a blast.This film has it all. The gloriously stunning atmosphere of Wakanda provides an enthralling visual and audible experience which is equally immersive and unique. From the top billed position to the supporting cast, there's not one weak link in the set of characters, which is loaded with premiere acting talent all the way through. Director Ryan Coogler makes his mark not only on the MCU, but on the film industry with a thematic story, which celebrates culture and delivers a down right fun and entertaining superhero flick to boot. With Black Panther, Marvel Studios continues to prove that the MCU is like a fine wine whose films only are getting better with age, and this adventure to Wakanda will stand the test of time as not only a spectacular superhero film, but as a legitimate, effective societal statement.10/10","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

It is a great movie about a Black character and it delivered an entertaining escape from the negativity of the world. Marvel delivered a young heroine who is a brainy nerd. It delivered another two strong women who were right up there fighting injustice with the men. It showed the people of Wakanda to be intelligent, compassionate and desiring peace. This movie was positive and delivered role models that kids growing up in a changing world can look up to. For adults like me, it was good clean entertainment.

Obviously, my opinion won't change any moviegoer's viewpoint as the film is on its way to be one of the highest-grossing films of the year. But review it I will...Black Panther does follow the formula of most superhero movies: establish its hero and villain, build the conflict between them while laying out the mythology and origins, and creates endless CGI battles. The difference here is its predominantly African-American cast and crew overtly celebrating its own cultural heritage. The film also takes its time to delineate its supporting characters and make them fully-rounded individuals of merit. Kudos to that, and its message of social and political conscience found within its story.The film firmly celebrates racial and gender equity in its depiction of an utopian universe called Wakanda. This isolationist African nation is a technically advanced place with a peace-loving population of various tribes who have no interest in being included with the outside world and its troubles. They purposely make their country's appearance as an impoverished third world country to our real world. But beneath its surface, there is a secret powerful substance called vibranium that protects this Kwanzaa territory and makes their Lion King into a Black Panther who will reign supreme. That is, until evil forces discover this metal for weaponry and corrupt power.Yes, the basic set-up of superhero versus super villain remains intact and much of the film's beginnings are, while compelling, still long exposition posing as a story. Our hero is T' Chaka (a fine Chadwick Boseman) who is in love with a very independent woman named Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o, ever so classy). T'Chalka (a.k.a. Black Panther) becomes king and must stop the outside world from getting their stash of vibranium at all costs. Helping him is Okoye (a terrific Danai Gurira), a fearless female warrior, and her Amazonian army of bodyguards. This film uses women power to the max, another timely positive touch in this MeToo state-of-the-world mindset.Mr. Coogler directs with skill and confidence. His debut film, Fruitvale Station, an under-appreciated crime film, showed a new talent to behold, and his second feature, Creed, established a director with an unique vision. This film, his third, shows a visionary craftsman that stages his action scenes with flair, especially his climactic battle on land and in air. His deft hand elevates this film from standard superhero mode to a film of importance and authority.However, one wishes the screenplay by Joe Robert Cole and the director would have been more adventurous in breaking out of the standard issue formula found in this fantasy genre. It does, at one point, venture out and begins to resemble more of a spy homage to James Bond, complete with fast cars and gadgetry, but then it goes safely back to comic book land and gets lost in its overindulgence of CGI effects, some of which are too noticeably fake.As written, our hero is rather a bland crusader whose supporting army of warriors are far more interesting than the main character himself. The world and characters spinning around him is a more exciting bunch. As with most action flicks, it must be the villains who have the necessary know-how to engage the audience. And in Black Panther, we have, not one, but two evil forces that are great foils. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue is the antithesis of sinister evil as a black market arms dealer and makes a lasting impression, but stealing the film is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, one of the most memorable villains since Heath Ledger's Joker. Mr. Jordan is dynamic as the vengeful rival wanting to seize the throne. He brings a street-wise edginess to the narrative very convincingly and is able to give his complex character a tragic side as well, no easy feat.Rounding out the cast are such talented performers as Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, John Kani, and Daniel Kaluuya. Also giving great support are British actors Martin Freeman as a C.I.A. agent (with a perfect American accent too) and Letitia Wright in a breakout performance as T'Challa's savvy sister, Shuri.At the risk of sounding too kumbaya, Black Panther has its flaws, but it is a rollicking good time. It doesn't break any new cinematic frontier as one is led to expect by the critical hosannas, nor does it redefine film history (except for the fact that the film industry has now discovered a black audience's willingness to pay green). But as entertainment goes, the movie repeatedly scores...and that's no easy feat either.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Notice, how i coined Wakanda rather than Black Panther specifically, this is due to the fact that Wakanda was o much of a character in the film and so many of its culture, natural beauty and citizens were fleshed out and made a large part of this film. In fact a lot of time and dedication were gone into the other aspects of the film. I thought that the film had one of MCU's more interesting villains as well, in the form of Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger, quite a lot is gone into his back story and as a street level villain I think he worked quite well. Much like the use of Vulture in Spider-man Homecoming. But, while in that case, the villain is menacing within a smaller 'street level' situation I thought in this case it's not necessarily Killmonger himself but what he represents that makes him the compelling villain that he is. Granted, he had a significant motive that can be empathized with he had a significant tie as to what he represented, the flaws in the former king T'Chaka and the conflicts that is bound to burden our hero T'Challa, the struggles he must make to choose between the right path and the path that would best benefit his people. I also enjoyed the many characters from Wakanda, Danai Gurira's Okoye was a strong female character that was a badass. Letitia Wright's Shuri who was a fun and interesting character as well. There was a decent amount of comedy that does not come into the expense of drama that the previous Thor Ragnarok may sometimes be criticized for and on a whole was a thrilling ride.All of which set in a setting that is stunning to look it, te blend of modern skyscrapers and vast mountains/valleys. And, the Wakandan culture, the rituals, the tribes, the vibrant colours all of which were presented in such a way that engages audiences and makes them grow more curious as to the many other facets of the fictional culture.","5 out of 25 found this helpful.

Every character has its own struggle to rise to fame and stumble down heavily. But as they say "" A hero must rise from the ashes of Phoenix"" to become more stronger and wiser than before, Black Panther is one such tale that needs to heard.Black Panther is an enigmatic story of a Prince T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) who is on the verge of becoming a King after his father dies in terrorist bombing. T'Challa returns home to take control of the kingdom of Wakhanda, an isolated African nation which has the resource in form of Vibranium that can change the shape of the world. However, T'Challa is challenged by his cousin Erik Killmonger, who was abandoned in his childhood when his father was killed. From the director of marvelous films like Creed and Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler proves that he is one such fine young talented guy who can transform a script into a must-see film. The first half is fast-paced and makes you glued to the screen with high-voltage drama followed by superbly executed car-chasing scene in Tokyo. We are also introduced to new characters like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ulysses Klaw (brilliantly played by Andy Serkis). The movie takes a sweet turn and second half becomes little monotonous with fall of King Of Wakhanda. The length of the film takes a backseat while editing could have been better. The saving grace is marked by a good comeback of Black Panther a.k.a King Of Wakhanda with a strong climax scene. As usual, there is a scene once the movie ends and a final scene after the entire credit rolls out. Visual effects are superb while Cinematography is excellent. Screenplay is very good and should be lauded for keeping us engaged throughout. Ryan Coogler does a good job in defining each character with aplomb. Each actor has done justice their role which makes the movie even better. But I felt, Andy Serkis stood out as Ulysses Klaw. The brilliant actor was mind-blowing in a small role and I wish the makers could have kept his characters alive for some more time.Overall, Black Panther has the right ingredients to keep you entertained. It turned out to be better than what I was expecting. Excellent 4/5","4 out of 19 found this helpful.

The plot is disjointed and stupid, with unbearably tedious dialogues and painfully poor acting. Listening to the dialogues is especially repulsive thanks to the African accents the cast is using, so prepare to hear things like ""pentha (panther)"" and ""teeknoludgee (technology)"". Chadwick Boseman especially excels at this, delivering a performance that perfectly mimics a speech impediment and an astute case of autism. Every other actor is just as cringeworthy, except for Michael B. Jordan (partially) and Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman, coincidentally the only two white actors in this garbage. But the veteran actors' serviceable performances cannot pull this trash out of the abyss.The setting for the movie is also unimaginably ridiculous - apparently there is a technologically advanced African nation hidden in plain sight. However, despite being so advanced, it selfilshly offers no aid to its neighbors, honors ridiculous savage traditions and has its soldiers armed with spears and swords. Thanks, but even a talking raccoon breaks the suspension of disbelief less than this. If ludicrous colorful costumes weren't enough to annihilate the visual aesthetics of the movie, it's also filled with old video game-quality CGI that makes your bleed, so obviously it stands out.But wait, it's an action movie, right, perhaps there are some thrills to be had? Well no Sir, because about 90% of action sequences are done with the same cheap CGI while the remaining 10% are horrendously choreographed with slow unrealistic motions during fights.To add to all this bedlam this film allows itself racist phrases like ""Great, another white boy to heal"". The fact that this mucus gained over a billion at the box office is disgusting and shows how far both Disney and the herds called ""general audiences"" have fallen.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

I was hoping that the critics' reviews are accurate. This has 98-100% on Rotten Tomatoes and the media is going bananas for this movie. It's an entertaining movie but extremely overrated.Expect the same formula from MCU. This movie mentions a lot from previous MCU movies that if you haven't watched them all, you'll be very confused like me. I don't understand some things being mentioned because this movie references the previous movies so much. The opening is good but the story drags that it becomes boring. The fight scenes are good but don't expect so much action from this film. The film is so predictable that I was yawning at some moments. And Marvel releases like 3-5 movies a year so the Marvel fatigue is real. The critics are suspicious. They should give this about 40-50% on RT. Don't trust the critics. Watch this if you want but I don't recommend seeing it theaters. I wanna give this 6 stars but to balance the overrated 10 stars, I will only give 1 star. If you're not a diehard MCU fan, skip the theaters.","81 out of 208 found this helpful.

If you aren't a total idiot, you can understand the nature of this film. While it does remind me of the Lion King, and while I wish there had been more scenes of Black Panther using his super abilities and in his actual attire, overall the movie's direction was smart. It wasn't just a super hero movie. Social and cultural themes were woven into it, giving Black Panther a more developed character. The visuals were stunning and ALL of the supporting characters were developed. It was more than just a Marvel movie. It was just a movie all its own.I don't understand why there can't be superhero movies that are a little serious just like this. Many people constantly talk about how the other movies were funny. But let's think about the original comics. They weren't all riddled with corny jokes. There were some funny scenes and such, but why can't super hero movies cause controversy as well? If this had been a story about other controversies, relative to other races of people, no one would feel this movie was ""unrelatable"". Captain America Winter Soldier had a deeper story line than some of the others, and was more thought-provoking than other Marvel movies. This movie gives a similar flavor. Still, does a movie need humor to be good? I don't think so. Still, if that's what you're looking for, the seriousness of the theme can cloud out the humor at many points of the story.Yet, I would like to move beyond the backstory in the future and actually see the super hero in his essence, in his suit, saving others' lives. But I'm sure we'll get there. This movie was the perfect stepping-stone for that.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This was an amazing movie by all means, it had everything you could want from this movie. You have amazing performances by everybody, best villain in MCU, beautiful visuals, action that made you grab your seat.
Movie showed that every hero isn't unstoppable, they too are people, who get hurt in major ways. You understand villain's motivations and why he's doing all of it. It actually feels like the villain isn't a villain, he doesn't have an ""evil"" plan to rule everything. He's trying to fix things for others, that he didn't have.
Every character has soul in them and have a reason to exist in this movie. Actions have consequences, which will determine others doings.It's not an over the top superhero movie. It shows us character and the impact of everybody.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

In many ways it succeeds, yet it remains to be seen whether the depiction of African Americans are truly authentic and innately faithful to respecting cultural differences. There are suggestions that, like its stereotypical predecessors popularized for the Western audience, liberties may have been taken. There are several weaknesses in two of the early fight scenes that seem to be more for the screenwriter's convenience to move the storyline along rather to offer a more convincing display of intelligent preparations for combat. The male dominated action scenarios continue with some effort to provide some balance to the violence inherent in action-thrillers. What makes this superhero movie stand out a bit from the rest is its attempt at a humanistic theme that emerges in places but doesn't quite fulfill the potential of a truly classic movie of real depth. In some ways, this movie reflects the current political turmoil in America today as good and evil are on display in the morality of what a Country stands for. Black Panther results in a good effort that sustains interest and incorporates the requisite elements for a superhero movie and includes a bit more thoughtfulness.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This sheer visual aspect of the film held my attention before I was sold on the film's underlying story. Even if you don't go for this sort of movie as a genre, you should nevertheless see it because its visuals demand being seen on screen. The film's stunning and lush realization of Wakanda alone is worth the price of admission.Then, there is the powerful story of two viciously competing visions for the place of Wakanda in the world and confronting injustice and oppression against its people. This film becomes a surprisingly gripping debate between confrontation and pragmatism, between vindictiveness and conciliation. Killmonger and T'Challa come to epitomize the conflicting philosophies battling for the leadership of Wakanda. In that regard, it's a great political Marvel film as well.I was impressed by how the whole cast gave this film so much vitality. Although Michael B. Jordan is somewhat underused in the beginning, his presence becomes more paramount and he shapes the film more and more as it goes along. Boseman is tremendously heroic and sympathetic in the title role. This is a Marvel blockbuster to remember when the dust settles. Strongly recommended.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The only other film i can think of that does this inside or outside the MCU is the newest Spiderman.Iron Man and Captain America like to shoot-first-ask-questions-later and feel sad about the unintended destruction they caused while carrying out their mission. The drama in Black Panther is much more interesting because we see he and his family weigh the consequences of the actions they must take.Thor could learn a thing or two about what it means to be king.Great performances. Great costumes. Great production design.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Honestly though, this movie deserves the praise. I believe that this is GREAT movie. It's entertaining and the acting is pretty good. You have Chadwick Boseman, Angela Bassett, Micheal B. Jordan, and even Danai Gurira for goodness sake. This movie not only has big names but it also has some cool special effects and world building. Also, it's funny and intense during some moments but I especially loved what they did with the planet of Wakanda.In my opinion, this is most interesting Marvel movie I've found myself watching.

Everywhere from the music to the action sequences. The film also redefined Hollywood and shattered both expectations and stereotypes with its primarily black cast. The movie also added some cultural and societal references that made everyone question the society we live in.
The cinematography was spectacular. The film makers blended traditional african clothing and culture with futuristic technology to create a world that seemed both tangible and out of reach. The acting was phenomenal. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent job portraying T'Challa, who is conflicted with his traditional values and what he'd experienced in the rest of the world. Michael B. Jordan definitely stole the show as Erik Killmonger. His superb portrayal of the sympathetic antagonist left audiences with both tears and cheers. Letitia Wright also added some excellent comic relief as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The film score by Ludwig Göransson was perfect. He blended traditional african music with modern day hip-hop to bring both Wakanda and its characters to life. The plot was phenomenal. There were many plot twists that kept the story rolling and the strife between the conflicted T'Challa and determined Killmonger added a lot of depth to the story. The cultural and social references that intertwined with the story related with the audience to make them feel they were part of the story, and that the story was a part of them. Black Panther is a film worthy of praise and will forever be one of the top movies of the century.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

""Should we use our resources to protect our people, or help others in need?"" That deep interest in societal culture is in every frame of Marvel's latest venture. To be sure, it's a celebration of black culture, and a bright and proud one at that. However, it's also a celebration of culture in general, an awards assembly giving medals to those who lean into their own history, even while improving it. Those themes help Black Panther exudes confidence and power in even its quietest moments. 
Its vigor vibrates from the fictional country of Wakanda, a place so vibrantly beautiful and well-realized you'll wish to jump into the screen. The story of a prince-turned-warrior-king doesn't provide tons of plot-surprises or even a super compelling protagonist. Nevertheless, it soars in its emotionally exciting action scenes (waterfall ceremony), its stacked cast of characters (greatest superhero sibling ever?), and potent villain psychology.
Sure, Coogler has fallen into the Marvel trope of the hero having to fight the evil version of himself at the end of the film. It also follows the recent Marvel trend of creating villains who are empathetic and fully logical, to the point that you find yourself rooting for them. And with Jordan's Killmonger, we're shown one of the most rich and heartfelt antagonists in superhero history, making Boseman's Black Panther confront the truth in the film's line, ""It's hard for a good man to be king."" Thankfully, Black Panther knows that's a challenge worth taking. Wakanda forever.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Currently, this is not the case but Africa deserves to be since the beginning of life started from the motherland. 
In addition, I am really thankful and grateful for the fact that the black females in this movie played a HUGE role in the saving of Wakanda and the women were very assertive and definitely had power of the men in some ways.

This review is my tribute to Chadwick.This is one of my most favorite films in MCU. This is one of the best films in MCU when it comes to storytelling. The biggest strength of this movie is the characters and their motivations. The outline of the story looks like a throne fight between two brothers but inside it is more than you think.Chadwick stars as the titular character and fits that role perfectly. As a king, he chooses what is best for his people and also the world, but he is the same king as previous kings in Wakanda. Everything changes when the killmonger arrives.Both Hero and villain journey are more than interesting. The film respects African people and their culture, history. This is one of the MCU movies with a lot of female characters and justifies them. Black Panther is a triumph of universal appeal and demographic specificity.The film is comparatively light on action, and the pacing occasionally stumbles in the back half, but the sharp character work and rich production design make up for nitpicks here and there. And when the action does arrive, it is brutal and to the point, with a second-act car chase combining real-world action with Wakandian technology that I could watch on a loop for hours on end.The first act is dedicated to setting up the world of Wakanda (an isolated nation shielded from the outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably a What if Africa had never been colonized fantasy) and T'Challa's from prince to king coronation process.
Black Panther is a fine stand-alone action drama that deals with the consequences of a modern civilization made possible by widespread colonization.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

This is another amazing piece from Marvel universe with Black Panther making an impact in the class of superhero movies. The background story is amazing and so was the action till the very end. The part before interval flows slow but picks from the first action sequence on-wards. I observed that all the actors which not only the lead actors but also the supporting roles & extras really jumped in to make a Marvel Movie. Good job by the director Ryan Coogler to craft a wonderful movie that not only consists of just action sequence, but message about the African tribe how much significance they emphasize on vibranium and safeguarding it from evil purposes. Boseman and Jordan were exceptional in their roles as well. This is a good flick from Marvel that you would love watching at least once.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Michael B Jordan as Killmonger is indeed Marvel's BEST villain as he brings the best out of his character. Shuri (played by Letitia Wright) should already be getting her own spinoff! All the females in this movie are queens (Okoye Nakia & Ramonda are amazing) M'Baku is hilariously played by Winston Duke. And the King of Wakanda himself is wonderfully played by Chadwick Boseman. You can literally see all of the characters putting their hearts and souls into their performances. Every character is good in their own right.To wrap things up: HIGHLY Recommend supporting this movie by watching it in theatersYA GIRL

Jordan) and his arms dealing ally (Andy Serkis) who is after Wakandan resources.With a culturally rich narrative that transcends race and sex, Marvel's most complex Avenger takes center stage. Backed by a stellar supporting cast as multifaceted as him, Black Panther's first solo outing is not only a milestone for the genre but the industry. Now, let's work towards a day when T'Challa can simply be called: Panther. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Killmonger is definitely one of the better MCU villains. T'Challa was a great character. 
The acting was more or less good.. Andy Serkis was terrible to the point of absurdity. Bilbo just played Bilbo again. And Shuri wasn't really good.The action was to my surprise really poorly shot, especially the last fight.The soundtrack was amazing for the most part. It reminded me a lot of the Lion King opening. Except for one chase scene where it was distracting.CGI unfinished and you can easily tell. Prequel levels of bad. Humor doesn't land at all for me. Political messaging was okay and I didn't mind it at all. Apart from the post-credits scene it wasn't on the nose and actually presented nuance. It doesn't hinder the movie. ""Black Pride"" is not a thing, and if it is, it is presented as a bad thing, as the only characters that exhibit it were Killmonger and M'Baku. Ryan Coogler delivers on the story and characters, and you can see that careful thought was put into his vision and the script, however some of the technical aspects seem unfinished, and the humor was the worst out of any MCU film to date (humor is subjective). This leads me to believe that the film needed more time.
All in all it was a solid Marvel film, but nothing special.

I considered leaving the film about halfway through but figured I payed for it, might as well finish it.As I said the spectacles were are as to be expected with the wild high budgets of Marvel films. With that it had some unique special effects and wild rides that I suppose are worth the price of admission. But th story is just atrocious, poorly written and really did not suck me in.

I loved it & consider ""Black Panther"" to be definitely one of the best Marvel has made.Chadwick Boseman Is an icon, a legend of Cinema for his iconic role here & he always stole the show when he turned up in the Avengers films.R. I. P to one of the greatest actors of his generation, Boseman was a powerful presence on screen, a man who seemed both calm & in control & also seemed lost, lonely & hurt, maybe it was his weary eyes or the seriousness in his facial expression but all i know is he stood up as one hell of an interesting leading man!!!For me his ""Trilogy"" of Great movies that i will definitely remember him for are the special super hero mega hit, BLACK PANTHER, his excellent gritty & dark revenge Thriller, MESSAGE FROM THE KING & his exciting & slick action Cop Thriller, 21 BRIDGES, all great films & excellent roles for one of the best performers out there!!!Cinema & the world has lost a great man.""Black Panther"" was such an Awesome & interesting character when he popped up in the other Marvel films as a side character & here he gets his own Amazing movie.Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther & brings his level of calm & coolness to his own fantastical adventure that plays like a super cool Spy flick adventure. Everything in this movie is a feast for the eyes as the design of the Wakanda is absolutely beautiful & visually stunning to look at!!! The production design is outstanding & the futuristic city is just amazing. Black Panther had a huge budget like all the Marvel films so it's top notch in every single department from the stunning cinematography to the Awesome & exciting music score, this is an epic super hero movie with one of the most Awesome looking & interesting Marvel characters ever!!!The huge cast is fantastic & the action scenes are spectacular, fresh & so exciting to watch, there's some funny moments & some deep moments but most of all ""Black Panther"" is an amazing fantasy adventure with Awesome fight scenes, cool gadgets & a mix of interesting characters.I heard all good things about this movie & excellent reviews & i have enjoyed pretty much all of the Marvel films so far, well i like some more than others & Black Panther is one of my faves of the MCU.Black Panther is rich with old ancient African culture & beautiful imagery, i movie that is powerful in it's vision & in it's story.Black Panther, is without a doubt one of the most impressive & spectacular looking movies I've ever seen especially within a ""Blockbuster"" superhero movie.Just sit back & enter the Amazing world of the Black Panther & Wakanda for a blast of exciting action packed adventure & a big visual treat.Black Panther may not be the absolute best of Marvels Movies but it's definitely one of the best & is probably Chadwick's best work as an actor in a leading role? Enjoy this fantastical adventure.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Cultures are depicted in the most cringe and utterly disgusting and weird way. This was a total garbage for me compared to Iron man, Avengers, Guardians of Galaxy, Thor, Captain America and all the other Marvel movies that gave us at least some sort of excitement. Probably because i had such high expectation from Marvel even before walking into the theater. I definitely thought this movie was not entertaining at all...

But this one plays out more like a shakespearean tale rather than a superhero movie, which is good. The action sequences are the films weakest point, the political drama playing out being more interesting. This is in part helped by Killmonger character, Michael B Jordan totally rocking in this role. But he is not used to his full potential, I wanted to see more of him. Also having fun with his character is non-CGI Andy Serkis who looks like a genuine badass. All the others are pretty good too. Surprisingly this is one Marvel movie where they have toned down on the comedy making it seem the stakes are high and not something to be joked over. This is complimented with the awesome soundtrack which moves you and cheer for the kiing.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

And it's visually beautiful. It's a delight, simply put.Reviewers kneejerk-calling this film 'divisive' can only be explained by an ignorance of both world civilization history and current events, and an oversensitivity to topics they have the luxury of otherwise avoiding. The story and characters are NUANCED. Sometimes people do bad things while trying to do good things. This isn't new and it shouldn't be controversial in a story for adults. All stories have a political stance. Black Panther handles its own positively and well.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Believe it or not, this movie is just as good as Winter Soldier and Civil War... Regardless of the film's shortcomings, it's still enjoyable and worthwhile to watch. The movie did a good job paying homage to African diaspora culture & spirituality... It also turns the focus on Afro-futurism... Yes, the movie does make social critiques, which is what good movies, as a form of art does-share reflections on how far we've come as a society and how much more work needs to get done...The movie is in no way racist... It's actually a good strategic move for Marvel opening up the MCU to diverse worlds and characters... The acting is very good with Michael B. Jordan playing a menacing anti-hero... I know a lot of folks are surprised to see a predominantly black cast bring forth such strong performances but get over and use this movie as a springboard to learn more about other cultures besides the Eurocentric dominated media...The Black Panther soundtrack is on fireeeeeeeeeeeee...

Written and directed by Ryan Coogler (and Joe Robert Cole), who is on a real hot streak after Fruitvale Station and Creed, Black Panther is the first superhero/comic book movie to feature a black lead since the Blade series (1998, 2002 & 2004), but more than that, this is a distinctively African story with a predominantly black cast. Something that's equally unique for a franchise film and a tentpole movie that's leading into Avengers: Infinity War. Whether Black Panther will prove to be significant enough to encourage more faith in diverse casts within the industry and audiences at large is yet to be seen, but I've every confidence that this will be a very popular and successful film. And it deserves to be. Black Panther is really terrific. Importantly, to some degree, Black Panther also works as a stand-alone film, being quite self-contained despite being part of a bigger world. Much like Wakanda, which is almost akin to an African Brigadoon; a place hidden in the jungle, unknown to outsiders, unseen, but magical within. This Utopia has been built on a rare metal that is more technologically advanced than anything else on earth, whilst a certain plant unique to the land is key to the royal bloodline and the power of Black Panther. This is a beautifully realised film, with a real cultural sensibility with a true identity established for Wakanda and its inhabitants. Every scene is brought vividly to life, from tribal rituals on the top of a waterfall to a city infrastructure, throne rooms and tech centres, and a nice diversion to Busan, where one of the film's villains, Andy Serkis' Klaue is being pursued. What's also evident is the enjoyment and commitment a truly excellent cast displays throughout. From Boseman, who plays T'Challa as an intelligent, sensitive, proud man, to a fierce Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyonga on assertive form, and a sparkling performance from Letitia Wright, who, is both T'Challa's sister and a Q-like master of arms and tech specialist. With palace intrigue abound, Black Panther finds ways to make T'Challa truly reflect his culture, which goes some way to counterbalance some of the typical - perhaps even expected - superhero movie tropes; absent fathers, flying machines, special costumes and a major battle at the climax. With the battle in question finding a different approach to the city under siege narrative that's been overdone in terms of mass destruction. There's strong support from Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Angela Bassett. Distinctive costume design, great music and a fine score. Plus well-paced moments of humour in a film that's smart, self-aware, ambitious enough to be individual within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a real pleasure from start to finish.","5 out of 31 found this helpful.

I have no idea who The Black Panther is or where he came from but left the film knowing all I needed to know. I thought the acting was good - with guards and royalty rightly subdued. Some complaints have said they're acting ""wooden"" but - no - they're acting with decorum. You wouldn't have a King act like, for example, Deadpool. The characters were mostly well-thought out with the exception of Killmonger whom I found a little lacking. He was enjoyable enough but - one minute he isn't there, then he is and this is his story thrown in quick. Okay then... It didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film but given the length (over 2 hours), perhaps they could have trimmed elsewhere to show more of him too? The start of the film was a little muddled with the directing of the action sequence, which was a little hard to tell what was going on but thankfully it became better with later action sequences. As for action, there isn't a lot due to the story being told but what there was, was exciting enough even though - certain scenes - you knew how they would play out. For example, you know this person won't win this particular showdown because of whom they're up against, kind of thing.The humour in this film isn't as much as other films but, again, it fits the world the story is in. Stan Lee's cameo was nice ;) I do like the fact he pops up in all of the films! The scenery in the film was glorious, the CGI done properly (not like a certain DC film that came out recently). What I will say though, I went in thinking I would hate this film because the trailer just looked dull. I'm glad I went regardless. I'm not sure how they would do a good trailer for this without giving all of the action sequences away but... Yep... As far as Marvel Origin stories go, I believe this is one of the stronger despite a few niggles. I look forward to seeing more of Black Panther.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

No. The acting is great, the costumes are gorgeous, the protagonists have depth, and the scenery is at times breathtaking. I don't think it deserves all these one-star reviews.Is it a great movie? ...No. The plot is fairly predictable and formulaic, the use of 'vibranium' to solve every issue that arises feels a little cheap, and the main villain is fairly cliche.Most importantly, for me this movie was missing the one element that Marvel movies have consistently delivered: it just wasn't fun. There's very little of the humour that we're used to seeing, there's no surprising plot twists, and the action scenes are at best so-so and at worst an onslaught of terrible CGI that would look out of date 10 years ago.So all in all: watch it once if you're a Marvel fan or if you are interested in the cultural impact side of things. But if you're a casual movie-goer just looking to relax and enjoy yourself for a fun few hours, try Spider-Man: Homecoming or Thor: Ragnarok instead. This is one MCU movie I won't bother rewatching.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

No Worries.I came here and read the movie reviews from other users before start writing my own. I think it's more of preference problem for people who rated the movie as bad, even under average. I personally loved this movie.Plot holes, sure there will always be plot holes in any movies. (Even in real life, the things that 'should go a certain way' can turn out to be the most nonsensical way though). Start with the cons, from my point of view, at some point the main conflict of the movie was pretty typical. The development pace of the movie can be a little inconsistent. Not to mention there are some CGI disappointment. Marvel-Disney production is usually one of the most decent in CGI that you sometimes can't even tell. But in this movie, in some scene the CGI are too obvious and even to the level of you think you're watching some early 2000s or even late 90s movies.Some fighting scene are just not to well shot. At some scene you can't see really well what is actually happening. The motions of the camera can make you suddenly feel motion sick, no joke.The plot are pretty predictable, but it's still pretty great how the production team can make you enjoy how the story flowed.The pros are that this movie really step out of the 'Comedic Fun Superheroes Movie' typical. It's serious, has a real issue for the character to face. It's more than just a superhero movie. It's about a growth of a man, a lifeshift of a 'prince' becoming a 'king'. It has become one of my favorite MCU movie after Civil War and Spider-Man Homecoming.I love the performance of Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. Both did great. Michael B Jordan delivers 'swag' to his role, though. Which is awesome.
While Martin Freeman is just being Bilbo Baggins, CIA version. (IYKWIM)Musics are great. You will really love it.Overall this movie is doing great. It makes you getting more excited and can't wait for the upcoming Avengers All Star movie, a.k.a The Infinity War.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

But what I also want to add positively is that I really like the movie a lot, because it's a bit different from what you normally know about Marvel (other country / religion, a lot of technology, sister of the hero is quite important and something else)","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

He should hopefully be getting more work after this. Story: Black Panther has a good but sometimes predictable story. While the story has some touching moments, it contains some familiar Marvel tropes.Script: The script is excellent, containing good jokes and some powerful emotional dialogue particularly from Killmonger (coming up). It also provides an extremely relevant message, a type that Marvel or any other comic-book film has never done before.Performances: Ooooh, the performances are incredible across the board! Chadwick Boseman does a nice job portraying a half superhero/half king and Lupita Nyong'o's great too. However, the real standouts are Okoye (Danai Gurira), Shuri (Letitia Wright), Klaue (Andy Serkis) and of course KILLMONGER (Michael.B.Jordan)! Danai shows badass fighting skill while still having a heart, Letitia is HILARIOUS as Shuri as well as endearing and has excellent chemistry with Chadwick. Andy made me smile everytime he appeared with his goofy performance. But then Michael comes in. Killmonger is 100% the best villain since Loki, a bad guy with clear motivations who allows you to sympathize with him. Michael somehow portraying him as enraged and charismatic simultaneously and leaves quite the mark on you even after the credits by giving many good points. I could make a whole essay on him if I could honestly, he's that complex...Visuals and Other Aspects: The movie has stunning costume and production design (I LOVE Shuri's lab!). However, there is some bad green screen moments in some parts of the film.All in all, Black Panther, while a little overhyped, is an amazing movie definitely worth seeing in theaters. If you get the chance, SEE THIS MOVIE!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Killmonger is, by far, THE greatest villain in the MCU. And he isn't exactly wrong in his motivations, either; he just goes about things in the wrong way. He has so much depth, and so many layers -- you can't hate him. I feel all of his emotions. I also empathise with him completely. I'm living for the sequel. Easily the best film in The MCU. Kevin Feige said so, too. I wholeheartedly agree.

Before Black Panther, I'd been completely put off Marvel movies for the fact that they were cookie cutter type of movies. The villain is always going to lose, the hero will always win, even to the point of falling of the cliff and have the hero handing on by one hand, no sacrifices ever really have to be made, its full of cheesy one liners and doesn't really break from method. It was the same recipe, repeat over and over.Until Black Panther, this felt completely new. It felt like anyone could be killed, no one was safe. The music was fresh and complimented the whole movie. The cast was awesome, they felt actually badass, like I would be intimidated if I came across Black Panther, compare this with other superheroes who seem so weak or lame.The costumes and technology used was exciting and kept me interested throughout. The cast was funny and well chosen. Right from Chadwick Boseman throughout to all cast members there were great strengths in acting. Letitia Wright was very funny, alongside Michael B. Jordan who was perfect baddie. Strong, ruthless and motivated for the right reasons.This movie was epic and so enjoyable from beginning to end. If you're over Marvel and their predictabilty then give this a go.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman is good as ever as T'Challa and even the supporting Wakandan cast manages to do a good job, but Michael B Jordan's Kilmonger is absolutely one of the worst Comic Book Movie villains I have ever seen. Not only do they keep the formula of making the villain the hero's mirror opposite (which works more times than not) but the filmmakers try real hard for you to like, pity and feel sorry for such a horribly designed character whose main trait is being an awful, petty and vengeful human being.There is no real substance to the movie unless you wanna be deeply immerse into race politics, not my cup of tea to be honest. Which makes me give Black Panther a 5 out of 10, the lowest score I have ever given a movie from this saga.I did not enjoy it, I am not looking forward for a sequel, not even if Namor showed up.","30 out of 70 found this helpful.

Next in line for the throne the king to be played by Chadwick Boseman faces several challenges as he attempts to take his new role in the hierarchy of Wakanda. This story is a postscript as it takes place following the devastating loss of a family member previewed In Marvels Civil War. The film depicts the road to the throne as he is challenged by another contender. A contender that he was unaware even existed, let along had actual birth rights to the throne The story goes on to depict how ones environment can play a huge part in the outcome of the human psyche. Vibranium continues to push the advanced society of Wakanda forward even further as a seemly magical substance that can be of use in any necessary circumstance. We are introduced to Erik Killmonger an inner-city Harlem New-York native played by actor Michael B Jordan. He is smart, attractive, and a natural born killer with a prior military background and tactical training also did I mention he has a huge chip on his shoulder. He becomes a mercenary for hire and eventually comes face to face with our proteaginous. This tale is not your classic good versus evil story, it's a true look into the eyes of the oppressed and the moral obligation of the innocent bystander. We the audience experience this game of chess play out as Pawn captures Rook when Killmonger infiltrates the seeming impenetrable fortress of Wakanda. The theme seen through this film is exploring complex problems. T'Challa is forced to face the wrongs of a person he adores while making the decisions to move forward and protect his family and his people. The story reaches its climax in famous Marvel fashion as good vs evil comes face to face for the final battle that pins families, friends and even lovers against each other. This becomes an all-out intense brawl where no punches are pulled. Music and angles signify the intensities of the wars fought in T'Calla's mind and on the actual battlefield for his people. After the fierce battle ends and the dust clears, we arrive back in America in a not so privileged neighborhood. Black Panther emerges as a beacon of hope. This film is a much watch for adults and children alike as it not only provides insight to many social and economic issues, we face in our current climate but also gives hope that we can all live in harmony.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

King T'Challa's quest to find out the truth of being a king is a very beautiful portrayal of the hardships of being a leader and the legacy that you carry with you. The feminism is on point here. Seldom do we see many women involved in an action scene in many dumb movies. This is not the case here. You get to see Okoye take down a car with a spear in an awesome manner, and so much more... even women soldiers fight in the end with the tribes. This movie is populated with feminism, racial equality and most importantly, a story that brims with heart and moral choices that decide one's fate. This is a super-hero movie that you've never seen.

I've been disliking the direction Disney choose for Civil War and the following titles, which mostly put ""fun"" upon telling a story about ""hero"" or just making a proper movie. Black Panther surprisingly shows some difference. The whole movie is trying to be not-so-""funny"". Instead, they treat the character seriously, build the jorney and the character's arc convincingly, and made several reflection on contemporary issues. 
Surely there are ""Marvel issues"" remaining. The music repeatedly jumps from unique and interesting style back to lame and formatic orchestra. Several scenes' cinematography remain lack of contrast (but mostly good job for Rachel Morrison! much better than the disastrous Thor 3). And the dialogues are definately childish compared to the issues they try to dicuss about. But in all, this is a bright changes for Marvel's Cinematic Universe. 
Seen the Infinity War trailer, you can tell this new style is continuing (especially considering the whole trailer has no silly jokes!). Good decision this time, Disney!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

T'Challa (Black Panther), returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a new adversary, in a conflict with global consequences. It is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. Critics considered it one of the best movies set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance. It received praise for its screenplay, direction, performances, action, costume design, production merits, and soundtrack. Notwithstanding, the CGI effects received some criticism. It grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, earning it the highest-grossing film of 2018, as well as the third-highest-grossing film ever in the United States. Audiences gave the film an A+, the second superhero film to receive that grade after Marvel's own The Avengers. I found it a solid stand alone film, but it delivers a limited connection to the MCU other than the death T'Challa's father, albeit the plot engine for the film. Definitely one of the better movies of the series, but not sure if it's my personal favorite.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The city of Wakanda is beautiful and this movie makes me interested in the culture of Wakanda.The motivation of the villain is clear, he's not just a bad guy who wants to take over the world or that kind of typical, bland villain. We actually understand his motivation and why he is doing what he is doing. We understand where he came from and that's what makes a great villain.The action sequences are all of course amazing and beautifully shot.

"8","/10","Enjoyable despite weaknesses in the writing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4069777/?ref_=tt_urv","BloodOfTheEnemy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10503939/?ref_=tt_urv","21 February 2018","As others have said, the movie suffers from weaknesses in the writing and and an under-ambitious plot, but the imaginative depiction of Wakanda, combined with Chadwick Boseman's charisma in the lead makes the whole thing pretty enjoyable all the same. Overall, I liked Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War, liked him throughout this movie, and came out of the theater looking forward to seeing more of the character in Infinity Wars.My main gripe would be that the conflict motivation in the story is highly under-used. The premise is pretty interesting, that Black Panther's home country of Wakanda is as big a technological power as Asgaard, but has been concealing this throughout history and likewise has been remaining neutral in world conflicts, even though their technology could have been a powerful force, for example, against black oppression throughout the ages. It takes very little imagination to see the widespread political outrage that this could cause if it leaked out, with potentially thousands of people and powerful radical enemy organizations trying to take control of that technology from T'Challa. Instead, the writers decided to limit the antagonistic forces to basically just one disgruntled guy. As a result, the movie comes off as a bit of a knock-off of the first Thor movie, except that here it's Killmonger instead of Loki who threatens a one-man coup of the kingdom. Anyway, still enjoyable, as I said, but I will always regret what the movie could have been","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I really don't like when people just give rating 1 to a movie that's good. It's not the best one in the MCU, but it's definitely something new. 
In my opinion, only one first movie in the MCU, for one particular character, that was really awesome, was the Iron Man. But if we compare Black Panther with Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange... it was completely the same, just an introduction to a character. I didn't compare it with the Guardians of the Galaxy cause Guardians are just different kind of story. They didn't bother to introduce you too much with the backgrounds of Star-Lord, Drax, Gamora, Groot and Rocket, they just mentioned it through the movie. 
Black Panther just introduced you with Wakanda, main characters, history, vibranium, technological advancement, tradition ... and it's just a beginning.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There were many promising drama elements on race politics, father-son relation but none were presented in an original way. The movie was annoyingly predictive as if a parody of itself.

I will start out with the performances that were good which are Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis. Sterling K Brown has a very small role in the film, but you can feel his impressive performance in throughout the entire film. This film is a little bit different when it comes to amount of blood due to the different forms combat that is in the film. This film has references from Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace, 007 films, Kingsman films, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight. Winston Duke in my opinion is the breakout star in the film and I would encourage people to look at him for more work in the future. I can honestly say that I did realize that he had small role on Modern Family. The performance of Letitia Wright reminded me in the best way of Q from 007 franchise. Danai Gurira performance reminded me of Viola Davis ferocity meets the agility of her character from the Walking Dead. Michael B. Jordan is the performance that I am still on the fence about I would describe of having elements of Malcom X, Blown Away, the Dark Knight, Déjà Vu. I can see this film being nominated for the 91st Oscars for best score, cinematography and costume design. My only real complaint with the film was with one of the special effects in the scene seemed not to be finished. I am going against most other film critics; I am giving this film 9 and ¾ stars out of 10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some or more of it seems racially or politically motivated. Others are either being movie snobs or just being contrarian. You don't have to think it's the greatest superhero movie ever (which it isn't) or the best Marvel movie (for me, it's not), but this was an excellent movie. For those who say the acting was wooden, what are you comparing this movie to? ""There Will Ne Blood""? ""The Godfather""? This is an action movie. Characters are meant to represent archetypes. There is not enough time to flesh out every character on this scale. T'Challa and Erik Killmore were the main characters. Their struggles were the core of the movie. This is not Game of Thrones, where you have 8 seasons to give depth to 15-20 characters. Compare the acting in this movie compared to the latest Transformers (or any of them really) or the latest Pirates of the Caribbean, and it's no even funny how superior this movie is to those. If you the no the acting in this movie is bad I question if you know what quality acting is, beyond what hip culture tells you (I know the type, I use to be a part of that culture)Those who attack the plot, it's a comic book movie. It's an excellent one, but one none the less. Still, it was ambitious in its scope. It was faithful to its heritage and shows black characters beyond typical movie tropes. Black characters are in Black Panther were superheroes, scientist, warriors, and a villain who was relatable. You shouldn't have to be black to appreciate this (I'm not). To the rest of you, you clearly have problems with this movie that more racially and politically motivated. Is the idea of a movie that portrays a world that has been unfair to people of African dissent so offensive? Where the points of view of some of the characters wrong? No. If it offends you politically, that's your problem. Open your mind and look at the world for what it is. If you can't see the world from others' point of view, then you are the problem, not the movie. Just shut up and let others enjoy the movie. Ultimately the movie had a positive, inclusive message. It was innovative and superbly directed (Coogler is on a roll). Haters go away.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I like to say it like it is.Second off I will say that I have an HD projector with a 100 inch screen in my basement with a full surround sound. This can make a huge difference when watching a movie. Especially with action movies.I thought this movie was brilliant. Here is why.
It is completely different to anything I have seen of late. The cast for a start. A mainly all black African American cast in a big screen movie. It just brought a whole new dynamic to the film.The cinematography was unreal in this movie. I kept commenting all the way through it. I loved the whole African setting for a superhero movie. Again something different.The music. An entire album was written for this movie and it's a very good album. How often does that happen?I felt the acting was pretty decent. The storyline I didn't mind. I judge a movie based on the movie. Not on how the storyline was like the lion king or some other movie. What has that got to do with anything?People of imdb what in the hell dictates a 5 star movie never mind an 8 or a 9 if this movie only gets a 1 star. 
1 star. 1 star?????????? Are you serious? I am literally laughing at the thought of what people think a bad movie is. I've seen horrendous movies and I mean terrible movies but i still gave them a 3 for what they did right. I gave this movie an 8 star and that is a true retrospective of the entertainment value that this movie provided me with on my given night to watch it.Don't be put off by terrible biased reviews. Judge for yourself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Black Panther's monumental success at the box office is certainly evidence that this film crosses many boundaries and touches people in a fundamental way. While the film delivers the expected action, moments and humor seen in all the Marvel movies it also speaks to historic problems in the United States and the world. Certainly the race and poverty message is a poignant one and resonates with not only African Americans but also any historically exploited or oppressed people.
It is interesting to note how some Caucasian Americans have reacted to Black Panther over some other Marvel films. Some white people that I have encountered (especially the overly-sensitive Trump supporters) seem to be insulted by the racial overtones of this film and cannot possible separate those notions from the rest of the film's quality. It is important to note that among the prior criticisms here on IMDB you will see many ""I'm not racist but"" comments or at least claims at not noticing the race of the actors. As we see in the age of dog whistles to white supremacists these claims are typical of such people. 
It is very sad to be living in a time when people cannot separate their own political biases from judging quality artwork. Black Panther is an exemplary piece of entertainment just like most of the Marvel movie franchise entries and no doubt that the inclusion of an almost all African American cast made the film more attractive to a worldwide audience. It is obvious that some weak minded viewers simply cannot stand it when minorities gain great success weather it is in attaining the highest office in America or making block buster films. In the end, the overwhelming evidence by multiple sources prove Black Panther to be a great movie but it's detractors who are racially motivated really aren't interested in truth backed by objectivity; they only want to see their own frailty supported by hate filled opinion.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Subverting expectations; Coogler takes on Marvel's most exciting story yet","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4545278/?ref_=tt_urv","isaacj02","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur70889461/?ref_=tt_urv","29 December 2018","Few predicted the level to which Marvel's Black Panther would become a cultural phenomenon. Director Ryan Coogler's addition to the MCU received acclaim from critics and audiences alike, as well as breaking an impressive $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Perhaps key to the success of Black Panther is the way that it thrills both fans of the superhero flick but also transcends the usual bounds of the genre, in its characters, design and themes. This is a film that subverts the typical Marvel formula, something which is long overdue.
Chadwick Boseman comfortably leads the film as the eponymous hero, venerable monarch by day and suit-sporting vigilante by night. T'Challa rules the nation of Wakanda, a futuristic and technologically advanced utopia shielded by a mask as a third-world nation. T'Challa's ex-lover, Nakia (played on expected brilliant form by Lupita Nyong'o) fights the case for Wakanda's moral duty to share the truth of their wealth; this is one of many surprisingly complex questions which weave their way satisfyingly into the narrative. Taking this even further is the film's villain, Erik Killmonger, a Wakandan isolated from the kingdom, calling for a revolution by black people against their oppressors. Michael B. Jordan is a charismatic villain, wonderful shades of humanity embedded within his performance, providing a fitting and scarily relatable foe for the Black Panther. A spunky ensemble (though prone to spouting exposition) completes the mix, Letitia Wright's Shuri acting as the Q to T'Challa's Bond and Martin Freeman delightfully Watson-esque as an obliging CIA agent.
For the most part, Black Panther is a stunning movie to witness, embracing its Afro-futurism with a colourful and vibrant design. The film feels very much buried in its cultural roots, which gives some understanding to the film's significance. Ludwig Goransson provides a luscious and innovative score and rap numbers courtesy of Kendrick Lamar complement the action.
The action sequences in the movie are also riveting; ""I never freeze"" pronounces T'Challa coolly in an early scene... and neither does the film itself. Pace never lags in relentless and sharp action sequences, gripping the audiences to their seats and, at some points, providing a strong emotional pay-off. The final act is certainly where the film is at its most disappointing, descending into an increasingly loud and banal CGI-fest, which, whilst not uncommon in a Marvel flick, is certainly beneath the calibre of Black Panther. Visual effects are also dodgy at certain instances, oddly plasticky and unfinished-looking. For the most part, however, Black Panther delivers soundly for popcorn moviegoers, never allowing its themes and cultural statements to overtake the pure entertainment.
One only has to see Black Panther to understand the reasons behind its sensation and the whisper of Oscars floating around. Ryan Coogler has crafted a visually staggering blockbuster, which manages to tell an engrossing story, with plenty of popcorn thrills, yet also a remarkably deep cultural message that boasts great relevance. Black Panther is without a doubt one of the most exciting and inventive Marvel outings yet.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Putting aside all that nonsense Black Panther is simply a FANTASTIC piece of entertainment from start to finish.I've seen every single MCU film to date and this one stands with the very very best of them. For a while now the MCU films have been starting to get into a bit of a formulaic rut. At worst they're always at least entertaining but Black Panther is a true return to form with exactly the right mix of humor, action, drama, style and sheer wow factor. Do not let anyone convince you that the film is preachy or over the top with political soapboxing. That's simply not the case. The themes explored here are UNIVERSAL and could have been applied to virtually any culture, while at the same time the incredible costuming, soundtrack, and art direction tapped deeply into dozens of African cultures to create a visual and stylistic tapestry that was simply breathtaking.Even if that holds no appeal whatsoever, taken simply as a work of pure action entertainment the movie delivers by every measure. Action was fantastic, fight choreography the best since Netflix's Daredevil, and a stronger narrative arc than any MCU movie to date. The storytelling was simply superb with a clear beginning, middle, and end and rock solid character development. The writer did not fall into the recent pitfall of other MCU films of spinning out too many sub-plots or characters and instead masterfully focused on the core story at hand. As such this may well be the best stand alone MCU film since we were first introduced to Tony Stark in Iron Man, while still fitting perfectly into the larger MCU pantheon.Believe the hype.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

This movie doesn't deserve a 10 star rating, I agree, but it doesn't deserve all those 1's and 2's from the haters either. It remains to this day, one of the best standalone Marvel movies ever made.
You'll be sorely missed. Black Panther is amazing, it has outstanding performances, amazing soundtrack, great action sequences, great humor, beautiful costumes, marvelous villain, and amazing story!! A negative here is the CGI, at times it's good, but at times it's messy and looks bad. Overall, BP is one of Marvel's best films ever made. Rest in Power, Chadwick 👑. The King has now rested. Don't know how I will relay this news to my kids. Especially my daughter, she loved Black Panther so much. Great talented cast. On a comic book level, this movie was very worthy.

The CGI in this show is extremely, take for example the last fight scene where the CGI is soo evident that it looks like we are watching a low-budget action film. The music score was pretty decent and the acting was pretty average. Overall this is an overly praised movie as the people are just praising the movie not because of the story but about it being the first superhero movie with a black person. Don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with that sentiment but to act like this is the best movie representing the black community is pretty dumb as there were better movies like Moonlight and 12 years a slave which wasn't getting as much acknowledgment than Black Panther when it comes to a movie that represents the black community.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was a single joke that felt entirely out of place (you know exactly what I'm talking about, if you've seen it). Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I can't wait to see it again when it comes out on Blu-ray.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Is it the best Marvel movie of all time? Not at all, but it was a different kind of Marvel movie that was interesting in it's own way. Yeah it was a little bit too predictable at times and that is the only reason why it is getting an 8 star rating. When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out a bunch of people thought it would flop, and it ended up being one of the best Marvel films of all time, and that's what viewers should think the same because it was a quite delightful film. Good story, memorable characters and stunning visuals. Plus a lot of these reviews say that it's political and that is a huge negative, there is nothing political about it. Makes me kind of think some people used multiple or rogue accounts to leave bad reviews. Go see this film!","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

I tried to watch it multiple times, and every single time it let me down. It's a terrible film. It's like they purposefully know how to make the movie bad, and then continue with those same elements that people hate. It's like, don't they test run these movies before releasing them? They keep putting the same trash out there again and again.And yet, it's not a total complete disappointment. It has cool scenes with Michael B Jordan. He plays a normal. cool guy in the movie, and you get disappointed that he does not come out the winner in the end. Some of the action parts are really cool. And the effects towards the end are pretty eye-opening. I remember some elephants or rhinos, and they looked wicked cool.All in all, it's not a good movie.

In first half little drag on the movie but its fine in every way. Overall the movie is fantastic.Chadwick Boseman (The black panther) is terrific. He again stole the movie after the Captain America Civil War. Other actors include Micheal B Jordan, Lupita Nyong, Danai Gurira, Latitia Wright etc do their part very well and much appreciative. The Cinematography , Special effects are really amazing. The action sequences in Busan and the climax fight scenes with Erik Killmonger are perfectly made and the visuals are so good.Another plus point of the movie is soundtrack which makes the movie more and more perfect. Ludwig Goransson soundtrack much apprectiative and very apt for the movie. Other thing is culture and life of Africans. I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie.

There's just not much to criticize here. I think the people who will be most disappointed are the people going in expecting a standard action-packed superhero movie where a costumed hero battles a costumed villain for the better part of two hours with a little dialog and drama interspersed so as not to get tedious and a forced and unnecessary romance subplot no one actually cares about. This is kind of the opposite.It's an almost Shakespearean drama with fresh takes on everything that has made this genre feel tiresome. Beautiful world-building, artistic vision, mind-blowing sets, elaborate and gorgeous costuming, a dozen brilliant acting performances, a nuanced villain with a grounded real-world perspective and motivation, an extended cast that actually matters, a historical background that provides context without the endless flashbacks and hamfisted exposition, and a real sense of danger and importance surrounding the events.There are a few predictable tropes that play out exactly as expected, but it's mostly fun and highly inventive in other areas. Killmonger is one of the MCU's best villains, and the final battle was like watching a Tron remix of a Capcom fighting game.","3 out of 21 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman does a terrific job as our main hero and I could not see the studio recasting him ever. Chadwick is the Black Panther! The only minor complaint is the ending fight scene between our Villian and hero is a little to heavy on the CGI. Everything else is crafted very well by visionary Director Ryan Coogler.

We thought it would be big as most Marvel movies are, but it ended up being 10x bigger that we planned on.This movie is for sure one of the most culturally important movies to be released in the MCU. I will admit that aspect caused it to be a bit overrated in the long run, but it is still as great and solid entry into the MCU.Black Panther was introduced in Civil War as a side character. It was clear he was going to have his own origin movie and Wakanda was finally going to appear in the MCU. This movie starts not too long after Civil War as T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned King of his nation.For a movie called Black Panther, honestly the lead is probably one of the weaker aspects of it. It's really his allies and the villain that shine in this movie. His sister and the head of the King's guard are easily the best two characters in the movie. They're really fun and lighten the mood what could be a painfully boring movie. The villain when he comes into light is probably the 2nd best MCU baddie after Thanos. Even Andy Serkis as Ulysses Claue makes a return from ""Age of Ultron"" and is so much damn fun to watch. It's really all the characters surrounding T'Challa that make this movie so entertaining. Without them, this movie would have been much worse off.It has some really stellar action scenes, especially the casino/car chase in the middle. It's a shame that the final battle is so poorly done. I'm not sure if it was because Marvel wasn't sure if BP would do well, so they cut the budget on the CGI for the final battle, but it just wasn't up to snuff with other movies like Winter Soldier or Civil War. The CGI battle between Killmonger and T'Challa on the train tracks looked really bad.Besides the lackluster finale, Black Panther is still a really great movie and a welcome change of pace in the MCU. It has a villain with real conviction and a great cast of side characters. Culturally, this movie was probably even bigger than Infinity War and it makes sense. It was just missing something to make it as top notch as Winter Soldier, Civil War, or Infinity War. I do hope for a sequel to improve upon this. Maybe a quality bump similar to Captain America 1 to 2.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Ryan Coogler manages to develop the characters and their interpersonal relationships and is competent in the action scenes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5566952/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2020","The 'Black Panther' was created by writer and editor Stan Lee and writer and illustrator Jack Kirby, appearing for the first time in Fantastic Four # 52 (July 1966) in the Silver Age of comics, being the first super- hero of African descent created by a mainstream American comic book publisher. This Marvel adaptation brings up the ancient origins of the Black Panthers, a cloak that is passed down from father to son and that traditionally stands in the line of succession between aspirants to the throne of the evolved - but not in the eyes of the world - kingdom of Wakanda.After several speculations for decades about bringing the character to life in theaters, 'Black Panther' premieres satisfying everyone who has longed since the hero's first appearance in 'Civil War', which showed the hero in action after the attack that killed the his father, King T'Chaka, of the fictional kingdom of Wakanda, again bringing Chadwick Boseman as the character. For this adaptation, director Ryan Coogler, who also contributed to the script alongside Joe Robert Cole, manages to bring a mixture of mysticism, legends and African customs that portray this new world, isolated from the world and that keeps many secrets. If the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was daring to change the way a hero film relates to the public, adding the comedy to the genre, Ryan Coogler's feature has the audacity to review the parameters of this thematic foundation, inserting comedy in a few moments and prioritizing a more dense history, which deals with family disagreements, tribal conflicts and revenge.
'Black Panther' accompanies T'Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated and technologically advanced African nation to succeed the throne and to take his rightful place as king. But with the reappearance of an old and powerful enemy, T'Challa's value as king - and as Black Panther - is tested when he is led into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda, and the whole world, at risk. Faced with betrayal and danger, the young king must gather his allies and unleash all the power of the Black Panther to defeat his enemies and ensure the safety of his people and their way of life.The film received seven Oscar 2019 nominations, including Best Picture, with victories for Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack and Best Production Design with total merit. Technically, the film is a visual spectacle. The production designer of Hannah Beachler and Jay Hart manages to portray a Wakanda in a fully satisfactory way, knowing how to preserve the most primitive aspect, maintaining the tribal concept of ancient African peoples with the high technology that came from the vibranium, which has shaped all that society since the beginning .Throughout the projection, we are introduced to highly developed technologies capable of healing gunshot wounds in a short time, capable of developing costumes, vehicles with magnetic levitation, sonic stabilizers, surveillance equipment, ultramodern ships, buildings and futuristic architecture. Even the choice of Seoul, South Korea, as another scenario in history, maintains the same futuristic and technological identity as Wakanda. All this technology is very interesting in a more palpable and credible scenario than previously portrayed, especially in the cosmic characters in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Thor'. It is a mixture of tribal society with extremely advanced technology that enchants the eyes of the audience.
The costume by Ruth E. Carter portrays very rudimentary African tribal clothing very well, bringing the difference in culture between the different tribes that make up Wakanda. The colorful and creative costumes manage to convey this concept of something more primitive and that contrasts so well with the technology of that nation. And this whole nation-building was incredibly orchestrated by Swede Ludwig Göransson, who knows how to thrill when necessary, increase tension at key points and showcase the culture of the people of Wakanda using drums, percussion instruments and tribal chants wisely. The costume, as well as all the construction of the language, habits and traditions of the Wakandians. It looks like a little bit of everything we've seen from African tribes, but at the same time it sounds new, with a certain freshness.
It is impossible to talk about this feature without mentioning the co-protagonists of the film - to call them supporting actors would be to reduce their importance in the plot. The king's personal guard, the Dora Milaje, commanded by Okoye (Danai Gurira), stands out, as does the entire female cast. Shuri (Letitia Wright) - sister of T'Challa - shows how much a Jarvis is out there on another continent and how much a Tony Stark can learn from his technological genius. Pantera's younger sister is equally important in comics - and has even taken on the official role of Black Panther in magazines - and here she is a true teenage genius. Nakia (Lupita N'yongo) is the most efficient and dangerous spy in Wakanda. We also have the power of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), predecessor of the Black Panther's courage, as well as a veteran priestess.
Villains have important roles. Ulysses Klaue, the Sonic Claw (Andy Serkis) - who had first appeared in 'Age of Ultron' - gains importance as a madly believable villain. Even a little cartoonish, his attitudes are anarchic and organized at the same time and his pretext calls into question the goodness of the Wakanda throne. Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is a brilliant strategist and scientist who earned his PHD at MIT. He is also a skilled martial arts fighter, able to take on the best warriors in Wakanda, including the Black Panther in a fight that causes great twists and turns. Their motivations are completely credible. We also have with W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) - who, if at a moment passionately cheers for the king, rebels unexpectedly motivated by the failure to capture Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) by the Black Panther.
One of the points that were missing a little in the story, is a greater amount to the action scenes. We have great scenes filmed in Seoul, with a practically uncut sequence of fights in a clandestine casino and, of course, the chase scenes through the city streets. The scenes of fighting for the throne and the clashes of the last fifteen minutes are excellent and exciting. Visual effects play a fundamental role in creating Wakanda's look, however, in some scenes the not-so-effective use of effects is noticeable.'Black Panther' is a cultural manifesto, unafraid to talk about racial and sexist issues in the US, past and present, while making an exciting and universal superhero blockbuster with a director and a mostly black cast , with themes of the black people and with several women as key pieces of history. A film that shows a closed society, but that from its new king, sees the need to build bridges with other nations, and not barriers, and that there is more that unites people than separates them. A politicized film, which has a more serious tone and uses humor punctually. Ryan Coogler manages to develop the characters and their interpersonal relationships and is competent in the action scenes. He uses and explores well the relationship between the real and the fantastic is not only in the mention of these real problems, but in the visual construction of the feature. In the end, there are still two post-credit scenes. The first gives clues as to what a 'Black Panther' sequence might look like and the second connects with the events of 'Captain America: Civil War.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A Groundbreaking, Supremely Satisfying Superhero Blockbuster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4723323/?ref_=tt_urv","williampsamuel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56938771/?ref_=tt_urv","15 March 2019","There's been a lot of hype building up to the release of this movie, based on Black Panther's appearance in Captain America: Civil War and the anticipation of the first truly Black superhero movie. Well Black Panther doesn't just live up to the hype; it exceeds it. Black Panther is a wildly entertaining and often thoughtful blockbuster that brings one of Marvel's more obscure heroes mainstream.If you saw Civil War, you already know the basics. T'Challa is the Black Panther, prince of the wealthy, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda. Following the death of his father, the time is at hand for his ascension to the throne. But of course the transition won't be smooth, with challengers to the throne and enemies both old and new threatening the kingdom.One of the best things about this movie is its incredibly talented ensemble cast. Chadwick Boseman gives an extremely well-rounded performance in the title role. He's smart, brave, frequently intense, by turns easygoing and dead serious, and always imbued with a deep sense of duty and honor. And no matter what, he always has style. As Black Panther, Boseman sets a new standard of black coolness just as Jamie Foxx did in Django Unchained and Will Smith in Men in Black.Of course he's not the only star to shine. At times Letitia Wright almost steals the show as Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister and personal Q branch. She's delightfully irreverent and sassy, and does she ever have some great gadgets to share. Lupita Nyong'o also casts an imposing figure and is a delight to see in combat as general Nakia, head of the royal bodyguards. Martin Freeman makes a good comic relief everyman as the film's token (or should I say Tolkien) white guy. And Andy Serkis is typically unrecognizable and delightfully insane as the villainous Ulysses Klaue. Seriously, this guy's nuts.Michael B Jordan makes one of Marvel's best villains in recent years as Eric Killmonger. He's brilliant but uncultured, wisecracking but intensely angry, a kid from the streets with pretentions to rule an empire. And he is absolutely deadly. Jordan looks even more ripped here than he did in Creed, and he fights like Antonio Silva on steroids. And for all his ruthlessness and arrogance, he's not entirely unsympathetic. He's a man who's lost much and lived a hard life from an early age. He's driven by a desire to uplift the poor and oppressed, to help his people. It's just that for him that means igniting a global race war and seeking world domination.There are beautifully choreographed fight scenes and excellent special effects galore. The casino brawl and car chase are fast paced and adrenaline pumping, and the final battle atop the mountain is particularly magnificent, like Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars. And visually the film is a real treat to behold. The costumes and set pieces are a whirl of colorfs, the camera work excellent, and the natural scenery is breathtaking. It's hard to believe this wasn't filmed in Africa.While this is a Hollywood blockbuster made with a largely American cast, Black Panther has a profoundly African flavor, from the music to the fashions to the traditional storytelling scene at the beginning. Wakanda's visual design is also unique and distinctive. It's extremely futuristic but at the same time deeply African and tribal, with hover-trains and holograms alongside spears, thatch huts and lines of robed dancers. It makes for a fascinating vision of a society that's progressed farther than practically any on earth while staying deeply attuned to its roots.The movie is also attuned to the culture and controversies right now. Let there be no misunderstandings: while there are subtle references to the Black Panther party, T'Challa is absolutely not a black militant or nationalist. The bad guy is. That said, it touches on poverty, drugs, mass incarceration and the sense of resentment its created. But it does so lightly, never in a preachy or confrontational way. Instead it's how T'Challa and Killmonger deal with these problems and the contrasting solutions they provide that drive the story.Black Panther is well-acted, well directed, action packed and gorgeously shot, it's a real treat for Marvel fans and anyone who likes action. And fanboys rejoice, they even included Man Ape, albeit without the gorilla suit. Yet another triumph for Marvel Studios. I give it four out of four armored war rhinos.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It had a good plot, good story, and very likable and great characters. Is it overrated by the PC critics? I believe it is over-rated and that movies like Dark Knight are far superior. However, this movie had great CGI, interesting and historically archetype characters, and a great morality as well.
Wakanda was done very well and the fantasy city was beautiful. The characters and the ark of the story was very good (although relatively simple). It did remind me slightly of Lion King and that is a good thing. I love the contrast between the two major characters and their morality that is displayed. One has a negative upbringing and chooses the evil route, and one has a privileged upbringing and has more moral decency. I found myself rooting for the character with proper morality and how he displayed his belief in right and wrong even if he had to go against his own family.
The one thing I noticed regarding the reviews is just as some reviewers are complaining because the critics over hype of the movie, I can say that the amount of 1 star reviews are the reverse side of the perversion. On one side, the critics want to drool over the movie for political correctness, and others want to hate the movie without actually rationally considering the movie. I find it hard to believe that this movie would have garnered so many negative reviews if not for the publicity and political hype that has ended up surrounding this movie. In my opinion, this movie falls somewhere between 6-9 rating.In conclusion, this movie was overall good. Good simple yet morally powerful story, and great CGI and backdrop to boot. While not the best superhero movie ever, still a significant and powerful one.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I too found myself confused at some points, asking why, but any Marvel fan can fill in those holes for you. This movie left me pondering its memorable events and I love that. And in the context of the rest of the growing Marvel cinematic universe, it thoroughly connects Black Panther to the rest of the heroes. 
Some reviewers talk about their distaste for the cinematography and use of CGI. I say that this setting is supposed to appear surreal. Wakanda is supposed to be otherworldly. It is supposed to be much more advanced than whatever technology we can create now. I can say I didn't like a scene that went from very dark to bright, but otherwise, I felt fully immersed in this fantasy along with many of those I have asked as well. 
Some attempts at humor certainly lost me, but juxtaposed to commentary on nationalism and racism, I appreciated the script's attempts to relate to a contemporary audience. Finally, I absolutely loved the soundtrack. At the most basic level, it is one of the most memorable for me. The music is unique yet appropriate for the context of current popular music.

Hype is always Overhype as far I'm concerned.The acting was OK, the script as nonsensical I could desire and satisfied the kid in me; maybe I should've left the subtitles on but that happens all the time nowadays! The cgi cartoonery was perfect, almost believable in its enormous scope. At one point the baddie says Death is preferable to Bondage, but the historical statistics wouldn't support such a view - and besides, every living creature on the planet is born into bondage to life unto death. The only difference with humans the world over is that we can also be slaves to capitalism. I won't dwell on the admiring loyalty shown by the common people in here to noble blood royalty!Overall entertaining, even if it couldn't help being chockful of someone else's social, racial and political opinions.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, the political message is too glaring and forced, like a product placement. Also, coming from a country composed mainly of immigrants, the ""greatness only achieved via isolationism"" theme and the majority of media's praise of the movie as significant specifically because it is ""(representation) for blacks, and (directed, delivered) by blacks"" are turn offs. For that a 3 might still be too high.

"10","/10","Good Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4720750/?ref_=tt_urv","thakrei","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100380342/?ref_=tt_urv","13 March 2019","T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, faces the difficulties and hard decisions of ruling a thriving, but secret country. He must keep the treasures of Wakanda out of the wrong hands, while also fighting a possible challenger for his crown. He has the special abilities of the Black Panther, which gives him extra speed and strength. In addition to all of these challenges that he faces in his country, he is also tasked with deciding whether and how his country should help the other struggling Africans around the world.We are hardly started in ""Black Panther"", and we can already see that this movie stands aside from routine superhero movies. It stands aside from the movies that are churned out every year that focus on the intense action scenes that completely overshadow the entire plot, if there is one. Like DC's ""Man of Steel"", it is the real thing. Boseman insists on T'Challa's good heart, courage and determination, and on the challenges many people face around the world today.The movie starts off with a detailed flashback describing the history of Wakanda. It then comes back to the present and introduces us to the main characters: T'Challa, the future king of Wakanda, Shuri, T'Challa's sister, and Nakia, T'Challa's ex-girlfriend. T'Challa is getting ready to be crowned king, and we see another flashback which ties in to a previous movie, ""Captain America: Civil War"". As this is happening, we are introduced to the villain, a young American man, and his partner. We then see the story of how T'Challa saves Wakanda, and in doing so, saves the world.Unlike most other similar movies, ""Black Panther"", gives vivid descriptions of all the characters, providing backstories that explain their actions and make viewers feel sympathetic towards both the hero and the villain. We see how the villain, Erik Killmonger, grew up, and the specific events that made him who he is now. In many other movies, the villain is a huge machine who goes around killing people just to cause chaos, but in this movie, Killmonger is human and does what he thinks is right.The same can be said for T'Challa. We see how he struggles to decide between what is morally right and what will help his people. He leads with his heart and relies on the advice his father gave him before he died. He is not perfect and makes many mistakes, but because of his determination, he makes things work out. He shows that he is a leader that his people can believe in.Also, unlike most other movies, ""Black Panther"" connects the events and problems of this fictional world to the problems of the world we live in today. As The New York Times describes, ""In its emphasis on black imagination, creation, and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of the past that was denied and a future that feels very present."" It is clear that the main problem in the film is not an evil villain looking to destroy the world, but a struggle to fix a world where no one is equal. At the core, it is a movie debating the best way to fix the discrimination that so many people face today, infused with action packed scenes, humor, and drama. On one hand, we have a man who has seen the struggles of the world firsthand, and on the other, we have a king who is desperately trying to learn but cannot possibly understand what everyone is going through. As the movie progresses, opinions change, and even though the solution presented is unrealistic and impossible in our world, it is still understood that we need to find some kind of a solution.""Black Panther"" is a movie unlike any other in its genre, with superior storytelling and a realistic plot, that changes how we think of superhero movies. I would recommend this for anyone who likes Marvel or DC movies, such as ""Wonder Woman"" or ""Spider-man"", and is looking for a new movie to satisfy their action packed tastes. I would also recommend this to anyone who likes movies focusing on real world problems and is looking for something similar, but different. ""Black Panther"" is a movie that anyone can enjoy, from kids to adults, no matter what they like.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

studio production (gathering by the way the youngest pearls of black
cinema), and worldwide...
At least the fact that a big studio embraced such a project should
have made you tick...What's the message? What bs is hiding behind it?
Here it is, my 'brethens', in a nutshell:
Black social case kid with strong revolutionary message is a big
threat to money, white of course-even if here it has been given black
faces. It is an Orwellian tale, indeed...Who is Wakanda? Wakanda is peopled by Oreo Cookie duplicated ad
nauseum, it is OreocookieLand as a matter of fact-or what Malcolm
would have called the House....brothers, whereas social case kid is the
Field....brother. Thus, Wakanda elite have the money, the knowledge, the
power, and most important they share knowledge with white dude. By the
way, white dude talks black and he lets you handle everything because,
of course, he is 'mr. niceguy'. (By the way, have you ever seen a white
dude taking a bullet for a sister? I haven't...not in this world we live
in.)Doesn't it seems to you that Wakanda is the Western World with a black
face - like a masquerade, a new minstrel show, every black man's hope,
deep inside?So, of course, you have again symbols of dependence -Mr. Nice guy will
of course help oreocookie peeps. The second addiction, which I had
already noticed in Blade, is a drug-here it is some ancestral blueish
hallucinogenic 'thang' they drink, as if they could not summon enough
strength within, and of course, 3rd addiction: prayer, this time to
the ancestors. Of course, you have the ridiculous gear that Marvel
heroes always wear...the one piece suit, that make men's ass real
tight...They even threw in some martial arts to try to make it look
real...Come on, peeps!Yeah they sold it to you fine, this one! You've got gotten...You've been
played! So who cares if all the cast is black? Down the line, we've
gotten bamboozled one more time.Watch out people: what they want is to make the struggle wrong.Of course social kid, the 'black monster' (even defined as such by
King of Wakanda) is given as a product of your own doing-since his
uncle abandoned him, which erases all the real bad conditions of
systemic racism and you were so excited that almost everybody
(finally!) is black in that movie that you did not see the real
message of this real killer movie.Because it is here to kill our thirst for justice. It makes justice
seekers the monsters. What is really at stake here is the fear of big
money, at the emergence of an educated black intelligentsia issued
from the ghetto.And wait with all the promo...they have created a cornucopia of products
to sell you, because money has to be made again, on black folks'
dreams... An orgy of shopping for lack of hope!The only thing i can tell you is: go beyond appearances. Hollywood is
a cliché machine whose strongest function is to create ideologies,
sets of beliefs to live by. And the well being of black people is
still not on their very conservative agenda!Beware what they feed you lavishly...They would not insert money into
anything that could topple the power of their chosen elite.My thoughts go to the black panthers-the real heroes who fought for a
cause and died in shame and bad repute... This film repackages the
concept into something hollow, a farce that does not render to these
dedicated fighters for black freedom the recognition they deserve!After 2nd thought, I deem the fostered division between the diaspora
and the Motherland the most treacherous message of that flick.
Imagine. Africa would stop being a cash cow, if ever Blacks united
beyond borders: they killed panafricanism once for all!And if you ask me, I'll say - I'd rather watch again:
Undercover brother, Baadaass, Get out, Do the right thing...etc. These
were soul movies.My review of Black Panther does not question the brilliant performance
of its actors. I still think the cast was outstanding and the
cinematography impeccable!Hey...They might even give it an oscar;
i'll call it the Oscar of all Scams!Damn, they also got me too...And sorry to burst your little Marvel bubble!
It's wake up or Wakanda!Wakanda, or...Wake up right now!
Which one will you choose?

This movie offers the most diverse cast and an interesting story line that fictitiously imagines an Africa without colonization by focusing on a hidden country. We currently live during a time when Africa has been completely gutted by European nations making Africa unstable in some countries. Black Panther captures the beauty of Africa, from the costumes inspired by various tribes, warriors, etc. protecting their valuable resources. Think about gold, diamonds, oil, and uranium and the many other precious metals of Africa and what has become of the countries where these resources exist. I read a comment on IMDb that described the film as divisive. When we take into account major blockbuster hits like The Great Wall with Matt Damon, God's of Egypt, Johnny Depp in Lone Ranger, and Jake Gyllenhal in Prince of Persia (To name only a few), these are all movies that we should consider divisive, especially when the main roles that should star native Americans, Iranians, Egyptians, and Chinese actors but star American white men, Black Panther is a breath of fresh air. I believe this film was only an introduction to the characters. We will and should see more. This is amazing film!

"10","/10","A Cinematic Masterpiece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4494235/?ref_=tt_urv","sammycook","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96009424/?ref_=tt_urv","4 December 2018","This may sound dramatic to some, or maybe a lot of people, but this isn't me being melodramatic or exaggerating my view of the movie. To me, Black Panther IS a cinematic masterpiece.I could write a whole essay on why I adore this movie and why it is marvellous. Hell, maybe I will. But this is a review, not an essay, so here goes;
why Black Panther is a 10/10 star movie and a cinematic masterpiece.First of all, the characters.
The characters of Black Panther are strong, complex, and three-dimensional. This is true for both the women and men in the story, the heroes and the main villain.The three main women in Black Panther are strong characters as individuals, especially whose purposes and characterisation within the story aren't solely related to the men in it. They have their own motivations, beliefs, strengths, and weaknesses.
Shuri. Nakia. Okoye.
Shuri is incredibly intelligent, funny, and greatly skilled in science.
Nakia is kind, compassionate, diplomatic, and forward thinking.
Okoye is immensely loyal, determined, passionate, and dedicated.
Out of all the Marvel movies so far, Black Panther has the best representation for women in my opinion by far. I found myself internally screaming in awe at how awesome they are while in the cinema, especially at their badassery and boldness.The men are also well represented, particularly T'Challa and Killmonger. They, like the women, are three-dimensional, strong, and complex. They too, feel real, as all great characters do. What is especially significant about these two, however, is the construction of them as main hero and main villain. T'Challa has the title role of the superhero Black Panther, while Killmonger is the villain. Despite being a villain, it is easy to sympathise with Killmonger, because he is a three-dimensional villain. His reasons for his behaviour are shown to us through his backstory and not only does it make the audience put ourselves in the 'villain' 's shoes and understand why he did what he did, but it did a brilliant job of demonstrating that people are complex and morally grey, that the person/character set up as a villain is only the villain from one side of the story. Killmonger himself did what he thought was right and what he was motivated to do based on his experiences. The depth and pain and heartache this added to the story and movie as a whole, as well as the characters and their relationships is what makes it significantly better than some other Marvel movies in terms of villain characterisation.Then there is the representation of African people. As someone who is not African, I cannot speak on the representation of African people in the movie. I can only speak on what I observed and know, and that is, that this movie did amazingly well at the box office. Not just because it is a Marvel movie, but because it is a diverse, almost all POC cast Marvel movie. The fact that this movie did that well at the box office, as did other diverse movies such as Crazy Rich Asians and Coco, speaks volumes to the amount that diversity in cinema is not just wanted but needed. Online, on twitter especially, I saw people of colour, specifically African people, talk about how Black Panther impacted them, how seeing themselves represented in an entire cast of a Marvel movie felt. Black Panther means a lot to a lot of people and it's impact is another reason why it's absolutely brilliant.Now, the writing of Black Panther, Holy Hera. The writing of this movie, just WOW. It is witty, clever, character driven, exciting in every scene, emotional, and packed with social commentary. A kind of social commentary that is executed so well throughout the movie that it is intertwined with other aspects of the movie. It's sprinkled into the witty dialogue, Killmonger's backstory and characterisation, the relationships between the characters, gorgeous cinematography, wonderful acting, and exciting action. The social commentary isn't a smack in the face, it's a series of questions that are directed to the audience in subtle yet clear, and bold ways.I've seen a heap of reviews on here, and other places, where people review it as ""overrated"" or ""overhyped"" but that seems a bit fishy to me. People do, of course, have the right to their own opinion and to express that opinion, however, I recommend that people who hate on Black Panther or who simply view it as ""overrated"" rewatch it. Not everyone will agree with me that it is a cinematic masterpiece, but please don't discredit it completely because of predetermined ideas about it or biases.If all I've already said about Black Panther isn't testament enough to the brilliance of this movie, it's impact, and it's worthiness of 10 stars, then perhaps this will;
Out of every Marvel movie I've seen, this is the one Marvel movie that as soon as it had finished, I immediately wanted to rewatch it.","2 out of 15 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Better late than never right?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4063931/?ref_=tt_urv","drawlife","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14294603/?ref_=tt_urv","16 February 2018","Black Panther is like a checklist. A checklist that fulfills every aspect and almost goes above and beyond. The film is unapologetically African and it subtly deals with real political issues. I'd argue the film is almost on par with the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and the Captain America trilogy.Ryan Coogler has proven himself as a capable director in his own right, with Creed and Fruitvale Station, and now he's three for three with Black Panther. Coogler puts the characters and the narrative(albeit kinda predictable) first before the action and spectacle. I'd like to mention though some of the cinematography is gorgeous so kudos to Rachel Morrison. Costume designs are fabulous so another kudos to Ruth E. Carter. Last but not least to the visual development team, Ryan Meinerding, Andy Park, Carla Ortiz, and the others. I don't know if any of you ever picked up the concept art-books of the MCU films, but these guys and girls put a lot of effort into coming up with the creative look of each film. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole explore some thought-provoking ideas such as isolationism, revolution, and the cultures of oppression. They tackle real world problems without being too preachy or over the top, but enough to get the point across in an effective manner. If you have the strongest and not to mention the most versatile metal on Earth, I would doubt you'd want to share that kind of info to the world, but then again you can also do so much to help others in need. With that being said, this is where Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is effective. The performance is kind of over the top, but it registers and you can sorta feel his rage and anger. He's definitely not the wasted villain that the MCU is notorious for. As I've mentioned before, the Phase 3 villains, while not perfect, are a step up to every other villain the MCU has given us aside from Loki, Red Skull, and Winter Soldier. Jordan's portrayal while again, slightly over the top, makes you see his point of view like The Vulture or Zemo. The women also are a stand out. Angela Bassett's role doesn't have too much to do but her acting chops alone make you believe in her relationship with T'Challa. Letitia Wright provides a lot humor as the sharp witted Wakandan genius and sister to T'Challa, Shuri. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira are also highlights as Nakia and General Okoye. Nyong'o and Boesman don't overplay their complicated/romantic relationship and Gurira's character butts heads with T'Challa frequently, but is also fiercely loyal to her king. Other cast members are solid. I certainly didn't expect Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Martin Freeman to have the roles that they did, so kudos to Coogler and Robert Cole for figuring out all those moving parts. Especially Kaluuya's role as W'Kabi. Winston Duke and Andy Serkis just chew up the scenery with their roles as well. Particularly Serkis, as it was nice seeing Ulysses Klaue make his return. Now on to Chadwick Boseman. He is so good in this role I forget the accent he speaks with in this film is just him acting. When I watched interviews with him I totally forgot he has the American accent. He's equally believable as a superhero, but as a man grieving for his father and questioning his ability to be a fitting king. Yes the film is by the numbers, kinda predictable, and by the books, yes some of the special effects don't look as polished to be quite honest, the action set pieces are competent but not mind-blowing, and the shaky camera was a bit of an annoyance. With that being said, being a comic-book geek I am pleased with the final result and I cannot wait to see what Marvel Studios has in store for T'Challa next. Black Panther has been quite the talk lately as there have been many opinions about the significance of a black superhero. Let us not forget about Wesley Snipes's Blade, but up until Black Panther's release, much of Hollywood considered a film with an all black cast as niche for certain demographics, but never as a blockbuster or a franchise like this. Like Wonder Woman, Black Panther will open even more doors for movies similar to them, and everyone associated with this movie on another level. 8.8/10","2 out of 15 found this helpful.

I always watch movies after checking rating and reviews at IMDB hence, I felt I should convey my honest opinion and save others some time and money.
I have never read any of the critics review and have had always gone with user reviews. I really don't know why anyone would rate this movie more than 3-4 stars. Is this the world we live in that just because it is a black majority movie we feel obligated for something and rate this movie high to gratify some particular community. This is by far the worst ever movie I watched of a big budget production house.Acting: All actors were expressionless and I think they were concentrating more on African accent (which is by the way was more hilarious than real). CGI: I really didn't like the CGI any better or at-least something to be talked about.Story: I can understand that it was taken from comics however, plot could have been better.In general those comic and funny scenes were really bad and I didn't even smile. We were group of four friends and boy we all went with high expectations and finally two of us slept and rest two were waiting for the movie to finish.","20 out of 45 found this helpful.

Most people just rate without leaving an review of the movie. So disregard all the 1 stars. Most of these people are racist in their feelings about an all black cast. Not giving away any spoilers, but Panther is a thrill ride from start to finish. If you love the Marvel series of movies, you will enjoy Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman gave a convincing performance at Panther, the King of Wakanda people. Danai Gurira, from the walking dead fame, is excellent as always. There is something empowering watching Okoye kick butt with her arrows and swords, guns are for punks. Overall, I would recommend this film. Again, don't pay attention to the 1 star rating. At the least Panther deserved 5 stars. Any 1 star rating is sour grapes from the usual racist in America that caused the message board on IMDB to close down. Black Panther is a must see for all the Marvel fan lovers.","2 out of 15 found this helpful.

This is a strong cultural representation that which typically becomes ignored unless tragedy or near-savagery are openly displayed upon the screen. The film is a good opening saga towards a character whom was introduced to the cinematic in Captain America: Civil War. Quite sadly, I did not care for the character in that display of him. Though, in the solo film, I'm a strong-holding fan of his & the movie, in general.No, I can not say that the film is flawless. To textually or vocally utter such is nonsensical. Though, the film attempts to not only give a better display of the character, it fully wants to enlist interested visitors towards his nation(for those of whom are tech fans). It does not display fully women to the utmost regard(nor does it disrespects women of any means), but it channels the energy enough to fully do such in the next film(T'Challa's Sister, Shuri, is his primary tech/weapons developer/designer). It's villain, intriguingly, is properly played with the character housing the same quasi-discontent for his ""motherland"" as which is generally shown in a reverse accord in real life.The means that the spiritual magic plays a strong, yet small, underbelly towards the technological shock is, oddly, great. The film would've been too bogged down if that was fully shown, yet the next one holds the aspect of going even further with that concept seeded into the story. It showcases that there is more than the 'Marvel'ous advanced tech that the country holds dear; it connects towards it's rooting cultural basis, as well.Hopefully, this could become a stand-alone trilogy whilst the primary character houses a good role within Infinity War saga, or even after such. There is a firm basis laid & we can see that the panther has a growl, if we can see him complete pounce or maul(I'm metaphorically regarding, mind you) while retaining his intelligence, then we could see one of the best comic book to film series thus far. Right now, though, we have a really decent movie that most can enjoy, regardless of race & comic book fandom.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It won't go down as the best CGI manipulated movie or best action sequence, not even greatest acting in the Marvel jaggernaut. However what this movie has done that the others have failed is to lend a cultural vibrance and a sense of belonging, especially to Africans in our homeland (I'm from Kenya), and to see the greatness of our continent if it's resources were harnessed and used well. Yes it has political undertones, anti-colonial sentiment which of course triggers the race debate (which is where I suspect many reviewers got salty), but that's the point of BP. Of you read about his character as well from the comic books, he isn't a ""fit"" in the Avengers and has always been suspicious of the rest, as his first priority is protecting Wakanda.

He is made so perfectly that it makes you to care for him and want him to win.On the

that deserves the title ,,King of Wakanda,,, but in some way he is overshadowed by the villian.
The other side characters are very good, except

"8","/10","Black Panther - Movie review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4077495/?ref_=tt_urv","maxigarciasoto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur78576654/?ref_=tt_urv","1 March 2018","""Black Panther"" is a movie that i was really anticipating. I had waited for this film since i saw for the first time ""Captain America: Civil War"" two years ago. When that movie came out everyone was talking about the great things in ""Civil War"", and one of those great things about that film was Chadwick Boseman's performance as Black Panther. I was incredible in that role and he kept me invested in his character. But i had this question inside my head: Will he hold up for an entire film by himself? - And two years later i have an answer for that question, and the answer is yes.This movie is about T'Challa AKA Black Panther and he is about to become the king of his nation, Wakanda. And while this is happening a group of villains involving Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis are doing evil stuff and T'Challa has to stop them. This is the only thing that i going to say about the plot of this movie, because this movie is worth seeing.This film was everything i wanted to see in a ""Black Panther"" movie and more. I like the fact that this movie is not just another super-hero movie, is actually a movie about a person becoming the king of a nation and the difficult task that he has to do. The film took the enough time to set up very well Wakanda, Wakanda's culture, and the importance of becoming a king. And that feeling that this film has, it makes you care more about the characters. You care about them when they are in danger, and there are a lot of moments were you wonder if they could actually succeed in what they are doing. This movie puts in your mind the question: Will this character survive? - Is really T'Challa the best king for Wakanda right now?Talking about T'Challa, Chadwick Boseman once again killed it as Black Panther. He was a very cool hero, but he wasn't just a cool hero, he was actually a person that you can relate to. The writing for him was so good and that combined with Boseman's performance, makes Black Panther a really great hero. The cast of this film is excellent, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, everyone is fantastic. I didn't mentioned this actor because i wanted to talk about him separately from the other ones, Michael B. Jordan. He was so good in this movie, he is a great villain and his motivation is so clear, that he might be the best Marvel villain since Loki, i'm serious.This movie is being directed by Ryan Coogler, who in the past has made incredible films like ""Creed"", proves himself here that he is one the best young directors working today. There are a lot of shots and long takes at Wakanda, and is magnificent to see.That leads to my negatives with the film, Ryan Coogler directed this movie incredibly, but i think that he has to learn how to film action sequences better. The action sequences in this film are fine, there are really great action sequences in this movie, but there are action sequences like the first one at the beginning of the movie, that are kind of bad. That first action sequence is edited very quickly and is very dark and you can barely see it, which kind of annoy me. Another issue that i have with the film is this. The visual effects in this film, for the majority of it, are very good, but there are some scenes were you can really notice the use of green or blue screen behind the actors. And that took me out of the movie in a couple scenes.""Black Panther"" was a very entertaining film, Marvel has made another great super hero movie. It has great action, great characters, excellent villains, it show us a new side of the MCU. The origins of Wakanda and the Black Panther mantle is explained very well so everyone can understand it. If you are a great Black Panther fan, or just a big fan of comic book movies, this movie is absolutely recommendable for you. It has a couple issues with the way the action is filmed and some CGI background that looked fake, but for the most part this movie was very entertaining and i want to see it again. ""Black Panther"" deserves an 8/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

What is clearly evident is that Ryan Coogler has delivered three outstanding films in three attempts in different genres. He has done all three with Michael B. Jordan, whose outing here as the corrupted revolutionary Erik Killmonger is another in a long line of excellent performances. Chadwick Boseman made T'Challa the break-out character of ""Civil War"" and proves after headlining three biographical dramas that he is also an action star.

"9","/10","""Black Panther"": Marvel Studios' first fiction which portrays a part of our world with seriousness and sensitivity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4143835/?ref_=tt_urv","FelipeCarrillo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61617922/?ref_=tt_urv","26 April 2018","We may well could be in front of ""The Movie"" of the MCU, by virtue of its coldness by man-made entertainment or fantastic narratives as a plot base, placing a homogeneous criticism on race, social chaos, feminism, power, politics, technology, honor and human demons, an unusual maneuver hitherto by the company that works perfectly in the ideal story, as T'Challa, king of Wakanda, becomes a milestone in the history of comic film adaptations, because of it's the first one that manages to blur that unresectable concentration by comedy and action in order to enter a field of more realistic, moralistic and compelling treatment, of course, without relegating an exciting, kinetic and fearless process to reach that stage.First of all, it must be said that ""Black Panther"" isn't a masterpiece. What's more, I took a while sympathizing with it running the first fifteen minutes, nonetheless, after having understood what was not working to allow me to automatically connect with the film, I came to the conclusion that such incompatibility was illogically derived from its original out-of-the-ordinary nature, that requested feature by all cinephile; Here the social and artistic message matters through creativity, because when it materializes in front of me, I found it impossible not to appreciate tremendous work, a fully unknown universe of stories or its introductory function to ""Infinity War"" aren't what make it compelling at all, what's make it unique is the value it holds for itself, since it relays an infinity of reflections and perceptions on reality, managing to touch everyone's hearts, especially to those poorly represented in and by cinema. It was such the transcendence that I decided to skip its post-credits scenes, I didn't want anything to do away with stupefaction that the nation of Wakanda left in my mind. This is a film that must be experienced on the larger screen under obligation. Also, unlike Marvel's previous flicks, this must be processed and analyzed primarily by the brains of adults and young people, obviously, without dismissing the full-fun ride constructed for the most little enthusiasts.Thereafter, ""BP"" is a cinematic blast. Opening with a sterling introduction to the place of the events, Wakanda twists the aim of a world power to turn it into a highly secret nation, rich in technology, advances in transport, health, economics and politics at the expense of the strongest metal in the MCU: Vibranium. However, they prefer to keep a low profile, creating a kind of selfishness by remaining hidden from outside eyes and ears, since, without hesitation, they'd be a sure target for the most vulnerable and near-to-extinct nations. And here the first topic for discussion comes up, one that will keep talking to the curious for quite some time. There is the fact that they can choose to remain anonymous to preserve intact their wealth and their nation standing or reveal their kingdom before a world burning in flames of hatred, finding it difficult to relinquish part of its stability in favor of the recovery and hope of the homeless, coming into play two ways which are really close to the current world stage.Another of its many strengths, which is present in the solid screenplay, is the important participation of women in the storyline. Just like ""Wonder Woman"" did, this film proudly represents what it means to be a woman of color, an impressive achievement - even if it's sad to mention: what differentiates white and black women? -for those ""minorities"", since each one of them receives a virtuous development, each one treasures a coherent and exciting dramatic background, daring individuals with hopeful characteristics; courageously intelligent believers, figures who honor two of the least respected groups by a society that grows in machismo and vanity: women and black people. In addition to writing rich and electrifying stories and foundations for them, the fighting scenes, which lies on the shoulders of the Dora Milaje, are superb, very close to Patty Jenkins' spectacular combats executed by the Amazons, the relation is valid thanks to the impact of these gigantic set-pieces that ends up being inspiring, getting to raise another important analogy. A Trojan army with three horrific beasts as helpers fighting against an army of female warriors - it should not be a source for joy, but it's such a representation of the female gender that this really means a significant breakthrough - struggling for their family, their lands, their king. This kind of scene symbolizes commitment by equality, not only for actresses who aspire to have important roles in the Mecca of cinema, but for every lady around the globe who is hurt by the dominance of her husband, father or boss; an inspiring incorporation that allows to dream of a more balanced planet, a readjustment to the balance of fairness and respect. From the beginning, they lose the horizon trying to build the mystery around the mansion, without noticing that, in half of the story, we no longer care what happens to any of them.Visually, Coogler's feature film is a glorious feast. Omitting only eventual perceptions of green screen in the background of fight scenes in the cascade and some flaws on special effects in the glamorous car chase, it can claim to have the same bravery and power in the pictures as the most recent release of the company, as it represents a radical color and style opposite with respect to Taika Waititi's colorful ode, here sobriety leads to sublimity in many of the scenes that enroll with honor in the best of the MCU; it's impossible to believe how the studio is surpassed by each new entry and this is no exception. Wakanda is as beautiful as complex thanks to the hard work of Rachel Morrison, the art & production department and anyone involved in the creative and artistic process, is magnificent and evidenced in the final product, an organic story about forgiveness and honor that experiment brand-new features for sure. Just like Ragnarok for Thor, Wakanda is another great discovery, not only for its magnetic culture, but for the artistic potential of this land that connects technology and nature organically.There are many people agree that Ludwig Göransson's score will be a strong contender for several gold awards. In addition to a lot of praises, the accompanying melodies and specific compositions that nourish fight sequences, moments of tension or a trivial talk are spectacular, his score has a great influence by African culture, drums and instruments are compactly intermingled with the vitality and extravagance of heroic melodies, a necessary choice as thanks to this important effect, the film manages to be what it is, a representative marvel. It should be noted that the soundtrack created in the name of the film by Kendrick Lamar goes very much in the style of his songs and is concordant; especially ""Pray For Me"" included in one of the most stylistic scenes, where The Weeknd's stunning vocals shine on their own.And finally: Ryan Coogler. It's not odd that the film opens in Oakland, California, because the filmmaker is from there, he knows the ailments of his people, knows the suffering and the causes of it because, like B. Jordan, we catch reflected in his work a sincere representation of hope and union for the entire black race, a love letter to his town in which their lives, values and dreams are highlighted. With only two feature films, Coogler directs his big Hollywood directional debut and he gets what Jordan Peele got with his opera prima as a director: to talk about a multitude of issues of global significance conveying his clear and realistic position. The film works in many fields, it's perceptible the effort in the idea and it's perceptible that the director knew how to portray what on the paper seemed so difficult, here, he's not limited to using a fantastic language because he also mixes culture and diversity in a film that will serve as a catapult to fame and opportunities. The American director and screenwriter presents one of the most interesting visions put on the genre, because it's one with foundation and purpose: to reach the heart of minorities, giving a message of peace, union and equality, symbolized by a hopeful ending very similar to ""The Last Jedi's"" final scene, a little boy starts dreaming.""Black Panther"" by Ryan Coogler transforms what a superhero movie must be, delivering children of color an idealized model with which they can dream now. In the long run, the film from the ""Fruitvale Station"" director and screenwriter works in many fields at the same time, it serves as a social commentary on the selfishness of the white people, politics, vices and discrimination while coherently produces a novel and unusual journey among Wakanda's technological and fascinating landscapes. Somehow, it's the ""Get Out"" of Marvel Studios, and reverses the comic-adaptation formula, placing its hero in harsh situations that can be compared to the real-life difficulties of a normal person. By far, one of the most different and original superhero flicks to date, ""Black Panther"" will serve as an illusion to many boys and girls, men and women who see in Marvel's dramatized works a possibility of change, an encouragement to start over again, even though when they get out of the theater and know that one more friend is gone for a society feeding on violence, inequality and apathy.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's been 10 years since the Marvel journey began with ""Iron Man"" and the narratives, spectacles and formula are in perpetual danger of wearing thin. Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler (""Creed,"" ""Fruitvale Station""), ""Black Panther"" writes its own narrative into the tapestry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a thread that is both distinctive and familiar.""Black Panther"" has a lot in common with ""Thor"" with its hidden fantasy world and elements of near-Shakespearean palace intrigue, but most of the action takes place in the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda instead of out of it, making the film Marvel's biggest exercise in world-building to date. Coogler must foremost create a people, culture and society that we believe in and care about in as little time as possible. With production designer Hannah Beachler (""Moonlight,"" ""Creed"") and costume designer Ruth Carter (""Selma""), they create a colorful, vibrant and exciting Wakanda. No fictional place has seemed more appealing to spend time in since the ""Avatar"" world of Pandora.Yet that's purely the sci-fi/fantasy appeal of ""Black Panther,"" which really makes its mark with themes and narratives of extreme relevance, especially presented through this black lens. The film opens with a prologue in Coogler's native Oakland, tying the modern day black experience to the Afro-Futurist fantasy experience of Wakanda, a nation of smart, strong black people sitting on top of a ""gold mine"" of vibranium, the greatest source of power known to man. The film mostly focuses on how T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), newly minted king of Wakanda and also its guardian and protector, the Black Panther, wrestles with having leadership thrust upon him. At the same time, the secrecy and isolationist policy long held by his country faces new pressure and danger from the outside world from arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). The story surrounds T'Challa with a team of strong minds and bodies (and terrific talents) including ex-girlfriend Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), tech-savvy sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and Wakandan General Okoye (Danai Gurira). There's also CIA Agent Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), who is a fifth as interesting as any of those characters and actually does amount to the token white guy. Outside of the superhero team-up films, it's Marvel's best ensemble.Yet perhaps all of them - even T'Challa - are overshadowed by Jordan's Killmonger, whose fascinating backstory and motivation make him Marvel's greatest villain success, or at least in that first tier with Tom Hiddleston's Loki and Michael Keaton's Vulture from 2017's ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" A villain with conviction and not just some unstoppable force trying to destroy the world, Killmonger makes ""Black Panther"" much more dramatic and interesting start to finish. He and T'Challa clash in personality and ideology in a satisfying way, one that's somewhat akin to Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. The film offers a buffet of action styles, from a ""James Bond""-inspired sequence in a Korean casino to a medieval fantasy battlefield brawl to the one-on-one fight scenes that echo some of Coogler's work in ""Creed."" It's a little all over the place and some sequences therefore work better than others. What's more important is most of the time, the stakes feel relevant even when the action gets messy.Carefully considered characters and themes, however, should account for most of ""Black Panther's"" success. That's how Coogler elevated ""Creed"" from among all the ""Rocky"" sequels and similar cliche-ridden boxing films. Creed's struggle was deeply personal and human. Nearly every character gets that same treatment here. Thematically, Coogler and Joe Robert Cole do not shy away from relevant black issues, even though the film explores them through fantasy rather than harsh reality. The Afro-Futurist fantasy of a powerful and influential black nation brings with it questions of responsibility that the movie devotes itself to contemplating and addressing. T'Challa must not only decide what kind of leader he wants to become, but reckon with the realities of a changing world. ""Black Panther"" triumphs not exclusively as an inspiration to black people wrestling with these same questions, but all of us can consider the fantasy of power and position and how we would use it. These notions distinguish the film from the rest of the Marvel Studios canon, not necessarily the more tangible storytelling and filmmaking elements. The film has weaknesses, many that it shares with other Marvel superhero movies, but those films cannot match its intellectual acuity and social consciousness.~Steven CThanks for reading!

With a vast collection of superheroes in the growing Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was only a matter of time before this movie was made and it was done in the best possible way.I'm a big fan of African culture and loved the attention to detail Ryan Coogler and the creative team put into the movie. They researched clothing, art, architecture, and customs of different African communities and combined them to create one seamless city.I'm a big fan of Captain America, Spiderman, and other of the bigger names, but feel that superheroes of different races, ethnicities, and sexual orientations have been underrepresented. Black Panther is a step in the right direction. I love this movie because I like to absorb different cultures that I'm unfamiliar with because they're exciting. As a white person, I don't get a lot of that from movies because different cultures are underrepresented. Overrall, this movie was great and I would like to see more like it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Its nothing like a Marvel movie we know. NOT funny, NOT interesting, WEAK plot, TERRIBLE acting, BORING everything. Skip this one or Marvel will think we want more of this crap.Note from me : Normally I do not write reviews unless I feel cheated. I am quite a fan of Marvel movies and always go to see but on that one I was thinking about leaving in the middle and asking for my money back.

With the ""Black Panther Challenge"", money is being raised so that black youths--who could not afford to see it themselves--can go watch the film. The amount of love surrounding this movie almost matches the film's own innate messages, and it shows just how powerful the medium of film can be. This is exactly why movies are made. So while we take the time to discuss and analyze the film, it's important to have this preface of the significance of this movie, as that is far more important in the long run than all the tiny details and Easter Eggs Marvel fans will pick apart and debate. With that said, Black Panther is a really great movie.

(10/10)
This is by far the best Marvel movie ever. Impressively well-acted film. The difference with ""Black Panther"" is that, while observing the outlines of the traditional comic book arc, Coogler and his creative team have enlarged and revitalized it.
Drawing on elements from African history and tribal culture, as well as contemporary and forward-looking flourishes, ""Black Panther"" pulses with color, vibrancy and layered textural beauty, from the beadwork and textiles of spectacular costumes and warm, dazzlingly eye-catching production design to hairstyles, tattoos and scarifications that feel both ancient and novel.
The MCU not only needed this movie, but all of the United States needed this movie. For a superhero movie, ""Black Panther"" exceeds exceptions and is sure to leave its impact of being one of the best in its genre. Socially aware, aesthetically captivating and emotionally pulling, this movie is one that is sure to leave its mark as one of the best superhero movies of recent memory.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it on the big screen - enough to see it twice, which is rare, so it seems appropriate to mention why.First, what is not new or surprising:
It you went to see this, looking for the next Avengers blockbuster special effects, then you are early - that is coming out later this year. And so you would be somewhat disappointed: no aliens, no space ships, very human antagonist, yet all the normal comic book plot holes are there to see...On the other hand, approached with an open mind, this was an interesting insight in to a very different world. You learn about the back story and character of the Black Panther, his weaknesses, his strengths and his commitment to his people. You see a messy aspect of his family history resolved. And then, too, you are exposed to a completely new culture - even though the Marvel view of African culture is as sanitised as civilian life in the big US cities, it is very much in that mold, with richness and depth and traditions on display or alluded to throughout.Yes, there are plot gaps, some personalities are under developed, odd storylines start and stop a little randomly; the lighter tone and mix of humour is not for everyone either. So, that cost it a star in my eyes.The film is visually stunning, approachable by families, brings considerable talent to the screen and is a thoroughly enjoyable step up from a pure action flick.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong: while it is rife with serious moments and dramatic tension (it would be hard not to, after Civil War!), and grapples with themes of loss and legacy, Black Panther does manage to smoothly deliver some well-timed comedy to lighten up the journey. Our theater adored Shuri, T'challa's irrepressible little sister, and I'm sure you will too.Many will zoom in, so to speak, on the visual richness of the film: African designs and aesthetic isn't something we see very much of in mainstream American media, to say nothing of our blockbusters, and the futuristic skyline of Wakanda has obviously been carefully crafted to make the city both unique and true to its roots. And the scenery is excellent, as is the costuming. However, the movie's strongest point, I feel is in its acting. Every one of the main cast delivered a memorable performance: Chad Bosewick is finally allowed to fully portray T'challa's grief and conflict to spectacular effect; Lupita Nyongo'o matches him scene for scene and is impossible to take your eyes off of; Michael B. Jordan manages to be at once terrifying, sympathetic and too compelling to make a truly tidy villain; Danai Gurira's screen presence and the sheer force of nature that is the character Okoye herself comes through from the very first time she steps onscreen, and sometimes without a single word spoken; and Letitia Wright dances effortlessly from the hilarious to the heartrending, stealing every scene she's in. I would need a lot more words and a lot more time to detail every performance that needed praising.So, while Black Panther is at its core a Marvel superhero movie, with the requisite cheese, heaping helping of action (Note: I'm not complaining, because that shit was fun as HELL), and some heavy-handedness in its political messaging (let's remember, though, Iron Man and Afghanistan and terrorism, terrorism, terrorism)... It's the chemistry and passion that both the actors/actresses and the film crew have put into this movie that form the heart of the story. It has the distinction of being the first Marvel movie that managed to make me well up, all while sitting at the edge of my seat and then being surprised into laughing by a deftly executed bit of slapstick or snark. It doesn't shy away from examining issues of racism, broken families, tradition vs. responsibility, pacifism vs. imperialism, and other uncomfortable topics that the world, but especially the U.S., could stand to reflect upon this year. It works through these issues to show us the characters moving towards a more hopeful future than any previous generation could have imagined, and isn't that what sci-fi is all about?Our theater loved this film. We laughed together, we cried together, we applauded together at the end. Thank you for a wonderful experience, Black Panther. I absolutely plan on seeing it again, and making sure the rest of my family does, too.","2 out of 16 found this helpful.

The first comic-book superhero movie ever nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it stands out from the field of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a few important respects, but before getting into that, seeing this now gives new meaning to the part of the picture involving the ""ancestral plane,"" where sons become kings through the revisiting of their dead fathers. Although not always the case, as the loss of most silent films to inappreciation and inflammable nitrate have attested, film has long been considered as a sort of afterlife. Like family photographs, they're memories captured indefinitely. Chaplin, Garbo, Bogart, Monroe, Brando--many cinematic icons have long since passed, but they continue to flicker on this ancestral plane of motion-picture screens. This long pantheon now includes Boseman. His legacy will endure. We see this in his hero's journey as T'Challa, a.k.a Black Panther, too, of life, death and rebirth. In a sense, Wakanda really is forever.Boseman is magnetic, as well. It's the role, the one he originated in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and reprised in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), for which he'll be most remembered. There is some fine acting and characterizations all around in ""Black Panther"" even compared to other star-studded superhero ensembles nowadays. Largely, this is due to the picture going beyond the generic jocular or, contrastingly, darkly pompous tone of so many others in the genre. For every ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), say, or, in the other regard, ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), where it works, there are a bunch more imitations where it doesn't. Long-established stars, such as Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker, are leveraged in the usual way (a trend dating back at least to the casting of Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, among others, to lend the appearance of legitimacy to ""Superman"" (1978) and a strategy continued throughout the MCU and DCEU). Minor parts are well occupied, too, by the likes of Winston Duke, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis and Letitia Wright. As others have noted, however, it's Michael B. Jordan's antagonist who's the standout here. Given the unprecedented awards attention the superhero movie received, it's a surprising snub that Jordan wasn't recognized with a Best Supporting Actor nomination.There's some entertaining genre shifting throughout; between the usual MCU joking (the quips of Wright's little sister/scientific genius are a highlight) and superheroic car chasing and CGI-enhanced fight sequences, we also get a James Bond-type spy thriller, which leads to some of the most dazzling long-take tracking compositions inside the casino brawl, and a sociopolitical polemic played out on a Shakespearean scale of monarchical intrigue. For a scenario that's a fantasy in various respects--besides the myth of the singular scientific genius (à la a Tony Stark or Bruce Banner) and an economically and technologically advanced nation isolated from trade and mixing cityscapes and automated mining with agrarian attachment to the land and warrior-code ancient rituals--Wakanda is primarily a wish-fulfillment of African hegemony, of black power. It's a fortunate accident of history that the comic book, the first mainstream one, I'm told, of a superhero of African descent, was named ""Black Panther,"" like but unrelated to the political organization of the Black Panther Party that was established around the same time. Because, for all its fantasy, unlike the rest of the MCU and much of comic-book fare, ""Black Panther"" is inextricably tied to the real world and the history of race, of colonialism and slavery and even the origins of humanity from Africa. And it is this that is the basis of the struggle between Boseman's T'Challa and Jordan's Killmonger.Otherwise, the MCU mostly abandoned realism after its decade-plus abstraction with extraterrestrials of a 9/11 allegorical attack on New York in ""The Avengers"" (2012) and, before that, some skirting with the War on Terror in ""Iron Man"" (2008)--none of which amounted to a semblance of profundity on such matters anyways. But, here, there really are competing ideologies rooted in reality, between isolated protectionism and of opening up to an exchange of resources and of armed revolution. One need not be overly diligent in keeping up with current events to see that these issues are ever present and that the same divisions remain between working within the system and from without and violently against. And so, with Killmonger, there is the lived African-American experience, as weaponized by the government-overthrowing CIA, coming into conflict with the ancestral past of T'Challa retreating into a paradise away from a world of colonization and slave trading and continued racial discrimination.Plus, the spectator still gets the spectacle of the usual CGI, as well as some of the best and more original costume design, musical scoring and overall production design of the entire Marvel franchise. And the result is an entry of unique cultural significance, of a mainstream blockbuster representing and celebrating black heritage and visible outside the frame even in the common adoption of the Wakanda salute and the slogan of ""Wakanda Forever."" All of this, and Boseman, are part of our shared cinematic universe now, our culture and the ancestral plane.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I would make a big mistake. My note is a proof.
I watched it in 2D and that was my second mistake, other then listening to a reviews. Beautiful CGI, amazing fight scenes, lighting... just every visual aspect is a proper 3D material. Totally recommended. 
I saw a lot of comments of how movie was over-hyped and now I wonder, do we now review trailers or movies. If a trailer (which I intentionally didn't watch) is a bit wealthy with scenes, why would everyone go super strict with a movie. Watch it like you never even saw a trailer, I say.
Now the technicalities. Almost everything you would except from a Marvel movie was there. Interesting story, hero that is kinda mythical kinda technological (like fusion of Iron man and Captain America), amazing side characters, beautiful background story which is also beautifully told, landscapes, soundtrack, a touch of humor but not too much like in Ragnarok... ALMOST everything. 
One thing we really lacked was a true villain! A bit of evil, more arrogance, brutality, blood. We lacked a bit of conflict as well. Not a movie conflict because we had a whole lot of fighting but that theatrical conflict between protagonist and antagonist. 
One more, minor-ish complain is that some scenes, some tribe-related scenes, could be done with more usage of a native language. With just a few more even minor mistakes that are not even worth mentioning, I have to say I really enjoyed discovering Wakanda and watching Black Panther. And as I said, see it for yourself!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I think the movie mostly lives up to that praise, but I view its specialness as being not so much in being ""different,"" as in ""finally getting it right.""The movie works on two levels. The first is as a dramatic piece in the thriller genre. Secondly, and more important, it works as an artistic and social watershed. It is a ""black movie"" in the way that movies should have long since portrayed black people and their experience in western civilization. It seems that the best rebuke to the ""white man's burden"" concept comes from a superhero movie.First, this is a good, action-packed, thriller movie. It has all the requirements of the thriller genre-a strong protagonist fighting long odds and supported by heroic friends against an equally strong antagonist. The dramatic tension is primarily from the contest between protag and antag, with large doses of physical battles in carrying out the plot. It even has a bit of a ""macguffin"" thrown in (the vibranium). There's all the spills and chills with fast-paced action of a Marvel superhero movie, but it's done well in that the action is not ""over the top"" (e.g., Thor Ragnarok). Also, the script doesn't indulge in the irritating fad of tongue-in-cheek ""humor"" (also e.g., Thor Ragnarok). I mean the characters operate within the constraints of the fiction's universe and they take it seriously. There is humor, but it doesn't pull the viewer out of the dramatic experience.The characters and situations are taken from the Marvel comics, but the storyline is pretty much basic thriller. I'm OK with such genre fiction when it's done well, and it is with this movie. The action is thrilling with very good SFX and CGI. The plotline keeps the tension up with enough complications to keep it from being predictable (up to a point). I liked that the Black Panther costume wasn't so ""mechanized"" as many of the superhero costumes are. It is closer to the ""non-tech"" costuming of the comics rather than the militaristic ""armor"" so many of the superhero costumes have become in their movie representations. That aspect emphasizes the hero's superness rather than the costume.Now, I think that good characterizations take a thriller story to a higher level. That's especially true in a superhero movie, where you run the risk of making a kid's movie and putting off the adults. Ryan Coogler (writer and director) is successful in that regard, and more. T'Challa is sufficiently strong, though with weaknesses, and moral enough to fight for justice against villains who are either morally depraved (Klaue) or misguided-dysfunctional (Killmonger). So its easy to pull for T'Challa. Casting was well done. Chadwick Boseman brings out the right blend of strength, intelligence, and moral fiber in T'Challa/Black Panther. Michael B. Jordan plays, Killmonger, T'Challa's chief rival with a range from street punk to bad a-s , to tragic figure. He seems to be a capable actor so I expect we'll see more of him. A couple of venerable actors lent some class and gravitas to the story. One is Forest Whitaker as Zuri, and the other is Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. Martin Freeman is CIA agent, Everett Ross, who is a sympathetic helper character. Freeman is a Brit playing his character with an American accent. He does it well and that seems to be the current fad. I had my biggest problem with Freeman's character. For having such an anti-colonial theme, here is a CIA agent as the protagonist's friend and significant helper. Well, I guess this is based on a comic book.While on the subject of the cast, I have to mention Andy Serkis, who has finally played a role that is not CGI or in heavy makeup. He plays the baddie, Klaue, and apparently bulked up for the part. Bless his heart. He'll always be Gollum to me.On the higher level, this movie breaks significant ground for African-Americans. The characters are mostly African-American and the story is told from the ""black African"" viewpoint. Without condescension or insulting stereotyping, the movie presents a story of black people as people-real people, as good and bad and nuanced as all human beings are. This has not really been done well before. Not even in such classics as the 1970s' Roots series. It is in keeping with Stan Lee's vision and it just excels over the what Hollywood has done in the past. Even so, it breaks that barrier, though just barely.For example, there is a strong anti-colonial theme in the movie. To protect itself and the vibranium element that empowers it, the nation of Wakanda hides itself behind a cloak of ""normal"" third world poverty. When we see the real Wakanda, we see the level of development that African nations should have attained, if not for the imperialism of the west (ongoing today). This seen in the white characters expressing disdain for African ""savages,"" and in the deriding term of ""colonist"" being applied to the white CIA agent (appropriately!). This theme is subtle, however, and I don't know how many younger viewers will catch it. Not many, I suspect.This movie is Heart of Darkness turned around. Probably, kudos for that should go to both Stan Lee and Ryan Coogler. They've made, not just a superhero story with an African protagonist, but something important in the history of socially-charged drama.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

(Russian Hackers? Fox News?) I doubt that much will come of this campaign. This film handles its business and leaves little doubt that it has. I'm not saying it's perfect but by super hero blockbuster standards, it definitely exceeds expectations. The writers/director (Coogler and Cole) have actually taken the time to write the actioner you want along with a fleshed out, exceedingly thoughtful and wonderfully relevant story, the likes of which have rarely graced this genre. This comic book myth may have been hatched in '62 alongside the emergence of the 'Black Panther' movement but this film announces that the social ideas and dreams, that were always that movement's subtext, remains alive. If you only know the 'Panthers' as a violent, revolutionary group, then you don't know the 'Black Panthers'. (I recommend the PBS documentary)Boswick is an excellent choice for T'Challa aka 'The Black Panther'. He's crafted an understated hero which suits his humility as great warrior and compassionate king. Michael B. Jordan aka 'Erik Killmonger' has come a long way since his days on The Wire and with good reason. He's truly become a wonderful, sensitive and intense actor which is on full display here. His portrayal is fully four dimensional having some ask whether he would have been a better Black Panther. Really, the entire cast goes all out to make this a human experience.Overall, the special effects are good with only a few over-the-top CGI moments and obligatory choreo-fights. This film isn't so much about the action (Don't worry. It's in there.) as it is about establishing the myth and proposing another way of seeing and being. AND the message isn't just for people of color.No spoilers today. Wouldn't want to undermine the experience in any way.8.5 stars!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

King T'chaka (John Kani) is killed in a terrorist attack and his son T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) is about to take over his mantle as king of Wakanda. Everything changes when old Wakandan foe Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and newcomer Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) are threatening to steal Wakandan resources (Vibranium, the strongest metal on earth) and expose the country for what it truly is: the richest and most technologically advanced country in the world. The movie bears the title of a Marvel movie, but it doesn't feel like a Marvel movie for the most part. In this case it works in the benefit of the movie. The thing about Marvel movies is that they are easy fun, they have a certain quality to them but are also predictable, loud and follow a certain formula that always leads to danger in the form of an apocalypse. In the introduction of the movie you get acquainted with the country and the culture of Wakanda as well as their characters, like Nakia (Lupita Nyongo'o), W'kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), M'baku (Winston Duke) Zuri, (Forrest Whitaker) standouts Okoye and Shuri (who are played wonderfully by Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright respectively) and with minor roles for Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) and N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown).It must be mentioned that this movie feels very complete and stands on its own without being dependent on other instalments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It feels like a crash course about Wakanda and their leaders and culture. Every story arc begins and ends in a logical, well-told and satisfying way. The characters talk about the future of Wakanda by discussing traditions and change. It has great social commentary and talks about Black lives and culture. Family and legacy. Loyalty and betrayal. Every scene of exposition ties into somebody's' personal story and serves a purpose. The Villain Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date. He is certainly up there with Vulture from Spider-man: homecoming and maybe even Loki. The incentives for the actions of Killmonger are so clear, you feel for this character for what he has been through in his life, even rooting for him at certain times during the film. However, he doesn't get the screen time he deserves. He is introduced for a scene in the beginning of the film and disappears for maybe an hour, which gives the movie some tonal differences.From a storytelling standpoint this movie excels, especially compared to other Marvel movies. Director Ryan Coogler once again shows us that he is here to stay. Because of him this movie just works. After Fruitvale Station and Creed, which were both very critically acclaimed, he comes with the most personal Marvel movie yet. scenes that will be remembered are the dramatic scenes, the acting, the chemistry between characters and the vibe of the movie instead of the action scenes, even though it's a superhero movie. The action scenes are the most underwhelming parts of the movie. Some scenes look too animated and look unfinished, while other scenes have too many jump cuts and shaky cam to really know what is going on. The action scenes are just not memorable. You can clearly see where the money from the budget was spent on because the set and costume designs are top notch. Unfortunately, this led to weaker CGI heavy action/fighting scenes. Overall, this was not just a good Marvel movie, this was a good movie, period. 
And even though the screenplay does not allow anything open for 
interpretation the movie does well by just telling a solid story. The Villain could've used more screen time, but the main and side characters are wonderful. The CGI could've been better, but the production design makes up for it. 8,5/10","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action is light and far from revolutionary. The film's basic structure mimics that of 2011's Thor. Killmonger is an solid villain, although his limited screentime and certain dialogue prevents him from being the greatest but he's one of better villains The MCU has. Phase 3 overall has been much better in the villain department. The CGI painfully reminds of PS2 video games especially in the 3rd act. While the tone is more serious, it doesn't erase the fact that this film's vibranium weaving has some cracks. It's an good film but not the masterpiece being touted. The performances elevated a rather generic and predictable story. C","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

They actually made strong female characters without having to make the male characters pathetic by comparison. the dormalaj (female guard) stole the show in my opinion and made wonder woman look second rate, they did so while not making the male counterparts look pathetic....take a note star wars.however the movie was nearly ruined by the racial agenda. While there was racism toward white people in pushing that white people of today are somehow evil and accounted for the deeds of their ancestors, it was far more racist toward black people.They made the black characters killmonger, his father, black panthers love interest and a few others very very racist toward black people. They kept referring to all black people as one people and brothers and sisters. That they were enslaved and oppressed. All black people are not the same, every black person is their one person and has their own beliefs and experiences. To lump all the black people of the world together simply because they have the same skin color is quite racist. Would you lump south koreans in with people of thailand? no because even though they share similarities, they are in fact very different people. Would you lump white Russians in with White americans or Austrailians? No because they are entirely different people. Skin color is the most common character distinction in people but it is also the most insignificant.Not to mention wakanda was shown to exist in the heart of africa, slaves were never or extremely rarely taken from inner countries they were mostly taken from coastal countries. further to that point, by enlarge slaves were sold to sailors by african tribes. It was common practice for warring tribes to take slaves as spoils of war and they would sell them to ships that would come by on the trade routes. Slaves were taken by force at times by colonizers but this was not needed most of the time as tribes warred and took slaves to use as commodities not only with white sailors but also with other african tribes. At least for the most part the character of black panther stays away from this and tries to distinguish that black people all over the world are not his people, his people are those of wakanda.it was just terrible writing. People go to see fantasy movies to get away from the real world and it is just terrible to see identity politics in a fantasy movie.","21 out of 48 found this helpful.

In my opinion the phase 1 was boring, the phase 2 was fine and the phase 3 is being amazing.
I didn't know nothing about Black Panther before to watch it, but this movie is the proof of how great a PG-13 super hero film can be. The main story is really good, has small twists to keep the interest and memorable characters to make every single scene epic.Some of the most points I love are: the costumes & the characters design (the creators deserve a nomination for the next Oscars), the action sequences are all incredible (the scene in South Korea is one of the best I've seen in a action film), and the soundtrack is amazing.Rating: 8.5/10I know it's an important masterpiece for the African people and I'm happy to see how Marvel could handle it with success. Now I hope they do movies with more people from different races, female leaders, and also with gay, bisexual and lesbian super heroes.

I'm in the I-love-it camp. But I understand how a lot of people could struggle to really love it as much as me.I'd say that Black Panther's best quality is that it's more of a science fiction type movie remarking on real compelling global issues than a regular safe good heroes saving the world from selfish villains narrative. You know. The type of story where the villain knows or doesn't care that the plan is evil because its their nature to be proudly selfish. The foundation of Black Panther also isn't irreverent jokes and dazzling cinematic battles for the sake of visual aesthetic wonder. Black Panther has some solid quips and visuals. But I'd argue it has more of the science fiction elements than the regular superhero elements. And many people probably expected and were disappointed not to to experience the opposite.For instance Black Panther being a superhero feels secondary to him being the king of Wakanda. I find this element of open leadership and responsibility great and appealingly more similar to the struggles of real heroes. But many people are going to prefer the other type of simple escape from reality story. I don't mind superhero movies of that type. I just find them inferior to a story like Black Panther's when done right.The film has a few moments where it might be a bit too smarmy and proud of its progressive side. It also has a few silly moments which seem to exist merely for the sake of fitting within the Marvel Universe than supporting the Black Panther story.But overall I find it to still be a great story and it feels like a Marvel movie one could appreciate even if one hasn't seen any of the other Marvel films. It has some great acting and character development. The cinematography, directing and pacing are great. As well as the score, costumes, and sets. The environment of Wakanda is very well developed as well.Overall I'd say it's the best Superhero movie I've seen. It's innovative, but works because it adheres to a lot of basic effective movie principles. It doesn't try to invent new ingredients for storytelling, but it puts ingredients we're familiar with together in different ways to create a very appealing and distinct final creation. I'd a well deserved 10/10 in my book.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

In current times, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is about to become king of Wakanda but he must face various challengers. T'Challa, his family, and his loyal friends face animosity from within and outside Wakanda. Some of their enemies believe that Wakanda should share its advanced technology to help other Africans in great need.Like many big-budget blockbusters, ""Black Panther"" is thrilling, exciting, and entertaining. It is also, like those other big-budget blockbusters, occasionally confusing with too many subplots happening simultaneously. But in fairness, it is less confusing than most other such films. What truly makes this film unique in this genre is its Afrocentric focus and perspective with an almost all-black cast. In this way, it has made history and is a welcome breakthrough. Its focus on whether or not Wakanda should remain isolationist also provides an intelligent critique on the current state of the world.""Black Panther"" has something else to its credit: it is a visual splendor and probably the most beautiful film to grace the big screen in many years - yet another reason to recommend this fine film. It truly is a feast for the eyes and is entertaining in so many other ways as well.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS: Cinematography; Set Design; Costumes","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I've been a little disappointed with most of the recent Marvel films so I wasn't sure what I'd think of this one but I was pleasantly surprised.Black Panther follows the story of King T'Challa of Wakanda, a hidden African nation filled with advanced technology, and his battle to protect his country.This film was obviously a huge step forward in diversity. The cast is mostly black and the women are refreshingly not stereotypical and not over sexualised. It's so nice to see women portrayed as smart, political, and strong but with complex emotions and ambitions rather than being portrayed simply as the romantic interest or the warrior.I thought that the story was brilliant. In the past, Marvel has not shied away from making political statements in their films and this was no different. There were moments that moved me to tears, the characters were likeable and well-developed, and the plot was clever, believable and well paced. The visuals in this film were absolutely stunning. The use of colour, in particular, really helped to establish the beauty of the country of Wakanda. The costumes were vibrant and the special effects were amazing.It did have a bit of a different feel to a lot of the Marvel films. This was potentially due, in part, to the fact that it was mostly separate from the previously established world of The Avengers. Most of the recent Marvel films have included cameos of various members of The Avengers or other well-established Marvel characters whereas Black Panther did not. Since T'Challa had already been introduced in Civil War, there was no need to connect this too strongly with The Avengers. To me it felt enough like it was part of the univere but a little secluded, like Wakanda.My only real issue with Black Panther was that the humour fell a little flat. It felt like an awkward dad trying to be ""down with the kids"". This was particularly disappointing as Marvel films often have the perfect balance of action, emotion and comedy whereas it just didn't work in this film. Overall though I immediately fell in love with this film and I cannot wait to see how it links in to the rest of the Marvel universe in Avengers: Infinity War.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It takes years to be untaught such racism. This movie lifts them up and shows them as the proud, intelligent and strong people they are. Kids today now have something to make them feel proud of where they came from.One mistake in film: ""It's our time to be on top"" line should have been delivered as, ""Our time to be on top AGAIN,"" or ""Back on Top."" There was a time were they ruled the earth; even an African King was a Pharaoh.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

With the great reviews and a lover of Marvel Comic movies this was a no brainer. As expected the casting, cinematography, directing, set design and acting were all seemless and worked well with the story. In my estimation a solid B+. 
BUT........ The Racist, stereotype depiction of the black race I could not get over. To those of you who have not seen it let me prepare you. 
In this movie an advanced secret black society in darkest Africa profits from the use of parts of a meteor that has fallen giving them power and technology (no mention of schools)... Then the costumes... In this advanced Black society they wear loin cloths, carry and chuck spears, have large lip plates (colorful), wear brightly colored leisure suits, and adorn the walls of this magnificent city with LA style graffiti. Ironically, supreme power is attained by drinking from harvested ""flowers"" that give the recipient super human strength. Did I mention the hallucinations from the substance? 
Pretty much covering many negative stereotypes we are trying to shed. 
A ""Song of the South"" for a new generation. Do not take my word for it and see for yourself.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I get that they're adding up to a greater narrative for Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but a lot of them seem almost indistinguishable from each other. Enter Black Panther (2018). Not only is this superhero not white, but almost all the action takes place somewhere other than New York City. There are a lot of strengths in Black Panther that make it feel like a cut above the rest. From the set design and aesthetic of Wakanda to the well-developed characters (including women warriors and women scientists), Black Panther shows how a superhero movie should be made.Despite its strengths, there are still a few, minor weaknesses in this film. First, some of the CGI felt a little off in the sense that my mind rejected it when I saw it. These moments were usually pretty rare but were unquestionably obvious. Secondly, one of the tenets of the superhero genre is the action/fight sequences. While these sequences were present and exciting in Black Panther, often they seemed to be jittery and confusing to watch. Perhaps films like John Wick (2014) have spoiled me to the steady camera of a well-choreographed action sequence.One of the best performances in Black Panther, which is why I think it should come so highly recommended, was that of Michael B. Jordan's antagonist, Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens. The strength of the African accouterments in this film was a cultural foundation that was offset by the oppression of African-Americans. This was made all the more evident by the antagonist's somewhat noble goal. I don't know if I've seen a more sympathetic villain, and it just made the conclusion feel like a richer sense of justice instead of just vanquishing an evil foe.A breath of fresh air in a stagnant genre of superhero films, I give Black Panther 4.5 stars out of 5.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Speaking of the antagonist, this movie's villain is probably the most two dimensional one seen in a Marvel movie to date, with the possible exception of Maliketh. The guy is whiny, arrogant, and, to be honest, stupid. If the movie didn't bend over backwards to force the conflict between him and the protagonist, he wouldn't have accomplished half of what he did in the movie.And on top of all of this, by the end of the movie the only real contribution it makes to the MCU is something that was already established in prior films.

A conflict ensues and the fate of the whole world becomes in danger.Black Panther is one of my most anticipated films of this year (you can check the list HERE) and I couldn't wait to watch it on an IMAX theater. I loved Boseman's presence in Civil War and his action sequences were amazing, so I was super excited to see what his origin movie could bring to the MCU.Well, it is undoubtedly one of the best in the franchise and its place on the top one-third of the MCU is certainly guaranteed. It has a very heartfelt and culturally significant screenplay. This carries an even bigger weight than Wonder Woman did because for the first time in the cinema history, a film with not only a black lead superhero but with a 95% black cast (only two white characters), shines through with an emotional story.The script is remarkably well-written. It has a lot of references to the real world but in the opposite way: Wakanda is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world and for once, black people are not the ones falling behind. I love this aspect of the movie, Ryan Coogler cleverly portrays a world where things are not as everyone thinks they are. This film is demonstrative of how to flawlessly build a world in a cinematic universe.Also an example of perfection, the casting is phenomenal! Marvel never fails in getting the absolute best actors and actresses to portray their respective roles, either these being the lead hero or a secondary character. Everyone has terrific performances, but some are worth mentioning in detail.I will not even start with Boseman. Firstly, I have to write about Michael B. Jordan and his interpretation of the villain, Erik Killmonger. Jordan is incredible, there isn't a single scene where he doesn't shine and he elevates his character. That said, Killmonger is by far the best villain since the beginning of everything (Iron Man (2008)).His compelling journey makes the audience care for him and his beliefs are very true to his heart. He is what he thinks the people need him to be in order for everyone to be able to live freely and protected from the ""bad guys"" running the world. His backstory is very tragic and it sets up a dilemma between him and T'Challa. Erik is notably well-developed and Coogler does a wonderful job co-writing him with Joe Robert Cole.Chadwick Boseman is right up there as well. He fully embodies his character, nailing the accent and making every interaction that he shares with his family or his close friends feel so realistic and full of emotion. T'Challa is an exceptional protagonist, it is easy to stand behind him since his motivations are genuine and passionate. He wants the best for his people and he wants to be an even better King than his father, by trying to correct his past mistakes.I don't even consider T'Challa and Killmonger as the hero and the villain, respectively. Each character has their own perspective and their reasons are both solid, so when the time for their head-to-head comes, I can't really choose a side. Coogler and Cole brilliantly write the characters' script and each one has their own reasons to support either Boseman or Jordan's characters. This is why this movie probably has the best characters in the whole MCU.Lupita Nyong'o beautifully portrays Nakia, a warrior that doesn't rely on tradition that much as she also wants to see the poor people around the world with a better quality of life. Danai Gurira (Okoye) is a badass and her character is also very well-developed, plus she has some cool action sequences. I also would like to congratulate Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue) for his excellent over-the-top performance, as well as Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi), Letitia Wright (super funny as Shuri) and Martin Freeman (Everett K. Ross).Actually, Ross was one of the characters that I left the theater wondering if he was really necessary. Being the only white person in Wakanda, I took a while to fully understand his role. Truthfully, he doesn't introduce or helps to develop any other character and he only has one or two scenes to shine. However, he is important to the cultural value of the film! He is the personification of the rest of the world, he thinks he is several steps ahead of T'Challa and his people, but Freeman ends up being the ignorant of Wakanda's greatness.Like I wrote earlier, this is one of the best installments of the MCU. Culturally, it means a lot and the story has a lot of substance. The cinematography looks gorgeous, the nation of Wakanda is very well designed through CGI and the editing is great throughout the whole runtime. The epic score is one of the highlights. A lot of praise has been given to Kendrick Lamar for the rap vibe that he implements in the movie, but nothing beats the African traditional sounds that elevate not only the action scenes but every single moment.Nevertheless, this film is not perfect. While its tone is well-balanced, its pacing not so much. The first act drags too much and it feels that some scenes could have been left out. From the first ritual battle onwards, the movie starts getting its pace right and the entertainment level gets higher. However, the plot follows a predictable path and it ends up on a disappointing note ... Coogler doesn't do good directing the most important action scene.The CGI might be very good and it is indeed well-controlled during the film, but it is misused in the climactic fight at the end. I mean, the first ritual battle between T'Challa and (at the time) a random character is way more exciting and better filmed (good handling of the shaky cam and the water splashes effects are pretty cool) than the supposedly epic showdown with Killmonger. Leaving the theater disappointed with the fight is never a good sign, especially when there are so many awesome action moments during the film. Apart from this, a couple of exposition scenes could have been told in a better way, but these are all minor issues that I have with one of the best superhero movies in the most recent years.All in all, Black Panther lives up to the hype and it does not fail. With an extraordinary cast, Boseman and Jordan lead a very heartfelt and emotional story, filled with fantastic characters and beautiful world-building. Killmonger is the absolute standout as the best villain of the entire MCU, the script is on-point for every character and the plot is very well-written, even if it becomes predictable. Technically great, but not flawless. While the cinematography, the editing and mainly the score elevate the film, the first act's slow pacing and the extremely disappointing climactic battle between the two leads bring down the movie, ending it on a bittersweet note.

While it made great attempts to be a great superhero movie, it misses a lot of the things other Marvel movies does great. The first thing that quite bothered me was the tribe aesthetics they wore, I understand that Wakanda is from Africa and they wanted to reflect that by using ancient tribe aesthetics but it does not work well with modern technology. They should have just stuck a modern style. Nothing wrong with Africans wearing modern suites. There is a significant amount of humour missing in the movie, I wish the amount of humour was more something like Thor Ragnarok. Cinematography and fight scenes were not all that amazing. Michael B. Jordan's character did not feel villainous enough. I truly hope they get a different director for the 2nd Black Panther movie.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Eventually, 4 of the tribes join together to form the nation known as Wakanda and use this new metal to advance their technology beyond anything the world has ever known. Equally important is the fact that a rare herb grown in that part of the world has been affected by the radiation from vibranium and, when ingested, gives a person superhuman abilities. This person is known as the Black Panther and he not only becomes the King of Wakanda but also serves as the protector for his people. Anyway, thousands of years pass and while the rest of the world advances Wakanda remains in geographical isolation and is thought of as an extremely backward country. But little does the world realize that Wakanda has technology beyond that of Western civilization and has chosen to remain isolated for fear of what might happen if their technology-and most importantly their vibranium-were to get in the wrong hands. That being said, when some vibranium is stolen the Black Panther is forced to go to America in secret and deal with the situation personally. Little does he know that his actions will have extreme repercusions for the rest of the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent ""comic book"" movie that combined a dynamic plot, good acting and plentiful action throughout. I especially liked the acting of both Chadwick Boseman (as ""T'Challa"") and Michael B. Jordan (""Erik Killmonger"") who seemed tailor-made for their parts. On the flip side, however, I must also say that there were some minor flaws in the CGI and that I didn't especially care for the character of ""Shuri"" (Letitia Wright) who was unnecessarily annoying. But that aside, I enjoyed this film overall and I have rated it accordingly.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It has a great story and one of the best screenplays Marvel has ever prodded. It offers a strong story with many interesting characters, mixes this with great action scenes and delivers a great visuality in general.
The only thing that could have been better was the acting. Why everybody was solid nobody really was at the top of their game. I guess that is still something Marvel has to learn, now that they stat to produce great screenplays. Again, dont get me wrong, Chadwick Boseman was great in the leading role but I felt that his co stars Lupita Nyong'o and especially Michael B. Jordan were there and just did their thing without much passion. I also thought Forest Whitaker once again adds an overacting credit to his resume, which is a shame. Angela Bassett was good and I really liked Martin Freeman and Danai Gurira. Andy Serkis also made a decent villain.
Daniel Kaluuya also doesnt really live up to his recent Oscar nomination and I felt the performance of Letitia Wright was a bit off. But other than that it is close to a masterpiece. Besides the great screenplay it has a fantastic direction by Ryan Coogler and many nice twists. I really liked the mythology it created and look forward to many more visits to Wakanda.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

A lot of it stems from the fact that it's (debatably) the first mainstream blockbuster to have a predominantly Black cast, and also the first that deals with issues affecting Black people around the world. For a lot of people, this was more than just a movie. It was a cultural moment. That's completely understandable, given Hollywood's history of racism and underrepresentation. Black Panther broke all sorts of records, and reeled in over $200,000,000 opening weekend, in the U.S. alone. It's really making its mark, and for good reason.It also helps that it's one of Marvel's best. After T'Challa (Black Panther) stole the show in Civil War, people were excited to see him in a story of his own. In this movie, he has become the king of Wakanda, an African nation that mines Vibranium (the stuff Captain America's shield is made of) to create extraordinary technology but disguises itself as an impoverished, third world country. T'Challa is conflicted about whether he should continue allowing Wakanda to thrive as an isolationist country or if he should use its wealth and technology to benefit the rest of the world. He begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be when the throne is challenged by Killmonger, a soldier who seeks to start worldwide uprising and bring it all under Wakanda. Killmonger was easily one of the best villains in the MCU, if not the best overall. He has a charismatic and patient side, but also a violent and aggressive side. Without giving too much away, his last on-screen appearance was a very good scene. The other characters were also pretty good. Shuri was fun to watch with all her technology. Okoye had some great fight scenes. Ross was a good comic relief. M'Baku was a good character. Andy Serkis is one of the best actors to play a villain. The list goes on. One of the best things about the movie is the way it builds the world. You don't need to be familiar with the comics to understand Wakanda, and its people, culture, and traditions are shown in great detail, making it fascinating to watch. Wakanda is beautiful, the people, the landscape, and the futuristic cityscape. It also helps that the movie's soundtrack, which ranges from traditional African music to orchestral movie music to rap and hip-hop, is absolutely fantastic. The blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film, with the combat shown ranging from swordfights to aerial battles that look like they're right out of Star Wars. The rituals shown involving T'Challa's coronation were great. He participates in ritual combat, and talks to his deceased father in the Ancestral Plane, which reminds me of The Lion King. That's actually a downside to the film, without giving too much away, it's strikingly similar to The Lion King in several different ways, not just because it's set in Africa. Black Panther still does it very well, though. The people show the different cultures of Wakanda, which are based on real African cultures. There are articles online that document the real life inspiration behind some of Black Panther's imagery, and are great reads.In conclusion, Black Panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of memorable characters, an amazing world and culture within its setting, and a great albeit familiar story. This movie meant a lot for many people, and it was an absolute pleasure to see on the big screen. This one is very highly recommended.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Well, it doesn't. It's paint-by-numbers for the genre but like ""Wonder Woman"", it differs from the norm because of skin color (Wonder Woman focused on womens' rights politically). But outside of this, it offers nothing outside of the ordinary, and frankly, I never liked superhero films outside of Batman, Superman, and seldom Spiderman.Just like my greatest concern with the vast majority of ""superhero"" movies, my biggest concern and knock on them has to do with insulting viewers' intelligence and dumbing down the viewer by playing on a fantasy world that removes all scientific facts and logic of what is known to be reality. This could never happen. And I have to say that this was the one thing that made the one and only modern superhero movie a true classic back in 2008; The Dark Knight brought Bruce Wayne and the Joker into the real world, minus a couple jump scenes. This is pure fantasy and childish, only appealing to kids who don't know better, and it's manipulating them for that for their SJW agenda.This movie is racist because it is expressing black power over white people as a sort of utopian vision for the future, where white people are slaves to black people, just like Wonder Woman fancies a future where men are subordinated to women in power.Within 5 minutes, between the actors talking like they're reading off of the paper with no depth and emotion, and the obvious clichés, I shut this POS off. 5 minutes was more than enough of my time to waste on such tripe. But don't worry, I shut 90% of all superhero movies off within the first 10 minutes, even the ones with white people; the only difference is the ones with white people aren't nominated for Oscar awards and overhyped.This is nothing more than by-the-numbers comic book flick, but one that is unabashedly racist towards white people.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The view from an old, intellectual white guy who isn't into Marvel comix or movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4077539/?ref_=tt_urv","MorpheusRU","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4747863/?ref_=tt_urv","1 March 2018","Browsing user reviews, I see many jaded Marvel aficionados were not impressed by this offering. I would guess most of them are relatively young white guys. Being a relatively old white Star Wars guy, never having read a Black Panther comic and having seen only one X-Men movie (I did read X-Men comix in their early days), I'm looking at Black Panther, the movie, from a very different perspective, one shaped by the Vietnam War and Civil Rights struggles, the long view historical context (e.g., 18th Century colonialism, the self-destruction of four empires in WW1 and the undoing of the remnants of European dominance following WW2, the Cold War, Vietnam, the fall of the USSR, the wrong-headed adventures of US neo-conservatives leading to a destabilized Middle East, and the rise of China as the next superpower), 20th Century rock, cinema and literature, etc. Having found the media hype intriguing, I approached Black Panther with an open mind, viewing it as a standalone expression of pop culture. I would imagine the negative reviewers who panned the film or damned it with faint praise, will view my review as way out of touch. No problem, bring it.From my vantage point, the film is a tour de force of fantasy action adventure and an audiovisual powerhouse. The costumes alone of the citizens of the small African kingdom of Wakanda are well worth the price of admission. The best of Star Wars has nothing on the special effects. The throbbing African rhythms alternating with hip hop beats and ranks of male and female warriors slamming their spears to the ground in unison keep the viewer in a prolonged state of excitement. The film features a full range of thrills- single combat between heroic African martial artists, armies clashing with primitive weaponry backed up by armored dragonfly air support and tank-like rhinos, high tech cars chasing a convoy of MRAP (mine resistant, ambush protected) SUVs and wreaking havoc on hapless civilian traffic through Seoul, South Korea, dramatic appearances of the superhero, Black Panther, in his transforming body suit that absorbs kinetic energy from various projectiles and channels it back toward criminal aggressors, ultra-high speed trains flashing along elevated tracks through the hidden, futuristic capital of Wakanda, to name a few. Reviewers who think some or all of this is ridiculous are forgetting something: magical realism.However, the most compelling aspect of Black Panther is the thought-provoking script, brilliantly manifested cinematically though it is. The premise of Black Panther, a hidden paradise of scientifically advanced black Africans disguised as a poor third world backwater in order to prevent everyone else on the planet from realizing what they have and disrupting their idyllic way of life, is an extremely ingenious flipping of the contemporary geo-political reality, i.e., a small set of advanced countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas fending off incursions from the masses of disadvantaged and resentful descendants of oppressed minority groups and colonial subjects who would like to enjoy the health, wealth and opportunities of their current and former masters. In the movie, some of the elite of Wakanda, including a king's brother, are anguished by the plight of their black cousins in Africa as well as the USA. These Wakandans believe their country should use its vast but secret power to intervene on behalf of the oppressed of the world and create a more just global order. The king, a conservative traditionalist, considers this a betrayal and puts a stop to his brother's plans, setting off a generational revenge cycle that threatens to upend Wakanda's idyllically detached society and set their devastating technological power against the ruling princes and oligarchs of the Earth. Unbeknownst to those complacent elites, their fate hangs in the balance as the sons of the old king and his brother face off to determine whether Wakanda will remain a wary but hidden observer of their abuses and machinations or a stalking jungle predator coming to devour them in their sleep. Perhaps many viewers of Black Panther who respond favorably will enjoy it for its dazzling surface of beauty, action and drama. I certainly did. Those who go a little deeper and consider the ironies and implications of the story it tells (for example, Wakanda's radical anti-immigration and isolationist policies vs. the social conscience of the antagonists), will find food for thought. Is the idealistic resolution of the core conflicts satisfying? You be the judge.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Such a great political study of both Wakanda and American ideals. Obviously this film borrows heavily from that run as well as Hudlin and Coates. The fascinating thing about this movie is using it as a ""what if?"" moment. Will a nation prosper if they have unique resources that was kept a secret for year? Wakanda is a nation that did not fall into the perils of colonialism and overreliance of other nations or ""aid"". The character study of TChalla and Killmonger is just as engaging. They are two sides of the same coin as their objective is to create a better world for their people. Though their methods are drastically different. Killmonger is a villain that, as an African American, you understand completely where he is coming from. He is one of Marvel's greatest villain since he provides an interesting challenge for TChalla, not just physically but morally. Coogler did a great job balancing a movie as complex as this with a great action superhero film. The action is nothing to sneeze at since it was breathtaking in most scenes. There ARE some CGI problems here or there but it was still good, especially the casino fight with a great score pacing the scene. The supporting cast is strong, especially Shuri, a different character from the comics but still fascinating. Last, it is good that a movie portrays people of color and a nation in Africa, though fictional, in a more positive light instead of pirates or war lords.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I have a black friend.""So growing up in Brooklyn, some of my better friends have lived their lives constantly effected by the remnants of institutionalized racism and racism in general. And denying that racism has infected all walks of life, including Hollywood, and continues to do so, is to be perpetuating a fallacy. You need to have some bulletproof blinders on in order to believe anything else. Under-representation of black culture and whitewashing is an easily traceable pattern in Hollywood. Multiple black actors is a rare sight in a film, unless the film is about sports or slavery. I agree that the overly PC culture we live in can go too far in it's demands for ""social justice"" and in it's outrage where it isn't truly warranted, but facts are facts and the annoying nature of some ""SJWs"" doesn't alter said facts.Now, as a middle class white man who grew up seeing racial injustice but never truly living through it, I found the idea of a Marvel super hero movie set in Africa and consisting nearly entirely of black main and supporting actors refreshing and interesting. However, for my friends it was far more than that. It was a source of pride and extreme emotional investment. Even now just looking at their Facebook wall you would see the positive impact that the very existence of this film has on their lives and continues to do so. And that's a beautiful thing. I want every movie I watch to have that effect on me and am thrilled when a movie, even one I don't personally like, has that effect on anyone.However, that emotional impact, those Facebook posts, the glowing reviews and everything else surrounding this film's release, as happy as it made me for people I care about, is the exact reason I waited a little bit to watch it. Because this movie had all the hype in the universe, and hype culture is a terrible thing with no true benefit to any moviegoer. If you hype yourself into thinking a movie's going to be a 10, and it's a 9, you will be disappointed. If you go in thinking it will be a 5, and it's a 6, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I had to go back into ""5"" mode before I decided to see this.So I managed to go into this film with weathered expectations and a constant mind to the things I typically don't like about Marvel films, instead of the hype. Even though I love the idea of this film and am happy that it's an overwhelming triumph financially, none of it mattered to me if it didn't succeed as a film on it's own merits.It did.The movie has the three main problems that I have with all Marvel movies: too long, CGI porn and containing bad one liners that take the drama away from a scene. However this movie was one of the lesser offenders in the MCU in those regards. There's only one or two of the lame drama-cutting jokes (and although this joke wasn't of that variety, any ""what are those"" jokes deserve to rot in the deepest circle of hell). To boot, although the movie felt a tiny bit long, looking back I can't think of any particular thing that could have been cut. I originally thought the Oakland stuff could have been cut, but they paid that stuff off in a big way at the end. I originally though the ""challenge"" scene didn't need to be there, but it served as a lesson in a Wakandan culture and provided context to later events, so no problem there. Ultimately I can't complain too much about the length. And it's a Marvel movie so CGI porn is CGI porn and it's there and there can't be much done about it. However the warrior culture and natural backdrops of Wakanda make for much more clear and enjoyable battle scenes overall.The story here is simple but effective: T'Challa is a new King after the death of his father. With the changing landscape of the world, the discovery of a stolen artifact and the eventual arrival of Killmonger, he is emburdened with the question of whether Wakanda's technology should be shared with the world, a new threat and the realization of his father's greatest failing. The movie is paced well, makes sense, is greatly performed, the score is excellent and best of all the isolationist nature of Wakanda meant the film wasn't burdened with gratuitous references to other Marvel movies, much like how the setting of Wonder Woman worked in it's favor.I knew Chadwick Boseman was a great actor and an excellent Black Panther after his previous turn as him in Civil War, but whether he could carry the main duties in a film was yet to be seen, and he was great here. Emotional yet powerful, serious yet charismatic, and believable. He has great chemistry with all of his co-stars and really fits the bill as a leading man. Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger continues to check marks on his rise to superstardom, creating something as rare as a unicorn: a compelling villain in a Marvel movie. His upbringing is laid bare and it makes his pain, anger and motivation completely understandable. He isn't trying to take over Wakanda because ""I'm the antagonist""; he's doing so because he wants both revenge on the world, and in his own mind, to save it. In the context of the film, you definitely feel for him. Also as a child raised in Oakland California in the 90s, his juxtaposition with the African people of Wakanda makes for an intriguing contrast.The supporting cast members are all noteworthy in their own right. I especially enjoyed Letitia Wright as Shuri. She was the funniest castmember, often quick with a one-liner that lands, and never obnoxiously so save for that ""what are those"" travesty. She never felt like a caricature or a stock ""funny"" character. Just a witty character with a sense of humor. Later in the film, when she had to be serious, she was.In the end, even ignoring the poison to balanced expectations that is hype culture, what you have with Black Panther it a well-paced, well-acted and well-told story and a bona-fide standout among Marvel movies, limiting the little annoyances that plague most of them. If there is an extra emotional element to you personally, even better.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I didn't know Wakanda was so ahead of the world with technology, or any of the character lore. Yes, this is kind of an origin story, but it's done in a way that it doesn't necessarily feel like it. The scenery is beautiful, and the characters are great. The women really kick butt, and the villains are very good. Andy Serkis especially seems to have a lot of fun with his role. I didn't really expect humour, but as with Marvel tradition, there is a good amount as well. Overall, a fun continuation of the dominating Marvel movies, and yet another that I will add to my collection!","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

But that's the same for all of the Phase 3 and 4 Marvel films.
What sold it to me was the majority African cast and more women in important roles. Both of which have been lacking in action films for a long time.
Add to that the beautiful panoramas and the view of a Utopian African society and I'm all for it.So yeah, it is as mediocre as every other superhero film but it's mediocre with a different demographic. I'm all for an update to the regular cast look.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A Rich And Welcome Addition To The MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4065673/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","17 February 2018","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come. Sure, there are a few weak entries, but I don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore. This is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen a few times each year, that's had a few mediocre episodes along the way. Happily, Black Panther is their latest entry and not only is it far from mediocre, but it's easily the best film they've produced in quite some time. Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this review and call myself a fanboy who's blinded by the brand of Marvel. I genuinely thought this was a terrific entry and here's why.One of the best things about this film is that it stands on its own. Yes, seeing previous movies definitely elevates your experience, but it's been a long time since the Marvel Cinematic Universe released a movie that's not reliant on viewers having seen previous movies. That being said, Black Panther picks up not too long after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Don't let that be daunting to you or anyone who hasn't seen that film because this movie does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie. The king of Wakanda has passed away and his son T'Challa has taken the mantle. With looming threats to have his throne stolen from him, he must take any precautions necessary in order to reign supreme. Quite honestly, unless you want this movie ruined for you, it's hard to expand on the premise itself, especially when it comes to the villain in Erik Killmonger.Everyone will want to discuss how well Chadwick Boseman fits into the role of T'Challa (Black Panther), but Michael B. Jordan is easily the highlight of this film. Once again, I'm not trying to let a highlight cloud my judgment of the movie as a whole, but the villain is honestly something remarkable here, especially for the standards that have been set by previous movies in this universe. His purpose for wishing to take down the titular hero will have you hating him and sympathizing with him all at the same time and that's when you know this character was created and presented with care. The interacting with Killmonger and the secondary character and the final few scenes that he and T'Challa get to spend together are honestly some of the best moments from any of these films in a very long time.Yes, I can admit that I loved this movie from start to finish, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me. Normally when I watch a movie, I never let CGI affect how I feel about a scene as a whole, but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here. Now, that's really all I have to complain about here because it didn't take away from anything. They're definitely noticeable, but I also found myself invested and tearing up during a couple of the final scenes, even though someone's body or a background looked fake, so I have nothing but incredible applause for Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole on their fantastically written screenplay.In the end, superhero movies, in general, are hard to make these days, especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them. Personally, I think of this genre as any other genre. If you make a good film, then it's worthy of talking about, just as an indie drama that's up for Oscars is. This is a rich and wonderful world that's worth exploring. Superbly directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and easily one of the best solo outings for a superhero.Has there ever been romantic comedy fatigue? No. Has there ever been horror film fatigue? No. People let themselves think they're having superhero movie fatigue because there are many of them made nowadays, but as I said, it doesn't matter if people have powers. A great movie is a great movie if you have a story worth telling, and Black Panther proves that statement tenfold. I can't recommend checking this film out enough. For comics fans and average moviegoers alike, I feel as though this will be a movie long-discussed.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I have a friend who went to see it 4 times and ranks it as one of his favorite Marvel movies and I just don't get where he's coming from. For the majority of the film I was bored. Nothing really kept me invested and I didn't feel like T'challa (Black Panther) was challenged by the responsibility of being both a king and a superhero.  The most memorable parts of this film were; an above average villein (for a Marvel film), jarringly bad CG (took me out of the experience more than once), and a really stale meme from two or three years ago.  In the end this is yet another painfully average Marvel movie and I have to admit I have grown weary of the formula.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I hate looking at reviews for a means to decide to watch a movie, but this movie, but for some reason this movie was all over the board. From an audiophile viewpoint, it was great with the computer generated imagery and sound. From a pure movie watcher experience I loved the overall plot to the storyline. Granted I'm not a comic book person, but love the movies non the less. This movie made me want to know more about the characters the country it portrayed and their people.

"10","/10","Best MCU Film Yet","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4070112/?ref_=tt_urv","JasonR77","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52562217/?ref_=tt_urv","21 February 2018","A common thread in Marvel films has been how past actions, before the hero has his power, come back around to present consequences. Black Panther is no exception. In the same way that Tony Stark's behavior when he was a party boy caused him problems many years later, T'Challa's fathers decisions from his youth have reprecussions on his son's, and country's, future.Wakanda presents itself as practically a utopia, as its citizens have built incredibly upon its supply of Vibranium and the skills of its warrior kings. We see T'Challa ascend the throne, as we expected after the events of Civil War, and the challenges that come along with such a role.While Chadwick Boseman is a strong, capable lead who creates a sympathetic and intriguing lead character, the true stars of this film for my money are Shuri and Killmonger. Shuri isn't just the wiseguy support character that so many of the people that provide technical help to a hero is. She is a strong, vital woman in her own right who makes a difference in multiple ways, and is a pleasure to see appear on screen. Nakia and Okoye can also make these claims; they are also much stronger than many female characters are allowed to be, even within the MCU, and they too light up the screen and provide great support to the story.
Killmonger has been receiving a great deal of praise as the best MCU villain to date, and it's hard to disagree. His history is replete with violence and intellect, and he has found a way to combine those two to become a powerful force when he goes to settle his grudge. He speaks intelligently, with conviction, and with firm and complex ideas about what he intends to do. He does this all while initially seeming like an average American. Michael B. Jordan as such turns in easily the best performance of a villain this side of Loki, and elevates the film each time he is on screen.This is a more serious film from start to finish than most Marvel films lately; it is grounded, and while still flashing that trademark wit, and fun action set pieces that we've come to expect, its true strength is found between the lines with well-written characters and an interesting plot that can keep even the most casual Marvel fan transfixed.Now is the time to talk about the cultural impact of this movie. The convention of films with primarily African-American cast members being unreliable in box office terms is surely shattered now. This film has helped show those that would claim to be experts that it doesn't matter what color the skin of the cast is, if the movie is good, people will see it.There is so much black culture evident in the threads of this film, from its opening to its closing scenes, and even at least one of the post-credit scenes. The inescapable nature of trying to improve their lot in the world, and what role they should take, is woven throughout, and presents numerous conflicts that only serve to make the film as a whole even better. Ryan Coogler deserves all the praise he is getting for creating such a thematically strong film that transcends its genre while still managing to be a great part of it.Infinity War is coming soon, and following it and Avengers 4, it is sure that T'Challa and Wakanda will be a huge part of the next phase of the MCU. I, for one, am eager to see how things shake out, and will be ready to plant my butt in a seat for Black Panther 2, whenever it happens.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

There's something fishy with the rating system here. Secondly, I didn't make it further than a half hour into the movie. It's just simply one of the worst implausible, race-baiting movies out there. Within 17 minutes, there are 2 allusions made to white men taking everything from Africans. Really? If this were the case in the movie, where were the Wakandans when Africans were selling off their own kind to the Europeans? For this movie to be plausible, they should make it a point that the Wakandans were complicit in the slave trade given their super advanced technology that could have stopped it at any time! This movie is so bogus... Wakandans with alien technology 100s of years in advance to the rest of the world, but their still wearing animal-tooth necklaces and wielding spears? And to top it all off, you see the Northern lights in central Africa!!There is NOTHING realistic in the scenarios offered by the director or the producers for that matter. This movie was made to placate the African American population, just like when you see a black princess in a European fairy tale... just not historically accurate and does nothing to give value to the ACTUAL traditions of Africans! When will they realize that when Europeans do this, it denigrates African cultures as being primitive and destroys the integrity of European history! Repunzel wasn't black. Snow White wasn't black. And NO African tribal hero was ever white!This movie is an insult to anyone with a brain! Pathetic","16 out of 35 found this helpful.

The movie implies that when black folks has power and knowledge that we should spread it to others and help. Be that change for the future. I can't say 1 bad thing about this movie. When you take your white children to see this film all they see is a superhero in a panther suit fighting crime. Remember that. I hope they do something else with the black panther.

This film has been out for less than a week and already pretty much everyone who goes to the cinema has seen it, except for me. I haven't seen it yet because I don't get the urge to do what everyone else is doing. So, I'll probably wait until I can borrow it from some library. I actually like the films that Marvel makes, but I don't jump up and down every time one of those films is released. My favorite MCU films are Thor (2011), Ant-Man (2015), Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Doctor Strange (2016), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Pretty much all the Marvel films are enjoyable, but the ones that I've listed are my favorites. The recently released Black Panther isn't one of my favorites. It's not a bad film by any means. It's good. It's more serious that the usual Marvel flick. It's just that only a few characters in the film appeal to me. The film also doesn't quite have the emotional weight that it should have. When it comes to the characters, it lacks the appeal of Thor or of Iron Man, for example. Since Marvel films contain some Anglo-American propaganda, it can also be interesting to see them because of what they're about. Some of the information in these films actually surprised me. For example, in Captain America: The First Avenger, the fictional terrorist organization Hydra uses some odd weapons and technology. Steve Rogers (Captain America) doesn't fight against regular German troops in the film but against Hydra troops armed with extraordinary weapons. Such weapons are usually the stuff of science-fiction, but I later learned that the Nazis did actually have some of those extraordinary weapons. Some of this technology and weaponry wasn't intended for mass production and some of it wasn't fully developed when Nazi Germany was defeated. So, for example, the Germans did have plans to create the Amerikabomber, which was a long-range strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe that would be capable of striking the USA from Germany. In the film, the Red Skull attempts to use a similar bomber to strike the USA. At one time, Adolf Hitler considered the creation a giant tank not so different from the one that the Red Skull uses in the film. So, if the Germans hadn't been defeated in World War II, such ""miracle weapons"" would have become a reality already in the 1940s or the 1950s. In the sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we find out that some members of Hydra were recruited by the American espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D after World War II. Something similar happened in real life too because the Americans did bring German and other European scientists, psychiatrists, and agents to the United States after World War II. Some of these people, like Ukrainian nationalists, were so-called war criminals because they were engaged in mass killings in Europe.When it comes to what I've been reading lately, I can recommend Paul Kennedy's book 'The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers' (1987). It's a history book with some good information that was recommended by the historian Andrei Fursov. I finally finished listening to The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky a few months ago. It's a thick book, and I had to listen to it for about 25 hours. I'm now listening to the Complete Stories of Sherlock Holmes (in 3 volumes) by Arthur Conan Doyle. The narration is by Charlton Griffin, and I've got to say that I'm really enjoying listening to these releases. It's not only that the narration is very good, it's that I haven't yet read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Therefore, this is something that's new for me. Since Doyle was a Mason and a member of the British establishment, his novels contain some interesting information about British intentions in the second half of the 19th century. Another book that I'm almost finished listening to is Dispatches by Michael Herr. Dispatches was one of the first pieces of American literature that portrayed the experiences of soldiers in the Vietnam War for American readers. Herr's book is surprisingly funny at times, though he mostly describes the behavior of American soldiers and their actions. Carl Sagan's The Dragons Of Eden, which is another book that Fursov recommended, is an interesting read. I got The Dragons Of Eden right after I've read Sagan's well-known 1985 novel Contact, which is one of the more memorable hard science fiction novels that I've read. I personally prefer to read books on my tablet, by using the app Play Books. Other times, when I feel like it, I buy books at second hand book stores. But, for the most part, I read books on Play Books or I listen to them on the Audible app.Some of the novels that I've already read are Inherit The Stars (1977), which is a personal favorite, Blood Music (1985), The Visitors (1980), The Robots Of Dawn (1983), Titan (1979), Beyond The Blue Event Horizon (1977), Mission Of Gravity (1954), The Godwhale (1974), Triton (1976), In The Ocean Of Night (1977), Ender's Game (1985), and Dune (1965). When it comes to Dune by Frank Herbert, I'd recommend getting the unabridged audiobook narrated by Scott Brick and Orlagh Cassidy, among others. I'm not at all a fan of Frank Herbert's work, and his science fiction novels aren't among my favorites, but the audiobook is a compelling listen that includes music and sound effects. Although I'm still reading the manga Berserk by Kentaro Miura (I'm now reading the 16th volume), I've finished reading Battle Angel Alita by Yukito Kishiro a few months ago. I've already read famous manga like Rurouni Kenshin, Death Note, Maison Ikkoku, Akira, Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, and Fullmetal Alchemist, but Battle Angel Alita is hard to get because it has been out of print for years. Therefore, you can read it only on the internet or on an app for now. I've thought about reading it for several years, way before I knew that there was talk of adapting it into a film. Sure, the artwork is the biggest draw, but there's also a pretty good story that includes the theme of social control. Battle Angel Alita: Last Order is the continuation of the story that features more of Kishiro's fantastic artwork.","1 out of 14 found this helpful.

So I was a little reluctant to see this one, but I am glad I did! It does not 'seem' like a superhero movie to me. The plot and back stories are excellent, and it was well casted. Of course it does have some cheesy moments, but that was expected. I was happy to see practically the entire cast was POC. Even though Martin Freeman was one of the main characters, he never was the ""hero"". T'Challa and other stay in the foreground, while Freeman was more of the side character. Overall, I thought it was great, and have seen it three times. I was not exposed to much hype before I saw it, so that probably made it better to me since I had no idea what to expect.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's obviously adapted to a somewhat younger audience (so you can bring your 11-year old). Violence, yes, but not too much detail, almost no blood at all, and no sex. 
The weakness of it is that in its attempt to be empowering (and it really tries to be that) it gets too self-aware and looses tempo. It's a bit like a slightly uneven The Two Towers, set in Africa. 
I found it slow and a bit tame in the beginning, much like a Hallmark production, but halfway it picked up speed and I was drawn into the story. 
 Much of the best acting comes from the female actors, especially Danai Gurira, though I do think they could have developed some of the characters more. Michael B Jordan is hypnotizing as a tormented super villain (and not just because of his looks). But can anyone tell me what in the world Bilbo was doing there!? You're not fooling anyone with that accent btw. Can someone show him back to the Shire, please!

The last step. It should be clear for anybody, that so-called ""professional critics"", that are praising this movie as a masterpiece of sorts, a New Testament for a certain group of people, the best movie of all time are, in fact, fake. Maybe they were paid off, maybe afraid to tell the truth about ""first black superhero movie"" (also a fake - we remember Blade, and Blade is, indeed, a Marvel superhero) - but the results are devastating.Marketing guys decided to play the race card and they've collected the prize during the first weekend. But the long-running consequences for future Marvel films and ""professional reviewers"" will be far more worst - people will not buy their shit.This movie is ripped from Lion King along with dozen of other films (James Bond and Rocky Balboa, for e.g.), refreshed with bad CGI and questionable soundtrack. Really, the final battle looks like a shortcut scene from some mediocre video game - press X to win.Coogler done the impossible -T'Challa, along with his girlfriend, are less interesting interesting characters, like Everett Ross. Only this fact indicates the quality of the directing and acting.Literally, this movie should be called ""Killmonger"" and centered about Michael B.Jordan character - definitely, he has potential and Coogler knows, how to handle the actor and boost his performance. But Jordan has less screen time, then he deserves, and this fact flattened down the character to some stupid angry kid with world domination ambitions. Nobody, for some reason, reminded him, that truly free person does not want to own slaves. We again have the antagonist, that have similar powers with protagonist. We again have a couple between main hero & Lupita's character with zero chemistry between them. Seriously, interaction between BP & his sister are much more enjoyable. Looks like Shuri will be next Iron Maiden.We have a carefully calculated cast: a couple of Oscar-worthy performers, a bunch of strong women to satisfy feminists (no gays for some reason, definitely the way to improve!), rising stars and two white men just to shut up rumors about ""all-black, anti-white film"". Filmmakers were so scared to offend someone, that character Man-Ape was referenced only by name (M'Baku) and was portrayed without his iconic ape suit.We have a future-tech, rich and powerful hidden country, where king is being selected in a direct battle. Trump vs Clinton! Who wins? A small country silently decides to take the whole world just because a random guy with royal blood appeared from nowhere and ordered this monstrosity, only a small amount of rebels does not agree. Of course, other countries does not have intelligence agencies, atomic bombs and all word population can be controlled by Wakandians, especially ex-USSR, Arabic World, China, India and Asia. Civil war with blades and spears? Without beam / projectile weapons? No, we have BATTLE RHINOS! Too many plot holes and assumptions - even for a comic book movie.Two white guys - Lee and Kirby - invented the character long ago. Right now Coogler and Marvel missed the opportunity to present a really fresh, interesting story involving Black Panther - this is really sad, I was hoping (after Civil War) to see a movie without dozens of cliches and copypaste work. No mentions of MLK, Malcom X, real Black Panthers? Seriously, guys, this is not good at all. Real world is struggling to live in peace, internal conflicts are loud and clear - and You've left us with another lunatic, who wants to rule the world.","17 out of 38 found this helpful.

The cinematography is brilliant, followed by a strong sense of commitment by the actors to their characters, backed up by amazing visual effects and visuals.It is a typical marvel movie,that sets off on a high note and followed by a strong second half. Micheal B Jordan produced yet another charismatic performance as killmonger. Chadwick Bosnan's performance was stiff throughout. Most of his jokes were just cringey and his dialogue delivery was just awful. The plus points to this film include the extra bit of effort put by the costume designers to make everything authentic as hell. Any one would be completely mesmerized by the visuals Black panther has brought on screen, making it one of the best looking Marvel movies to date. Killmonger was yet again a sensible villain. We feel that he has the reason to get his throne and this in turn pushes T'Challa to see into himself and undo the wrong. Black Panther works as a good superhero flick, but marketing it as a movement is just plain absurdity. The film so blatantly imposes that without vibranium, Wakanda and its sprawling civilization would be nothing and would cease to exist. It also has a predictable story and a kind of a forgettable ending. Killmonger deserved more screentime, in comparison to T'Challa. If you're looking for some insane action or some adrenaline rush, Black panther is not for you. It slowly works itself, with some noticeable flaws and mistakes.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I love the underlying message of this movie. That the villain is the black lives matter guy. He wants revenge for past things that has happened to his people. While T'Challa sees that it is best to be equal and not get revenge. The trials that T'Challa goes through in this are very cool. Seeing Wakanda essentially go through a mini civil war is very cool. Klaue is a very cool villain, even though he was very much a wasted potential.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 8/10
I had fun watching this again. It isn't the most entertaining super hero movie out there, but is still plenty of fun. Chadwick Boseman did such a good job. His character is so likeable.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 8/10
There is tons of emotion in this. The characters go through so much. But you don't really feel it as deep as they do.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
This movie has a very good theme. Equality. Not revenge. All are equal now. Just because it used to not be that way doesn't mean it isn't now. You need to be better than the wrong. ""The illusions of division"". Thinking that one thing is better than the other is inherently wrong.This movie is very deep. Most people don't even realize how deep it is. They see a man who wants Justice for his people. But what they don't see, is how he is more evil than those who did wrong in the past. The best way to handle it is to stop looking at the illusions of division. We are all equal now.5. Characters - 9/10
All the characters are fantastic. T'Challa is such a great character. In my mind he is worthy alongside Thor and Steve Rogers of wielding Mjolner. The trials he goes through and comes out on top of are perfect. I love how he sees what needs to be done now, and learns to not dwell on the past.Shuri is a little annoying and cringe at times, but is fine for the most part. Ulysses Klaue is so wasted. He is basically the main Black Panther villain, and they completely waste him. He had some great potential, and was played by one of the greatest actors of all time. His character was not handled well at the end at all.Erik Killmonger is a fantastic villain. He is so evil. He wants to spread hate and revenge everywhere, and will do the most evil things to accomplish that. He is one of the most selfish characters we've ever seen. Because of all this he is a fantastic bad guy.I also really loved the inclusion of Agent Ross. He is one of my favorite characters. So seeing more of him is very fun.6. Acting / Writing - 10/10
There isn't a single bad actor in this. And the cast is filled with some of the best actors of all time. Chadwick Boseman is by far one of the greatest, and so is Andy Serkis. I loved how they both played their characters. The emotion felt by Chadwick in this movie is top tier. It doesn't get better than this performance.Michael B. Jordan also did so great as Killmonger. You feel the hate he has so much.7. Cinematography / Sets - 10/10
This movie is beautiful. The cinematography is amazing. The sets are amazing. The grand shots of Wakanda specifically were very cool.8. Score / Sound - 8/10
I like the music for this. It isn't the best soundtrack in the world by any means, but fits the film very well.9. Editing / Pace - 9/10
The editing is great. The fights are edited well to make the choreography look even better.The pacing is great. I was enjoying the movie throughout and never really got bored of it. It is just hard to tell the time frame of this movie. There isn't really any indication of how long it takes place over.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 8/10
The CGI was very good. There was some parts that it definitely felt like CGI, but not at all bad. Still very cool. I wish they did more of a practical suit for Black Panther. As the scenes when it is practical, it looks a lot better than the CGI suit. That being said, the purple kinetic energy on his suit looks very cool.Average Score:
8.9/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
8.7/10
I love the message of this movie. This movie is secretly very conservative, and I think that is awesome. A lot of more liberal people like this movie because they are only looking at it shallow, but if you actually think about it and go into a more in depth look you see the true message behind it. That everyone is equal, and you shouldn't seek revenge for wrong doing in the past.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Other than that, I don't find any thing that provoke me to call this a disgusting movie.
In short, Black panther is a great movie to watch with great performances of both cast and crew. Actually I never give 10 but just to outweigh these comments by people with digestion problem, I had to. Else i would give it an 8. I accept its not the best movie of Marvel franchise but still it wasn't half bad and on par with the good movies of MCU","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

T'Challa accepts the crown and becomes king of Wakanda, but his position is soon challenged by a new threat.Unlike the previous Marvel instalments, our lead hero is more of a silent type who rarely speaks, but when he does, he's confident and strong. The film also has a heavier focus on story and developing its new characters rather than loading the film up with huge amounts of witty jokes as we've previously in the likes of Thor Ragnarok or Iron Man. The film also has less amount of action than I expected for a Marvel title. But is less humour and action something to be spoken about as a negative or positive?Being a Marvel film, one element that doesn't surprise me is that once again we have an audio track which is loud and alive. I personally love how Black Panther's soundtrack felt- perfectly timed and fitting tightly with every moment. Even the faint drumming in the background of some scenes was tension building and gave life to moments where key characters dealt with dramatic situations. The visuals are also strong, full of colour, except for some of the film's fights scenes, and this brings me to one of the film's negatives for me personally.Some the fights scenes are fast and quick, which I expected for someone who moves and fights like a Panther. But, some of these action scenes were nearly in utter darkness and I found it slightly disappointing. Some of the action scenes were so dark it became somewhat unreal, almost turning it into an animation film and it became harder to enjoy the action as the darkness felt slight distracting. Other action sequence resulted in predictable outcomes even before the claws come out. The villains (yes, plural) overall were also fun and some of the best we've seen in the Marvel universe to date (Andy Serkis- dare I say no more lol).Overall, this is yet again another enjoyable Marvel film. I love how this film manages to be different from the other previous instalments. We have a new entry to the Marvel universe which focuses more on creating better characters and a strong plot rather than pushing witty characters and big bang action sequences. I truly give absolute respect to the results that have been achieved here. While it might not be my no.1 Marvel film to date, I can easily understand why many Marvel fans will sing and chant its praises.8.1/10

Well what a surprise! I find that what often comes up in the negative reviens is the technical problems, in particular the bad green screens or even that the final confrontation is in CGI, but does that really affect the experience of the film? No.The story is perfectly paced, goes deep into its substantive issues, the characters have great chemistry but we stay in something very classic but effective. Ludvig Göransson's soundtrack is excellent and much more striking than the rest of the MCU. There is excellent costume work, the direction is quite ambitious and dynamic without being illegible. There's a feminism put forward without being force and the female characters are therefore very interesting. There's also a strong political point and the substantive issues are very interesting.Big surprise and so I think even if you don't like the MCU Black Panther can still please you. 8/10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you are a black person there are themes that you just can't miss that are close to home and the film really speaks on the relationship between African people and black Americans. So many non black people grip about this movie but it is actually very deep. Unfortunately white America is already acclimated to in depth and complex narratives of people that look like them. And, Unfortunately people of color get the short end of the stick with terrible predictable films. I can't name five truly sophisticated non stereotypical black films so of course you have people over the moon excited about it. It's one of the only films where there is a positive black male lead.This movie is wonderful for children of color. It is one of the first films that reinforce self esteem. ""Show him who you are"" is pivotal. The whole idea is knowing who you are and where you come from. Black Americans have been stripped of an identity, as was Killmonger, thus being the driving point of all his rage. If you are outside of the culture and never cared to learn about black culture all of the themes will go over your head. This film shows the power of a nation that is perceived to be impoverished, which is clever and revealing about people who do not want to share their information for fear that it will destroy them, much like Africa and all its resources. A young woman is the head of technological advancement and uhhh the military is all female! That speaks volumes but you just won't get it if you aren't black, which is fine but there is no need to hate a movie that doesn't cater to your perception of the world as many films do. this film gives real history vibes, Wakanda resembles a place called Lesotho and Eric Killmonger resembles a man named Shaka Zulu. If you aren't cultured you complain about CGI and a story line you don't understand. I saw a complaint about people flying across the room when being hit but they clearly didn't pay attention to the fact that the vibranium collects energy and redistributes it, or that T'Challa has super human strength. Don't view the movie as the best marvel movie out but a decent attempt to demonstrate powerful black culture in the form of a super hero because you know Hollywood wants you to believe it can only be done in a fantasy world.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What I am really seeing on the first few pages of the review thread of this film. So many negative reviews and most of them coming from a viewpoint that the film has been overrated by critics. Seriously ! when you buy a ticket, you never really ask a critic for consideration. Sometimes you enjoy even the worst movie in theater. Judging on the basis of Critics's opinions seems dumb and totally childish. Anyways this is my opinion. I recently watched the film and to be really frank, had not really bothered about the reviews. I would have watched anyway even if they were negative.Like all Marvel Superhero films, Black Panther follows the traditional route of Good Vs Evil but with style and substance. It's not a flawless film. The pace dips many times in between and the editing could have been crisper. The CGI also looks unimpressive at many places. But this film truly belongs to its actors. Each and everyone of them is an absolute marvel on Screen.However, the two actors although very good and performed extremely well didn't leave a lasting Impression I was expecting throughout. Chadwik Boseman (Black Panther) and Letitia Wright (Shuri). The latter's performance has been applauded like crazy and I found her overrated. Don't even understand how she's given more Importance that Okoye and Nokia who were far better etched characters than her. Anyways Micheal Jordan is simply superb as KillMonger. Hope he now has understood that he suits the image of a larger than life supervillian than playing a dumb Johnny Storm in fantastic four series. I also felt they could have avoided Morgan Freeman's Ross character as he barely has much to do. The action sequences, fights are another highlight. The choreography is simply stunning. For me the stars of the show are Danai Gurira as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia. Both are extemely brilliant actresses. For the previous, she has such a commanding presence on screen and her dialogue delivery is top-notch. Although she remains tough, she comes alive even in small emotional bits. The Latter nailed the part of Nakia with great balance of vulnerability and emotions. Both the characters stay with you even after the screening has concluded. I really enjoyed the film, although this is not a perfect film by all means, but its a deeply satisfying superhero experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The scenes in Wcanda were beautiful, iI felt there could have been a bit more explanation given about the smart sister.
Very happy to see this many POC and women represented.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Immedietly after the movie i went home and looked into everything about this character, his backstory, comic lore, etc. And i was so excited that he was getting his own solo movie. But i saw it, and i hate to say this but i was extremely disappointed.Well this movie is not completely bad, first off all of the characters did an excellent job and when they have an emotional moment, you totally buy it. Even though i am probably the last person to say this, Killmonger is one of the best MCU Villains. I totally agree with what this guy is doing even though his methods of doing so were a little cruel. Also the music was very good. It gave the movie a sense of tone and even gave a little in depth view of other world cultures. Also the action sequences are pretty fun (for the most part). And sadly that's all i have for positives, i just wish i could've put more here.My biggest complaint of this movie by far was the pacing. The first 30 minutes of the film were a huge drag. Then things start to pick up, then the entire movie feels rushed from there. Also the film's CGI was bad in parts. For example that entire battle sequince at the end looked like graphics you see in a PS2 game. I understand CGI can be a good tool when there are difficult things to add into a movie (I mean armored rhinos isent something you can add in a movie perfectly), but i mean this movie's budget is way to high for the CGI to look like that. Other films old and new have done better with smaller budgets. Near the middle of the movie i told myself that ""It's gonna be a slow burn, then the big pay off with make everything right!"" But the movie does not give you the pay off you want. So all in all, Black Panther was a pretty average Marvel Movie. I feel like this movie was rushed in the making. It felt like one of the Producers said ""Oh wait we need Black Panther in Infinity War, but he has no movie! Okay we will make a movie about him in the span of 2 years and he will have been a fully developed character by then."" I do believe this is one of Marvel's weakest films. However i wonder, would i have enjoyed it more if i didn't hype it up?","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

My late reviewI finally saw the movie. I must admit a speculative fiction movie is just not my first choice in movies. After seeing ""Furious 7,"" I promised myself I wouldn't waste my valuable time again. I also admit that my only intentions for seeing the movie was to support this movie because it's based on Afro American History. Although the movie is fiction much of the story is true. I suspect many other people saw the movie for the same reason. It is a great movie. The movie kept a fast action packed tempo that was easy to follow from beginning to end. There were several A Listed Actors that played their parts to perfection. Whoever chose the cast couldn't have done a better job. Angela Basett, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jorden, Forrest Whitaker; those names sell movie tickets! I have never saw a more beautiful cast of actors. I'm sure the actors hard bodies were a marketing factor. Their skin was smooth, chocolate, shinny, and even toned. After the movie I had the craving for a Hershey Bar; yes, that good. Although the entire film wasn't shot in Africa the locations were nothing short of paradise. The use of animated animals was risky but also well done. I kept thinking, there is no way this movie was written by one person. There was just soooo much going on. The brilliant writers Ryan Coogler, Joe Robert Cole, and Jack Kirby tied the conclusion of the story in to the opening scene perfectly. The time jump from summer to winter wasn't clear to me. I don't even think the change of seasons was necessary. I think they could have used a better substance for snow. One thing that really stuck out for me was the way one character died in the end of the movie. I don't think the actor acted out a dying man well. I think it took way to long for the character to die. I have to charge the actor and the director for that. This movie is very educational. It is not your typical super hero movie. I have strong doubt that you will be disappointed. I highly recommend this movie. GO SEE THE MOVIE!Peace and BlessingsErik Smalls

In the 2018 Academy Award nominated movie Black Panther this issue is one of several discussed in the plot. The movie follows the story of Wakanda, a fictional utopia for Africans on their native continent. While war wages on the outside all is at peace in Wakanda. The king of Wakanda is T'Challa who loves his people and wants them to prosper; he is given the powers of the Black Panther, a mythical superhero that allow him coupled with technology, to be literally unbeatable. The story of the movie weaves through the different settings and time periods to show the difference between Wakanda and the outside world, while they are prospering the world is struggling.Throughout the movie music plays a huge role in terms of conveying the meaning behind it. The tempo rhythm and beat all help to set the mood of the scene. Whenever the king T'Chaka or his side are involved traditional African drumming is prevalent to contrast when Killmonger or the antagonist side is involved more contemporary rap music takes over. This contrast helps to convey the contrast between the two sides and what they stand for, thus adding an aspect of social commentary on the debate of the non-violent traditionalists and violent realists. T'Chaka wants to keep Wakanda separate, to preserve the Utopia of the previous generations. Killibonger on the other hand wants to use the edge in technology and peace Wakanda has to overthrow the world and create an empire where ""the sun never sets."" Music also is present in combat in the form of high tempo to add intensity to the scene.Cinematography also plays a huge role in the movie too and helps to provide social commentary throughout it. A good example is when the mentioning of sunsets come up and there is a scene of Killbonger and T'Chaka where music accompanies the beautiful images and lighting. In Oakland where the movie starts lighting is dim and dark to show the state of current people of African descent. Meanwhile in the technology lab in Wakanda, the lighting is bright and futuristic showing how advanced they are. This helps to provide a commentary of the contrast between Wakanda and the outside world because with these examples the viewer can see how it relates to reality and visual aspects of the movie.Acting also plays a huge role in how the social commentary between the contrasting sides is portrayed. The casting of Chadwick Boseman in the lead role of T'Challa is perfect as he carries the role with ease of showing a caring king for his people. On a contrasting note, Michael B. Jordan plays an amazing Killmonger someone who is fed up with the world and the oppression it presents; how he is in it solely for the benefit of himself and no one else. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker play well casted supporting roles to help surround these leads with people who have similar viewpoints and wishes for Wakanda and the world. Throughout the movie, these characters add a dimension behind the two leads as they fight for power and the future.I recommend Black Panther because above all it helps to portray and tell a well structured story of how minorities struggle every single day in the world to gain recognition and equal treatment. This movie provides the social commentary of being open to help those around oneself peacefully without conflict and to build through friendship, not aggression. This especially plays out in the end, but I do not want to spoil it, so go watch Black Panther. It is available on most streaming platforms such as Netflix and on iTunes and Google Play.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have to say my opinion hasn't changed. I remember discussing this movie with a friend at the time as he was a big fan of the movie but most of his reasons seem to be in the political aspects of representation. Not really about the quality of the film itself.There is a decent story in there but the way it was executed was just terribly bland and immature. Like a teen that thinks too highly of himself and considers himself the best at everything. Its like they wanted to portray Wakanda as the perfect civilization with no flaws beyond wanting to remain hidden from the rest of the world.I was personally very impressed with the Black Panther character when he was first introduced into the MCU in Civil War. Boseman fit that role perfectly but in this movie there wasn't much depth to his character and there wasn't much Boseman had to work with. After his death (RIP), there was a very fanatical uprising where it just seemed to be about representation and nothing much else. Not being an African American or white for that matter, I don't really have the same stock in this film and found it mostly forgettable. Not really sure I care about the sequel as its firmly routed in that political mindset of representation and now that Boseman is no longer available to play the lead, its no longer a film about Black Panther.Today I feel the bar for quality story telling has been significantly lowered to the point that you need to step back and really read the comments and reviews to see exactly what they are praising. A movie with a high rating doesn't automatically make it a good movie. The motivations behind the fame seems to firmly be routed in political discourse outside the movie itself.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Black Panther picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War following Chadwick Boseman (T'Challa/Black Panther) and the rise of a new king and the struggles that come from the responsibilities of it. Performance wise everyone did a flawless job, between the accents of the Wakanda people to the beautiful, Blade Runner like city designed to the artistic fight scenes and tightly written dialogue creates a movie worth watching. Every character, even Stan Lee with his famous cameo, just come off with such power and leaves the viewers with such impact and lots to think about from each line of dialogue delivered. Both Boseman and Jordan make the ranks of fans and critics favorite characters in the MCU to date along side with the array of supporting actors (Freeman, Gurira, Nyong'o, Whitaker, Kaluuya, and Serkis). Action wise this movie is visually stunning. With Coogler transferring his use of beautiful follow cams from Creed and using the same Cinematographers from Creed and Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kingsman: The Golden Circle to choreograph the fights and film them so flawlessly and beautifully makes Black Panther one of the best action movies of the year by far. Special Effects look beautiful with the Kinetic Suits and the Vibranium infused weapons used by the Wakanda warriors and Boseman. Each site of the city gets more and more beautiful with its subtle yet so appealing to the eyes. By far my favorite was the kinetic energy used when the Black Panther suit was charged up. Ryan Coogler gave it his all with Black Panther and didn't hold back a single bit with is beautifully written film that was directed so perfectly. I was a fan when I saw his work with Jordan on Fruitvale Station back in 2014 and loved his work even more with yet again Jordan in Creed and how Coogler has cemented himself in with the MCU as being one of the best directors working to date. My overall Score for the film has to be a 9.5/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

As the king, he faces questions on whether to open his country to the wider world as well as threats from a usurper (Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan) who threatens to take the throne. The Good. There are some great performances in Black Panther. Angela Bassett brings gratis as the Queen mother (And does not look either her own nor the character's age); Winston Duke shines as M'Baku the leader of the Jabari tribe; Letitia Wright is funny and brilliant as the Black Panther's sister Shuri and seriously needs her own movie; and last but certainly not least is the best Marvel villain since Loki (and one that gives Heath Ledger's Joker a run for his money) Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. I cannot emphasize how much fun and joy the four actors above bring to the screen. Heck, I am recommending the film based on Wright's and Serkis' characters alone. They honestly save the movie.Another thing that saves the movie is excellent costume design and a real sense that they took care to absorb real African cultures into their fictional world. This is an African utopia with a glorious sense of place. The music and costumes combine to help recreate a magical kingdom that still seems somewhat grounded.The Bad: There is a moment in the film (or two) where there is an opportunity to have Winston Duke, as the leader of the Jabari tribe, usurp the crown and take the Black Panther mantle. The movie would have been wise to take this opportunity. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is dull and incompetent. Lady Jane Grey had a longer and more effective rule than this dope. Winston Duke has charisma and presence something one would hope for in a Marvel superhero. (As bad as the first two Thor movies could be they at least always got Thor right.)The antagonist Killmonger isn't that much better. He is overshadowed by Andy Serkis' bad guy, he rants like Buggin Out from Do the Right Thing and he is as an Angry Black Man trope that mostly died out in the seventies. His main beef is that Wakanda didn't use its wealth and technology to help the African diaspora particularly as it refers to the Transatlantic slave trade. In other words, he is upset they didn't invade Mali in the 15th century. Black Panther really missed an opportunity here. Wakanda is a Utopia. All Utopia's have a hidden dark side (See Dubai). Why not have a hidden underclass that Killmonger tries to save. The Mali Empire (1230 to 1670) is basically Wakanda in real life. I mean it is, after all, an absolute Monarchy with mines. It doesn't take a genius to write in an underclass for Killmonger to identify with. It would have also given the Black Panther character some depth and a reason to disagree with his traditionalist mother.The Ugly: Someone at Disney shorted these poor folks on their FX budget. It is clear that they got the B-team. You would think with all the money Disney was saving remaking both the Lion King and a superhero movie in the same film they could have spared a few bucks.In Conclusion: Remember how underwhelming the third act was in the Original Iron Man. Remember how we ignored that because the film was so good. Black Panther is the now the eighteenth Marvel movie yet are we still treated to the same lame showdown and battle in a field. While it is no Blade, Black Panther is a treat of music and costumes and some breakout performances. Come for the Panther but stay for the Serkis.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

(Though really their most impressive feat is containing a rhinoceros in a rickety wood rail fence.)° Powerful female warriors are all tall, thin, striking, and beautifully dressed.° Bullets bounce off magic unitards. (Of course we've known this since the first Superman comics were printed. Well, I guess I didn't know it quite that far back, since that was before I was born back in the Middle Ages.)I understand why it was popular: the social shift, whose importance I don't dispute. But otherwise I saw little to recommend it; that social shift deserves better -- deserves real characters and drama, not poor comics. At least a third of the movie is spent in fights (seemed like more ... they felt interminable), which drew far more on CGI than on choreography. The plot is shallow and uninventive. Yes, few things in art are truly new, but this hardly has any new slants. I look at the long list of quotes from the movie on IMDb and don't see a single one that I'd call interesting.Stereotypes abound (see above) -- I've probably forgotten some in the days since I saw it. Vibranium bears an eerie resemblance to the magic lozenge that W S Gilbert wanted to use as a plot device and which his equally famous collaborator rejected. I found it insulting that Wakandans' success was basically credited to an accident of place rather than to their skills and ingenuity.In stories *about* the movie, much is made of African tribes, African history. I did not sense much of that in the actual movie though. Mostly lots of fights and individual posturing. Very little sense of any community. To the extent that tribal customs and dress were represented, they were so subsumed to the action as to be no more than background, and obscured background at that.Oh, Africa? AFAICT, not a single frame was shot in Africa. Studio work was all done in or near Atlanta GA. The ""British museum"" scene was shot in the High Museum in Atlanta, and the ""Oakland"" basketball court was in Atlanta. They went to the expense and logistics of spending a lot of time filming in South Korea -- scenes which were almost entirely fights. The dramatic waterfall, scene of fights that seem to go on forever, is in Argentina. Africa is represented by three continents, but Africa is not one of them.The soundtrack is resolutely late Romantic European style, with a few splashes of late 20th century American popular and general movie-score music. If there's anything in it that sounds African, I don't recall it, and don't hear it in the soundtrack sampler on IMDb. Isle of Dogs has more that sounds African. (The soundtrack sampler seems to consist only of the parts by Ludwig Göransson, and there are other soundtrack credits, so perhaps some are more apt. I do hear a bit of kalimba in one of the Göransson samples ... but the string orchestra accompaniment wipes out the African effect.)OK, it was a superhero movie. I don't watch those -- this was my first ever -- so I didn't really expect much. It lived up to my low expectations but did not exceed them. I don't doubt that (as widely reviewed) it's better than all the other superhero movies, but that's a low hurdle in my book. I recognize that the black cast is an important innovation in this genre and understand why that excited many people, but the genre lags movies in general. I won't say I was bored during it, but in looking back, I'd rather I had spent my time watching something else.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I must say I am very impressed. Marvel really crafted an interesting world in Black Panther full of fascinating characters.The best aspect of the film is easily the world building. Black Panther crafted the Wakanda world with such detail it was breath taking. The movie really went above and beyond shaping a unique and engaging culture for their world scape. Acting wise the movie was packed to the brim with talent. There really wasn't a bad performance in the movie. I particularly enjoyed Danai Gurira who was bad ass as always. The acting was only enhanced by the fact the characters were all well written. Both Killmonger and Klaw were interesting and engaging villains in their own way. Killmonger in particular was a standout in the Marvel Universe for an interesting villain. It was also great to see Andy Serkis in person for a change. Animation wise the movie was gorgeous. There was a lot of pure eye candy in this film. On top of that the choreography for the fight scenes was outstanding. The final large all out battle was particularly satisfying. who doesn't love seeing someone riding rhino into battle?Whoever made the soundtrack also did a great job. Sound was a big part of this movie and directly tied into a lot of scenes. The music really helped to immerse you into the Black Panther World.I did feel the movie was a bit uneven though. The movie had a very strong opening and ending, but the middle was a bit weak. You could easily predict what was going to happen mid-way through the movie. That didn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie, but I would have preferred to see a tighter script.Overall this is one of the most original and interesting Marvel movies to date. Despite its minor flaws it was a great ride from start to finish. A 8.25 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is beautiful. I'm a Marvel fan, so I definitely have a greater appreciation of this film than someone who isn't, but I went with my friend who's never seen an action or superhero movie in her life and she really enjoyed it too. The acting is great; the villain is truly a sympathetic antagonist. His motives are clear. The film has quite a few unexpected twists that keep surprising you; there's enough comedy and a ton of color to make it fun. The protagonists are exceptional - you love them and feel them. The visuals are spectacular! The film is based in a hidden country that comes to life on screen. You can believe it's real; you want to believe it's real. The creators of this film have created an entire new culture with such depth, showing off its tradition and color in so many different ways. 
At the same time, it's not too surreal (except for the nearly-magical and incredibly diverse Vibranium technology, which is kind of the whole point). A good part of the movie takes place in modern urban locales, adding a whole different vibe. The action is fantastic. Different characters have their own style, strengths, and weaknesses. Every movement made sense.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Despite its critical and commercial success, the movie falls short in delivering a compelling story and fulfilling its potential.Firstly, the plot is predictable and lacks nuance. The conflict between T'Challa and Killmonger is reduced to a simplistic battle of good versus evil, with little exploration of the complex political and cultural issues at play.Additionally, the characters are underdeveloped and lack depth. T'Challa, while visually stunning, is a bland and uninteresting protagonist. Supporting characters, such as Nakia and Okoye, are reduced to stereotypical roles and lack agency.The film also fails to fully utilize its predominantly black cast, relying instead on stereotypes and cliches. While the movie may have been marketed as a celebration of black culture and identity, it falls short in truly challenging and subverting Hollywood norms.Finally, the film's action sequences are underwhelming and uninspired, relying too heavily on CGI rather than practical effects. The lack of originality in the action scenes detracts from the overall experience.Overall, Black Panther is a disappointment and fails to live up to the hype.

I usually only would go to the trouble of writing a review when I think something is bad and I want to vent. I think there are many people who are like me so perhaps that's the reason why I'm seeing so many poor reviews here. I'm writing this now because I feel like I just have to put this thought out there because there is user behavior bias to the review system, and people should be aware. I scrolled through some of the poor reviews and found that many of them think the movie is too flat or that the actors are not good. I mean, this is a Marvel movie, so don't go expecting the Titanic. If you like this line of story, you'll like it, if not, then don't watch it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Shuri, his sister is a genius teen who still dresses and acts like a teenager. Eric (Killmonger) Stevens is a villain who we can empathize with while rooting for his demise. Nakia, T'Challa's Ex, shows that a fierce warrior can be compassionate and socially responsible. Too many great characters with great potential to say how many will spawn other efforts.
Costuming and sets are world class but the story is truly compelling for a Marvel based hero.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

They bring a new component into the universe with Wakanda.
The amount of effort bringing Wakanda and it's culture and people to life is remarkable. Also the cast was very well chosen, from smaller to bigger roles.
The CGI and action was great for the major parts even though some scenes seem to be lacking the fine tuning, for example some spacecrafts looked a bit out of place or some fighting scenes looked a bit surreal. But it's not too bad, especially having the bigger picture in mind.
The plot made sense, as far as anything makes sense in the Marvel Universe. Yet you know it's more to introduce the 'Black Panther' and his history in the Universe and a standalone movie would've been better for dramaturgical purposes.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie was great from my point of view(great flashy scenes to increase my dopamine level from a primate point of view, some new cinematic filming, cool characters that caried themselves around just fine), but some things we're just a little wrong like poetic fighting, lack of acting etc.

Coogler gives us a great superhero film, that's much more dramatic than previous MCU fare but also has lots of heart and a beautiful script to help it stand out. Some fans may find it a little standard, but you need to look past the surface. (as with all films) The Visuals for the film are very much CGI and it never looks to real on screen (much like Spider-Man) but if you can get past that you'll find there is enough sleak style to make the film stand out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's definitely not your typical Marvel movie. I usually spend some time playing games on my phone during superhero movies, but not this one. I liked that it was different, no stupid jokes, endless fights and similar. Think it's rather harsh to give it a 1, definitely not the worst movie of my life.
It's a movie about a different culture, with a different belief system, so of course it didn't meet everyone's expectations. I love that the fight between the good and the bad isn't that polarizing, and that it's not about who has more wealth and power. I love that it has strong female characters (that's what I expected to get from Wonder Woman, not the crap that we were served). I really hope that it will inspire some girls to follow their dreams, to be fearless, to be engineers... I love the visuals, the references to African culture. Love the soundtrack.
Try to watch it without any expectations, and you'll enjoy it.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It made over 1 billion dollars at the box office, had the highest rotten tomato score of any MCU movie and was nominated for Best Picture. With all those accolades there then came a wave of haters. People on the internet combed over this movie and nitpicked it to pieces. The CGI wasn't good, the ending felt rushed, this character talked too much all sorts of little details.Second, in 2020 lead actor Chadwick Boseman tragically passed away at the age of 44. Boseman had been diagnosed with cancer but had kept that information private. Looking back on his career with that knowledge, it is clear that Chadwick knew that he didn't have much time and wanted to make as big an impact with the time that he had. Black Panther is an excellent addition to his filmography of characters, right there with Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall.With those two things out of the way, how is the movie itself? It is pretty darn good. I love Ryan Coogler's directing, the man made ""Creed"", he will have my loyalty always for that. It is interesting that the CGI is often a point of criticism from people. Yes, it does fall a little flat towards the end. But, so much of this movie is so beautiful, the land of Wakanda is unlike anything seen up to this point. We have seen the lands of Pandora, Deep Space and Atlantis but Wakanda is such a distinct and other worldly I want to live there.The character of Black Panther is an interesting one. What does Clark Kent do when he is not Superman? He's a reporter. Boring. What does Bruce Wayne do? Billionaire businessman. Less Boring. Black Panther is the KING of Wakanda. He declares his kingdom by being able to beat any challenger in armed combat. That is SO COOL.As much as I love Chadwick in the lead role, I'm sorry the show was stolen by Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. Hands down the MCU's best villain, best character and arguably one of the best comic book villains of all time. The back and forth between him and Boseman is what make this movie a must see.Yes, the movie doesn't helm the best action or have any of the funniest jokes, but that is not this movie's strength. It is in the characters, in the conflict and in the philosophies. A must see and a must own for any MCU fan.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story is set up his story very well for future installments and it was nice seeing a film with a majority Black cast. There is an overwhelming amount of movies where the hero is white and its nice to see something different for a change. Killmonger played my Michael B Jordan is a villian i have been waiting to see in the mcu. I was even rooting for the him at times through out the movie. One thing about Black Panther is he set himself apart from other Superheros. Most Superheros work alone but Black Panther was a team player, he wasnt yhe know it all, and just because he was the one in charge he was open to the opinion of his warriors who were women. The women were submissive but strong, smart and ideal. I thought that was awesome.Black Panther is action packed with a very powerful message. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because they did not like it has a majority Black Cast and did better than most Marvel movies. MCU movies like the first Iron Man is waaaaaay over rated. Black Panther runs circles around the majority of marvel movies. The cast starred the best actors and actresses in hollywood. Watch this movie with an open mind. It tells a story about how a lot Black people feel in general. When i went to see this movie people of all races were clapping and enjoying the film. Everyone loved it. Dont listen to the haters and see it for yourself","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Every character was uniquely memorable, which is more than can be said for a lot superhero movies. They are all fantastic additions to the Marvel movie universe. Marvel triumphs with BLACK PANTHER, which beautifully blends elements from African and African-American culture into all the ingredients that make an amazing action film: a noble hero who has as much to prove to himself as others, a villian who is as charismatic as he is evil, and an alluring, magical setting complete with out-of-this-world technology. Plus, the movie has an awesome soundtrack and score, both of which I now listen to on my own time. I believed bad reviews to be accurate, until I actually went to see the movie and judge it for myself. I sat in the theater, completely engaged, waiting for the movie to get bad. However, it never did, and it kept me hooked til the last scene. I will watch it a thousand more times and still have my eyes glued to the screen.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The stars of this movie are all very attractive but the quality of the acting isn't up to par. Even an academy award winner N'yongo couldn't connect with her co-stars
The characters lacked depth and there was no chemistry between any of them. Even between the King and his mother, and the King and Nakia. The fight scene's script between Killmonger and T'Challa when the former challenged him for the throne, was taken from Troy's fight scenes between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Achilles. The movie is visually breathtaking but they could've done better with the script and storyline.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed this escape from reality and the homage to so many movies and cultural icons Steven Spielberg has managed to cram into this game within a game movie.
A few weeks ago I reviewed another virtual reality movie a (rom com) Game Night , which I really loathed and thought absolute crap so I was a little sceptical about Ready Player One.
Last Sunday we visited our neighbours very switched on and clever Grandson Callum for his 9th birthday celebration and he was engrossed in his new video game with head set in place and I could see it had captured his imagination and I spotted his Avatar or virtual reality identity in full destroyer battle mode.
I wish now I'd taken up his invitation to join in the game as I've never played a video game but there's always next time.
This experience unknowingly prepared me for this movie in which has cleverly combined real actors , who live in a bleak futuristic 2045 in dismal residential towers called ""The Stacks"".
The occupants of this dark and shattered world escape to the Oasis a virtual realty world where fantasy is the aim and adventure is the game.
Some have said this may be Spielberg 's greatest movie I'm not sure about that sweeping statement but it's up there with ET and Close Encounters.
A terrific youthful cast headed by Tye Sheridan as Parzival, our hero and Olivia Cooke as his capable side kick and romantic interest are the young game players but I was also impressed by the villain Australia 's Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento and Mark Rylance as Anorak and the inventor of the Oasis James Halliday.
Also loved the music and the fact that what could seem a bleak future Spielberg has transformed into a spectacular colourful world where the human element is most the important component.
It's more about friendship , loyalty and caring for your fellow humans and reality really wins out in the end.
A High Five ! and I'll add 4 to score this movie a 9.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film does a marvellous job bringing to life the fictional world of Wakandla, having put thought into every little detail and fans of the 'Black Panther' series of comics (which I am) will be thrilled; in ways of set work and art direction, I'll say this is Marvel's golden achievement. Casting is great as well with Chadwick Boseman returning to the screen as the titular 'Black Panther' or King T'Challa, after first being introduced in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War', Chadwick was born to play this part, bringing heart to his character, facing a constant inner battle between his loyalties to his kingdom and his moral obligations to an outside world less fortunate. Side characters do a great job too, especially Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The sibling chemistry between these two characters are off the chart and is an actual true highlight of this film, you completely buy them as brother and sister, constantly on each other's cases, but: should anyone else dare... Both the main antagonists in this film do a great job as well, and that was quite refreshing too, as one place Marvel often has fallen short was in creating memorable villains. Michael B. Jordan stars as Erik Killmonger and Andy Serkis (for once not just appearing as a CGI character) as Ulysses Klaue; Jordan plays his character more straight, assassin like, but sells it well, creating sympathy and even some understanding for what we know is a truly evil character, Serkis takes a more comedic approach, basically playing the character as a fat South African who had one too many beers; both characters are completely different and sets two different tones for the film that actually makes the pacing work brilliantly as we switch over from the second to third act. Lastly I just want to make mention of the action as, after all, that is still why many people see these films: the action sequences in this film is great, but actually has it's best moments in the one-on-one battles when T'Challa has to defend his crown in tribal rituals. The fights are intense and beautifully choreographed. Really, there is nothing I can truly fault 'Black Panther' on; even somebody like me, who will openly admit that I have started finding the ever growing super hero genre to have become somewhat trying, will admit that this is about as fresh a film that has come from this genre since the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and it is most certainly a film I will happily recommend you go see on the big screen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Besides, there was enough reference to Nigeria in this movie, so here we are! I saw the most hyped movie of this time, Black Panther, and I loved it! There is actually nothing to hate in this movie! I am not really a fan of science fiction and fantasy movies, I mean, I love the X-Men franchise, but that does not mean that I jump to the cinema as soon as they release a new movie every week.But Black Panther is different! It is obvious that these people sat down and did their homework well. I mean, I did not find any fault with the movie! And that is the best thing about the movie. It was like the creators of the movie were ready for any movie critic; they left no stone unturned. Beautiful working storyline, amazing location (and if it was a studio work, the special effects team deserve an Oscar), lovely, lovely costumes! (I mean, Lupita actually wore Ankara!), the soundtrack too cannot be compared to another, especially during the fighting scenes. And they did not use the same score for two fights. One score, one fight. (Yes I pay so much attention to details) I mean, Marvel outdid themselves in this one!This is a good place to stop right? Before I will start sounding like a sell out. But there is no movie without characters right? We have to talk about them! TChalla, the king of Wakanda and the Black Panther himself brought his A game to this one! He commanded so much screen presence that I just wanted to see him in all scenes. That said. Michael Jordan is one very sexy villain I have not seen in a very long time! I mean, the first time he appeared on screen, he was stealing. But every girl at the cinema screamed when he appeared. Yes! I heard them. Other cast members are Lupita as Nakia, the object of the king's affection, Angela Basset as Queen Mother Ramonda, Forrest Whittaker as the king's spy. But the character that brought life to Wakanda is bald headed Okoye, the king's general. Played by new comer Danai Gurira. Girl's got some badass moves when fighting!Yes! Black Panther is the most hyped movie of this time; but the movie is worth all the hype. It has something for everybody - scifi, drama, African heritage, basketball, comedy, ceremonies, action, gun fight, etc. But a little lacking in the romance department. I did not mind a bit though...If you have not watched it, please go and watch it. Not for anything; just to feel among we cool kids that have watched the movie and to tell people that you have also watched what is perhaps the greatest movie in 2018.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

Through all the expectations to the all the facts after seeing the movie, it all leads to the conclusion that Marvel didn't want to make their tipycal variant of the good ordered blockbuster, but give a chance for something else, so the people could see other new members of the crew of Marvel.
Well, that ended pretty well with the high ratings and box office.
Some people find it great and awesome. Others find it worst movie of Marvel.
I have other opinion. It is good. But it is not great. To make more simple to think it:
The story and all the acting and assembling the whole pieces of the movie producing and filming is all top. But in the final, maybe even in the early too, phase of the making of the movie, seem to be mistakes, which do not blow everything up fortunately. The montage and some of the scenes, were awfully cut or placed. This kinda takes part of the enjoy of the film. And that's what is weird for the Marvel movies. They always are well planned and carefully made untill the final realease.
But this does not make any troubles, because I'm sure Marvel had that plan. And they do not find those mistakes fatal. The phase is completed, and they are ready to get back on track for perfection.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They really built up the first Marvel Black super hero a little too much as it did not really make him the hero in the movie it was more a team effort.
What was a shame the theaters were letting in kids too young to see this movie and it was definitely too violent for them.
If you want a Black super hero watch a Blade movie....Snipes is a Bad Ass.

While not everything it did work, an generous amount of it did and did so in ways I did not expect. The movie definitely has a distinct visual style to present African culture. The cinematography was on-point, delivering vibrant scenery and fully captured the beauty of Wakanda. If I had to single out something that did not work for me, was the CGI. From the badly rendered rhino's to the video-game-like third act, it just didn't connect and at times was blatantly obvious. The performances were strong all-around. Chadwick Boseman got plenty of time to shine, and I was impressed by how much screen-time others, like Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Letitia Wright and Daniel Kaluuya had. Each character had an important role to play, and they did those roles proper justice in my opinion. A pleasant surprise was Martin Freeman as the unassuming CIA Agent Everett Ross. His role was a lot larger than I thought, and his attitude towards superheroes and the Wakandans built a fun rapport that made the story a little more dynamic. Now the villains. I will say this now, Marvel has probably created one of their most fun and most nuanced villain in a while. Andy Serkis's motion capture free Ulysses Klaue was just plain fun to watch as he brought a charming flair rarely seen in other antagonists. Michael B. Jordan was the one I was skeptical about at first, as the trailers did not properly set him up. His moral views and goals where very understandable and it is rare to see a villain so desperate and so rightfully justified in his actions. Even T'Challa was a changed man at the end of it all, which further supports Killmonger's actions. Last but not least, Kendrick Lamar and his curated hit songs may not have gotten a huge spotlight, but with the occasional beats delivered by him, Vince Staples, The Weeknd and others, along with Aftican tribal numbers all but helped add another layer. ""Black Panther"" bucked usual superhero conventions with its cultural insight, villains, atmosphere and strongly-written characters while also remaining very much grounded in the MCU.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is also one of the only movies I have ever seen that introduces the audience to a new culture that feels like I could actually described afterwards. The soundtrack is amazing and really helps the transitions feel smooth and adds to the action sequences.However this movie has a pacing issue that results in it feeling like two films that were pushed together. The second half of this movie is definitely better than the first for the simple reason that Michael B. Jordan gets to shine as killmonger, one of the best villains that the series has had so far. The casting in this movie is brilliant with the interactions between Boseman and Jordan towards the end being what is most memorable about the experience. The pacing issues cannot be overlooked however and the fight scenes were a little disappointing given Coogler's previous work on ""Creed"" A very enjoyable film overall and a welcome addition to the MCU.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After the death of his father, T'Challa is to be named king but soon he'll find out that a well-hidden secret from the past will force its way into the present to make his job much harder than imagined.It's one of those movies which has a great idea, that of an advanced civilization living hidden in the present world, and builds its story based on it. Speaking of the story, it's quite good from most points of view, managing to avoid linearity and bring something out of the obvious every now and then. It has its flaws though, I must admit, especially when it comes to the finale which could have been treated better, but it is good enough to keep the action together. The characters portrayed are well thought, a bit underdeveloped unfortunately, but still likeable and worthy of the story.The movie is based on action, so you can expect plenty of it, regardless of time. It is by far the most important part of the film, all the amazing fighting scenes, whether speaking of 1v1 or large scale, contribute decisively to the outcome of the film, especially entertaining-wise. You also get a bit of drama from time to time and some emotion, but the action remains dominant.To help build this amazing world, the producers used a couple of very impressive visual effects. It's easy to see that they've put quite a lot of effort into this department, making sure that everything looks as good as it can be. You simply have to give them credit for this one. Another aspect which is worth mentioning is the soundtrack, very well made according to the atmosphere of the movie, adding more suspense each time it comes into play.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had a good story, good characters, great atmosphere with great music and some amazing special effects. If the story had received a bit more polish and the characters would have been a bit more complex, we would have been talking about a truly great film. Not that it isn't great as it is, but you're left with the feeling that it could have been made a bit better.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ryan Coogler's masterful superhero drama is unlike any other, featuring outstanding acting, breathtaking art direction, fascinating royal intrigue, memorable action sequences, and surprising depth. It's that depth -- of character, of storyline, of relevancy -- that makes Black Panther shine, as Boseman's T'Challa takes the mantle of king with enormous uncertainty about whether to share Wakanda's resources with the world. With the exception of his second-in-command W'Kabi (Kaluuya), T'Challa surrounds himself with an inner circle of influential women: Okoye, Nakia, his mother (Bassett), and his genius younger sister, scientist/tech inventor Shuri (Letitia Wright). Each of them contributes much to the story, with Gurira's spear-wielding Okoye the movie's clear scene-stealer, Wright the clever comic relief, and Nyong'o offering a wee bit of romance. Even the central villain, as played by frequent Coogler collaborator Jordan, is well-rounded and humanized, with the actor doing great work opposite the equally nuanced Boseman.There's so much to appreciate in Black Panther, from its pulsing score, which features a soundtrack overseen by award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar, to the mesmerizing cinematography courtesy of DP Rachel Morrison, gorgeous tribal costumes, and vibrant production design. There's not as much laugh-aloud banter as viewers may have come to expect from Marvel movies, but the beats of humor that are here, usually thanks to plucky Shuri or mountain-tribe leader M'Baku (Winston Duke), are extra funny. Ultimately the film's success comes down to the thoughtful, compelling storytelling from director Coogler and writer Joe Robert Cole, as interpreted by a terrific cast of actors. This isn't just another highly entertaining but formulaic superhero story; it's also poignant and powerful and earns its place toward the top of Marvel's films. (Be sure to watch all the way through the credits for a couple of extra tidbits!)","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The characters, world and culture of wakanda is what makes this movie special, you see a culture that you rarely ever see with superheroes and to see how deeply that culture is ingrained into the heart of the black panther makes this much more interesting than other superheroes from marvel. The visual effects as always from marvel are stunning and the villain in my opinion is one of the best marvel had ever produced, and his motivations are very human, to the point where you can see his side as well as the heroes and in my opinion that moral dilemma creates the best villains. Black Panther is one of the finer superhero movies out there.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Is it worth all the praise? Yes, yes it is! This is an absolutely fun popcorn film with tons and tons of depth.What's the story? After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.Okay, let's acknowledge the elephant in the room first, since I just wanna get it over with: the CGI isn't the best. Although Wakanda looks absolutely beautiful, the opening scene had very well-crafted CGI, and the action is really exciting, there are times where the CGI could look absolutely STUPID, like during the scene where T'Challa and Killmonger were fighting. The people standing up on the mountain was done in such a horrible way it's laughable at how fake it is. Also, near the end where T'Challa and Killmonger were once again fighting but this time with some electric trains, that also looked very laughable and stupid. Okay, with that aside, the best aspect of the film is the story. Not the action, DEFINITELY not the effects, but the story. It's a movie that is aware of other countries, which is a great twist, not just for Marvel, but for movies in general. I know Marvel likes to put their primary focus on the story, which is a smooth move, but in this film it especially works because we need to see the nation of Wakanda and to sympathize what it's going through. It's also kind of like James Bond where they go to different countries, like Nigeria and South Korea. Also, although Wakanda isn't a real country, the movie develops and forms it to make it feel like it's real. They explain the nationality, the quality of life, the looks, and the culture of this fictional nation. It's very cool on how well-setup it is, and I wish more movies could do that. One last thing I'd like to mention is that the acting and characters are very well done, and while it does focus on a male superhero, it gives equal power to the female characters as well, and without them, the Black Panther is pretty much screwed.In conclusion, Black Panther is a diverse and refreshing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that's good for both Marvel fans and movie fans in general. Of course if you like Black Panther and Marvel, you'll love this film. Also, ignore the people who say it's a bad movie, because those people don't know what they're messing with.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Less of a review, here are some random thoughts which I had while watching this movie which is only notable for being the first all-black production from the current iteration of Marvel Studios.This film has an overflowing abundance of tell-don't-show exposition, which breaks the #1 rule of filmmaking: Show-don't-tell. For at least the first 30 minutes I had no idea what motivates the main character, what the previous king was like, what their relationship was like, or why I should care about anyone on screen except for their being the main characters in a Marvel movie.The main character's first self-directed act of the film was to jump into the middle of the jungle, murder a bunch of conscripted child soldiers (!!!), and knowingly ruin an undercover investigation into human trafficking (I think..maybe? It's not clear). He did this so that he could invite his girlfriend to a party the next day (???). I actually laughed out loud--for the only time in the film--when he said this. Is this man a psychopath?The film is introducing a completely new nation--apparently the most advanced on the planet--and all that the audience is shown of it is 2 or 3 largely empty rooms. They really brought the Imagineers to bear in creating this new world, didn't they? This grand nation of Wakanda feels extremely small and unimportant.The most advanced nation on Earth--with many terrible weapons of mass destruction on hand--chooses its leaders by seeing who can beat the crap out of each other the hardest? What the hell?!?! Actually.. that seems about standard by Marvel logic.The main character is told (not shown) that he will have a difficult time as king because he has a kind heart. At this point in the film his kindest action seems to have been in killing child soldiers.. His first morally conflicted kind act does not seem to happen until over an hour into the runtime and it has no ill effects whatsoever--in fact, it helps him! Great follow-up on that plot point, ey?The entire first hour of the film is wasted time and does not effectively develop any of the characters to a point which other films would manage to accomplish in 10 minutes. They run around furiously, accomplishing nothing. I did not feel that I knew any of the main characters any better at the end of the film than I did at the beginning, except for perhaps the villian--he had a bit of development.The visual effects would look right at home in a PlayStation 2 video game cutscene. Very unimpressive, very muddy, poor color contrast.. honestly, a mess.This movie was probably supposed to release before Captain America: Civil War, I'm guessing? Because at least then I would have had some idea of what was going on with this random panther man who showed up out of nowhere. Well... that's 2 incredibly boring movies that this guy is in, anyway.This film has some of the most eye-roll inducing and unfunny Marvel-style humor break-ins that I have yet seen. Even a bad film can be somewhat enjoyable if it takes itself seriously. But we can't do that in the Marvel universe, not ever. ""Come on guys, are you done with the serious faces?"" Wacky! Wacky!I was watching all-black superhero movies when I was 8 years old, and they were a lot more fun. Can I get some love for The Meteor Man? Maybe we could follow it up with a Static Shock marathon? Good times!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I don't know if I would have enjoyed it more if I knew more of the backstory before hand.There was no real character development, short of the bad guy, and even then it's just a basic back story to explain why he's bad.

The music was also fine. Not brilliant, but definitely above average.However.The story was unimaginative, illogical and plain boring. The pacing was terrible and the things that were supposed to be exciting were predictable and lame.
The acting was bad and the characters were ridiculous. Most of the time the movie felt like a school play. Seriously. I think most actors are probably quite good actors, but the writing (and possibly also the directing) was horrible so they came off like complete amateurs.Overall the movie was nice to look at but completely uninteresting.
If you are 10 years old or if you are interested in costume design this might be a movie for you. Otherwise the only reason for watching the movie is if you just HAVE to see all Marvel movies.

I don't reallly care for these Superhero Movies as they depend on action CGI rather then a plot.
I did notice that other reviewers are calling this a ""cultural event""..""most significant movie ever made""...""the greatest movie ever""...REALLY?
First, this is a fantasy film. Wakanda is a fictional place...it does not exist. There were never any Space Kings or Space Queens...this is not the first Black Superhero Movie...and definitely not the best. Previous Black Superheroes..include Storm from the X-men...Blade (really good movie)..and what about Michonne from the Walking Dead? Any girl that weighs less then 100 pounds and can swing a Katana like it was a feather must have superhero powers. I would only recommend this for children and if they were bored and had nothing else to do.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The story line took too long to develop, the villain was lame and I mean seriously lame but the soundtrack was really good, didn't live up to the hype but it was still amazing. I must say the final scene where Kill-monger stats talking about slavery was in my eyes over dramatised and over looked today's problems. I also thought that the fight scenes were underwhelming considering that it's black panther. I was also really lost in when they started calling Kill-monger kill-monger as apposed to his characters name (which I can't remember), it didn't make sense to me and it was very forced, I feel they would have benefited more if there was no alias name. Unfortunately when I left the cinema I had a sour taste in my mouth, not because it was a bad movie but because it didn't live up to the huge hype surrounding it's release.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

Black panther was one of the new ones that i was looking forward to but i tell you, what disappointment it turned out to be.Without spoilers, let me tell you, there is absolutely nothing that will make you stun or surprised or praise anything that you have not already watched in the trailer. Actually the trailer of this movie had almost all the cool scenes and thats it.NO action... just a mess all around. No integrity what so ever.. a 100% predictable movie from the first 5 mins. an over stretch of a first 2 mins of movie. THIS IS THE ONLY SUPER HERO MOVIE THAT I DID NOT EVEN WAITED TO SEE THE END OF CREDIT SCENES... !! Imagine how it boggled my brain... I had to come home and see Captain America - Civil War all again. Just to keep the Black Panther in saw in civil war, to keep that as his memory in my head and not this crappy s**t i saw ... There is something really wrong with the ratings now a days. I am surprised how such junk movies are being hyped till maximum.. I seriously have lost all faith on Critics and ratings... That is now all a business and game.. In last few years, soo many good movies have been dumped by critics and so many crappy movies have been hyped up the roof...

Even people with no acting skills could do better, just so poorly researched. Busan felt like a copy paste CGI. I'm not sure what's the Panther's purpose? I felt no connection to any characters whatsoever. Critics should be ashamed of themselves calling this a masterpiece. Probably they felt pressured to dish out a nice review, if not, the backlash from black communities would be huge and they would be labeled racists? It's just a bad movie, maybe worst by Marvel. I felt robbed after watching and my eyes are still sore. If you want a real BLACK superhero, then watch my all time favorite BLADE.

All the clamor about one of the best Marvel films fails to meet objective standards. But money talks, very loudly! BP had a production budget of $200M and a marketing budget of $150M. It's like spending a few million for a Formula One racing car but getting a midsize Toyota. Not to say it's a bad film, but it could be so much better on so many fronts. I can understand Oscar nominations for special effects, visual effects and makeup/costumes. All deserved. Maybe even cinematography.But consider several things: acting is very average, script is a bit on the weak side, directing is average. It's a very expensivemaybe abive average superhero flick. But money speaks and you can market a film. If you show it in every theatre and bring it to attention of Academy members, you win. For example, think about the success of McDonald's: mediocre food but outstanding marketing and presence. So everyone wants a below average burger. In today's world, sometimes we fail to think for ourselves.The cultural impact on black America is immense, but that doesn't mean it's outstanding. It's interesting as it creates a whole new world in Wakanda. Which is why some critics rate it highly. Much like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, it follows a spectacular imagination. And think of some films that did that and failed overall: The Last Airbender, has been the worst. But that's comparison with LOTR ends. The acting, script and directing in LOTR series was much better. I rate BP only a 4 but I could give it a 5, 6 or maybe a 6.5 at its highest. But given all the overly optimistic voting, I'm downgrading it.BP' cast led by Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa and Michael Jordan as Erik really wasn't strong except the female roles of Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira were stronger, despite average scripts. It's solid entertainment but not Marvel's best. By comparison of superhero films of the same period, compare Wonder Woman. It's superior in many ways except David Thewlis as Morgan/Ares or the supervillain. You gotta be kidding, right? Somewhat not convincing. Patty Jenkins did a better job at directing than Ryan Coogler. But who's paying attention?","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Absolutely nothing original about the characters and the overplayed theme of everyone deserves punishment because my ancestors were slaves. With the whole Marvel story line and character base to play with couldn't the director come up with something more original than that. I watched this as it was included in the 'list of movies to watch prior to Infinity War' but honestly.......don't waste your time. It brings absolutely nothing to the MCU and there is nothing missed by not seeing it. People always talk about removing movies from a series canon, well I strongly suggest this is put forward for that privilege. Save your time and money on this cliched pile of junk.

Could this be my reason for walking out ..well maybe, after all nobody likes noisy people around them whether or large or small whilst trying to pay attention to something, but I can certainly say it wasn't my only reason for walking out. Maybe teenagers are the target audience, or adults gripping to childhood.This among other Marvel and DC releases was as I suspected it would be; An over-animated mess without much sense other than to showboat over-priced CGI, over-done sound effects and over-compensated actors. The only decent aspect in all of this was the incredible wide angle scenic shots that could only look better if I were not to be in a cinema, but in nature properly being in these landscapes myself.There are some neat ideas in the film, but if they're only made tangible by the before-mentioned budget, then this indicates a lack of imagination in viewers since a lot of these ideas like magnetic railways could be made far more common place if only we put our money to better use rather than it going to an over-inflated box office for people to sit in a cinema grazing on fat, salt and sugar to take their mind away from the job and bills they hate so much. This film, not unlike 90% of others gives us a glimpse of what is possible by working together, not without question, but with care & dignity ..unlike the current modalities that have such a grapple hold on our Earth at the moment.","17 out of 41 found this helpful.

I've seen them all and I can appreciate how the studio chose to present its stories and characters. Nothing too ambitious nor too stupid. Well design entertainment. Black Panther however is not like that.Production value in Marvel movies is there to overshadow possible drawbacks. Panther is sloppy in the production and since there are many drawbacks this movie is simply put - boring. CGI is rather good but when it's bad - it's very bad. It looks like several director assistants put this movie together. Few did very good job - the rest not so much. The result makes me want to compare this movie with the last DC... That's how bad it is. Story is yet another thing that made me scratch my head. This was pretty much a Marvel version of Amistad. Seems like yesterday, I know but why to put this theme in the movie? They wanted to compete for Oscars or something? Basically the story goes like this: Black folks are oppressed all around the world and there's secret, super advanced and resources-rich country in the middle of the poorest continent but they do nothing about the evil in the world. That's not even half of what is wrong with the story but you get the picture. Acting is something you never look too closely in Marvel movies simply because there's not much time for it. Slow moments are rather few and are well positioned in the story and well directed. Not here. Main character apart from crying 10 times does little to symphonized with him. Black Panther and his friends are so dull and uninteresting that I much more liked two main villains and theirs motivations. Seriously. And dialogues? Only the bad guys made sense here. ""Good guys"" talk and talk nonsense for hours. Not to give you some perspective or background but to save money on CGI (I guess). I pay no attention to details like music in Marvel movies. But here you cannot miss this. Soundtrack contains everything from typical rap, through typical African music to classical drama-like music. This would normally be good BUT. The way this music is implemented in the scenes would make you think ""wait, what?!?"". I rarely watch movie where soundtrack is making it worse not better. The list of what's wrong goes on...This is a bad movie, bad Marvel movie, and poor overall production.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

I love marvel super hero movies, this was a B-movie at best, like something swept up from the cutting room floor and thrown out the door. Under any other circumstance this movie would never be released, it is completely sub-par for marvel's current high standards. Representations of Africa and Africans were childish, cartoonish and patronising, and reminded me of 1920s safari brochures or victorian era stereotype propaganda, just a farce. A missed opportunity and once the real reviews start making the headlines and word of mouth spreads as to how bad the acting, story and dialogue are, it will single handedly destroy any chance of a similar film being released for the next 20 years. Just a boring movie, very poor quality for marvel and total disappointment. This will be the only time you see black panther movie so if you really feel the need to waste your money, you had better see it, because there won't be a sequel.","20 out of 51 found this helpful.

As many positives this movie featured, the one word that popped up in my head constantly was: Serviceable.Don't get me wrong: the movie's good and there's not much to point to that's bad, but stripping away the great cast, incredible world-building universe and special effects, it's the most average origin story.The star and best part of the movie, Chadwick Boseman a.k.a. The Title Character, was fantastic and stole every scene. Granted, I would've liked to see him more in his full-body superhero outfit (you'll see as much of him as the Panther as you did Batman in The Dark Knight Rises. In other words, not much.) But, thankfully, he does carry the feature with his great chemistry with the cast and charisma on screen.As mentioned, the world these characters live in and their mythos was also great to see and unbelievably believable. I knew little to nothing about this comic book's background and for them to set it up so nicely that it became realty, was very welcomed.Also really nice was that this was a self-contained story in a huge universe. Never opposed to other Marvel characters showing up, even just to say: ""Greetings!"" but it's nice this stood alone. Of course, aside from the setup, that is.Boseman's T'Challa is still mourning the loss of his father in Captain America's Civil War movie...but, then again, it's only been a week since those events. Nevertheless, he needs to be the new King of his (certainly not a ****hole) nation of Wakanda, he needs to prove himself to his people, himself and his father's spirit and bring in a criminal who's taking a break from Middle Earth, Kong Island and this very MCU. There's much more to the story, but why ruin it?The movie takes itself very seriously and that's an ENORMOUS relief from Marvel's go-to formula: 80% comedies with 20% superheroing, i.e. Spider-Man: Homecoming, Iron Man Three, both Guardian of the Galaxies and Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies relied almost exclusively on humor and so little on what I bought a ticket for. Mercifully, they kept the humor - which was sometimes funny - to a minimum here.This isn't a movie I'd rush to see again, mostly because the main plot is so average and predictable, but it's definitely recommended to see once, especially for all the positives mentioned above. ***Final thoughts: As a favor and quasi-birthday gift to my friend, I agreed to stay and see the two post-credit scenes that I usually hate to waste my time waiting for. No spoiler to the content, but a warning: these were two of the lamest I've seen. The first is something we already knew was coming and the second is something we already knew about. There were no surprises and, AS ALWAYS, they were completely avoidable. They're always available online to see so you don't have to spend an extra 20 minutes in the theatre to see 3 seconds of blah.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

So when I saw 'Black Panther' had been nominated I thought it must be a truly incredible film and was looking forward to seeing it. What I got instead was a painfully boring, unoriginal and uninspired movie that shouldn't be anywhere near a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.I've seen some boring superhero movies in my day but this would be near the top. Twice I had to pause the movie and have a nap because every time I would try to watch it would put me to sleep. There wasn't one character I felt any connection to or interest in. The hero was bland and the villain was equally so.I can only think this nomination refers back to the #Oscarsowhite controversy of a few years back and the Academy's determination to rectify that. It's a shame because there are some truly great and worthy films of 2018 that highly deserved a nomination in 'Black Panther's place. There are very few redeeming qualities about this film. I would not recommend giving up your time or hard earned on it.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

This could have been such a great and monumental movie. It's like the mistakes that were apparent were deliberate or the studio told the production team, half way through the making of it to get it done by next week.The acting, oh the acting, so poor on so many levels, the story line is weak, the CGI poorly executed, the only reason I didn't walk out after 30 minutes was because my 12 year old daughter had been desperate to see it.I literally didn't care about any of the characters meeting a sticky end. They could have nuked wakanda for all I cared. There just wasn't enough to bring you into the film. Plus it was full of political over tones and was clearly trying to make a statement. Films like avatar fall into the political category to a certain degree, but they also carry themselves if you strip away the politics.This movie does not carry itself on any levels.This could have been a fantastic film, and when you look at the caliber of cast, and the hype, it should have been. But no. Please don't waste your time.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Not based on the fact that people tend to rate this movie based on the politics and ethnic racial war (which should never, ever interfere with any movie in general), but for what the movie really offers to it's fans. There are better movies out there that are rated way worse than this one. If you objectively look at this movie, you can see that is not worth more than a 6.5. Maybe if you are a MARVEL fan a 7. That's because the movie was lacking in action. The movie wasn't too much about the Black Panther but the tech that he had. The character didn't had the space to built itself which is such a shame considering the fact that that was what the movie was all about!! It would have been awesome to see more action from the panther, to have scenes where you can see all those amazing skills that he posses..the movie had the space to make this hero look way cooler that it did.

All while the music director only knew how to play African drum beats from a PBS special. As with all Marvel Films, the effect were good. But...there was nothing original, nothing made this superhero anything different then what we've already seen. What gives, it had a huge budget, and could have been a great piece, but it falls short on many levels. If the cast were not colored, this would have been panned by the critics and word of mouth would let it die a quiet death. I appreciate the attempt, and still feel Black Panther is still a great character but this film just made him a ""B"" film lead character, or a good supporting character at best. The Black Panther deserves better! Also, why take some of the most attractive woman in the word and shave their heads, does that pass as good acting now? AND... How did one of the Wayans children land the bad guy lead in the film, bad hair and all!I also have a hard time hearing about all this diversity, only to have either a while cast, or a black Cast.... Kind of wish it were more of a chocolate-vanilla swirl ice cream cone... Both are good, but together, they are great.Wish I had waited and rented this film Redbox. it would have been worth it then.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

The main issues with the film in my opinion are the belowFrom the very beginning the extremely simple core plot line is obvious. Good guy becomes king, evil family member dethrones him and in the end good guy reclaims the throne. It's literally a story we've seen hundreds of times before. Add to that a run time that could have been 30mins shorter and you have a mildly boring film While introducing us to Wakanda and the culture we are told how much tradition and fellowship are what made Wakanda as great a nation as it is. However, towards the end of the film that idea is tossed to the side for plot development. There is a very specific scene where it is stated by Wakandan laws the bad guy should not be king yet all the Wakandans chose to ignore their tradition in favor of the bad guy anyways (ummmm what?). Then you have the issue of race, politics and possibly the worst villain in a marvel movie. Honestly looking at the film in it's completion there is no way anyone should logically agree with Kilmonger in any way. Without giving away spoilers let's just say all his talk of oppression, slavery and being held back due to race has nothing to do with the story we are given. In reality there is only one set of people he should want revenge on but he's simply not smart enough to realize it. In honesty you could remove all the politics/race from this movie and it would not alter it in any way. It seems like Marvel simply added a few lines here and there to appeal to the target demograhic which in this case was under 30 black males.While this film as a stand alone movie was good it simply doesn't live up to what Marvel has built. I simply do not care what happens with Wakanda or if a sequel is made and that's upsetting. Maybe when a sequel is made (you know there will be) Marvel will cut all the politics and give the fans an action packed thrill ride instead of 2+ hours of mind numbing interactions that really mean nothing as a whole","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

This movies is loaded to the brim with every trope of the genre, up to the point it feels ridiculous.
If the movie would have steered away from this leftist and PC insanity, and tried to stay faithfull to the source material it would have made a good movie.
But what it does is that it tries to be all things and all people, while pleasing none.

Too much has been made of it by SJW's claiming that if your white you inherently will give this film a bad review, people accusing me of being racist if I don't like a crap film will not force me to like it. As I have stated I like a wide variety of films starring black actors as a matter of fact lots of my favorite actors are black I could go on about Jamie Foxx's performance as Django as he was simply superb however this review is about this ""movie"" which was not superb in anyway. Everything about it was bland, generic and design to appeal to people who would rather make it a big political issue and start more animosity with white people, personally I think these politics should be kept out of it because a film should be about whether it entertains or not, back to Blade again where this film is just about the politics of you must like this or your racist this never happened with Blade he was universally loved by both Black and White people in effect this has undone a lot of the hard work films such as Blade did by ramming politics down your throat and has in effect been nothing but a racist film towards non blacks. In defense of the people actually involved with this film I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was not there intention and that all the crap with the SJW's comes from there inability to actually engage what little intelligence they have, I would also state that the Black community have also been forced into the middle of this by the SJW's because most Black people don't want to force being black as being and issue it's usually white middle class morons chucking tantrums as they obviously did not get enough cuddles when they were children. Although I did not enjoy this film at all I still wish the cast and crew the best of look and hope that in the future they produce a good film.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Nothing about it was exciting, but I said I have to give it a chance.I probably need to listen to my gut more often because this movie was a waste of time and money. I do not get why all the critics praise this movie. It just didn't click with me, like I was looking at something not important, with no real story, more like a reenacted documentary from a science and history channel.The CGI was outdated (those rhinos were the worse - if you saw the movie, you understand). The city looked so fake, even Asgard from the first Thor looked more real. The action was boring and it just did not make sense some time.Besides the good cast this movie is just boring and not relevant enough like the other MCU movies. I really do not get the hype and the critical acclaim. It feel fabricated and not organic.There was too much talking about nothing, about what is good and was is not for Wakanda to go public with that unrealistic technology jump they have from vibranium. If you have an advanced civilization build in that bubble, why do you still need to choose your next king totally undemocratic, but the old fashion way - just fight for the tittle. If you leave this plot hole out you really have no movie, because the villain will just not form. I mean they try to bring in a villain half way into the movie, and you don't know him, you do not care enough for his motives, just boring.I get what Marvel wanted to do with this movie (as I said - fabricated for the really annoying Hollywood so this and so that movements from the past years) - but just that make no good movie. This was suppose to happen shortly after the events at the UN meeting in Captain America: Civil War. I mean the king just died and everybody is just fine: no funeral, no tears, no heart-brake, just a short mention in the beginning before that fight for the title. I never felt so un-invested in a MCU movie before.Also that Wakanda Forever feels like the X-factor sign and it scares me because it feels like brainwashing of the people.","14 out of 35 found this helpful.

"1","/10","A ridiculous mess of hero villain clichés, cringy dialogue and political correctness","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4155007/?ref_=tt_urv","TheNabOwnzz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49216376/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2018","The entire concept of 'Black Panther' with a third world country that is supposedly technologically advanced is, ofcourse, utterly ridiculous. This means this movie was probably doomed to fail from the start, yet the mess it has turned out to be is just an affront to cinema in general. There are a lot of problems with this big pile of garbage, and naming all of them isn't really possible in a single review, so let us pick out the most obvious ones. The general core in a film is its story and storytelling abilities, combined with compelling characters and character development. All of these things Black Panther has failed terribly at. It is a terrible and nonsensical plot about this country in Africa being a technologically advanced nation, yet they still fight for the crown of king like a bunch of barbarians? A plot can transcend realism factors with its story, but it cannot transcend ridiculousness, which is what this movie has done. This in turn makes it empty, with no characters to care about and no story to care about, because it is such an absolutely ridiculous bunch of nonsense it isn't possible to relate to. As if it couldn't be any worse the plot is incredibly predictable. A certain person appears to die but you know he didn't. A certain person is a mysterious outsider but you know who he is already. The villain can also kill the hero but prefers first to speak a few words so someone can save him.Unfortunately even though the movie itself is terrible, it is also covered in a SJW political kind of cover. There are a lot of messages that one needs to help the entire world, and all of the women guards ( What a joke ) fighting like they have some kind of superpowers is just tiresome feministic ridiculousness once again. It is just laughable that the supposed greatest 'warrior' and general of wakanda is a woman, it makes you think about what kind of wimps the men are like there. Nonsensical feministic message once again. If the art form that is film has turned into this kind of social propaganda, there is little feature left. Bunch of nonsense to keep the feminists and social justice warriors happy is all the message is here, no morals and no psychology.The actors unfortunately also leave much to be desired. Everybody has this weird african accent that makes it look like they can barely pull a bucket out of a well yet we are supposed to believe this nation is technologically superior, just a joke. This is excluding the villain ( Michael B. Jordan ) in the film who is even worse as he talks like some idiot straight out some hood in the Bronx and combines this with his weird head uptilts and gestures and 'Bro' dialogue that is as out of character as can be if we want to take this idiot seriously. The movie did start out with a decent villain in the form of Andy Serkis, but he was unfortunately replaced halfway through by this idiot. Not to mention the weird cringy facial expressions especially the woman warrior makes all the time.We once again have cheap CGI as an excuse for nice cinematography, but it just looks bloated and ugly and not at all authentic, as it will always be. Greenscreen cannot possibly replace the seduction of natural lighting in actual beautiful environments, and it is also the reason this movie just looks ugly. The fight scenes feature terrible choreography with superhuman jumping and weird moves which you might have seen a lot in a couple of terrible videogames. It also includes a scene in which the villain and hero fight in midair, reminiscent of the absolutely terrible fight between Neo and Smith in Matrix Revolutions, but this one is just as bad. You can tell all of the fighting and the moveset is just pure CGI, there are no impressive athletic skills, just videogame jumping around nonsense. There are also a couple of scenes near the end which are stolen straight out of Return of the King and Star Wars, as if this already mindless project ran out of further ideas.With terrible actors, terrible acting, terrible cliché dialogue ( Especially by our forced delivery cliché fest master Michael B. Jordan ), irrelevant political messages, ugly cinematography, ugly choreography & mediocre modern day music Black Panther isn't just bad, it is indeed, a disaster for whom i can name no good points.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

Black Panter feels like a recycled Thor: Ragnarok; The legacy of a father that has made mistakes, an evil relative and a fight to win back what was lost. There are no stakes in this movie, you know how it will turn out the second something is happening, killing any suspense. The movie is full of interesting concepts, but they just get left behind. At least the set design is really nice, you want to see more of it.This is by far the most overrated movie in the MCU. But most User Reviews reflect this already so I won't go into detail. The culture, the characters and Wakanda itself are so extremely interesting and you want to create a connection to them, but the weak plot and the lack of stakes just stop you from feeling anything toward this film, other than maybe the feeling of a wasted opportunity.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

I'll tell you how: You order it and see it for yourself. This is exactly the same situation here. After seeing exceptional reviews & ratings for Black Panther, I had to see the movie. Boy, It was a huge disappointment to see the low production & direction quality of the movie. I'll second another reviewers point: ""..just a bunch of senseless fighting and meaningless story line.""Do not waste your time and money watching this movie (and I don't mean just in the theater...I mean watch it at all on DVD or other formats).","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

On that level it is a 10/10. The trouble is, the film is terrible. Good news, I think most of these Marvel films are terrible. Their over-reliance on CGI has made them silly and instantly dated. If the goal was to make a film relegated to the pile of forgotten and unwatchable movies in under a decade, it was a success. What makes this one worse than most Marvel films; however, is the terrible writing. I am going to focus there because the acting was actually really great from all involved with even a few standouts from Jordan and Wright. One example ought to do. How can you tell me this ""kingdom"" is the safeguard of easily the most advanced technologies on earth and yet they decide their kingdom's ruler by hero death match?!?!?! Does it get any more barbaric. This could be possibly overlooked were it not for being the central device driving the entire movie's plot forward. This is inexcusable and just lazy writing.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I have enjoyed most of the other Marvel superhero movies like Iron Man, Captain America etc. In all honesty this was the poorest one. I thought the actors were totally unbelievable, like they were in a high school play or something. The story was drawn out and could be condensed to half the duration of the film and the story was not interesting. The only character that was half believable was the villain. Such a shame because when we got a glimpse of Black Panther in Winter Solider, I so wanted to see this film. I don't usually write reviews, but because this film has been hyped up to be a masterpiece, I felt like I had to chime in a lay waste to that claim. Even the kids in the cinema looked bored. I love many ""black"" movies, a lot of which are classics in my opinion and truly brilliant movies. This was not one of them. Blade (1997) for example urinates all over this film in every way. The pro critics have obviously felt pressured to give this rave reviews out of fear of being labelled racists by the social justice mob. I am not racist, the film is just poor.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The sounding wasn't that great, it seemed a bit unrealistic, even fake at certain times and out of tune with what was going on in the movie. But the story just didn't cut it for me. There was allot of action, you know the typical American production where everything blows up, cars flying up in the air and crashing with their wheels spinning. And amazing flying machines hunting eachother like in a video game. But it makes one wonder, what do wakandas really do? Or what do they do for fun? And one would expect that the advanced people of Wakanda would be sufficiently educated as not to kill eachother in a medieval style fight. So overall a decent movie, with a leaky leadership battle storyline and allot of overtones about black emancipation. Was there room for improvement, did I expect more out of it considering the hype around it? Definitely","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Yet not in this film. In fact he's portrayed as an individual coming to the rescue at the end and his racism simply laughed off. It's like this film was made 50 years ago with its tiresome cheap shots and endless chip on the shoulder rhetoric. It is a weak entry into the MCU and ranks alongside IM2, Thor 2 and Ultron as a Marvel dud.I have concerns about the impact of this film on Infinity War. I do have faith in the Russo's but capitulating to brainless dross to satisfy a rabid politically correct fan base isn't beyond any movie exec. Watching the IW trailer, it does look like they are fighting in Wakanda so are we really going to have to suffer the pinnacle of the last 10 years of MCU coming to a head in an ill conceived El Dorado just to satisfy a bunch of snowflake SJWs who are the last people that were buying into this glorious franchise.Just as the wait comes to an end, just as we top the crest of the hill to see the wonder of IW and it's huge assembled cast, are we really going to have to contend with a big chunk of it played out through the lens of this blatant weak link? Are we going to have to tolerate Cap and Stark playing second fiddle to this kind of nonsense? I can't deny that I'm a little worried.When we have seen what feminism, identity politics and piss poor writing and directing talent can do to Star Wars and a Marvel tentpole, are we not fearful that all of our longing will be dashed on the rocks of a studios needing to signal its moral virtue.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is made by competent people who know their craft and know how to elevate an average screenplay to a visual spectacle. Strip away the CGI and what have you got left? Well a standard script that works in Hollywood. Hero becomes king after tragic loss, hero is brave and honest, hero is immensely rich and then it is time for the fall and then of course he gets back on his horse and wins the day and gets the girl. The formula works with a twist here and there but nothing to testing. And it ends like other Hollywood dreams no matter how advanced and technically savvy the world they created is, it always ends up with a fist fight. 
It is not as comedic or refreshing as Deadpool or Guardians Vol1, it is better then Iron Man or most of the other MCU productions. It lacks a spirited hero, this one is bland at best. It has no awesome bad guy with great one liners. it features no memorable characters. Some good actors are here Forest Whitaker, Angela Basset, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis but King Lear it is not. It is a comic book made into a movie and it has no deeper meaning then that.

Angela Basset and Forrest Whitaker are some of the worst actors working in Hollywood. They constantly talk with such dramatic poise and make facial flourishes that no normal person would ever do, and neither of them behave like this in real life, but every movie they do, they put on this theatrical performance. Just watch closely and see it. it is painfully bad.Then if you can accept the bad acting you have to accept the ludicrous premise, which is basically the primitive tribe is this sophisticated people. it would have been more interesting if it wasn't this stereotypical African primitive tribe, but instead a real sophisticated group of people.Just typical badly written Hollywood film. filled with one cliche after another. you rarely find a film that dares to take a different approach and surprise us with a unique way of telling a story.I for one, won't pretend that a king would have women as security guards. nor will I pretend that this type of place remotely ever existed, and that's okay.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

I ask myself, how many time do I want or need to see this this film? Black Panther is a film i would only need to see once. Thor, Spiderman and a bunch of other marvel films I've seen recently are in the same boat for me. compare that to a movie like Interstellar which I've see over 20 times. My problem isn't with the film, Black Panther, go see it, it's fun. But does it deserve the kind of critical reviews it has gotten or worthy of a second viewing. Probably not.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

To begin with the subject matter is based upon one of the most lackluster and pointless characters of Marvels vast roster. Not to mention one of the most absolute banal and tedious backstory/plots in comic book-dom. You can then add to those issues the ridiculous ""bad guys"" that come and go from Black Panthers little world. Each one even more asinine than the prior and not a one that has a shred of believability. The only interesting character to ever intermingle with BP was The X-Men's Storm and thankfully they pulled her out before her amazingly masterful character was sullied.The movie is nothing to write home about. It's a superhero movie plain and simple. It's not a ""love letter to black people"" despite being called that. It in no way has the distinction of being the ""first black superhero movie"" no matter how many times people try to give it that title. Long before BP there was a movie called Spawn portrayed by Michael Jai White. He was black he was the hero and he was the lead. So when you take all those things from BP what you're left with is a movie that is just your average everyday superhero flick. So if you're expecting a brilliant masterful piece of cinema based on all the ""woke"" black people that make the stupid ""Wakanda Forever"" salute and worship it like it's a black African god you'll be poorly disappointed. If you expect a movie with action and superpowers and villains peppered here and there amidst garish costumes, armies of Africans, and long winded speeches then you'll get just that.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Quick summary - numerous fight scenes, chases, terrible screenplay. Nothing unique about this movie. I was looking for a quick exit soon after the movie started and wishing I was home watching this on blue ray or DVD so I could fast forward through this mess and save a couple of hours of my life. I keep hearing ""Tribute to Africa"" in the media, viewers and critics alike. The movie backdrop was set in a fictional Africa. It was actually filmed mostly in Korea. So much for the tribute. There is no real life homage to the country, its culture and way of living now or in the past. As far as the superhero part, there is nothing the black panther does that is in any way unique. Superman can leap tall buildings, has superhuman strength, has xray vision, Spiderman has spidy senses and his webs to get around town with, Ironman...well Ironman is Ironman. Black panther just seems to able to jump short distances horizontally (not so much vertically) with a bullet proof suit on. Oh, he does have the gooey purple stuff that he drinks that is supposed to make him the BP but I really couldn't tell the difference with or without it. Ughhhh.This was the worst I am not sure he really is a superhero of all the I am not sure he is a superhero movies I've ever seen. PS. If you are new to theater 3D (vs documentaries filmed in real life) as I was - don't bother with the 3D version unless you at all have a choice. All the superimposed graphics of aircraft, backdrops, crowds of people, etc make it look terribly fake and the perspectives are all off.

Clearly the critics had their own agenda when they reviewed this movie.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

But guess what? They went to see this one... I wonder why! :P
I even overheard conversations when the post credits rolled like: ""oh they are making a movie called Avengers and Black Panther will return! We have to see this!""
People, this is just sad.There were other black heroes in the past before this one (i.e. Blade, which was amazing).
Please be more open minded.
Intelligent humans -regardless their colour- know that Black Panther was really bad.I like all kinds of GOOD art (music, movies, etc.) whether if its black, white, yellow or purple with blue stripes, I couldn't care less...I hope my comment doesn't get deleted as it has in other movie forums / pages.

For some reason, he tied being the Black Panther to being King of Wakanda, even though it's obviously not necessary. Throwing in a requirement that T'challa lose his Panther powers for a fight to the death with anyone who wants to challenge him to take the throne made sense in the wake of that decision overall (because of how the second one plays out), but it creates massive structural and logic problems on top of it. Is this really how the country's next leader is decided? Whomever can kill the other in ritualized combat? And, there's a drug that can give you super powers and another that can immediately take them away? It's the kind of stupid you might expect from a comic book movie, but the powers are given and taken so easily and frequently within this individual film as to make the meaning of them smaller than intended.So, T'Challa comes back from Europe after Civil War and has to become king and the Black Panther for real. He fights off a challenge from the fifth tribe in Wakanda who hasn't been seen in hundreds of years and secures his throne. Meanwhile, they've received notice of Klauwe, a South African arms dealer who stole a bunch of their precious metal vibranium from them decades ago and killed a bunch of people in the process, including the father of __, who leads one of the five tribes of Wakanda and leads the military. T'Challa goes to South Korea to intercept Klauwe, fails when the antagonist Killmonger gets him first and kills him in a way that leads to everyone else dying. Killmonger than takes Klauwe's body into Wakanda and immediately and coincidentally finds the one person in the whole country with both the inclination to listen to Killmonger at the sight of Klauwe's body and the authority to back him if he should decide to challenge T'Challa.Killmonger challenges T'Challa to the throne, wins by throwing T'Challa over the waterfall without ensuring that the one guy who could prevent him from keeping the crown is actually dead, and starts an imperialistic program that will see Wakanda forcefully take over other countries because they don't align with his values. T'Challa is, of course, not dead, gets resuscitated and re-powered with the magic plant that gives him Black Panther powers before challenging Killmonger to a second fight which blows the whole country into its own civil war. Oh, and Killmonger had shown up less than twenty-four hours before.This movie is a complete mess. The biggest issue is that the story itself really doesn't start until an hour in when Killmonger shows up in Wakanda. Everything up to that point are subplots that don't really matter. The first half hour deals with world building around a utopia with incomprehensible customs around government and an action scene that doesn't really matter because T'Challa was effectively king before and is king afterwards. Hell, based on Civil War, I assumed that T'Challa was already king because he said so in that movie. Klauwe is an excuse to get an action scene in Seoul. Since Killmonger just shows up with Klauwe's body, the whole action scene didn't actually affect the story in any meaningful way. Once Killmonger gets there, we get a sense of a central conflict, but the conflict of visions isn't built dramatically. It's just people explaining their believes to each other in expository dialogue. Killmonger, while a pretty good villain considering his competition of antagonists in the Marvel Universe, is more of a hodgepodge of motives that never really get straightened out. He's out for revenge and to make Wakanda an imperialistic power imposing its views on the world. Fine, but his motives for his actual actions seem more driven by the mere revenge and the stuff about imperialism is a coating on his motives. It doesn't feel like the motives were ironed out particularly well.In the end, I find this a confusing slog of a film. The final fight gets ridiculous, not because it has war rhinos (which are kinda cool in a superficial way), but because of the short timeframe that the whole story has taken place. This great jewel of the world, hidden away because of its awesomeness, was thrown into complete chaos within a twenty-four hour period and only resolved because one guy got stabbed in the heart. I mean, there's disruptive and then there's a utopia that's never had its power structure challenged in the least way, undermining its status as a utopia. It also looks rather bland. There are bright colors in terms of costumes, but outside of that the movie leans much more heavily towards the visual aesthetic of Captain America than Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor: Ragnarok. Things look kind of blandly typical in Wakanda with science that has a visual texture that feels a whole lot like Tony Stark's tech that undermines the idea that Wakanda's science is all that advanced. It could have done better with a bigger embrace of the outlandish, though the waterfalls and costumes do provide some visual flair in an otherwise bland soup.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"5","/10","O Snap! The Hype is Political Correctness on Vibranium!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4817617/?ref_=tt_urv","joneshollaifuhearme","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur85312169/?ref_=tt_urv","30 April 2019","Despite my lame title, it wasn't so much the dissonance between the movie and the spectacular hype surrounding it that was most jarring to me experientially - this would come later, rather it was that so many of the narrative elements were so spiritlessly conceived, assembled and executed, that it even got in the way of the entertainment of the thing.The Vibranium powered hype is easy to understand. Marvel, a hot franchise, decides to do an all black cast Black Panther movie with a largely African setting, and banks on the novelty of the very thing for marketing vitality. The idea is rich in politics and rich in optimism - that quintessential of Hollywood opioids. The critics, already on a decades long MCU high, fall in love with the pre-sell and go in hard for their hit, and all at once what we get is a frenzied race to the bottom, critics working hard to outdo each other in elaborating and praising the addled qualities of their latest trip.But the product is vastly different from the synthesized hype. Few things work and the whole is discord at best. Despite being armed with a massive budget, the makers seem to have been overwhelmed by the central task of populating the film with believable African characters with a back stories rooted in African reality and culture. As an African myself, this was particularly devastating for me. The accents were nothing like anything I have ever encountered. They weren't Fulani, Luo or Zulu, or generic Nigerian, Kenyan or Chadian. Instead they were all over the place, a little bit of this and a little bit of that, often fused within the same character, such that they came to us robbed of all semblance of singularity, the way, say, an Irish accent in a movie identifies a character to the audience as an Irishman and all the cornucopia of meaning and sensibility that comes with that. This to me was perhaps the original sin of the entire enterprise because it's all downhill from here. The actors could not get in to their characters because they were the worst sort of amalgams with no cultural unity, which led to very weak depthless portrayals, and even far more artless dramatic interactions between the characters on screen. The affected mannerisms by the actors played out more like burlesque than anything seriously intended to communicate humanity to the audience.The direction and filmography of the movie seems to have come from a place that was either cognisant of these limitations and therefore endeavored to cover for them with various tricks of the trade, or was complicit in the negligence and it was, again, all they could do to hide this behind special effects, set design and costuming, and hope nobody watching caught the flaws.The movie just doesn't work primarily because the people behind it were either too lazy, overwhelmed, or uninterested with delving into real research on the people and cultures that they were seeking to populate their production with. Instead they seem to have just copy pasted whatever they could put together from quick scans of Google search results and hoped for the best. There are numerous examples of this from the movie, but just one will suffice to show the extent of the travesty. The Jabari tribe, a mountain dwelling, wood carving, isolationist tribe, that worships Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god!), and whose calculated role in the movie seems to be to make the political statement that not everyone is for technological advancement, yet their leader (who sometimes speaks with a generic accent, other times with an Igbo one) makes a challenge for the throne of Wakanda. How farcical is that?Perhaps someone will say that bringing an over critical eye to the movie experience is what's at fault here, that if I had just managed to get past the flaws I would have allowed myself to be entertained, but that to me is not how movies work. Films work, I contend, by directly engaging the audiences sense of empathy. They invite us to believe that the persons on the screen are real persons going through real imaginable experiences with real emotional consequences. We get to see this emotions captured on the faces of the actors, be it a smile, laughter, anger, sadness and everything between. Our minds ability to take flight, or get immersed within this simulation of life depends a great deal on its authenticity. By this I don't mean how realistic it is relative to everyday life (Audiences connect with animations and fantasy movies all the time). Rather, I mean how much our minds feel that the emotions, situations and characters portrayed mirror stimuli that is within our repertoire of familiarity. The more familiar, the more authentic and the more engaging the material is. Black Panther was simply none of this.And that is really the tragic part, because all that that hype on steroids seemed to dwell on were notions on representation, the celebration of a hitherto marginalized people, the idea that finally peoples of African descent could go to the movies and see their lives reflected on the big screen. Instead, what Black Panther proves is that, for truly authentic African stories to be told, it's not the amount of money thrown at the project and the marketing thereof that will make the difference, but the heart and commitment of the storytellers in relation to their subject matter.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

However my lovely wife really want us to go. Well with me being pretty much in line with what us real people comment in IMDB I still didnt want to blow $40 on a movie night for a movie that may be a fail. So i watched it via a different venue. And I am glad I did. The first thing I want to say and my wife agrees is that the BS hype about how good this movie is was so bloated that it is clearly FAKE news. Good grief! Is that why it made so much money because so many went there thinking it was all that? First off, I didn't sense any covert political overtone, and wasn't bothered by it. The synergy between modern technology and the tribe culture was totally lacking. I mean the garbs and the wall decor just didn't go together well with the aircraft, building layout etc at all. The car chase scene was terribly weak, not sure what was missing...more collisions and/or explosions, I dont know. As far as the acting, no particular actor really jumped out at me, though I did like Letitia Wright, she brought in the much needed bits of humor. Not until the last few mins when Michael Jordan shows up at the tribe camp and starts to be the A-hole did the movie become interesting. If I compare this to a action movie like Skyfall there is no comparison. None. Nor does it come close to Thor or the Avengers movies so Marvel did themselves an injustice by putting their mark on this one. I don't know what to call it...a very weak action movie or a boring drama with a bit of action? And to think one of my co-workers said she went 3 times, and another went twice. When i think of seeing a movie two and three times, it would be something like Avatar, King Arthur, or any of the Daniel Craig Bond movies. I am just so glad that I didnt have to spend a dime to sit through this one. It fills the billet for a B movie to me. Shame on the media and critics for propping this flick up with HUGE pillars. Shame shame shame.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Its a Marvel story so we dont have a choice, its a Superhero movie and anything goes. So here's what I thought ""Will I want to see the movie again?"" Or enjoy to see again? I guess not. Now will I want to see the movie ""Rush"" Niki Lauda and James Hunt - yeah! How about Ironman 'Yes'. Thor? About maybe, sure. Captain America? Maybe not.Whats the difference? Great movies have great actors that can carry the persona in a cool way. You want to see that action again because you love the character. Actually, you can watch Black Panther in the theatre, and then forget about it - without desire to see it again.Another take is, for Africa to map up, it must measure by European Standards - like ""Wakanda"". One always takes a legacy to build up fiction. Iron Man has a legacy of American technology, more like Vision and its imaginable. Africa doing a Wakanda isnt a vision, its something that can be a joke, as in ""In your dreams"". What I mean is there's a yardstick of how it must be and then its all illusion to make someone feel important - who hasnt really shown any such attribute themselves. Th 90+ rating on review sites frankly bums you up for Black Panther. If it was a white guy, this movie's rating would be 25%.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everything besides the music and the color pallet is painfully average. And it stunned me how people are acting as if this is a political thriller. This is another Marvel movie that is about one guy going in a black wunzie and beating up some guy with a bad motivation. It has a 97% on rotten tomatoes. People and including and especially critics are saying this is better that the best superhero movies like The Dark Knight (Which is one of the best movies of all time by the way) and Superman (1978). The humor is incredibly cringe worthy and awkward. The villains motivation is completely basic. All the characters have no complexity at all. It isn't nearly as good as the best MCU films like Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 (2017) or Iron Man (2008). It is just very average. I give it a 4/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I hope Infinity War will be much much better than this, actually it should be.About this film (just some general explanations why I don't like this movie):
Technologies are amazing at the first time, but not used very well, I mean... You could do this and that using ""it""... Why you just fight like that? so stupid.The ending is quite a disappointment as well (hope this isn't included as spoiler).. you will understand why.Overall I dislike this movie that I much prefer Thor Ragnarok. Fighting scene, comedies, and the thrill was real. Black Panther? I don't think he's that special, maybe not yet.. It's like having two Iron Man (which is not even any better than him), you know, in a non-american version (no offense)... I already have Iron Man, so why bother for Black Panther?

IMBD gave it a 7.8/10, Rotten Tomatoes a 97%, and Metacritic an 88%! Their showing must've had all the fabulous scenes and storyline that was obviously edited out. I appreciate and enjoy the 3 act structure of the set-up, confrontation, and resolution that the screenwriters and directors use to seamlessly keep these movies action packed, exciting, humorous, emotionally gripping, and thought provoking. None of this was done effectively with Black Panther. I hate to say this but it seemed as if the director, Ryan Coogler was trying to make this movie relative to the struggles of black communities living together in inner-cities. I could be totally in left field with that thought but it just seemed too coincidental. Albeit fine, and if that was his objective, superhero films that are based on the action, adventure, and sci-fi genre don't flow seamlessly, or well, with a film that seems steeped in the drama genre. It was a disappointingly abysmal let down. How this movie got rave reviews by movie critics across the board is mind boggling but in this day and age when you can lose your job, followers, advertising deals by being forthright, unflattering, and God forbid curt and negatively critiquing a film that is made up of 98% African American Actors, Director, and Writers you will unequivocally get torn apart by the news media, social media, and probably ANTIFA! Especially, when you're the only movie critic who mistakenly did his job. I can just imagine them all sitting at their desks after watching Black Panther thinking, ""That movie was utterly horrible, but I can't write that now can I? I'll be made to look like a movie critic version of President Trump, except without the power, billions in net worth, and powerful allies, they'll destroy me! Just lie for God's sake, forget my integrity, moral fortitude, and pride! I'll die if I have to do manual labor!!","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

The acting was wooden and the script was dreadful. Any attempts at adding humour was embarrasingly bad too.
The movies only saving grace was the baxkground visuals but they didn't compensate for the fact that the movie felt like a gang wars scenario set in Africa with hi-tech weapons and animal based super powers.
The most laughable bit was the fact that they used their tribal blankets as shields against the weapons - yes seriously!!!","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

Firstly, the acting is good but the basic story is rushed and filled with posturing from a few stars. The lead offers the viewer the best possible example of man in charge, to the point that it feels forced. The ending is clear from the start and the only good bit is how that was set up. The plot twist is very well done. Leading the viewer down one path to take them to the true destination. Very good. Once that's over with, it's cringe worthy and very predicable.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

Today I watched Thor Ragnarok for the first time and I can no longer stay silent. There's a reason why I watch superhero films and it's to be wowed. Where were the scenes that saw black panther kicking ass, where were the scenes that showed his character develop, that showed the other character's arc? Where were the fight scenes that should have blown my mind away? Where was the story that had suspense and plot twists? Those things were absent from this film. There was only one funny scene. This film is quite dull and borING. I rated it two because of the Dino Melaye. we should all be honest enough to admit that the success of this film has very little to do with merit and a lot to do with sentiment.

The storyline is all over the place, the acting is very cringy at times and mediocre at best. There are some good actors involved but the overly faked African accent just ruins it for them. So here's the real problem, this movie gets an average critic score of 88. Which is very high I mean critic scores on IMDB are never that high, especially for an action movie like this. Then I got to thinking why is it so high? The movie is clearly not that good..Is it because critics are afraid to score this low because they will be labeled a racist because it's an all black movie? That's really the only reason I can think of. So hence the title, a bad movie got a good score because of the way the world works today. And that to me, is the sadest thing about it all. (I would score 1 out of 10 but I gave 2 because they had nice Lexus cars)","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Really hyped but did it meet expectations?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4065777/?ref_=tt_urv","theresamansweto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69121524/?ref_=tt_urv","17 February 2018","Look, I came to this movie with excitment, and with an open mind. I didn't even watch the trailer for the movie, the movie got so much hype and good reviews from pplaces like Rotten Tomatoes at 98% making it the highest scoring superhero movie and Imdb with a 7.8 rating. People were saying best superhero movie ever, Michael B Jordans villain was the best villian in movie history, the villian was better than Heath Ledgers Joker, did you read that, b-e-t-t-e-r than Heath Ledgers Joker, okay now you've crossed the line. Michael B Jordans preformance as the villian was good, but in no way does it stand next to The Joker.Plot: The plot for this movie was set up in a good way, it reminded me of The Lion King, which I think was better than Black Panther. Except it got boring, I never have nearly fell asleep in a movie, even in the action scenes. It got pretty boring and really, really futeristic. It got boring because of a lot of talking but I didn't really care about characters dying, Sometimes I didn't even get the big deal about someone dying. Actors: I have to give props to the actors in the movie, most of all Andy Serkis, who is usually a monkey actor for Planet Of The Apes, and King Kong. I am glad Andy got a chance to show his other acting skills to the world even though he is already a brilliant actor and very underrated. Overall Michael B Jordan, Chadwick Boseman and the lady supporting actors like Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were really good as well.Editing and CGI: There was a lot of CGI in this movie for obvious reasons and mostly because the movie is so futeristic with extreme technology and flying things and things like that. Other places included scenery and landscapes like waterfalls and other nature were very good and they nailed that.Feedback: To be raw this isn't the superhero movie I was looking for. This wasn't anything like Spiderman Homecoming or other Marvel movies, which it doesn't have to be exactly like other movies it's just they coulld have made this movie a lot more intriguing and interesting. The hype really wasn't needed for this movie but it was mostly the African American people really excited about a new Black superhero, which I understand because if they made a movie surrounding my country people will get really excited to because pretty much all movies are based in America because America always gets the spotlight. But It was great to finally have a Black superhero for a change instead of having a predominatly white American superheros, and It's great that they are spreading superheros to other areas around the globe and I hope they continue to do that for places like Europe, Australia and other places around the world. But saying the movie is a really good film because it is a Black Superhero isn't the way to judge how good a movie is. This movie got boring for me and that is just my opinion but it seems a lot of other people agree as well. It was over hyped, huge budget, but really boring and nearly put me to sleep. I give Black Panther a 5.5/10, The best part was Andy Serkis's character.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

It is not an awful movie but it certainly isn't great. It's just above average if I'm being generous. The performances, as with the majority of Marvel films are pretty good with the exception of Daniel Kaluuya (in his defense, he's given almost nothing to do) and, I know this rocks the boat but...Michael B. Jordan. He comes across as a gangster and that's all. I like Jordan quite a bit especially in the first Creed film but in this he's just an angry black dude. Chadwick Boseman does well but the best showing by far is Andy Serkis. He completely steals every scene he is in. The action is generic and the CGI is legendarily rough. It's formulaic and brings nothing new. I've just finished a third viewing and I tried to like it more but, honestly, I don't really care to ever watch it again.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Everything in this movie just feels like it came straight from a checklist, but if you are okay with that, then this movie is fine. When I left the theater, I felt apathetic. I wasn't disappointed but I certainly wasn't surprised. As I said, you get what you come for. If you care about specifics, keep reading, if not, just know that it is like every other Marvel movie.Plot: If you saw a trailer or even read the IMDB plot synopsis, you have spoiled the movie for yourself. 5 minutes into the movie you can guess where the plot will go, beat by beat. There are no twists, no turns, just your formulaic safe ""go here, beat some guys up, talk, go there, beat some guys up, talk, etc."" If you are fine with a predictable plot (will the main character die 15 minutes into the movie?! What?! He doesn't!) then this is the movie for you.Effects: While the art design for this movie is frankly beautiful, the effects are far from. The whole movie feels like it was shot on green screen and some effects are cringe worthy. I am talking about PS2 cutscene levels of bad. Nothing feels real and there is no tension in anything. Characters, pacing, cinematography, basically everything else:The characters are 2 dimensional (the stoic main character, funny smart girl, stoic bodygaurd, wack villain, serious villain who is the antithesis of the main protagonist). The style is ""marvel movie"". Take it or leave it. Politics?:There seems to be a misconception that this movie in any way deals with politics. While that is technically true, the issues are handled wit the grace of ""should we kill all white people?"" ""probably not"". There are so many political issues addressed by this movie, isolationism, racism, traditions, etc. but all of them are presented in the fashion of ""(insert topic here) is (good/bad)"". It makes no statement that a 10 year old couldn't also make. In all it is far from a bad movie, just incredibly bland.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I respect and like that idea... that's a big plus but honestly the movie is actually nothing more than a action-fantasy story in a Avatar-Batman-Star Wars mix. This is a Marvel movie for children cause it doesn't have to tell grown up people much. It's about entertainment and there is a big difference to ""BlackkKlansmen"" in the quality of story-telling, acting and message to people. This time it's about a black Superhero in a black society. I'm not hater of those movies but some of them are just really dumb. What I don't like if they try to make the concept get more serious. I find that ridiculous and feel like I'd rather watch a movie that doesn'T combine our world with Superhero worlds. This fantasy trying to become real which doesn't work to me. ""BlacKkKlansmen"" does address that rather directly which I prefer. This movie shouldn't be on the Oscars more like a typical action movies and get nominations in irrelevant categories like effects or sound editing but not for ""best picture"". This is ridiculously overrated and more relevant movies would be better in that category instead.I vote 5 stars which I think is actually too much. I feel that it is sympathetic concept somehow. But when I had to vote like this movie really was as experience I'd say 2-3 stars.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a good movie that raises questions about the concept of a nation and the idea of protectionism, but the story is dull and doesn't really add much. The movie briefly touches on a wide variety of issues and then just kind of leaves them there. And the worst thing about the movie is that, for me, it isn't even really clear who the good guy is. I accept that movies can have ambiguous ideas to make the audience question who the protagonist is, but the thing is, this shouldn't be the case for 99% of types of superhero movies. If the story was any better, not having a clear good guy would actually be a good thing.

There is understandably a lot of hype because it is a mainstream-marketed superhero movie that features an mainly black cast. This shows that Hollywood finally acknowledges that they should cater to everyone on the market and is a indicator of the significant changes society has gone through and the representation in this movie is an absolute gem to witness.2) It seeks out stereotypes and breaks them. 
In lieu with being a cultural movement, it is a Hollywood movie that finally presents African countries in a positive light while also dispelling myths of tribes being backwards, as well as some mystic being ""all-knowing"" because they're so in touch with nature. Letitia Wright's character, Shuri, is the biggest breaker of stereotypes here, but a special shout-out to making Forest Whitaker's character, Zuri, more than your standard ""mystic man"" as well.3) The costume and set design was literal art. 
Kudos to the costume department for thinking through the symbolism of every tribe and person represented and for having their vision for each character (even background or minor ones) shine through.4) Shuri, General Okoye and Killmonger. 
They stole the show. King who? Black Panther who? All of the actors were actually pretty good, but Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan were exceptionally good. Actually, every single character felt decidedly more interesting to follow than T'Challa. I now wish I had gone to see a ""Nakia: Super Warrior Liberator Spy"" movie rather than Black Panther.
Now here's why Black Panther is an average movie at best and counting its cultural significance as a positive:1) Its protagonist is literally the driest and most bland character in the movie. 
Despite Chadwick Boseman being a good actor, he wasn't given much to work with. I don't remember T'Challa's struggle nor his character progression in this movie, because he was written with only one apparent struggle but nothing that seemed deep enough that a day's worth of contemplation for T'Challa couldn't fix. In the movie, T'Challa's character is mostly used as a tool to clash against Michael B. Jordan's incredible work as Killmonger. It does not do well to have a superhero movie where we can't even remember the struggle of the title character.2) The story is bad.
The story in this movie is so bland, predictable and it doesn't even offer any kind of resolution. The movie has so many world issues it wants to address, but never quite manages to do anything besides skim the very surface of and not even that goes well. It tries to highlight that Killmonger seeks revenge on the whole world for slavery and imperialism; but then never really addresses its complexities, the effect it has had on history nor does it explore the morale behind Killmonger's vision ever again (you get a cop-out to this issue if you stay for the after-credits scene or watch Infinity War). It tries to address that Wakanda is a prosperous nation with its own privileges and yet the nation doesn't help its own neighbors; the movie then also never addresses this issue again, except for offering said cop-out in the after-credits scene. It tries to address the issue of many African tribes being hung up on tradition as a hindrance; then also never addresses this issue again. Everything is left hanging in the air and there is never really a resolve. This is a superhero movie, we expect a resolution of some sort, even if that resolution has a negative impact.3) It's not even a good superhero movie.
While I appreciate my drawn-out and serious dramas, I went in expecting a superhero movie. I felt like I showed up, prepared for entertainment and was rewarded with... a kind of cool scene action scene at the end? Sadly, it wasn't even when our protagonist was fighting the antagonist in the inevitable last standoff, it was when our beloved General Okoye was on the battlefield. With the exception of Shuri and General Okoye not much of this movie felt remotely superhero-like. I would not have held this against a movie normally, but if I'm expecting a superhero movie, I actually want to see some really cool action scenes. It's like they promised me James Bond and I got some dweeby half-limp noodle CIA operative (Wait, Martin Freeman's character, is that you?).4) The CGI.
It's just bad. They overused it and whenever Chadwick Boseman was presented as Black Panther, I had a slight PSTD flashback of watching Legolas jump on stones in mid-air in The Hobbit.5) The writing is horrible.
Except for a few one-liners (you get a pun or two besides what is shown in the trailer) the writing feels stunted and weird. It just feels very off, even with the added filter of me understanding that I am a European and thus ""out of the loop"" in terms of how the cadence of jokes or tonal use of African languages (I think it was Xhosa?) usually is delivered. The dialogue is what makes this movie forgettable: There is sensation of a real struggle between any characters except for in Killmonger's case. They could have played on the struggle between General Okoye's duty to her country opposed to her love for Daniel Kaluuya's character, W'Kabi. They could have highlighted Shuri's frustrations of elders looking down on her nontraditional way of life, they could have shown more of the struggle that Winston Duke's character, M'Baku and his tribe has gone through. There were so many missed opportunities and while many things can be derived by context and implicit meaning, the language used between the characters never felt right. This resulted in a general feeling of indifference and I would have felt no inclination to be on Wakanda's side, had it not been for Shuri and General Okoye (and even Lupita Nyong'o's character, Nakia, has me feeling a bit skeptical).Overall, I understand the hype and the significance of this movie, but it is not a good superhero movie. The cast, crew (except for a select few: I'm looking at you, CGI-folks) and score has done an amazing job but somehow the writers have done them dirty and it has resulted in an overall forgettable movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Let's hope they sort it out for the sequel:)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

And made worse by the disgustingly bad CGI, the worst of the MCU, and the worst of the post-mcu era of superhero movies.The good parts are basically all thanks to Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and the good secondary characters like Klaw, M'Baku and Okoye.

The characters felt forced into the story, the director forgot to give us some feelings about them to at least try to engage into their backgrounds and stories. The rituals part were not deep at all. No explanations about certain events; Whitaker's character was there because it had too. It seemed he represented part of the identity of the city but nothing was mentioned about it.The African culture could have been beautifully represented by the music and Environments other than just the clothes and characters themselves.

I won't bother going into details. There are already many long and detailed reviews out there explaining why and how everything about this movie sucks big time.I thought Ant-Man (speaking of which has an imdb rating of 7.3-?!?!) to be the worst movie in Marvel Universe but they managed to prove me wrong and outdo themselves. Kudos Marvel dudes. I give 2 stars for the sake of the CGI guys who apparently spent the most time and effort for this movie.Last note goes to IMDB ratings. Marvel recently is not only successful in creating movies almost as bad as DC, but also in destroying IMDB ratings' credibility. 7+??? Guy Ritchie's King Arthur has 6.8, which also is overrated, is much more of a movie compared to this piece of junk.Thank you for inspiring me to write my first ever review.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie is a snooze fest, bad writing and bad acting too, boring fight scenes and I know it's adapted from the comics, but black panther has always been a ridiculous character, how can this country in Africa make highly advanced technology when they still live in mud huts irl. It doesn't make sense to the real world in the slightest, if the world building isn't believable and everything else sucks then there really is nothing of value this movie has to offer.","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

We have never been in a super hero movie before and it was refreshing to see and as a person of color I felt empowered. Every time T'Challa jumped it was me jumping, everytime he holler it was me that guided his voice, everytime he punched it was me. He was very relatable unlike Tony Stark (yuck) who is rich and white, and the actor who played this black chocolate hero don't even get me started meow am I right girls, that is exactly the kind of eye candy a woman like me needed to get into the theatre. But the one thing I don't get is why would the director make such a handsome and powerful black character the embodiment of Drumph? He represents everything Drumph does. It makes me so mad why would you make such a beautiful movie but make me want to root for Drumph?! 2 stars for that chocolate mmm and the authentic Africana","17 out of 54 found this helpful.

Some son of the Wakanda soldier who was left on earth and later grew up to take revenge for his father. Somehow he arrived at Wakanda and overtook as king. Then both sides started some mini war to defeat this king from Earth that was full of hatred and anger. Need more explanation of how that precious metal stolen would bring that revenger to Wakanda easily. How many times have we seen such story?They've made nice CG effects and settings of this Wakanda. Sounds and music were average. Most of the actors were not much more than reading the script without providing more personalized emotions to fit into scenarios. So they were like same as the others. The fighting actions were weak. Not asking to see skillful Kung fu moves, but at least fight with force and speed. Hits were like half of both. Only couple of the women soldiers showed some good combat moves. Overall the story is missing many parts: more better acting, character development for villains and that culture, more realistic actions other than CG.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Black Panther himself was a complete bore. Almost nothing the guy did got a reaction out of me. I was looking forward to Michael B Jordan's performance and I was so disappointed. It was totally one note and uninspired. The CGI was terrible as well. Watching Black Panther jump around reminded me of Harry Potter in the first film playing Quidditch. And the technology displayed was way too overdone. They could've downplayed it a little.This will go right along with Iron Man 3 for the weakest films so far in the Marvel Collective.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The racism in the movie is laughable only because we know that if similar jokes were made at the expense of blacks, there would be outrage and really only show the hypocrisy or ignorance of movie makers.

Where other marvel movies have had fast pace, action packed and well written action scenes, Black Panther did not have those at all. It almost looks like the actors and choreographers just did not have enough time to go through the fight scenes as they should've, and decided to make the moves slower and easier to perform.For me, being a person who really likes a well written action scene ( for example I love the John Wick style of action scene) this was a really big letdown.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Chadwick Boseman had a stellar performance, along with Academy Award Lupita Nyong'o. The characters were more complex than the characters in other Marvel movies, but the plot was predictable and boring, ruining the unique characters. 
 The setting of Wakanda was majestic and eye catching. The new technology reflected their advanced society. Once again, the plot did not live up to the setting. The concept and message of the movie was powerful. Black oppression is what created Wakanda, and fueled the tension. It is not unusual for Marvel movies to have a political message, but 'Black Panther's' had a more relevant stance. 
 'Black Panther' was empowering to African American's and touched on political issues in the U.S. Overall, it was very boring, which allowed the audience to overlook the outstanding performances and setting.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is exactly the same. People fighting with killing to be the one in charge with a hot, sexy man walking around shirtless the whole time.
I don't even understand how this constitutes as a super hero movie, because he wasn't walking around saving people in distress from crime in the middle of the night or nothing.
Nothing really happens in the movie. It's a lot of mindless violence. People get killed for no reason. People kill people without thinking twice and with no remorse. A lot of people brought their little kids to see this movie of violent slayings
And sex god, Chadwick Boseman, is shirtless for most of the movie, which is why I bumped it up from 1 star to 3. Because I like myself some eye candy.
I should probably just stop seeing anything by Disney altogether, because I was born in the 1980s, and I don't think I ever seen anything Disney that wasn't a remake of something else, or based on old fairy tales, or comics that were already tv shows in the 1960s.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

There is no harmony in Africa because everyone is different. There's more diversity among Homo sapiens in Africa than any place on earth. Just because you have black skin makes you my brother is an idealistic bunch of hogwash. Anyway, the CGI stunk, the characters were one demential and the production design laughable in its over use of oddball African motifs. Also, this film actually thinks its audience will believe there was a futuristic, modern African country with a hyper sonic subway and super technology around when the Belgian Congo was a systemic holocaust. Why didn't this goofy nation, light years ahead of the world, stop that genocide? I'll answer my own question: because the writer, producers and director didn't have an iota's worth of knowledge about the history of Africa nor did they bothered to do any research. The antagonist of the film was a conglomeration of hip hop gangsta clichés. The only believable character was the bewildered white dude going through the motions of acting. Hollywood has been the worst perpetuator of stereotyping in the history of the world. Anyone who liked this film and praised it was either phony PC virtue signaling, lacking in taste or both. This film denigrates African culture because African culture is complex and is not the simplistic Western hodgepodge of tropes this film is. This film is a real stinker, and all involved in its creation should do like Tony Manero did in ""Saturday Night Fever"" and give the trophy to a real winner.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

It seems they can't stop making excuses for not having enough movies with women, all races that aren't white and people with handicaps. Just watch one of the last Oscar shows, and you get what I mean. To me, this movie puts the black people even more in a corner, out of which they are trying to escape from for years. Let's give them an exaggerated accent (I didn't know Jamaica was an African country), big lips (with a saucer implanted in them), an ancient tribal culture and let the tribes fight among each other. Then make sure that, even though Wakanda is extremely rich and technologically advanced, the people in the kingdom are poor peasants. Now the acting. That was, in my opinion, some of the worst acting since all 300000 episodes of ""The Bold and the Beautiful"". I guess every colored person went to the movies because there finally was a black superhero, thus explaining the record breaking box office. They should all ask for a refund, for making ridicule of their race. The only thing missing to make things worse was the Black Panther smoking weed on his throne.

The rating, based on the content of the movie, has been artificially pumped by, what I can only assume, political activists. Now, before I get labeled as racist and bigoted, I am in no way leaning anywhere close to the extremes on the political spectrum. The movie is incredibly bad. Full of cliches, ridiculous situations so as to portray a world in which the roles would be reversed between the western nations and the less fortunate of our planet...terrible script, terrible acting...overall just an incredibly bad movie. I would argue it's the worst movie ever given the funding it had. I cannot say one good thing about this movie, other than the cool cgi and costumes, I guess.

Yet, Black Panther fails to give me a high.
The movie makers weren't sure whether they wanted to cash in over the geo-political happenings around the world or to honestly bring us entertainment. Unfortunately, it still manages to be self proclaimed best marvel, in fact the best superhero movie, as far as the B.O. numbers are going to due hype created by professional and politically influenced critics.Its neither the first black superhero movie (wait! wasn't Hancock a superhero?)
nor the first movie with an entire black cast(what about Straight Outta Compton?). 
Besides, for covering up the ""blurry stationary flaws"", they say that one shouldn't judge it as it deals with elevating the oppressed. Really?My dear friends! there is no such thing as ""upliftment of the downtrodden"" or ""being champion of the underdog"" in these 2 hours. Instead, if the film is losing something, its the emotions.On contrary to your presumption, here King T'Challa, throughout his spectacle, is obsessed with trying to set up his monarchy over Wakanda. He ensures that no outsider, no matter who he is, ascends the throne. The only moment you see a righteous statesman in him, is when you see him confronting his father for murdering his uncle.
The antagonist, in contrast, depicts an orphan, poor, homeless and unguided kid with a motive, which although disturbing, forces us to relate him with an underdog.If kids are looking out to watch this movie to gain self confidence to deal with social taboos, I suggest them to better see documentaries/videos of modern day achievers like Serena, Usain or Oprah, who tackled the taboos which an average black youth faces every day.
Coming back to the movie, the only praiseworthy thing I felt is the strong portrayal of female characters, which seem no lesser than the protagonist. The only place where they find themselves behind the protagonist, is in the title of the movie.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

That said, that bias had to come from somewhere and for me, its the general inanity and blandness of these kinds of films that is so off putting. Black Panther feels a lot like Action Man meets The Lion King. Its got a kind of unreal, simplistic , garishly optimistic feel to it, that is, I suspect, simply unconvincing for anyone over 14 years of age. The story is the usual basic adventure/action fare that's fraught with contradiction. Why an advanced society would embrace a medieval feudalistic model of rule based on a King makes little sense. Nor does the notion of it being hidden from the world behind a rather contrived force field. I'm sure none of the not so lucky locals, forced to live in simple huts, would be tempted to tell the world for some extra $$?The narrative is predictable. Comprised of shallow, basic dialogue and bland humour, designed to make the character's seem mildly believable.Really the action is the only place where this film shines. That, of course, is to be expected but is there any harm in injecting a little intelligence into the overall story rather than dumbing the thing down to the point where it could only really appeal to early teens?So whats left to say? Watchable on a very superficial level but really that is it. More one for the young than cynical worldly wise, old guys, like myself. 5/10 from me.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

In the end, I formulated an essential question: Did I fail this flick, or did the flick fail me.After some time to reflect on the nature of the production and directorial decisions, I think I can say with some assuredness that the flick failed me.Black Panther is operatic, played out in a big budget Hollywood flick.This means that a fairly simple mythology--and scenarios which play out modestly reticulated developments stemming from that mythology--are stretched out over a skein work of standard-issue over-the-top action sequences.So, in the end, I think I ""got"" this flick. It's just that I'm 1) not an opera buff, and 2) tend to not be impressed by CGI and interminable over-the-top action.While I can see ways that direction/production may have thought they were ""throwing a bone"" to snobs like me (e.g., cleverly down-to-earth writing style), it wasn't enough to redeem the exercise.It also niggles because of the way real artfulness in filmmaking has been taking it on the chin lately. The idea that films like Black Panther represent the kinds of money-making stuff that sop up all that money... just rankles.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I honestly believe that Black Panther lack respect to the real African people and their culture. And Africa itself is nothing more than a symbol to fulfill the western audiences' curiosity. The settings in the movie are contradictory, and they do not make sense. I cannot imagine with Wakanda as a country with such advanced technology; people still need to win the throne through a savage fistfight. And technically, T'Challa did lose his throne in the combat, and then he revived by eating secret herbs. I think he violates the rules of his own country. But in the movie, he was still depicted as the right one to rule just because he's the decent man and his brother was depicted as a nasty guy.
Besides, there are other logical errors in the film. According to the settings in the movie, T'Challa's sister should be the real ruler of the kingdom since technology is the most potent productive tool there. When his sister controls all the technology, she could easily manipulate the whole Wakanda. The movie is also full of stereotyped images of African people including strange clothes, combat strategies, weird rituals. I'm not saying they are all fake African elements. I'm assuming that these elements are disjointed with modern society and are insipid. Overall, I think if Black Panther should be considered as the victory of the Black people, it's only the victory of the Hollywood Black people. However, the visual effects in the film are pretty cool, but they are still repetitive products of the film industry.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is a very common issue within many films, however it is usually fixed by making the plot and characters engaging to watch. This is where Black Panther fails, none of the characters resonated to me very well, the villain's story is much more compelling then hero's story. It is worth mentioning though that the action sequences were by far the most entertaining sections of the film specifically the one set in South-Korea which was the peak of the film in my opinion.At some points Black Panther's CGI was brilliant and helped massively to expand the world however at other times the CGI was laughable which was best displayed in the final action sequence which looked awful.

I was insulted by how ridiculously it is done, mixing tribal style with african american elements. All actors could have been white anyways as it seemed so unreal, but then again, all the barbarism wouldn't quite fit. In my eyes an abominable illustration of black culture and a down to the core white and terrible movie. 1 star for the neat visuals though.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

You may ask yourself;
How does this movie gets such a high rating??? What kind of people gave this such a high rating?? Is this voted in the same corrupt way as a presidential election?Acting; they tried but failed, some of the ghetto slang was really out of place at times.
Story; lame and honestly kind of stupid, mediocre even for teenager audience.
Plot; very predictable, again; better suited for a teenager audience (sorry to insult the teenagers :-)
Scenery; the badly done mix of touristy African kind of culture with SF style is really disconcerting, it hurts my eyeballs....Black Panther is a very-very mediocre comic book movie.","9 out of 27 found this helpful.

I tend to rate movies for many things, but one is if it is watchable more than once. So, this movie is a one-time-watch and you never have to see it again, like Ant-Man. The story was more involved than Wonder Woman but I've seen Wonder Woman around six times and could watch it again. Hopefully they won't destroy the character of Lobo (in the future if it is made like the rumors say) like they did the black panther. And hopefully Lobo isnt ruined by politics and ignorance. Good luck, Lobo. Good luck.The warriors are pretty sic tho. However it is too long, too political, too full of itself to matter to me.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

I'm also a movie buff. With the advent of the Comic revolution, you'd think someone like me would be in paradise. Best of both worlds right?Sadly - no. 
Only a handful of comic adaptions work. A very small handful. The suspension of disbelief isn't the issue. It's more basic than that. 
It seems we have a generation of fans willing to pan down the swill that Hollywood serves up like there's no tomorrow. 
Mindless action and CGI FX, take priority over characterisation, script, continuity and just plain substance. 
Added to that is the PC agenda. 
Added to that is the abject disrespect that Hollywood treats the original material and the creators of it with. 
I'm ashamed on behalf of the keepers of the flames. I'm downright embarrassed actually. 
Until fans lift their sights a bit and demand more, the studios will churn out rank movies that offer only superficiality and rake in the money. 
Nearly none of the movies are made by ""fans"". We know how great it can be when a fan directs a movie. Peter Jackson showed us with LOTR.

But let's get something out of the way. This is not the first African American comic book hero. What about Blade and Spawn? Both of those movies were excellent. Even for a Marvel cynic like me, both of those were excellent comic book movies. So let it not be said that I cannot enjoy a comic book movie.It's just that modern day Marvel is unfortunately nothing like Blade from 1998. The action was terrible, the acting was unforgivably bad. The dialogue was of typical modern day Marvel quality. I just can't say anything positive about the movie. sorry but I'm not sorry. I guess they use great CGI, I suppose that's both a compliment and a complaint at the same time.Spare yourself the misery. Just like with Star Wars, let's stop giving these people money until they're replaced. Who knows, when the makers are replaced, we perhaps might get more talented individuals who can lift the quality back up to the standards of Blade.

However while this is wonderful to see, it doesn't make a good movie. That comess down to the story telling, direction and acting.Michael B. Jordan I thought was just terrible, he delivered his lines in such an awkward way I couldn't not laugh at a few of them. Chadwick Boseman I thought was good, although he was definitely given a much better character to work with in like Jordan's who I thought just wasn't written well enough. The film relies too much on visual effects, I must've seen this film at least 2 or 3 times and just can't really remember the ending, it's just not memorable. Andy Serkis for me was the standout performance though his was short but sweet, he made a good villain again unlike Jordan compare the two and Jordan comes up 2 dimensional, easy to suss and forgettable.I personally didn't enjoy the film nearly as much as other people I just saw as 2 hours of visuals that was there to pave the way for Infity war, forgettable story and characters, to see this consistently ranked best marvel film absolutely baffles i'd place it in the lower tier, hopefully the second will be better.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Unlike other marvel movies where science, emotions, details dominate, this one was much longer, faster, and filled with more quantity than anything. Less real and convincing than others and less interesting because it is based on something too much unreal and out of ordinary without any explanation or logic. Too unreal, too long, and somehow looks racially motivated. As if this is more about black people or Africa than about fiction. Bit cool makeup, girls, vehicles, animals, landscape, buildings, devices, superpowers, and stunts. Remind me of famous video games like Need for Speed and GTA and strategies a bit. But story is too unreal, sudden, fast, unfinished, unnatural, complicated, without purpose. No any deep or real emotions but few typical and shallow ones. Although nice insight into human nature such as tribes, instincts, kings, it is what makes it negative. I am just too happy to not live in that city or country or time. Sounds too bare, amateur, negative and based on luck and lack of intelligence. Reminds me of words: nomad, barbaric, homo sapiens, monkeys. Unreal and sudden transition to human world and lack of humans response from normal planet.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Having debuted in 2016's Avengers: Civil War, Chadwick Boseman brought a grace to the future King of Wakanda as well as an interesting opportunity to show a unique setting in the Marvel Universe - Wakanda is an African land that has isolated itself from the wider world for thousands of years to preserve its unique technological advances brought on by a Vibranium meteor crashing there. In the soil atop the meteor a seemingly magic plant grows that gives those that drink it the power of the mystical Black Panther - protector of the realm. Boseman's T'Challa is to take up the crown upon his return following his father's death in Civil War, which the film happens only weeks after.Disney/Marvel have, as do most big budget franchises, a bad history of letting directors follow their visions without constraint or interference. In recent times they did permit Rian Johnson free reign all over Star Wars and James Gunn was able to operate almost in isolation with the second Guardians, with both perhaps displaying why they had been so reluctant. This happened in the wake of the Edgar Wright / Antman situation that disappointed most of everyone, Wright most of all after nearly a decade trying to bring it to the big screen. For the job of helming Black Panther Marvel inlisted Creed director Ryan Coogler which leads to talk about the politics of the film. Briefly. Black Panther is being toted, wrongly, as the first black superhero (Blade, Hancock, Spawn, Steel) and is also the first wilfully racially segregated production in decades by having an all black cast and crew, with very few exceptions. Discussing the aim of the films political messaging is not the objective here, though I will simply say that prohibiting a person from working on a film for being born in the wrong skin should be unacceptable. Yes, it takes place in Africa so there would be an overwhelming majority of black people, though realities racial dispersion doesn't ordinarily prohibit achieving a ""diverse"" on screen group. Any further reading of the political elements will be put aside unless relevant to the film making choices or some other significant role.Coogler brought in his Creed leading star, Michael B. Jordan, to play nemesis Killmonger mirroring T'Challa's calm with a burning rage. Returning to the MCU after a brief cameo in Age of Ultron is Andy Serkis as arms dealer and Vibranium extraordinaire Ulysses Klaue, now complete with a lethal limb. Other notable additions are Dania Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o as one of the Kings key advisors/ generals and love interest respectively, Forrest Whitaker as spiritual leader and former spy, Angela Basset as mother of the king, Sterling K. Brown lining up as leader of a Wakandan tribe and Martin Freeman as the token - I mean - CIA operative Everett Ross. 
Narratively, the opening is choppy, jumping through essentially three different openings back to back. It does occasionally settle in to a pattern only to just as soon forget about it, as such certain elements or plots end up being rushed through when others seemed overlong. This then takes away the punch of certain arcs conclusions, removing the resonance or significance Coogler tried to dictate. There is also a deal of continent hopping through the first half that adds to the choppy feeling before we really touch down in Wakanda. Once there, T'Challa must earn his throne through ritual combat before beginning his first real kingly duties - tracking down Ulysses Klaue, the only man to steal Vibranium from Wakanda. In doing so, he crosses paths with Everett Ross who is also pursuing Klaue. During the pursuit of Klaue, Killmonger begins to assert himself against T'Challa and challenge his right to rule, questioning the isolationism and hording of advanced technology. It is in dealing with these topics the film does occasionally get distracted trying to preach to its audience and score modern day political points, that the actual debate being played out fails to go deeper than the surface. Other conflicts emerge when the film tries to frame historical issues in a negative manner, even having enemies agree about its awfulness, before the ending sets up Wakanda taking the action the film had been decrying. This not done in a ""now I understand history a little better"" but more of a ""it was wrong when they did it, but its okay for us"" fashion. As is tradition with Marvel films we do get an opening action scene which exposed one weakness in Coogler's directing. Much of the action is filmed too close to follow, with the near pitch black of the setting only exacerbating the problem. The later, more grounded action elements fair better, highlighting the more athletic nature of Boseman, as well as displaying some of Coogler's flair for style. Jordan's physicality is equally well performed, no doubt thanks to time spent boxing in recent years, continuing to tell the story in his actions. The biggest flaw with the larger set-piece action scenes is that they are undermined by the low-quality CGI on display, an issue that plagues the film. Larger creations, such as the animals, stick out like a sore thumb, never once creating a sense of tangibility. When we do get to Black Panther leaping around the screen, he looks very rubbery, reminiscent of Neo in the Matrix Reloaded. Even simpler computer enhancements are poor; a scene that only required the generation of a small crowd on a cliffside ends up looking like the creator just copied and pasted the same 4 small groups to pad out the shot. Similarly, some of the rendered backdrops look like the back projections from Goldfinger. This issue is not solely the effects failing but the look of the real elements also, as everything - from rocks, to garments to buildings and people - is pristine. No scene takes place in a setting that you would describe as weathered-looking or worn, with every surface looking polished or whole rooms seeming sterile. These choices end up making the sets the feel very much like sets and the spotless costumes feel like costumes. Compounded with scenes being lit very flat and uniformly, the world never feels real enough to fall in to. Wakanda's place as the battlefield with Thanos was given a skeleton crew dress rehearsal in the final act, as Wakanda's forces combat an insurgency. Hopefully, the all-round computer effects will be at least average, which would be several steps improved than what was on display here. Given that the showdown takes place away from a major metropolitan centre unlike almost all its fellow comic movies, it is possible the strong flat lighting in the open fields made the effect less, well, effective. When the compositing was shaky, the problem was compounded by the pure CG additions, like the war Rhinos. Looking more like they belong in the stampede from the original Jumanji, begs the question where all the money went in the 200-million-dollar budget. At no point do they seem real, which in a sense means the Rhinos are at least consistent with the rest of the effects. Perhaps the effects here were undercooked to allow more work on the Infinity War renderings and effects.Marvel's other significant element is its comedy which Coogler deploys more ably and more sparingly than some of his recent counterparts. Most of the best laughs come from either Serkis's manic performance or Boseman's flat composure as king momentarily lifting. When Boseman appeared in Civil War he was a fresh lively element, here Coogler has him playing it too stoically, turning him in to a blank slate. Beyond flashing his perfect grin, there is little emotion for him to work with, no real intensity to tap in to. Boseman, as does practically every member of the cast, performs solidly with what's given, it's just that what's given to them is often uninspired. Letitia Wright, playing T'Challa's little sister Shuri, plays the role closet to a comedic relief as a stand in Q - creating new tech, weapons and armour. Not all of it lands but there's nothing particularly egregious about it either - minus her one or two racist remarks. Given the highly promoted segregation of the production it is perhaps unsurprising that there are direct, actual racist moments in the films political messaging. These range from claiming that history museums are, essentially, active crime scenes full of stolen possessions (such as 7th century farm equipment) or to a chamber full of African people silencing Martin Freeman as his whiteness prohibits him from speaking. It is played off with a joke, but he never gets to actually speak. If inclusivity is the message you want to broadcast, moments like these run counter to it.Certain character motivations towards to the third act become wafer thin, bordering on illogical. Particularly when T'Challa is accused of a failing without ever explaining his view of what actually happened, causing the accuser to betray his friend of decades in an instant. Another major illogical choice is regarding the means of the Black Panthers powers - on the site of the meteor impact a flower grows which, when ground up and drank, gives the consumer the powers of the Black Panther. The issue comes in that only one person ever drank it at any one time. Surely a war faring people, as the entire world was thousands of years ago, would have dispensed this drink amongst the ranks and conquered the world. Perhaps just dispense it to the Wakanda Guard to ensure the borders are truly impenetrable. The situation is partially resolved by the films end but the with Infinity War seemingly staging a decent time in Wakanda (if not the films finale) the existence of a dispensable superpower potion should logically play in to that. All in all, Black Panther is an averagely written, mostly well directed, well-acted, horribl","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Even Magilla Gorilla cartoons had richer dialogue, more finely developed characters and a lot more credibility. Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space, which is widely considered to be the worst film ever, was far more believable than this high budget, super hyped trash.Stories with boundaries of imagination, as Rod Serling put it, still have rules within the fantasy worlds they create. If the premise of the story is a man who can read minds or a woman who is compelled to tell the truth, the reality of the created world stays within the walls of that premise. The mind reader can't just instantaneously develop super powers and use them to knock out his charging enemies. Superman can fly, toss buildings around, bend bridges and even turn back time but he can't just build a flying space ship around his body and have it shoot missiles at armies. This film makes it up as it goes. Fights are decided based on how much strength and how many weapons instantly become accessible to a given warrior, at a given moment. If the filmmakers want someone to be losing a battle, his or her enemy will have the strength, weapons and indestructibility to win. If they want the fight to turn around, anything and everything the person needs to reverse it and emerge victorious will miraculously appear. There are no rules or boundaries within the reality they attempt to create, so in turn, there is zero credibility. People believe the impossible but not the improbable. This is an impossible story that throws in new improbables with virtually every frame.IMDB users seem mostly unified in feeling that this film is beyond awful. For whatever reason, it still has a 98% score from Rotten Tomatoes. And for whatever reason, after I rented the film from my cable provider, I wasn't given the option of rating it. I guess, if millions of dollars are spent to promote a Hollywood blockbuster, sites like Rotten Tomatoes only allow those who support their agendas to vote. Read the other IMDB reviews before you squander your time and money on this one. There are a limited number of hours in all of our lives and watching this film is a total waste of two of those hours.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Very little in this movie makes sense. The plot is stupid and so many important details were overlooked. For example, why do the super-advanced people fight exclusively with melee weapons? Also, why do they have super advanced weapons and fighter/bomber planes and why do the average citizenry seem to know military tactics (they form a phalanx during the final fight) if they've never been in a single war ever and have only ever hidden from the world???? Why does Black Panther simply have a special suit and magic metal claws? This is supposed to be part of the Marvel universe so Ironman and the Hulk exist in this. What could this guy contribute? He could contribute super advanced and nearly indestructible weaponry (guns/drones/satellites) based on the magic metal. Instead, he's just a tribal cliche in a catsuit... meow.Moreover, there were some REALLY good concepts that were brought up, but never fully examined. For example there were ideas of family, heritage, identity, geopolitics, race and more that were never really examined. Even the main baddy's motivation could have made for a really great story with a REALLY dark twist at the end, but, instead we got the Disney rated G ending which didn't even make any sense.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Over the course of about 2 and a half hours the movie really only tells exactly that story. Yes he has to face an evil villain as part of the journey and fight some evil bad guys and all the other standard superhero stuff. But nothing really excites in this movie. His powers are kinda average and meh, the story kinda drags and is pretty meh, the fake dialect is meh and the only thing the characters have going for them is the fact that they are pretty much all black - which to be honest doesn't bother me, but its also not an great argument to like a movie simply because of the casts skin color - but apart from that they are also pretty meh. I did not care one bit for the bad guy. Only interesting character is one of badies played by Andi Serkis.
Black panther was by no means horrible. It had its moments, it has some cool scenes and nice visuals but that is basically it. Nothing is really inspiring, no scene breathtaking and towards the end the movie really starts to drag. Overall, black panther is probably my least favorite of the resent marvel movies. If you want a movie to watch while cooking or cleaning, this is a perfect choice!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I sat down with my sister to watch this, both really looking forward to it. She loves superhero movies, and I grew up reading Marvel including Black Panther comics which I loved, and I love what Marvel have done with the MCU, but...What was this? If I as a white man had done ""comedy Nigerian student accountant"" accents like the Wakandians did in the film, I would be called racist. We actually started laughing as they spoke, after a few nervous glances at each other.Everyone behaved like they had a pole up their collective behinds, and I know many of them are very good actors, such as Angela Bassett who was fantastic in AHS. Who let Andy Serkis was off the lead and told him to perform like a panto villain who thought he was playing a pirate. The only credit must go to Michael B. Jordan who turned in another good performance, and Letitia Wright as Panthers sister Shuri.After the movie my sister and I had a chat about what we'd just seen, and apart from the general disappointment, the over-riding feeling we were left with was... If the casts colour had been reversed, the film would be branded as racist.Bottom line: although I understand for an American movie this was a major thing cast wise, the casts acting was generally poor. As a Marvel film this was uneven and disappointing. And when the credits had rolled we were left with a bad taste in our mouths saying almost in unison that we won't be watching that again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

So little background on everyone throughout the entire movie. All characters are for sure wasted.

Emphasis on the deep down, cause what we actually got is one of the most disappointing MCU movies ever. Where to begin with this! I'll start with the few things i liked. The score is nothing great and i personally much prefer original scores to just songs pilled together but still it's better than regular MCU ones. Michael B. Jordan does a great job as Killmonger (easily the best performance in the movie) and the directing and scenary is preety good and the costumes are nice as well (i much prefered the Civil War suit but whatever)! However, the negative outweigh the positive by a lot! The plot is as generic as humanly possible. Nothing more than *evil relative takes throne, hero takes it back* . Nothing new, nothing interesting and as predictable as possible (unless there was a person who thought Black Panther actually died midway through the movie)(also plot makes zero sense at all but its a Marvel movie so I'll allow it). Acting apart from Jordan is just ok, and some characters are extremely annoying (looking at you Shuri). The humour is also extremely mediocre and tries to pull off jokes that would have been considered funny 2 years ago (ahem, what are those) and i personally didn't laugh once. But those are just nitpicks compared to the 3 main problems! 1. Black Panther is too overpowered. He already was bulletproof, super strong, super fast and an expert martial artist. Did you really have to include the whole blast thing? That problem is prevalent with a lot of heroes but when he is so overpowered any sense of suspense is immediately lost. 2. The CGI is shockingly bad! One of the worst of all MCU movies! Like it certainly has some very nice shots but his animated suit is very poorly animated and the car chase and especially the final battle are hilariously bad in terms of CGI (literally looking like a PS2 game at times!). 3. Speaking of the final battle, the action is quite possibly the worst in any MCU film. Apart from the ok waterfall fight scenes, the first one is too dark to see anything, the car chase is ridiculous at best and the final battle is embarrassingly bad, in terms of logic, CGI, suspense... it fails at everything (once again a mediocre hero vs villain with exact samw powers final fight)! All in all this movie is a mess and it feels like it briefly took Marvel back to the early MCU. Unfortunately disappointing is the best i can say about it. 3/10 (Keep in mind i rate this movie solely as what i like and dislike about it as a movie! I am not reviewing it for its cultural effect or anything else in this review)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, this came out to be extremely terrible, confusing, poorly developed and full of plot holes.First, they introduce us into a new world, new culture, technically an unknown universe to begin with. But then it quickly moves to actions and stuffs that made me feel completely lost in this Wakanda. Overhyped, I think. They brought all these festivities and vibes all over and forgot that we haven't been around to get any of it. The characters and drives into movies were also unfully developed. Also, one of the male lead's arrival was only discovered after halfway through the movie, that made it unfocused.Unlike any other Marvel, I didn't like the actions at all. They seem so fake, unrealistic and old -- like a false mixtape of a bunch of details from different movies. I was expecting great cultural and action experience, not this crampy hot mess. Is it just me feeling that the only reason critics gave high ratings on this one is that they would be called racist for not doing so?

How about you tell an entertaining tale for EVERYONE to enjoy watching instead of making a film that insults white people to the enjoyment of black people?
I REALLY wanted to like this film and I was very impressed with the cast but after the fourth insult towards white people, couched as ""jokes"", I simply lost interest and re-filled my popcorn.
I get it. Black history is full of oppression and wrong doing by whites. I don't even argue that point. Want to REALLY stick it to the oppressors? Make a movie highlighting all your accomplishments, and there are many, showing a mature, strong, even-keeled, heroic leading man and woman and celebrate all that makes black culture great. All accomplished in spite of oppressive whites and without thumping them over the head, but rather by ignoring them.
Way too many insults thrown around towards (greater than) 50% of the population to make this 2.5 hours worth it for anyone.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

This is one of the worst movies in the mcu, which is at the same level as fantastic four, dark phoenix and homecoming, ridiculously overrated by pretentious critics and fanboys. The story is so flimsy with bad and unconvincing acting, the costumes looks hilarious like a bunch of clowns in circus, cg is dodgy at the standard of tv dramas, even the compositing is bad where characters doesn't blend well in some scenes. It's a joke the critics are giving this a 8-10 which shows they are totally an unprofessional bunch of hypocrites, untruthful without credibility, scared of being accused of racism or politically incorrect. This is why IMDBs rating is just so unreliable and fake, shame on these moronic phony raters.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Acting was terrible and the only saving grace perhaps was Andy Serkis' performance firstly because he was the only actor with a convincing accent but he also captured the craziness of his character well enough to warrant some sort of believability. The rest of the cast were bland and uninteresting, their story arcs were unnatural and there were many plot holes throughout the whole film. The ending of the film has to go down as one of the worst movie endings I have ever seen, heavily politicised dialogue which was out of place within the context of the scene. To summarise, poorly acted, poorly directed, poor CGI, forced humour, force-fed politics, weak and arbitrary character motives. Although entitled to their opinions anyone who gives this film anything higher than a 3 is not really seeing the film for what it is but for the fear of the social implications of not liking it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

When I chose to go to a comics-inspired movie I expect a different type of experience than the one that I expect when I go do a Shakespeare-inspired film or an European art production. Yet, there are good films and bad films and I have seen all of them in all genres. Within the limits of its genre I did not find 'Black Panther' directed by Ryan Coogler to be a very good film and it's difficult to me to understand the enthusiastic reception given to it by some of the film critics that I otherwise agree with most of the time. It's not a bad film either. It's just average.The idea could actually work as most of the ideas of comics-based characters. A meteorite hit Earth million of years ago bringing with it a precious metal, vibranium, stronger than anything we know plus some curative properties. Vibranium is something like the reverse of kryptonite which was annihilating the powers of Superman, with the difference that while the Black Panther superhero can use it and become superhero by drinking it in liquor form, his whole nation of Wakanda can enjoy its power and build an advanced underground civilization in a secluded area of Africa, with one of the poorest countries on Earth as a cover above the ground. If you did not hear about Wakanda you should not worry, you probably did not hear about many of the - say - 20 poorest nations on Earth members of the UN. The adventures of young king T'Challa who ascended to the throne and is confronted with many internal and external threats and enemies as well as with the dilemma whether to continue the isolationist policies of his father and ancestors ('Wakanda first' :-) ) or open and share his technology with the rest of the planet and especially with the oppressed categories on it are the essence of the story. The rest is CGI and 3D effects.It is visible that film director Ryan Coogler made a serious effort to add a layer of serious items to the basic comics story. Allusions to current events in the US and rest of the world like racial inequities, war as a mean of settling conflicts and isolationism are more than transparent. The treatment they get in the film is pretty conventional and there are no surprises or dilemmas, there are more questions than answers. Characters are quite well differentiated but their depth does not exceed the two dimensions of the comics heroes - we pretty much know from start what they will be doing and how they will react to various challenges. Good acting by a few well known and other lesser known actors could not add too much, not even the fantastic Forest Whitaker or Angela Bassett. Computer graphics are spectacular but they lack innovation, I found them to be at the middle of the road between 'Star Wars' and 'The Jungle Book' (the animated version). One atop the other, it's reasonable entertainment for kids of all ages (and I include myself in this category) but it's not up to the buzz.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was a poor mixture of Avatar and other comics but this, it was made very poorly. You could see the effects were in front of numerous green screens, the flying machines were poorly done, the costumes were colorful. The plot was predictable, father is killed or died and son takes the lead. I was rooting for the bad son that was left behind in the hood but he couldn't pull it off either. He just couldn't blend in.
Lots of Hollywood names but they couldn't do much for the movie. I liked the kings sister with the techno stuff but Forest Whitaker? Was he bored or looking for something to do? He's so much better than this and so was Angela Bassett.

I don't know if it was the sound track but the voices were muffled and difficult to understand at times. Many actors were wooden and it felt almost like an amateur cast albeit beautifully shot.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Yes, I am also a white guy trying to justify why I don't think this film is the greatest thing since whatever Marvel film came before it. But you know what, I'll start by saying this: if you are a black person, you will definitely get more out of this than I did, because I know damn well that I can't relate to being oppressed for centuries and then seeing a film with a cast that almost entirely look like you where their skin colour and culture is celebrated rather than enslaved or genocided.With that said, it's a Marvel film. If you take away the slightly more interesting aesthetics and soundtrack from the African inspirations, then what you're left with is...just another one. The only thing I could see that slightly raises it above the others is the main villain. Unlike most others in this series, he has believable and understandable motivations, and even says something not entirely untrue about society and the struggles black people have with it.So I like him, but other than that...the acting is fine, some of the dialogue is cringe central, the directing is flat as all hell, the production design is good even if some of the effects look honestly really bad, and man are all the characters other than the main villain booooooring.I can't deny how important of a film this is culturally, but I can wish it was a better film that gave this moment to black people.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Even it is great to see a superhero movie with just black actors, the conclusion feels too underline and pointing, which hardly is what the makers wanted.Movie also feels too vain and clearly it has just made to underlay upcoming Avengers movie. It only purpose is to introduce new character to audience, so they don't have to do it at Avengers movie.Black Panthers massive budget of 200 million dollars gives you some beautiful scenery but nothing else. Stan Lee makes his cameo in this movie and that feels the most funniest part of the movie.Visually Black Panther is guaranteed Marvel production.

They've had a low point recently, with Civil War, which I didn't like, but with Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok, I really felt like they started to improve and balance their humour and good story well.
Based on the trailer for Black Panther, I did not like the movie from the start. The trailer was awful. Then the ratings came out, and I thought that maybe I was wrong. People called it the next Avatar. But I had a bad feeling walking into the theatre after I realized that all the reviews were talking about were the ""diversity"" of the movie.
And- it turns out I was right. This movie is awful. The story is cliched and forgettable, the characters are standard except that John Watson guy, and it's awfully paced and boring. Nothing stands out. It's been a few months now and nobody is talking about this movie anymore... well, maybe about the black diversity thing, but not the actual movie quality itself. Hmmm. I wonder why. Probably because this movie is **%#%%, and all the critics are scared that they'll be called racist if they don't like it.
I mean, an 88, really? That's just ridiculous. I've always trusted metacritic, but this must be a joke. I want to see all these critics watch this movie again in thirty years and see how much they like it.
Yeah- this is what happens when you involve social politics in movies. Movies are an art, not a platform. And this movie is like a kindergardener's drawing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Most Overrated Movie of 2018","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4275445/?ref_=tt_urv","littleging12","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55832546/?ref_=tt_urv","9 August 2018","Marvel's ""Black Panther"" treads new grounds as it takes on racial and political problems, as well as being a blockbuster action film. ""Black Panther"" works as a positive medium for building bridges; it has a good message, but is not a good movie. Once you look past the political and social ambitions the film aims for, it's just another by-the-numbers predictably average comic book movie. The only real impressive thing about the movie is its villain. Michael B. Jordan was forced to carry the movie, and when he wasn't on screen it was painfully boring (most of the first hour). His villainous Erik Killmonger stands as one of the better MCU villains. His ferocious yet sympathetic portrayal of a vengeful man gave the movie the spark it needed to avoid sucking. Also his super fit body jacked the eye candy way up (for a second I thought I was gay). However, Killmonger suffers from abrupt Dr. Evil syndrome. His prime motivation is to give all black people around the world specialized weapons made from vibranium, a mined substance in the technologically advanced Wakanda, to seize social dominance over any non-black person. I'm surprised he did not ask for laser beams attached to the heads of sharks. I'm sure the vibranium is capable of such matters. Without the emergence of Michael B. Jordan's more interesting villain, ""Black Panther"" is a dreadfully formulaic, predictable and borderline boring superhero movie. The characters, outside Killmonger, are pretty forgettable and uninteresting. The comic relief is very inconsistent; a few jokes hit while most completely miss the mark. The CGI is noticeably sub-par. The action sequences are not poorly done but don't leave a lasting impression. Many of the film's plot points you can see coming from a mile away (T'Challa vs. Killmonger part I and II, M'Baku's entrance, T'Challa's return). ""Black Panther"" is a movie that is getting such spectacular reviews from critics because it has a socially proactive message, touches upon real world issues, and nearly has an unprecedented all black cast in a superhero movie. Judging it as a piece of entertainment, it is wickedly underwhelming, predictable and disappointing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Without a clear tension in the plot the film fumbles along through various minor crises with tons of CGI, gunfire, and action until the sudden appearance of a short-lived climatic rise involving characters for whom the audience does not care.

After the release of the movie, it received sparkling remarks from everyone I spoke to and the most popular being ""Best superhero movie ever"". I never believed that would be true and after I finally watched it, I could not have been angrier. This movie is overrated and overhyped. The plot feels shallow and doesn't actually kick in till halfway through the movie. Felt like a classic Disney movie made for children. The villain was hyped and as being the most ""relatable"". Yes, he's more relatable than a living planet but relating to KIllmonger is like relating to the leaders of most terrorist organizations in the world today. (No joke, they literally have the same motivations and goals as he does). Michael B. Jordan's portrayal was unconvincing, bland and the furthest thing from funny when he delivered his one-liners. The main character of the movie was boring and weak. He needed to be bailed out of almost every fight he got into. The movie tried to be funny but could not deliver on that aspect. The CGI and sound design looked like they were ripped out of a video game on a Playstation 3. All in all when i rank my marvel movies, Black Panther is definitely going to be further down the pecking order.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And then there's the credibility of this country that is sort of known about in the outside world and sort of not known about, and glowing blue airships taking off over American cities with only a couple of kids in a basketball court noticing. And how exactly does the Vibranium economy work and enable the building of those magnificent skyscrapers? (Two stars instead of one is because of the gorgeous exhilarating shot of the ship landing in the city for the first time.) And why on a movie of this budget couldn't somebody hire a really good dialect coach to get the accents uniform and convincing? Given the billion dollars and the worldwide acclaim I must be wrong.

Do Africans share same culture even if they are from different countries and might hate each other in the history?Definately no.But Killmonger, who grew up in the US, seemed not understand that and not really respect African diversity and Wakanda culture. Himself may suffer from discrimination in the US. But there is no reason for him to ask Wakanda people to fight for all of African. He just supposed that Africa is one entity.It's wired.Will Amercians fight for Candians/British or share their tech just because they are all white people? All live in the same continent? Or share the same ancestor?Will Japanese people fight for Koreans and forget the war history between them? Will Vietnamese save China during crisis? These are all asian countries. Maybe Hollywood is too arrogant to distinguish them, but these cultures are quite different. They will never stand together only because of skin color or they are asians.Killmonger just ignore this huge difference and so did Marvel. The film just depicted a Hollywood Africa again. People live in love and peace. People will help strangers only because their skin color. (Since Wakanda is so developed, it seems impossible to catch them as slaves.

"5","/10","One of the few times I said sorry for choosing a movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4336627/?ref_=tt_urv","amo_mdd","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16718585/?ref_=tt_urv","13 September 2018","I almost never write reviews. But this time I feel the need to say something.
My girlfriend and I will watch mostly any kind of movie. We have also watched all the Marvel movies up to this one. There were good ones, some were ok and a few really bad. But I never felt the need to say to my girlfriend ""I'm sorry I made you watch this"" until last night. She didn't think it was necessary, she knew that I had suffered through this at least as much as her. But let's pick this one apart just for a few words:Scenario - plot: Ok.. I think I started with the lowest point. It was completely non-existent, nonsense and boring. Not much to write here, I think I already half-forgot what the movie was about but I distinctly remember the taste and feel of it (unfortunately).Characters: If we're talking about cliched, flat 2-dimensional characters that are extremely predicable while at the same time being unrealistic, this should be a prime example. All Marvel movies flirt with this problem, but at least you care for the characters you're watching. In this one, I was going from total indifference to hate and back.Effects - CGI: Aren't they supposed to get better by year? Was this shot 10 years ago? The underground scenes were horrible and the above-ground scenes were nauseating.Acting: Here it's mixed. I can see the genuine efforts by many actors but I think the directing kinda mutes most of those peaks into rather bland outcomes. The protagonist especially has no emotion, no feel and no credibility in the way he portrays the main character. A different accent (one that comes and goes in many levels, often jarring) is not enough to make it real.Continuity - world: I don't see many reviewers mention this one but viewers need a very high level of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie. I will talk vaguely to avoid any spoilers. The whole story behind ""technological advancement"" based on a specific element is bonkers from the start but they creators don't even make an effort to disguise it some. In reality, progression of science to higher levels requires so much collective effort, resources and communication that even advanced countries it appears to be a crawling process. Here, yeah right, you guessed it, the exact opposite. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about and you're already felt your brain flushed through the drain. And I'm not even mentioning all their habits, clothes, items used. Holy **** just thinking about it makes me furious; the whole idea is so stupid it shouldn't exist and it shouldn't have been made in to a movie from the start!In conclusion, and after you've read and endured my rant, the real question is: Should you watch this movie? For those who have already done so and are just checking opinions, you know... what's done is done and you can't change it so if you didn't like the movie for any of the reasons mentioned above, congratulations, you have a good taste that matches mine (hehe) and we agree! For those thinking of watching this one? Well, let me tell you, it's a BAD movie, even compared to low Marvel standards and it will most likely make you frustrated and angry. It's also a redundant and needless movie, even for the Marvel Cinematic Universe... But, unfortunately, you WILL watch it, because like me you want your movies and stories in the proper order. And I don't blame you, because you should watch it actually! Bad movies should be watched now and then in order to make us understand what is bad and what is good, in order to appreciate the good and proper efforts even more. Yeah, so suffer it, just because of that! :D Cheers!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's actually a simplistic plot. It's somewhat ironic that Wakanda is presented as the most advanced culture on Earth. But this ""advanced"" culture chooses its leader by ritual combat to the the death. That's hardly advanced or civilized. Such a nation would have inevitably descended into tyranny and war if their leaders were chosen this way. And that is what happens in the movie. There was such a tremendous amount of hype to this movie- perhaps more hype than for any movie before in history. The movie doesn't live up to the hype. Not even close. The CGI wasn't even that good. Some of the gushing reviews by ""professional"" critics were unbelievable. Were we watching the same movie? It's as if they felt obligated to love the movie because a lot of black people were in it. Over-all this is a movie that will enthrall children and people with the minds of children. Intelligent adults won't think that much of it.

This monstrosity is a virtue signaling masterpiece for the feebleminded Simpletons who believe that anyone, especially petite women can easily take on the role of the guardian of Wakanda, The Black Panther and without hesitation take out muscle bound villains with ease. I'm starting to believe now that they have emasculated The Hulk, Thor, and now T'Challa there are forces greater than we know that are actively conspiring and willfully trying to destroy the American culture to implement some kind of new great reset or something?

The reason for this is that everybody I knew that had seen it praised it for being one of the best movies they've seen in years and one of the best Marvel movies. I have no idea what those people were watching, but it certainly wasn't the same one I watched. Black Panther is a sub-par Marvel movie that has only gained such recognition and praise due to the revolutionary predominantly black cast. Putting the cast aside, the movie itself is completely underwhelming. The plot is coma inducing because it's SO boring and there is not nearly enough substance to keep viewers interested for 2 hours. Furthermore, the pacing and development of the plot is here there and everywhere. There seemed to be a complete lack of structure or build-up, and after 40 minutes my brother turned to me and whispered, ""What do you think? I'm really bored,"" which, in my opinion, sums the movie up in one - it's BORING.All of the characters are one dimensional (a common problem in most Marvel movies) and completely lacking in any personality. The antagonist is your typical vengeful young man hung up on getting revenge by any means necessary, but that suddenly turns into a solemn, soft and pitiful soul at the end. In contrast, the protagonist is your typical hero-type that does nothing to warrant being so important or special apart from being born into the right family. The supporting cast are equally one dimensional and many of them serve no purpose other than to flap over the protagonist. The CGI was pretty poor with the Wakanda backdrops being obviously green screen. I opted to see the 3D version and felt I'd wasted my money, since the special effects were lacking and the 3D only seemed to serve for decreasing the quality of the picture. Everything about Black Panther is utterly predictable and lacking in originality. The only thing that sets this movie apart from the other Marvel movies is it's focus on black characters and creation of the fictional nation of Wakanda, and the African culture that goes along with that. Putting that aside, every other Marvel movie I've seen has been better in every way. If you do opt to see this movie my advice would be don't get your hopes up. Whilst it's certainly not the worst movie in the world, it's also not what the critics praise it as being. If you are a huge Marvel fan, you may find more enjoyment, but in my honest opinion, it is just as unoriginal and boring as the rest of the Marvel movies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Every scene had a white-bashing, anti-American narrative for a country that clearly explains how it's OK to exist in a virtual utopia, while letting the rest of Africa be eaten by parasitic worms, die of malnutrition and spread AIDS like wildfire.
The accents were way over the top. Have any of the producers or actors had linguistic coaches involved? At one point, you'd think that some of them were from Jamaica.
The story falls apart almost from the very beginning. A society that had such advanced technology wouldn't obsessively embrace living like they were still in the stone age. 
Sigh. 
If I had to speak of any positives in this film, it would be the visual effects were quite good-- except for the CGI fights involving Black Panther as they broke the laws of physics in every scene. I don't care how good your armor is-- if you get flung against a concrete wall at 100mph, your insides would turn to a fruit smoothie.
A big stinking D- for this movie! How people raved about it, I can only guess-- either they were fully shamed into hating their whiteness or loathed the fact that they were born under an American flag, I have no idea. Did Louis Farrakhan or Al write the screenplay? All this movie did was stoke racist emotions under a thin story that you could fully guess within the first 10 minutes of watching the introductions of the characters.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thus, I'd said the story was just an ordinary.Even though the story isn't that much very different from those ones I always see, I must admit that the effects are quite good. But it still can't make the film to get 9 or 10 stars rating. They still need to improve it to get high rates.All in all, if they could improve the story and everything somehow, it'd be better than this.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

T'Challa is so dull and boring in this after being the BEST part of Civil War. The CGI is inexcusably bad in multiple scenes, and the jokes fall as flat as can be. Yet the worst part of the ENTIRE movie for me was the villain, Killmonger. When I tell you that this character was beyond cringe-inducing in every single scene, I am not exaggerating. I am a Michael B. Jordan fan, but this was brutal to watch. The dialogue was laughably corny and predictable, and the execution of said dialogue was equally corny and rough. I did not enjoy a single scene in this entire movie, and there is not one MCU movie I want to watch again less than this..(okay maybe Hulk).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That's all I can say on the positive side after yawning through this dreadful Marvel story. I love superhero films but this one made little sense. Firstly, how can such an advanced civilisation remain hidden in Africa for so many centuries? It would have been more believable were it set deep within the Amazon for example.I was very disappointed to see Forest Whitaker's type cast performance as he might as well have been playing in The Last King of Scotland. The main actor was, in my opinion, badly chosen. I think Michael Jai White would have pulled it off better. The strongest performance from was by Michael B Jordan ( Creed main actor ). I know superhero stories are meant to be fantastical but this one just didn't make any sense to me. The movie was disjointed, the script weak, the acting average and the characters were not likeable or well described. Perhaps they just focused on the CGI without bothering to concentrate on the script, story or acting.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The main characters fight over the thrown, but by the end nothing has really progressed or changed in the characters relationships to each other since the beginning.I enjoyed several of the action and fight scenes and enjoyed the theatrics and the dress of the characters.

But in reality it s a very average film. There is nothing particularly oustanding about the movie. The set design is very good (in particular the ""techno-organic"" archirecture of Wakanda.) But the storyline is very average - and even sub-standard in places.
The battle scenes in particular are somewhat absurd and unbelieveable - looking more like a mass brawl than any military operation. I suspect whoever wrote it knows very little about armed conflict or military history.
Also the the villains are very disappointing. Klaw is probably the best bad guy the MCU has come up with. However, he is dispensed with early on to make way fort just another baddie clone of the hero. Same as happened in Ant-Man, Thor, Winter Soldier, Iron Man... in fact just about every other Marvel film. A major opportunity lost.

With lackluster CGI, a lot of continuity errors and character inconsistencies, this movie wouldn't stand out in any other decade. 
There are better movies that touch on the african culture (Tsotsi, Hotel Rwanda), better action movies (most MCU movies, the recent Mission Impossible ones) and more compelling portrayals of heroism that touch on the minority aspect of society (Boyz n the Hood, Dope) that don't require fantasy elements.
The villain was better than in most previous MCU movies, but the writers still didn't give him anything with gravitas, for T'Challa to rise to the challenge in a memorable way.

There was actually nothing that stood out as different (apart from the cast ethnicity) whereas the latest Thor film was a triumph in delivering something different and entertaining. This could just as well have been a Netflix film.

All in all, it gives you a good look at who Black Panther is and a one watch to get the info, but terrible fight scenes, CGI the worst out of all the marvel movies, first marvel movie i was disappointed about, when people say infinity war is better, I'm baffled.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I feel that as far as the origin stories go, they seem to follow a pattern that goes something like this: The top origins were funny, and serious, had action, interesting characters, smart dialogue and a decent story line. The worst were long, slow and little action or most of the action was at the end. I would suggest that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"" were tied for #1 as the best of the origins, while ""Thor"" and ""Fantastic 4"" were arguably two of the worst. The first ""Iron Man"" was somewhere near the top but ""Captain America"" was probably closer to the bottom. ""Wolverine's"" origins was probably somewhere in the middle, since people seem to love it or hate it. The rest are all sprinkled somewhere in between. (Sorry if I left some out and being true to the comic story line was not considered since that is a measure mostly for true comic book fans). Black Panther has a decent story line, good villains (but kill of a colorful one early), but is rather slow at times and is light on the action until the end. This movie has patterns of both the best and worst origin stories. It is not the best but it is certainly not the worst. It's somewhere in the middle.What is most unfortunate for those of us that really want to like this movie was the stupid levels of super-over-hype by the media and critics. .","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, with its somewhat Shakespearian plot combined with themes about the dangers of isolationism it brings with it a few takes on the superhero-blockbuster formula that feels fresh and captivating. It's one of those rare Disney/Marvel movies that stands on its own feet instead of being a 2-hour set up for the next project in line.On top of that Black Panther also takes a couple of well deserved jabs at social injustices as well as both ""old-school"" western imperialism and modern western imperialism. The jabs may be modest and somewhat unsophisticated (which is to be expected when it comes to movies made and released on this scale) but at least they are still there, and that is something I very much appreciate!Script, pacing, acting, CGI etc. strikes me as above average overall so no complaints there. In short, Black Panther is well worth a watch and hopefully something that might contribute to Disney/Marvel upping their game yet another step in the future.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Jordan's horrendous acting abilities. The filmmakers even misused Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman; to spoil two such great actors tells you something about this movie. I wasn't surprised, really; I expected this movie to be boring and unappealing to me. I tried to get pass all of those unfavourable things and just enjoy the film, because if it's at least silly entertainment with zero depth or interesting storytelling, then at least it accomplishes the entertainment factor, which is a good thing. Having said that, there were moments in which I found myself interested and involved, but those moments were few and faded away pretty quickly. Even the action I found it dull, nothing that could raise an eyebrow. The only thing I thought it was okay was the CGI, which I've seen a lot of people in here criticize. Whenever there were scenes of the tech used in Wakanda, I though the special effects were very well done.
I couldn't feel absolutely anything for these characters. Had they all died in the end, I wouldn't have been shocked or even cared at all. Michael B. Jordan as a villain was an utter joke, totally forced and unbelievable.I think Black Panther actually IS a cool character, but I dislike the way the actor has portrayed T'Challa, and to have a heavily criticized origin movie sort of creates an stigma for the character in my opinion. Although one could argue that it definitely has something to do with the masses and social media, because the hype was created by the people, the ""fans"". And fans disguised as ""journalists"" posting about the movie on every site and on social media. Believe it or not all of this influences how many people view this character and his universe.All in all, this movie wasn't very good in my opinion, but I did enjoy some parts, so I'm giving it a 5. There are far more people out there with harsher words than mine who won't hesitate in rating it below 5. If there's a sequel, I will be watching for sure, but I'm not expecting much, that's for sure. Suddenly I feel like watching Static Shock or Blade for better outlets of metahumans of African-descent. And to why there are so many people praising this flick as if it was The Dark Knight, it's beyond me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They were entertaining, funny and originals to a certain degree, they didn't reinvent the wheel of actions movies, but they pushed it to the limits. After a while though they became quite repetitive sometimes more than other, but with a movie every 6 months or so it's hard to follow without loosing interest. So this is where I stand, I enjoy action, I enjoy special effects, I enjoy Super heroes, but more than anything I like to be entertain.It's basically 2 stories, first it's a heist movie disguised as a spy movie disguised as a superhero movie, after that it's the classic Disney prince story of king loose his kingdom, has to fight for it, meet resistance.Sadly this movie wasn't quite entertaining sure it had pretty much all the check points of a big action movie... in fact any type of action movies: hand combat, sword fights, gun fights, army fights and space ships fights, car chase, spy gadgets, super heroes gadgets, casino meet up with the bad guys, illegal merchandise contraband, cia, spies, super soldiers, girl army, rhinoceros, etc. 
Problem was the delivery was off on most of them, there was a LOT of things going on, they tried to do everything, while also introducing a team of 4+1 people + their aunts and uncles, 2 bad guys, 2 other tribes chiefs. It makes at least 9 characters to introduce and create a personality for them with screen time and dialogues, it doesn't work and we end up with pretty unidimensional characters with no depth. There was nothing original outside of it being in a fictional Africa, costumes where amazing by the way (I'm not talking about black panther per say). Looking at some critics though I feel like it did absolutely what it needed to do, it realized the phantasms of most of the black audience. It was kind of a celebration of what any kid with some feeling of the weight of blacks oppressions over the years would like to happen to the black community. I think it really touch a sensible nerve with the black American community in that sense. For me it felt like just giving everything he wanted to the viewer. While being empowering in a sense it didn't gave much satisfaction cinematographically speaking.It didn't bring anything new on the table, no character offered much possibly to get attached to except maybe the bad guy. In the end it felt really flat and soulless everything looked quite clinical (that's what happen when you shoot everything in front of green screens) and most character had the depth of a page of paper. Unless you're a big super hero movie, stay away from this movie, it's a forgettable effort.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We were really going to shut it off after giving it a chance for 20 minutes. We held out hope, but it was a dud! Here's my impressions of the good and bad:
Good: The outifts were very colorful, and the African art looked nice. 
Bad: 1) an advanced society that has a monarchy, has fight-challenges, and with knives and spears? 2) how does a society become so advanced when cut-off from the world? the people there are an order-of-magnitude more intelligent than others? they sure didn't act it. 3) I understand what they were trying to do with the Africanized-English accents, but it made it hard to understand the dialogue at many points, 4) because the dialogue was not clear, the plot and subplots were lost on me. All I know is that they were all related and some relaties killed each other and there was revenge ... I really didn't feel anything for these characters, so I didn't rerun the scenes on the DVD, 5) no memorable special effects, 6) no cool, great music theme. Listen to the Wonder Woman theme music and you'll hear a great tune.
I wasted my time with this, when I could have been finishing up Season 14 of Survivor on Amazon Prime.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think in many respects this was a missed opportunity to create something completely different in the Marvel pantheon. The initial premise of having mainly black actors and a strong female presence is laudable, but sadly I felt this became simply a token gesture. I think the cultural and political messages could have been much stronger and this would have created a far more absorbing and challenging storyline. Some other reviewers expressed disappointment in the fight scenes and poor cgi; this didn't bother me too much, but at times it felt very derivative and a regurgitation of set pieces from other films, and at times became all a bit Lord of the Rings. All in all, I felt the film lacked the depth and inventiveness that it promised and if it had been a bit more daring, could have added a new perspective to this genre.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The picture is incredibly beautiful (who would doubt, because the budget for the film is huge) and I'm not talking about the graphic component (it is performed at medium-high level), but about landscapes, suits and so on. That's all pluses. In the negative, I will not go into details. The protagonist is the personification of despondency. The main villain, though well played by Michael Bi Jordan, is a complete copy of the black panther in strength, differing only in color. By the way, the main villain and protagonist are invulnerable in their costumes. Empathizing for someone in this regard is very difficult. Further on the list is the fact that this film is a filler. that is, all the events of this film have no significance for the entire movie world. I could name even more minuses of this film, but I doubt that anyone will ever read my review.

Mostly because I didn't read much of his comics and the character did not interest me much.However the movie had great reviews and smashed a lot of box office records and Marvel movies have a good quality on average. But Black Panther I have to say was well below that average.The action scenes were bland and not on par with other Marvel/DC movies and the CGI, which there is a lot of, was surprisingly mediocre. The story was bland and didn't make much sense to me. Something about some metal with magical properties giving both enhanced super powers and technology and they managed to somehow hide that from the rest of the world by isolating and hiding a whole country? I mean in a world like Marvel where you have SHIELD and other super-spy organisations, none of them could figure out this high tech country? No, that is just nonsense, even for a comic book movie.The characters were not that very interesting either. You have more than the usual dose of feminism with super smart and super strong female characters, none of which had much depth and were there just because they were women. The villain in the movie did show some promise but they didn't really explore him much and the hero, Black Panther, I can't say had neither the flare of Tony Stark nor the heart of Peter Parker. He was just another bland character in a bland movie with bland actors.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's simply a marvel movie, which isn't a compliment. The writing is mediocre. Characters are basic. You got your perfect hero, that doesn't have any character flaws. Love interest that does little to nothing. Villain that has a motivation that seems to change throughout the film. Any other character discussion would result in spoilers. There's a lot of cringe worthy lines. Bad jokes are littered throughout this film. And a lot of stuff that made me unintentionally laugh.The visual effects are quite bad. Black Panther looks rubbery, and plain fake. The MCU seems to look faker by each installment.The music is probably the only unique thing about this film. They used a lot of African Percussion and hip hop instrumentation, which is something i can appreciate. It adds to the atmosphere and helps make it somewhat unique.So when you watch this movie don't expect a well made film. Expect a formulaic movie that's only intention is to sell toys and sell tickets.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, this does not excuse it from the major problems it contains.I have never been so thoroughly able to predict the plot of a movie before. This is not to say that most Marvel movies don't have predictable plots, but with this one, it is more blatantly obvious than any other in the series. It is also not aided by the fact that it has a boring protagonist in a movie where every other character is more interesting than he is. Because he has no real enticement as the lead, it quickly reveals the other problems more readily than other Marvel movies as you are paying more attention to them.The only part of this film that really deserves the praise it got is Killmonger. He is a great villain, the most interesting character in the movie, and has some really worthy things to say. But he cannot save the entire movie, which is so generally mediocre.

Visuals were amazing in spots and in others the CGI was clunky. Directing was OK and the production values were good.The not so good:There were some slow spots in this one...lots of them. Unlike most Marvel movies, this one seems to lack much of any sense of humor. I understand they are doing an origin story with the first film for BP...they spent way too much time on it. This may have worked well were this a stronger story, not so much here. Not to give too much away if you haven't seen it, entitled rich prince becomes king(and superhero), loses kingship then gains it back(along with powers and a suit), because he is...you know...entitled.Considering the time they spent developing this story I would expect that there would have been much more character development, but in this case it was sorely lacking. The ""villain"" is the most developed character in the film and ultimately the most likable having at least a motivation. The titular hero of the movie, aside from having been born the son of an absolute monarch, chowing down on the African equivalent of peyote, is not(in my opinion) well developed, relatable or especially likable. Other characters are 2D, but honestly still more likable than our hero.I wish I had skipped the big screen and waited for Netflix.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Wakanda just signed SOKOVIA ACCORD weeks ago to restrict Avengers from ignoring other countries' border and flipping their wills fighting around. The old king T'Chaka even said: ""Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all."" BUT, when it comes to Black Panther, he just invaded Korean territorial air space, ignored international law, local law and collateral damage. Wow, I mean, Wakanda is more America even than America.As a country with that kind of top notch high tech and special computer technology, their streets still look like Mumbai in India, or Sakaar planet in Thor 3. Most of people walk on the dusty soil road with bare feet.If a country is really that advanced, it should be shown in every aspects, including common people's life.Also, the political system in Wakanda is extremely fragile and dangerous. There is no proper mechanism to restrict king's power, and the selecting system is unbearably primitive. I understand it's comic setting, but MCU films always make some adaptations, why can't they make it a ritual ceremony instead? Let the elder council elect the symbolic king.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I finally watched this when all the popularity surrounding it had died down, so I'll just give my perspective on the substance. The movie definitely had some of the best visuals and set pieces in almost any other Marvel movie, but the idea of Wakanda and the comics to begin with just gives a huge range of options and boundless area for creativity with this superhero and atmosphere. A secret civilization far more technologically advanced than any other first world country, basically the equivalent if Tony Stark owned his own small country. Warring tribes and factions of groups all vying for the thrown based on a unique political climate. Yet even with all these amazing ideas and the great filmography that made every shot look stunning, I couldn't help but feel it all came up short. For instance, even the actors involved were an all-star lineup, but it seems like most of the characters they portrayed had bland dialogue and one dimensional personalities that had little depth to them. A major exception to this, however, was Killmonger who was a very good villain even though his ""master plan"" at the end was a little weird and vague. Andy Serkis was also entertaining beyond no ends as Klawe which is not surprising for him. The plot was almost comically predictable as well where you could guess what was going to happen a mile away as if we had all already seen this exact same plot before, and some of the characters actions did not seen genuine and seemed to just happen to move the formulaic plot forwards where we all already knew it was headed. The fact that T'Challa just happened to appear with the mountain tribe is some coincidence. Martin Freeman's character also seemed ridiculously unnecessary and the idea of a CIA operative being a selfless hero is just absurd in my personal opinion, but hey, maybe the CIA are different in the Marvel Universe compared to real life.Overall, it had more ups than downs and the visually appealing shots and filmography was enough alone to keep anyone entertained watching this movie. Now that it's on Netflix, there's absolutely no reason not to watch this and it gives a good precursor to how the Marvel phase 3 tech suits and weapons will look (Iron Man's nanotech suits).Final score: 6.7/10 rounded to 7.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As with almost every Marvel movie there certainly were some killer action scenes, some laughs and some interesting characters. 
But for me nothing here felt special in any way which I had hoped for going into this. Even worse so, most of the typical Marvel-characteristics didn't work as well as in some of their previous entries, making them actually pretty decent: music, humour, CGI. 
As for the music, the original score is fine but the incorporation of the Kendrick Lamar curated soundtrack didn't work at all for me. Most of the tracks were pretty awful so they should have been left out of the movie. Martin Freeman and Letitia Wright were the only ones with comedic timing. And the CGI was laughably bad at times, especially towards the end. Wondering why Marvel didn't put as much effort as usual into this. After the glowing reviews I had hoped for a somewhat grittier, less Marvel-like, energetic movie (maybe a la Logan, but in Cooglers style?) but got yet another generic, predictable, formulaic and overlong Marvel episode.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes, sure, because it os action packed with some good sceenery and stuff. Would I say it is something profound and touching, thought provoking and lifechanging experience?

Just because the Oscar's didn't nominate any black actors one year, it doesn't mean they need to nominate a mediocre movie for best picture, just because of all the black actors in it. Ugh.
Anyway, I was really looking forward to seeing Black Panther, after hearing all the hype. I was disappointed, as was everyone who saw it with me. Movies need to be about PEOPLE, not white people, or black people, or yellow people. I thought we've moved past this type of thing.
As a superhero movie, it was one of the most forgettable in recent years. Of course I sometimes like to watch movies of this type, even if they aren't the best. I may even watch it again someday. Maybe I'll like it more once the hype dies down, and I don't have any expectations.

Besides Bob, she is my other source of information on the latest movie releases. My movie plans revolve around Archie's seasoned critique. She is the 'recommender of movies', 'maker of plans' and 'booker of tickets' (sometimes gets the theatre wrong but you can't hold that against the Maker) and despite all this, I went ahead and watched the Black Panther even when Archie said that the movie was just average. Could she be wrong? The movie has been setting milestones and is apparently the highest grossing superhero movie.
Though I like the DC comic superheroes better, I prefer watching the Marvel movies. So when Shugz and Hershey asked me if I wanted to watch the movie, I tagged along. 
30 minutes into the movie, I looked at Hershey who looked super engrossed. I waited for 5 more minutes and then hesitatingly asked her if she could understand what was happening. ""Not a clue (or should I say Klaue :D)""she said. 
(NO SPOILERS) Here is the storyline of the movie (I shall refrain from calling it the Plot because the movie lacks one!): The film begins with the 'birth' (figuratively) of the Black Panther and the coming together of the Jabari Tribe to form 'Wakanda'- a nation that portrays itself as a Third World Country to the world, that irrationally refuses foreign aid but is in fact years ahead of its counterparts in technology and refrains from aiding other countries despite having the capacity to do so. 
The source of this technological advancement is Vibranium, a metal available exclusively in Wakanda, that is used in almost everything - fidget spinner like flying saucer, kinetic energy absorbing 'panthersuit', running trains to healing broken vertebrae and turning otherwise gentle rhinos to beasts of war. 
The vibranium falls into the wrong hands, an illegal arms-dealer, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and King T'Chaka's brother (Sterling Brown) is accused of having helped him steal it. 
Post T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) inherits the throne. He is accompanied by his side-kicks, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of his army of bodyguards and his ex-lover, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o)
Klaue steals a Wakandan artefact made of Vibranium from a museum with help from Erik Stevens (Michael Jordan) and plans on selling it to a CIA operative, Everett Ross (Martin Freeman). T'Challa along with Okoye and Nakia head to South Korea to extract the Vibranium before it's sold and also bring back Klaue to Wakanda for justice. The plan goes awry with Klaue escaping, only to be killed later by Erik Stevens.
Erik goes to Wakanda with Klaue's corpse and gains the support of a tribe there and defeats T'Challa in the ritualistic fight for the throne. Skipping the why's and the how's as that would reveal the ""plot"" (for lack of a better word), the story follows with attempts made to restore the rightful heir to the throne. 
Here is why I was disappointed with the movie:
1. Did you see Forest Whitaker mentioned in the storyline above? Well, guess what, he's there in the movie. The movie has an ensemble of brilliant actors but unfortunately they either lack sufficient screen time (Brown and Whitaker) or they aren't ideally suited for the characters being portrayed by them (Freeman and Nyong'o).
2. Many may disagree but Boseman hasn't done complete justice to the role of Black Panther. The character just seems so 'ordinary', there are no quirks that set him apart. 
3. The movie is a hotchpotch of plots. The story seems to have been written along the way, in an attempt to include all that is required to make a Blockbuster Superhero film and then some more.
4. While the actor (Jordan) portraying the role of the villain has made a good attempt, the character of the villain itself is not well-etched. All superhero movies need a Super Villain and Eric Stevens is not intimidating enough. 
5. The dialogues lack in creative ingenuity.
The only time the audience hooted was when Stan Lee made his cameo appearance. 
Thankfully I hear it's a non-sequel movie. It goes to show that the makers of the film too didn't have much confidence in it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Characters are stereotyped and cliche in a boring way.Overall, this is a typical no brain entertainment movies for people who want some kind of light-hearted entertainment, no need to think, just watch the colorful fighting movie , have some fun at the cinema and forget all afterward; then they may enjoy this movie.The high-tech African community in this movie is so American cliche. Many reviews pointed out this. That's why I don't think Wakanda is cool.Personally, I don't like this movie at all. I even become to hate it because of the hype.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It started out promising and lively but then got boring in the middle. Just something about it wasn't as exciting towards the middle to end of movie. Unfortunately, most of it was surprisingly predictable as well. The bad guy didn't sell it for me either. I was confused as to whether he was supposed to be fearsome or admirable, or both, but I felt neither. I guess he was supposed to elicit some type of empathy from the audience or something, but his story was sort of weak and didn't seem the least bit genuine. So in essence, wanted to love this movie but don't.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I love most Marvel movies and The Dark Knight trilogy. I also need to state that I am not a racist, and that I have nothing against an all African American cast. In my book, what matters most to me about a movie is- is it good? Is it entertaining? Is there something original?
Black Panther is not one of the good movies. It's not a good superhero movie and definitely not a good movie overall. It lacks originality as well as a good quality plot, acting is fine but nothing special, no good characters except maybe the villain, but he is nothing special. 
Overall - this movie is so overrated and overhyped it's almost unbearable, just because an all black cast.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Solid Superhero origin story","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4088211/?ref_=tt_urv","gortx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0366508/?ref_=tt_urv","11 March 2018","Setting aside what it represents for the moment, let's just say that Ryan Coogler's BLACK PANTHER is a good solid superhero movie. Just like WONDER WOMAN last year, that should be first and foremost the most important thing to consider.What sets PANTHER apart from most superhero origin movies is that it is largely content with 'just' being an origin story. Ever since SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE set the template, most first movies in a franchise begin with the background tale in the first half, and then proceed to the title character's first adventure. Save for a brief epilogue (and the now de rigeur Marvel credits sequence bits (two, here)), PANTHER ends with Chadwick Boseman's T'Chala fully earning the right to his moniker. No second act.For the most part, the strategy works. Writer-Director Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole have concocted an original enough tale (based on the works of Jack Kirby and a cameo-ing Stan Lee, of course) to keep this a backstory-only adventure. Even though there is a bit of sci-fi to spark the story (a meteorite with a magic metal substance called vibranium), this plays out almost like a tribal sword and sandal tale full of magic kingdoms (Wakanda) and god-like leaders. And, of course, there are the usual warring factions. Bringing the legend to the present day involves a seemingly unrelated theft of a Wakandan weapon in a British museum. The robbery is carried off by a cheeky villain named Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Coogler fave Michael B. Jordan). Getting the weapon back involves international intrigue which includes the involvement of an American spy Ross (Martin Freeman). Family secrets are revealed, battles fought including double-crosses before all is settled.The spins on the usual origin story work for the most part, although there are some points where the pacing sags, and the story-line gets a bit murky. Placing the ancient Wakanda in the context of the modern world gets a bit awkward at times with some cringe-worthy dialogue and even a character flipping the bird. It's not that some of these intrusions of modernism wouldn't intrude on their world, but, it's sometimes an uneasy mix with all the somber respect for past rituals and a certain reverence to mysticism. The acting is solid with stalwarts like Angela Bassett and Forrest Whitaker on hand to add gravitas. The production design and special effects work are solid with some intriguing twists in keeping with the story's more offbeat themes. The music isn't bad, but, one thing the D.C. films have over the Marvel universe are the scores. It's as Marvel purposely doesn't want the soundtracks to compete with their 'vision'.BLACK PANTHER's success - both critical and commercial - is worth noting. Even more so, because the actual movie earns that respect. And, the sight of the all those warrior kings and, especially, queens is sight to behold on the big screen.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Capoeira, Techno-Shamanism and The Future of Africa","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4087692/?ref_=tt_urv","mazzobr","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur72527729/?ref_=tt_urv","11 March 2018","The screenplay shows a hidden country in Africa where technology is quite more advanced what creates cities of beauty and peace. But, inhabitants argue if they need or not to spread this civilization to other parts of troubled and impoverished planet earth. The secret of so advanced science is a type of metal found in this land with special and unusual features. Of course, criminals and CIA want this metal. The Black Panther is also the king of this country. He has the duty to protect the reign and to regain a piece of metal stolen by a criminal that can also reveal the secrets of Nakanda. He is surrounded by a group of woman warriors that protect him and the country. But, inside the country, several tribes fight for governing it. The fight scenes are extremely violent but movements from capoeira and Brazilian jiu-jitsu bring novelty to the combats. All over the scenarios, a mixture of technology and mythology and symbols from African gods, the Orixas, bring such harmony that one could say technology is a type of magic and Nakanda could be said a land of techno-shamanism. Overall the film creates a sex apple that invites us to dream with a world of beauty and peace without any type of racism.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The beautiful and colorful production design is ruined by terrible CGI and bland cinematography. The actors don't seem like they care about the movie and everyone lacks charisma. The main character is just way too boring and bland in this movie. The action is good sometimes and sometimes it's mediocre but there's very few action scenes. There's just a bunch of scenes of boring characters giving out exposition. The script is fine but everything is executed in a boring and unexciting way. This was the first time I fell asleep in a movie in 10 years.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","What Africa could have been if they had a civilisation","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4176716/?ref_=tt_urv","Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52895853/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2018","It is definitely an action packed movie with an interesting story and a few plot twists. I thought it will be boring to watch it with this ""African"" culture, but in reality it is a mix of African and artificial culture, which kind of shows what African countries could have looked like if they had enough wisdom to create their own cultures like asian or european countries did. So it is interesting to watch this made up country with perfect technology, kind of Atlantida or something. Another reason why it was interesting to watch it was because of MARVEL. Their directors can make even a dumb idea look good, so it was indeed interesting. 
Anyways, it is probably one of the weakest Marvel movies in the recent years, even though the story is quite good, but I don't regret watching it, even though it is not really connected to any other Marvel movies.
Andy Serkis was great and as always, it's always good to not watch trailers to have surprises like this.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.
