You don't have to be a plot savant to figure out what is going on and how it will end, but there are enough comedic moments and well cut scenes to keep you engaged if you are just watching to enjoy some family time. As I read another reviewer state, it's a great watch it and forget it type of move. Entertainment for the sake of entertainment! Having said that, there is the reminder of the importance of family and the struggles of raising teenagers. They hit a few of these points spot on. Make more of these types of movies so I can enjoy them with the family please.","39 out of 45 found this helpful.

Sure, but in a wold where,m save a few exceptions, most movies are very slow burns with crap characters only defined by their gender or secuality I'm just hjappy to see a movie that is just a movie.It has heart too, Michele Monagan never disapoints and even Mark Whalberg does a hreat job as the father figure.A fun ride throug and through, jighly recommended in these dark times as we all deserve to crack a laugh.","36 out of 47 found this helpful.

As he was once a rogue agent and trained to kill. And a bunches of henchmen are after him.The plot is okay which involves Mark Wahlberg trying to connect with his teen kids and trying to break the news to his wife the truth.The action sequences are okay and entertaining. Mark Wahlberg did great in the role. The rest of the cast did okay as well. The villain felt underdeveloped. The humor can be cheesy with Mark Wahlberg and the baby fighting with the baby just giggling through tough situations.Overall, it was a pretty fair film with plenty of fun action but cheesy humor.","14 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's not depressing; rather, it's an enjoyable, chill, and fun movie. Some might not like this type of movie, but there's also people like me who just want to watch action-packed scenes without too much gore, not that violent, and especially obscenity scenes. The bed scenes are just okay, which I like since, as I have said, it is just a family-feel-good movie, and it is appropriate for the movie's theme.The casting is perfect; I could sense the connection between the characters and each other, and the interaction of the family is very realistic.The editing is also good, and so far, I have not seen any plot holes. I also love their lines; they wrote the dialogue well. Action scenes are not that repetitive. In that scene where Monaghan broke the bamboo, I really thought she was going to jump, but it was not, and she performed an unexpectable execution.This movie is recommendable and much more exciting compared to the EX4 lol.","21 out of 27 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Apple beefing up its original movies with a solid typical streaming type of movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9498163/?ref_=tt_urv","destroyerwod","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3886859/?ref_=tt_urv","16 December 2023","Part action, part comedy, here comes a Mark Wahlberg movie that is both typical for this actor, but also something you likely saw (or close to) in the past. That said, its 2023 and almost everything has been done already, so the real question is this. Is it well done this time? Is it fun? And the answer is yes.The movie take a bit of inspiration in True Lies but put its own spin on family road trip comedy with some ""We are the Millers"" vibe, while injecting some decent action sequences in there.Having a runtime of 2 hours make sure the movie put enough emphasis on the familly relations and developing its characters, wich can be a definite plus, but at the same time i felt the movie dragged a tiny bit in the first half. Maybe 10-15 minutes could had been cut. But it didn't detract from my enjoyment.Mark Wahlberg is definately in pretty solid shape still, wich make his character completely credible, but he ain't no martial artist so seeing him go toe to toe with Lateef Crowder (a Copeira expert) did showcase some of his shortcoming. That said, that scene was meant as a mix of comedy and action and not to be taken too seriously so for most peoples who are not martial arts afficionados, it should not be a problem. The rest of the action including gun scenes were well done.Michelle Monaghan is also pretty solid in her role as the mom of the familly. Charming and charismatic. The kids also got to have enough screen time and developement that they felt usefull and interesting in the story. Every character pretty much as its own arc.Overall its a movie that i taught was pretty enjoyable on a first watch. It is a mix between comedy and action but at the same time since it never fully commit to either side, you can't say its a super funny comedy or a big action movie. It is a bit of everything and it makes for a good story tough.Ultimately not every movie is meant to be watch multiple times and considering Apple TV+ has a pretty limited selection of mainstream original movies (Ghosted being one of the few great ones), it is a welcome addition that both casual viewers and cinephile should enjoy.","34 out of 48 found this helpful.

From the routine ways in which he showed his wife how much he loved her to the lack of ability to connect with his children.It is only when he is forced to bring his secrets into the light with his family is he truly able to connect with them.While it may not feel fresh, this movie does a good job at paying homage to the original as well as offering something new.Wahlberg, Monaghan, Colletti, and Crosby do a fine job bringing the characters to life in fun and enjoyable ways.While this movie may not win any awards - it is certainly a fun watch.","12 out of 15 found this helpful.

There's product placement, but not too much. There's staggering violence, but it's all squeaky clean so it can be a Xmas movie. All the supporting cast is ethnic just the right amount. The family is flush with tremendous cash, which helps plot advancement as well as beautiful cinematography / scenes.It was very enjoyable, assuming enough suspension of disbelief. The whole thing is obviously very predictable, but it's executed nicely.

This ain't Oppenheimer, folks. My wife and I had zero expectations when we tuned in and this movie more than surpassed the low bar we had set. It was cute, funny, and mildly action-oriented, with better than expected acting and a few moments that were actually pretty funny and heart-warming.

How easy is it just to remake a high scoring film but without the large budget. This is so copied from True Lies, even the main character has the same job and there is also the evil Asian woman. The ending with a show out against the baddies in an empty building, same. Between the first and last act there is the road trip ala National Lampoon's Vacation and it feels as boring as the real trip possibly would be. A few scenes are inserted to show how the kids and parents are growing to eachother. The film is trying to copy the light hearted touch of True Lies but fails. Is it a bad film? No surprisingly it is entertaining enough to sit along, mainly due to the main characters Mark Wahlberg and the amazing Michelle Monaghan. It's an actrice I don't see much, but she does a great job and it feels there is chemistry between both persons. And Mark Wahlberg never changes and I still love this guy for his commitment.","31 out of 47 found this helpful.

Faced with the resurgence of adversaries from his past, Dan opts for an unconventional escape strategy - packing his wife (Michelle Monaghan), teenage daughter, teenage son, and a surprisingly pivotal character, their 10-month-old baby, into a minivan for an impromptu cross-country road trip to Las Vegas.While the film doesn't break any new ground in terms of its narrative, what elevates it from the run-of-the-mill action comedy is the unexpected star power of the youngest member of the ensemble - the adorable 10-month-old baby. In the midst of explosions, car chases, and typical action sequences, the infant manages to steal the spotlight, providing moments of genuine humor and heart that resonate with audiences.Wahlberg and Monaghan deliver performances true to their seasoned capabilities, injecting charm and charisma into their respective roles as parents navigating the chaos. However, it's the interactions involving the 10-month-old that inject a refreshing element into the formulaic proceedings. The clever use of the baby's innocence and unpredictability adds a layer of authenticity to the family dynamic, serving as the unexpected source of both comedic relief and genuine warmth.Despite the film's adherence to a tried-and-true formula, the endearing presence of the youngest family member helps ""The Family Plan 2023"" rise above the monotony. The action-packed road trip may not offer groundbreaking storytelling, but the delightful twist of placing the spotlight on the 10-month-old character gives this predictable family adventure an endearing and memorable touch, making it a worthwhile watch for those seeking a lighthearted blend of action and family dynamics.","39 out of 64 found this helpful.

Right from the beginning, the acting felt unnaturally theatrical, especially in the interactions between the characters. Even with Mark Wahlberg onboard, the performances felt hollow and contrived, making it impossible to connect with the story. The dialogue sounded forced, devoid of any genuine emotion or natural flow, resembling more of a scripted reading than a genuine conversation, especially with the kids. The plot, involving an ex-hitman chased by villains while on a family road trip, rapidly descended into ridiculousness and absurdity. The attempted seriousness in life-threatening situations failed miserably, with laughably unrealistic scenarios that never worked after adding the comedic tone. The entire premise felt like a mockery, leaving me thoroughly disappointed and uninterested in continuing. It's a shame considering the potential of the initial concept, but the execution was nothing short of a train wreck. This is the type of movie the people would leave in the background while playing UNO.","39 out of 80 found this helpful.

It's like watching a super hero movie and having no concerns about the powers the actors have--it's a super hero movie! Same with this comedy.

I tend to get bored with non-stop action movies that spurt blood constantly and have no actual human characters.

A couple of supporting performances by Ciarán Hinds and Maggie Q help to counteract Mark Wahlberg's awful lead and contribute to making this drivel barely watchable overall. I might try to share some of the unmemorable plot points, but I only like watching movies with memorable characters, and Ms. Monaghan and the character of her toddler are the only ones present here. Along with more plot holes than Swiss cheese. Did we need a full two, mind-numbing hours to include more pointless & bloodless stunt work? For the love of God, no, of course we didn't. If you think seeing Wahlberg's abs or Monaghan under a sheet in a luxury Vegas suite is worth the wasted hours you can never get back, go ahead and squander it away on this one, folks.","42 out of 89 found this helpful.

He takes on the lead role in the recently premiered action film ""Family Plan"" on Apple TV, portraying a former killer and agent.Adding a touch of diversity to the cast is Li Meiqi, an Asian actress who plays a significant supporting antagonist. Undoubtedly, she stands out as one of Hollywood's most stunning Asian female stars. While she's been cast in decorative roles before, her four-year stint in the TV series ""Nikita,"" which started in 2010, has undoubtedly solidified her presence in the competitive realm of Hollywood.The narrative of ""Family Plan"" unfolds as a tale of a former special agent assassin who, after going off the grid and starting a family, finds himself pursued by a relentless organization. The only option left is to go on the run with his entire family. Despite its straightforward plot with minimal twists and humor, the film has managed to earn a commendable 7.2 rating on IMDb, based on 71 audience reviews.Taking a closer look, the movie appears to draw inspiration from ""True Lies,"" a factor that might resonate with fans of Schwarzenegger's earlier works. However, beyond this familiarity, the film boasts commendable action sequences, and its overall narrative pace is expertly handled, preventing it from succumbing to dullness.The increasing inclusion of new Asian faces in Hollywood productions is a noteworthy trend. These aren't the stereotypical portrayals but refreshing talents like Li Meiqi and Daniel Wu. With the burgeoning influence of the film and entertainment culture from emerging Asian nations, particularly South Korea, Hollywood must address and dismantle its antiquated stereotypes, especially those depicting Asians with big faces and squinty eyes.In a nutshell, ""Family Plan"" stands as a worthwhile addition to the action movie genre. However, it's worth noting that the film crew might have exercised a bit too much frugality in their use of ketchup, metaphorically speaking. This nuanced observation adds an element of critique without overshadowing the overall positive appraisal of the movie.","41 out of 109 found this helpful.

There's nothing significantly special about the film, but it provides a family aspect while still giving entertaining action.The main draw for me was Mark Wahlberg. I'm always entertained by his stuff. He doesn't give a standout performance, but he hasn't lost his mojo yet. Michelle Monaghan, Zoe Colletti, and Van Crosby round out the family perfectly. I don't know them as actors very well, but their attributes are perfectly suited to their characters. My favourite character was baby Max. The infectious laughing and giggles reminded me of Jack Jack from ""The Incredibles"".The story is good and progresses well despite being a little long. It doesn't just focus on action and killing. It also brings the family issues to a front so bad guys are the only things being combatted. Trying to navigate different things while trying to keep everyone safe. The characters don't feel rigid. Everyone has an ability that adds to the survival.I enjoyed the looks and sounds of the film. The different environments and landscapes made it feel like you were part of the road trip. Sounds were a huge deal for this film to work. Lots of gunfire, punches, glass, and vehicles being fired, broken, or moving. The main take was punches and glass sounded natural either by landing properly with the visual, or not being bigger than what the object was. Glass bottle shattered like a glass bottle and a table the same thing. The music wasn't too shabby either. It all worked perfectly for the enjoyment of the film.Overall, this is an enjoyable family action flick though you don't have to watch it with your family. The downside is if swearing isn't your thing then maybe skip it. If you like Mark Wahlberg then he's worth the time. The movie does a good job to draw you into the family while also entertaining you with action and violence. Looks and sounds like a film of this calibre should look and sound like.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

I took a day off and picked it back up and made it to the final third which had a bit more to chew on. I was on board at that point and things got at bit more fun and interesting, relatively speaking.I think the idea with this film was to try to repeat the success of Instant Family, which was a great film. The cliché is you never know until you try and in this case The Family Plan tried and came up a little bit short but I still liked it.There were some decent performances in this film, although not from Mark. I'm not sure what happened, but he seemed zoned out during this. Maybe he was busy managing the film and not focusing on his acting? A subjective thought, perhaps.Ultimately the film wraps things up nicely with some feel-good scenes.One major flaw I will point out is that the film seems to be leaning towards the family-friendly direction, but has various aspects that will not work for most families. Quite a shame, because the message is reasonably good and with just a tiny bit of editing this would have been a fun family night film for even younger teens. As-is, it's more older teen and adult.

And so it was this time. It's not a super ambitious movie, but it's good entertainment. At times a similar atmosphere to 'We're the Millers' (but note: certainly less funny).Simple, uncomplicated plot, predictable (of course!), but really good entertainment for a Friday/Saturday evening. For me, Mark Wahlberg is a guarantee of a good movie, and that was the case this time.Cool music is a nice addition. Really awesome Michelle Monaghan and Maggie Q!","9 out of 12 found this helpful.

A ton of ludicrous and implausible scenes stitched together in a contrived feel good way.I'm happy with the acting skills, it's the plot that is the let down. For most of the movie, viewers are wondering where the cops are. Violence in casinos and on the roads are left unanswered by police or security. Why?The extremely unlikely case of the family revolting against dear ol' dad just because he killed a few people is extremely unrealistic as well. There are bad people in the world, and there are assassins. And it is not wrong to take bad people out. Would you cry if someone were to take out Putin today? This manufactured outrage is tiring exhausting and unbelievable.All in all, certainly a watchable movie. Somewhat enjoyable.

The first 75% of the script aside from the obvious anachronisms could have easily been something written in the 1950s. The characters are devoid of the many histrionics that seem to have become a staple of modern movie's characters.I can't remember the last time I watched a family comedy where at least one of the main cast wasn't insufferable but here we actually have a healthy loving family for once! And that's not to say this family doesn't have problems. In fact the first half of the movie is dedicated to the family's problems and personal dramas but they work through them as normal mature people who have conflicting perspectives on the world rather than screaming at each other incessantly. While all of this is going on we have the time to get to know and care for each member of the family, so when the danger picks up in the second half we actually care about what's going on.This movie doesn't break any new ground, but again, what makes this movie good isn't that they add a bunch of new things, it's that for once many of the defects that seem to affect practically all modern family entertainment are absent, and for that I say bravo!Lastly I can't end this without mentioning how good all the cast was, with special mention for Michelle Monaghan navigating an unbelievable situation with a very believable performance.","14 out of 21 found this helpful.

His most enjoyable roles place tactfully little pressure on his talents. Those roles use mild humor to avoid any expectation of dramatic acting.

It doesn't disappoint because our expectations are solidly aimed at the bulls eye, going in. We all know what MW will give us, and he always does. Wahlberg is the MacDonalds of entertainment.

Not like this movie differs in realism than half others which feature the same kind of character.Which I found most boring are fighting and shooting scenes. If you'd compare this to some real action movie you'd give that segment like 5/10. On the other hand in some other compartments like comedy, dialogue, acting, etc.. movie is entertaining, so it averages about 6-7/10.Cinematography is very good, acting good. No glitches in acting that would take your attention away and take you out of the movie.I have no idea why some bashes this movie so much. I'd give it a chance.

It is pretty slow to develop but the action picks up. It suffers from the typical glaring continuity and consistency issues, usually inherent in these types of films, but they're easy to get past and settle into the rhythm.

Not a drop of blood is to be seen although plenty of shots are fired. Mark Wahlberg has always been a second rate action hero for me and he does not surprise that way or the other in this one. Michelle Monaghan as the supporting actor is doing a good job, but again nothing that will knock your socks off.The kids also have an interesting story-line on their own and the movie deals with spy movie-esq plot along side a tale of family values and coming-of-age lessons. Just keep in mind this is a family movie aimed for teenagers, therefore not very serious and nothing you haven't seen before.One thing that I found refreshing was the eSport angle. Without giving too much away, I enjoyed seeing that in a mainstream movie and thought it was handled with a good level of realism.How to rate this movie? It's nothing special, however it's enjoyable and can be watched by the entire family, if taken as such it is not a bad watch, however Mark and Michelle are not Brad & Angelina.

Violence is the greatest aspect - and due to the violence, I'd not suggest this for younger viewers. It's NOT a ""family film"" due to the violence.-----------------All that being posted.. and irrelevant to the actual storyline... it was VERY strange to see these optics from an Apple film... all these henchmen chasing down this white suburban family are black. Seriously, ALL the low-level street henchmen/killer were black.. the race dynamics were so, so prevalent they were readily apparent to me. And honestly, that's rarely anything I would notice.","19 out of 31 found this helpful.

One can add to the interest by spotting all the references to other films, from the opening ""Truman"" to ""Killers"" and ""True Lies"" and even ""Baby's Day Out"".The key theme running through the film is family and the way dealing with adversity can heal petty family rifts, especially when individual (and often unexpected) talents are employed and earn merited admiration.Where Hollywood might benefit from taking a closer look is the way comedy and violence are melded in a way that makes the latter appear normal and even funny. It lacks the gratuitous and even sadistic violence of the John Wick series and Tarrantino films, but the number of dead mount up and within the context appear to be thoroughly justified.In sum, worth a watch but not a strong recommendation, as tastes on this may vary considerably.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Michelle Monaghan is so charming I only barely resented her being cast as a typical suburban mom. I mean come on, she's THAT beautiful and still manages to pull off kinda dorky and goofy? The baby was very clever too and also not annoying. The important ground this movie broke was going back to the day when we could all sit down with snacks, be entertained rather than preached at, teenagers could still be shown loving their parents, and a family could stick together and win the day!

The movie follows the life of Jack Cunningham (Wahlberg), a former high school basketball phenom who takes on the unexpected role of coaching his alma mater's struggling basketball team.One of the standout aspects of the film is Wahlberg's compelling performance. His portrayal of Jack is both gritty and emotionally resonant, capturing the character's internal struggles and growth throughout the storyline. The supporting cast also delivers commendable performances, adding depth to the narrative.The plot, while somewhat predictable, manages to keep the audience invested with its well-executed blend of sports, family dynamics, and personal redemption. The basketball scenes are thrilling and well-choreographed, providing an adrenaline rush that complements the more emotional moments in the film.The Family Man explores themes of second chances, sacrifice, and the importance of family bonds. The character development is a strong suit, allowing viewers to connect with the struggles and triumphs of the main characters.However, the film does have its flaws. Some plot points feel clichéd, and the pacing could be tighter in certain scenes. Additionally, while the comedic elements add levity, they occasionally disrupt the overall tone of the movie.In terms of visuals and cinematography, The Family Man is competent but not groundbreaking. The director effectively captures the intensity of the basketball games and the intimacy of family moments, but the visual style lacks the innovation seen in some other contemporary films.In conclusion, ""The Family Man"" is a solid addition to the sports drama genre, elevated by Mark Wahlberg's compelling performance and an engaging narrative. While it may not break new ground, it delivers a satisfying blend of action, emotion, and character development. A 6-star rating signifies a movie that is above average and certainly worth a watch, especially for fans of Wahlberg and sports-themed dramas.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, I was quite surprised, and pleased, that that wasn't the case. Now don't get me wrong, the movie's idea is not new and you'll feel like you've watched this multiple times before but I'm actually a fan of the genre and enjoy those types of movies.To start off, the movie wasn't totally lame. The jokes and the comedic scenarios were pretty decent. The action scenes, and although they weren't many, were quite entertaining and engaging as I feel like they were placed and the right timing. Now the story is basically a combination between an action comedy movie and a family roadtrip movie which was unique and not so unique at the same time. You will see that family bonding and character development that you see in those types of movies but with a little spice to it. Also, the ending and the events leading to the ending were a bit cheesy and predictable.The whole cast and especially the members of the family had really good performances but Michelle Monaghan really stands out to me.Overall, a pretty fun movie for people who aren't looking for anything too serious to watch.Score:7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His past catches up to him and he has to take his unsuspecting family on the run.The film was directed by Simon Cellan Jones. Writing credits go to David Coggeshall.THINGS I LIKED:
I love Mark Wahlberg. He's equally talented in drama, action, and comedy. Here in Las Vegas where he lives (and I live), he has a great reputation as being a stand-up, family man. That's impressive to me. He and his co-star in this movie, Michelle Monaghan, also starred together in the movie Patriot's Day back in 2016.I'm wondering when Michelle Monaghan and Maggie Q are ever going to start aging. They both look amazing.A character in the movie is named Kyle but he has a fake passport with the name Van, which is the real name of the actual actor: Van Crosby.Adele gets a couple of shoutouts during the film. Who doesn't love Adele? Mark Wahlberg's character said, ""She has the voice of an angel.""
I loved the Las Vegas scenes. I live in Vegas, Baby! There's always so much to see and do here.Keep watching during the final rolling credits for some cute images and more funny clips.Vanilla Ice. Ha haTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The characters felt like...characters. Nothing felt real in the story. I know, it's supposed to be a silly comedy, but it made the film feel hollow and overly cheesy somehow.Teenage daughters in movies are always portrayed like complete monsters. The one in this movie was extremely unlikely until Act 3.The scenarios are completely ridiculous. The characters' reactions to various things are unrealistic and, at times, really odd. Just check your brain out the door so you can enjoy this.A lot of the jokes don't land.Ultimately, the film is extremely formulaic and cliched.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity, including 1 F-bomb
Some sexual innuendos and talk of sex
Violence with various weapons
Very high dead body count
Destruction
We see a shirtless man.A mom chugs beer upside down
A married couple makes out in bed
People are in perilous situations
A teenage girl flips the bird
We see a teenage boy kill a bunch of animated people in video games.!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I will not lie that the movie did entertain me and there were things that worked in the movie's favor, but the movie The Family Plan (2023), though entertaining, could have been better because of the potential of some the things it does; along with it also having some good performances from the main actors playing the family, with there also being a standard villain.Mark Wahlberg was not bad in the movie as a normal suburban dad secretly being an assassin; he is good at taking care of his family, even if the son and daughter do not agree with some of his choices like to keep them off technology, but he does try his best when doing hand to hand combat to not kill someone. He was not bad as an assassin, and you can tell he has skills, though I would have liked an in-depth backstory on how he became an assassin instead of dropping it near the end in the third act; the rest of the family was ok with the wife played by Michelle Monaghan being not bad, and the three kids were fine with the older brother and sister at times being annoying. They do a lot of bonding on the trip, and the dad helps his son and daughter in a way that can help them, like the son being a pro at playing video games and the daughter getting over a bad boyfriend she had with her finding a college.The villain is someone who knows the dad's past as an assassin, but he is still a standard villain who does not do much and could have been better; there is also a reveal of a character who I did not care for that much and forgot was in the movie. The action scenes could have been better than they were by taking out the multiple cuts they have, and making it easy to see what it is happening, other than that the action scenes are ok and fun enough; there are a lot of things that had potential which only made the movie good enough with only an occasional funny moment and moments that can seem similar to other movies that have a similar premise.I will not say The Family Plan (2023) is bad, but I will say it is entertaining enough and the performances are not bad, also I would say this movie had some potential to being better than it was. The villain could have been better, it could have been a bit funnier than it was, and the way the action scenes look is ok but could have been when comes to seeing what is happening; this is not a movie to rush and see on the Apple TV+ streaming service, so do not expect a great movie, just expect a movie that is good enough.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was even hoping that this was an indirect sequel to Mark Wahlberg's 1998 The Big Hit where a much younger Mark played an assassin. Unfortunately it's just not very well done.Mark and Michelle Monaghan have great chemistry in their scenes, and none of the actors are bad per se, but the script is hokey and silly, and the kids' subplots are so cringe it's painful. Like, agonizingly painful.More importantly, the emotional beats just never land properly, and neither does the comedy. They even steal the ""but they were all bad,"" line from the VASTLY superior Arnold Schwarzenegger film True Lies (1994), and all it does is emphasize just how much worse this film with a very similar plot is.I like that Mark Wahlberg is making family-friendly films now. I've enjoyed a few of them. Just not this one. This one you should probably avoid. It's definitely not the worst thing you'll see this year, but it's not good either.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Twenty or thirty years ago Disney produced schlocky poorly created movies lumped into a category called Afterschool Movie Specials. They were all bad, thinly plotted and badly acted, but for grade schoolers and nerdy high schoolers they provided content in a three network viewing household. Netflix (and in this case Apple TV) has jumped into that void for a new generation of teens and tweens looking for a video that's easily digestible, but not substantial. This movie, and others like it (Role Play with Oyelowo and Cuoco) fill that niche.Mark Wahlberg has been in a lot of movies. A few of them very good (The Departed, The Fighter), but even in those he wasn't the best actor.In a movie like this he's expected to carry it. But even though he's serviceable, his comedic talents aren't enough to pull it together.Add to that the fact that the movie swings from screwball comedy, to thriller, to domestic melodrama, it's a mess.It feels like it wants to be True Lies, or Mr and Mrs Smith, or fill-in-the-blank. But all the films that have tried to emulate that movie have missed. This does as well.And because there have been so many clones of True Lies we can easily predict how everything will work out.The wife doing a 180 wanting to leave and take the kids with her though, is just one of many tonal shifts that don't work.When the crazy fight sequences (that are terribly choreographed) at the end take place there's no tension at all. We know the family will be okay, that they'll all contribute in unexpectedly badass ways, and that it will all be wrapped up in a bow.Even Michelle Monaghan can't trade her work from the Mission Impossible films into something worth watching.Bummer.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Nothing makes this a standout example of this artificially sweetened genre, but nothing makes it a flop. It's a fairly bland, run-of-the-mill, straight to TV example. There seems to have been an attempt to build in some interesting subplots, but they are best ignored as they go nowhere. There are possibly notable interpersonal conflicts, but nothing that isn't part of the usual family tensions. The comedy is shallow, perhaps eliciting an occasional smirk. The action is well choreographed, but adds little. The overall result is a passable time-waster.

Nearly everyone is miscast, from Mark to the rest of the family. So simple, so predictable.Go watch another movie, they're getting to be all so similar now, and anything is better than this.I'm thinking that Mark was the executive producer on this vanity project, so he couldn't really see just how bad his acting skills are. 2/10, one or two funny parts otherwise quickly forgettable.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

(But the tone shifts wildly) I honestly don't think the creators knew what this thing was. There's this whole subplot about the son being good at video games so of course he's made to be a spy's eye in the sky. It could have been a statement about the secrets families keep hidden from each other but why would they do that?Really not as into it as I thought I'd be. I'd definitely prefer the comedy I imagined in my head. Baddies Maggie Q and Ciaran Hinds can't even save this lacklustre flick. They aren't in it very much which just seems a waste. (But really I just wanted it to be funny.) And it really falls flat.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Me and my whole family, including our little ones really loved it. Not vulgar sexual jokes and references, except a very few intimate scenes which we skipped. Other than that, most of the language and acting was clean. The movie concentrated in making sure the story line was excellent, which was! A big thumbs up because we all liked it and we loved seeing our kids having a laugh every now and then.It was very family oriented and the storyline was kept from a family point of view which many comedy movies completely miss understanding. So this movie got it spot on and really made us laugh. For 2023, we have not had a family movie which we felt like we would watch it again. But this one is for sure one that we do not mind watching it again.Maybe the next sequel can be kept even more kids friendly with the same level of family oriented fun and exciting action which all kids and parents can relate to.","14 out of 30 found this helpful.

If it's funny you can get away with unrealistic and fake things, but otherwise you just leave me hanging. I kept waiting for that moment where I thought, OK I see where you are coming from and going. Mark is not an actor, but a character and still, he manages to disappoint, not one of his jokes landed, not a single one. About 75% of the movie feels like an elevator ride and when you step out it's just a lot of cringe that Michael Bay fans appreciate: just action and special effects.It's predictable and I think the only thing that made me laugh was the cringe at certain things. I first thought this might be a good movie to see while folding laundry or something.

Both far superior to this film. A minor difference being they strap in a toddler into this film and use far too many cut away shots of the kid reacting to the mayhem. The storyline is far too predictable, and there are no plot twists that you don't see coming from miles away. Wahlberg has no chemistry with anyone he is playing opposite. Your time would be better spent with ""Spenser Confidential"" than this potboiler. The two adult women are wasted in this movie, the teenage storyline could have been written by any high school freshman.

That very day is the 18th wedding anniversary of Dan and Jessica, who are getting ready to go out and celebrate, leaving their 3 kids (2 teenagers and a latecomer-baby) on their own. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie...Couple of comments: this is the latest from British director Simon Cellan Jones, best known for his TV work. Here he gets a shot at a big production Hollywood film, which focuses on a family road trip from Buffalo to Vegas (1st hour) and what unfolds in Vegas (2nd hour). The plot is as unlikely as it is unbelievable (average/boring dad/husband turns into a James Bond-like character) but that aside, the production is super-smooth, with some big action scenes. Mark Wahlberg (as Dan) can do this type of movie in his sleep. If it sounds like I am being negative about this movie, I am not. I found myself surprised that I stayed with the movie through the end. This movie is perfect holiday fare: mindless entertainment, nothing more, nothing less.""The Family Plan"" recently premiered on Apple TV, where I caught it the other night. If you are in the mood for a family-oriented action comedy that provides mindless entertainment, I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The film, intended as a comedic action flick, unfortunately, misses the mark in delivering humor, leaning heavily into a more generic and uninspired narrative.The plot, reminiscent of an 80s glorification of the American lifestyle and capitalism, is riddled with predictability and lacks depth. The film's attempt to recreate the vibrancy and charm of its predecessor is overshadowed by a series of unrealistic action sequences and notable plot holes, detracting from its overall appeal.Wahlberg, while a competent actor, struggles to infuse the necessary charisma and comedic timing into his role. The script's brainless approach and failure to innovate or offer fresh perspectives on the genre leave the audience with a sense of déjà vu, failing to capture the originality and wit of ""True Lies.""In essence, ""The Family Plan"" serves as a reminder of the challenges in reviving classic themes without adding substantial new elements or perspectives. Its lack of humor, combined with a predictable storyline, makes it a forgettable addition to the action-comedy genre. The film's over-reliance on unrealistic action and an 80s nostalgia that doesn't quite resonate with contemporary audiences further dilutes its impact, resulting in a movie experience that is, regrettably, more tedious than entertaining.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Not to brag about it, but I really enjoyed this movie and everything it gives, Movie deserves at least 7 to 8 overall rating from what is worth.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I don't know what else it is supposed to be because the jokes were to lame to be funny, the romance too cheesy to be taken seriously, and the conversation to mind-numbing to add any depth. Sadly, there was a lot of talking. And only little of the promised fun and action.But things get even worse. The movie does a good job in presenting a lot of stereotypes, so many people hoped Hollywood was done with: the ignorant house wive who doesn't get what's going on, always the female characters holding the baby, non-white actors only in the ""bad guys"" roles, wrong type of jokes, and the list goes on and on.In conclusion, the only thing this movie really is is boring. Additionally, the values this movie conveyed are some, I did not expect from an Apple TV production. In fact, not from any modern movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story is simply about a family, and a father that hides his dark, bloody past. When things are getting out of control for him, he has to take the mission in his own hands and hide his true identity from his family. First, I had an impression that this was going to be a fun comedy that can live on its action, but turned out to be an unoriginal flick that really looks like it's written be Ai. First I got to mention the characters. I remembered maybe half of the names, because I never get connected that much (Besides the father, Sean, the main hero) that by the way carried the cast mostly. Sean as a character himself was interesting, but unfortunately not so interesting as I expected him to be. The villain he had to fight came out of nowhere and felt totally out of place, in my opinion. His backstory came more on the end, too, and I wished maybe a little peak before. Sean's wife (The Mother) was fun, yet she was very plastic and the actress could be more of a food commercial women. The kids are the most predictable characters, easily comparable to kids from other family comedies. It's always a computer dude, a weirdo and some little kid. A few of the action sequences were acceptable, yet not so great as I expected. Generic and predictable, it tried to make things interesting but ended with a cheesy cliché that should never took have place. I got really surprised over the camera filming and overall quality, and sometimes I think that not only Apple sponsored this movie, but helped to make it with their cameras. I don't know if I liked it or not, it was a weird feeling in the filming, I don't know, something was just strange. The movie was carried by nice soundtrack, as well as nice suspense score that was good, but some of the action was so lame that the music was wasted for nothing, and that's bad, because they could use it for something much better. In the end, this is an Ai-Script, bad, plastic acting, as well as uninteresting and forgettable action. The rating was saved some more by a few good sequences and nice soundtrack overall.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I've only made it through the first 3rd of the movie before giving up and writing this.There are a great deal of MEMEs floating around about the lack of originality in Hallmark movie plots. We can certainly apply the same judgement to this film.If your an action movie fan but you just can't get enough of dysfunctional families with obnoxious children where nobody gets along (and, as a bonus for adults with children of your own, you want to slap these kids twice for every frame of the movie they occupy), this might be a great use of 2 hours for you. For the rest of us who prefer to have at least one character in a movie we actually care about, this The Family Plan falls short.Honestly, the husband and wire are a tolerable couple with average communication issues. Even the baby makes for some amusing scenarios. Perhaps the movie could have been more watchable if we just left out the teenagers.Even Mark Walberg's considerable charm is not enough to make up for the stress of near streaming whininess and back talk found it the first 40 minutes of the film.Of course, in true Hallmark fashion, by the end everyone will have grown a bit and familial harmony will abound after the bad guys have been vanquished.Unfortunately, that's just not a good enough reason to continue watching. The lead character should have left his family at the start. They would have been safer, and he would have more peace in his life; on the run, looking over his shoulder and engaging in deadly battles every few hours.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Mark Walhberg does try to infuse some fun but the dialogues are so lackluster that it makes it hard for anybody to make them instantly work. The runtime too feels longer as the conflict doesn't look as serious as they intend to be despite the light hearted treatment but the action blocks too are routine. Overall, it adds upto the list of disappointing Christmas films.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I actually re-ran it for days in order to cleanse my mind after the Greta Gerwig joint.Thus I may be biased after BARBIE trauma but THE FAMILY PLAN is a generic action comedy done just the way it should be and proud of its cliches performed with utmost conviction.You can't really say that Simon Cellan Jones made the Mark Wahlberg version of TRUE LIES because he is not the filmmaking god of Jim's stature. But if TRUE LIES was made a by a mere mortal then yeah we can say this is the Mark Wahlberg TRUE LIES.Mark Wahlberg is such a talented performer and he is believable both in action and comedy and family situations. Michelle Monaghan delivers all that Jamie Lee Curtis brought to TRUE LIES, and she is a fully age appropriate partner to the leading man.David Coggeshall wisely sticks to the Liman's MR AND MRS SMITH concept where we don't deal with the villains most of the time and there are no boring parallel plot strands with villians shouting orders and coming up with ways to hurt our heros. At the final showdown, we actually get a pretty fresh take on the dynamic between hero and villain.The balancing act between action and comedy is well done. Simon Cellan Jones directs exciting action. He tries to keep the Wahlberg character to the absolute minimum when it comes to actually killing people but even when it comes to merely incapatiting opponents it is done in a visceral high octane Jason Bourne manner. So film is visually well-balanced both when it comes to style and rhytm. In a way Simon Cellan Jones in terms of vibrancy actually surpasses typical action comedy and offers a fully devoted directorial approach. Obviously, the director of photography Michael Burgess deserves to be mentioned as well.THE FAMILY PLAN is like a rerun that you actually like better now then when you saw it first.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Such dated and insensitive portrayals should be a thing of the past. It's 2023, and the people at Apple Orginals should have progressed beyond these stereotypes.Beyond the problematic stereotypes, there's so much else wrong with this movie. The narrative pacing is utterly off the rails. The acting is atrocious, truly horrible. Many scenes drag on far too long, and the film could easily have been cut down to 90 minutes.

Even thought the side plots were tied together pretty nicely.The combat scenes were just not believable for any adult to watch but as a family time killer it's not a horrendeously bad flick either.Sadly for adults it's a snoozefest and the real ha ha's never come..","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Mark Wahlberg stars as Dan Morgan, a former assassin who has to protect his family from his old enemies while hiding his true identity. The movie is full of clichés, stereotypes, and unrealistic scenarios that are neither funny nor exciting. The characters are shallow and annoying, the plot is predictable and boring, and the action scenes are poorly choreographed and edited. The movie wastes the talents of Michelle Monaghan, Ciaran Hinds, and Said Taghmaoui, who play Dan's wife, boss, and friend, respectively. The only thing that might make you laugh in this movie is the baby, who makes cute noises and faces while Dan fights off bad guys. The Family Plan is a disappointing and forgettable movie that should have stayed in the family vault....I lost it when she shot at the elevator 😭😭😭","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, a regrettable choice in portraying antagonists solely as individuals of African, Asian, and Italian descent introduces an uncomfortable racial dynamic. The lack of diversity in this aspect mars an otherwise outstanding plot. With a touch of sarcasm, one can't help but wonder if the filmmakers forgot to include Latino adversaries, leaving the audience questioning the film's inclusivity. Despite this misstep, the gripping storyline manages to keep viewers engaged, making it a commendable cinematic experience.""","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I really miss good old sober Mark. I don't know if he's drunk, high, or if his brain is damaged from all that drinking and drug use. He just looks and sounds intoxicated in most, or maybe all the scenes. You can see that he tries to hide it, which makes it kind of easier to see. With the constant head flips when he talks, he speaks like a drunk person speaks to a police officer, his eyes flicker, etc. Why doesn't anyone help him? Stop putting him in movies until he's sober. It's an embarrassment to himself as a person, and the movies he plays in. Enough is enough.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Mostly in earnest, often quite respectable, here in comic, correct ridiculous, and rather disappointing.Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan as a couple are still the best thing about the film, the chemistry is right. Apart from that, the film is light, correct me again, shallow, maybe just for a side film or if you're in the mood for feel-good slop. The entertainment factor increases towards the finale, but sorry, rubbish remains rubbish. One of those films with a half-life of one day at most.P. S. Anyone who didn't know what ""Valorant"" is, like me, now knows, thanks to product placement every 10 minutes.

Things are so implausible and so unrealistic that it's laughable at times, even during the dramatic scenes. And the baby? The baby is one of the most annoying part of the entire movie, and his voice is obviously dubbed in afterwards which makes things look even more silly. Surprised that this was not any better than it was. Maybe someone should remake this down the road and actually do a decent job of making a film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Actually they're both closer to lame than anyone else in this movie.The script is ridiculous, its story thinner than a stale soup a third rate deli and action scenes are tedious and boring. There's no excitement or real drama. Actually the game outtakes must be considered the best action in this movie. Nothing is novel really. It's all a hodgepodge of very loose ideas concocted into a quite bland meal.Comedy, you say?

Including a series called True Lies. This Mark Wahlberg vehicle is portrayed as a comedy/action movie. But although there is plenty of action, I found few laughs.The plot is what you would exect. Ex agent with special skills is pursued across America after being accidently outed. Cue car chases during which he tries to keep his family ignorant of his past. Cue fight scenes in the background of wife and children looking at a college for their daughter.But it's all very two dimensional with villains and endless henchmen for Wahlberg to deal with. Production values save this from being a total losd whilst the cast play the roles seriously. So watch on a boring day.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

The film's central premise, featuring a retired assassin attempting a new life, is tired and lacks the innovation needed to stand out in the genre.The action sequences, highlighted in various reviews, dominate the narrative, leaving little room for character development or a compelling storyline. Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of the assassin seems uninspired, contributing to the forgettable nature of the film. Despite the potential for a fresh take on the retired hitman trope, ""The Family Plan"" succumbs to formulaic shoot-'em-up sequences that fail to elevate the overall viewing experience.In summary, the movie's overemphasis on action, coupled with a worn-out plot, makes ""The Family Plan"" a forgettable addition to the genre.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Although I dont think the writing of this movie is necessary bad, it's just unoriginal. The acting and directing seem ok enough but for my taste, they're just more of the same old spy story.

Although it starts with promise -- Walhberg's ex-government assassin -- fighting off an opponent in a grocery store with his baby strapped to his chest, it degenerates into one of those hum-drum family road comedies.You know the ones... kids don't respect their parents and don't get along with each other, parents trying and failing to do right by their kids, parents fretting about the spark in their marriage... It might have helped if the dialogue had some bite to it, but, nope, it's not sharp, or witty, or terribly funny.On the acting front only Michelle Monaghan comes off as natural. The two kids are okay.Wahlberg is the worst. He's a pretty monochromatic actor unless he's paired with his frequent director, Peter Berg, in some action flick where's he's somewhat bearable. Here, he delivers his lines in such a tired, low-energy manner that you can totally believe that he really is just a used car salesman and not a former assassin.Ciarán Hinds is wasted in this movie as the bad guy. I'm pretty sure this was a paycheque movie for him.In the final act, the movie throws a contrived and corny curveball into the plot. The final shootout/battle is competent, but will hardly get your pulse racing.A few chuckles here and there, but you'll never re-visit it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
